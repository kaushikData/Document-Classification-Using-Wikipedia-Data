{{Main article|2009 flu pandemic}}

The United States experienced the beginnings of a [[pandemic]] of a novel strain of the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1#2009 A(H1N1) pandemic|influenza A/H1N1]] virus, commonly referred to as "[[swine flu]]", in the spring of 2009.

On April 28, 2009, the director of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) confirmed the first official US death of swine flu, a 23-month-old toddler from Mexico who died on April 27 while visiting Texas.&lt;ref name="fatality1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2009/04/29/swine-flu-fatality-in-texas-likely-infected-in-mexico-official-says/ |work=CNN |title=Swine flu fatality in Texas likely infected in Mexico, official says |accessdate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503220655/http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2009/04/29/swine-flu-fatality-in-texas-likely-infected-in-mexico-official-says/ |archivedate=May 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By June 24, 132 deaths had been attributed to the virus.
As of January 11, 2010, at least 13,837 deaths were attributed to the virus worldwide, and at least 2290 deaths in the US were confirmed to be due to the virus.  The CDC suspects, however, that the total number of deaths in the US is much higher than the official total, as some deaths probably went unconfirmed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[File:AlabamaH1N1.PNG|thumb|left|Alabama&lt;br /&gt;As of July 21, 2009:&lt;br /&gt;{{legend|#cd3412|Case(s) confirmed}}]]

As of December 5, 2009, the Alabama Department of Public Health reports 2453 confirmed and 36 deaths from swine flu. As of January 9, 2010, Alabama was the only US state reporting widespread A/H1N1 flu activity.

==Alaska==
On May 10, 2009, the Alaska state Division of Public Health reported the state's first probable case of swine flu in a crew member of a Royal Caribbean cruise ship traveling in Alaska waters.&lt;ref name="alaska"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Pemberton |publisher=The Associated Press |url=http://www.adn.com/life/health/story/790532.html |title=Swine flu suspected on Alaska cruise ship: Health |work=adn.com |accessdate=May 19, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513022026/http://www.adn.com/life/health/story/790532.html |archivedate=May 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, they confirmed that the woman had been infected with swine flu but they do not consider it to be Alaska's first case because she became ill before entering state waters.&lt;ref name="alaska" /&gt;

As of December 5, 460 cases of swine flu and 11 deaths were confirmed in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hss.state.ak.us/press/2009/H1N1_pr_061209.pdf Alaska health department report on the new swine flu cases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617184948/http://www.hss.state.ak.us/press/2009/H1N1_pr_061209.pdf |date=June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 27, Alaska health officials confirmed the first H1N1-related death.

==Arizona==
As of October 31, the Arizona Department of Health Services had reported a total of 6,302 confirmed cases of H1N1 infection since April 2009, with at least one case reported in each of the state's 15 counties.  786 of the cases had resulted in hospitalization of the patient, and 81 deaths were associated with H1N1 infection in that period of time.  Of the H1N1 associated deaths reported in the state, 72% suffered an underlying medical condition (asthma, lung or heart conditions, cancer, metabolic disorders, pregnancy, immunosuppressive disorders, neurologic diseases or other chronic diseases) at the time of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/oids/epi/flu/pdf/weeklyflureport.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=Arizona Department of Health Services |title=Weekly Influenza Summary |date=October 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 12, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123202605/http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/oids/epi/flu/pdf/weeklyflureport.pdf |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, the first cases of H1N1 influenza infection in Arizona were confirmed in four school-aged patients in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]].  The schools attended by the patients were immediately closed following recommendations from the CDC; after only 3 days, however, local authorities reopened the schools, stating that the H1N1 flu appeared to be no more deadly than the seasonal flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/05/05/20090505arizflu0505.html|title=Teachers scramble as school closings lifted at 3 schools|last=Fehr-Snyder|first=Kerry|date=May 5, 2009|accessdate=May 20, 2009|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  School closures in the area have since been eliminated in favor of simply sending the infected children home, resulting in slightly elevated absence rates statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/11/02/20091102schoolflu1102.html|title=Valley students with flu symptoms sent home|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=November 12, 2009|publisher=The Arizona Republic|first=Emily|last=Gersema}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first death in the state due to H1N1 swine flu complications was reported by the Maricopa County Department of Public Health on May 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/12news/news/articles/2009/05/14/20090514ariz-swine0514-ON-CP.html|title=Arizona woman dies of swine flu complications|last=Turner|first=Channing|date=May 15, 2009|accessdate=May 18, 2009|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One was a woman from California, the other one was a man from [[Mexico]]. On May 3, another case was found in [[Marshall County, Iowa|Marshall County]] causing schools to close. On the week of February 28, 2009, a three-year-old caught the swine flu due to close contact with ill pigs, but not the same dangerous strain that came from Mexico.

As of July 24, 165 cases have been reported by the CDC.

In Iowa City's [[Iowa City High School]], there were over 400 students absent on Oct. 7 with suspected H1N1. The recent homecoming dance is credited with causing this. The school's 9-day absence limit is also believed to have influenced this, restricting sick students from going home if they have already been absent 9 days. The school has refused to close despite protests from parents, teachers and students alike. On October 9, 32% of all students were absent out of over 1,600. The school has continued to stay open despite advisement by the Johnson County Health Department even as more and more of the student population falls ill. There are serious concerns of students passing along the virus to the community, creating a large local outbreak. As of October 15 the school is still open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press-citizen.com/article/20091007/NEWS01/91007005/1079]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 24, 2009 there were 213 confirmed cases of swine flu in Kansas, 101 in adults and 112 in children. However, in [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte]] and [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson]] counties the state had instructed that only hospitalized patients needed to be tested so the numbers were quite possibly higher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kkob397t?url=http://www.kdheks.gov/H1N1/ Kansas Health Department website, accessed June 16, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  By June 30, 2009 there were 129 confirmed swine flu cases in Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kkob397t?url=http://www.kdheks.gov/H1N1/ Kansas Health Department website, accessed June 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
As of January 9,26 people have died of infection with H1N1, including a healthy 52-year-old man with no underlying health problems that would place him at higher risk for A/H1N1 infection.also, a 6-year-old Kansas boy and 27-year-old Kansas woman, have also died from infection with H1N1, reinforcing the fact that young, healthy people can die from infection with A/H1N1, and that vaccination is recommended even for those without preexisting medical problems.

==Kentucky==
A [[Warren County, Kentucky|Warren County]] woman who had recently visited Mexico tested positive for the virus April 30. After returning to Kentucky from Mexico, she traveled to Georgia where she was hospitalized. Health officials from both states announced this as the first confirmed case in their states, however the CDC listed the case in Kentucky.&lt;ref name="CDC-Confirmed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kyhealth"/&gt;

In Jefferson County, Meyzeek Middle school has three cases of H1N1 influenza. This initially started from a staff member, but spread to students.

Late on April 29, Maine Governor [[John Baldacci]] declared a "civil emergency" and ordered a school and daycare facility in York County to close for seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/newsupdate.php?updates/flu-threat-closes-two-york-county-schools |title=Maine Daily News – Portland Maine News &amp;#124; Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram |publisher=Pressherald.mainetoday.com |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501054310/http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/newsupdate.php?updates%2Fflu-threat-closes-two-york-county-schools |archivedate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 22, there have been 282 cases confirmed throughout Maine. As of November 26, 1562 confirmed cases, 97 hospitalized cases, and 9 deaths have been reported in Maine. Also, 172 schools have reported outbreaks of [[H1N1]] since May, according to Dr. Dora Anne Mills and the Maine CDC. On December 2, 2009, it was announced that H1N1 has killed 2 more Mainers, bringing the death toll to 11. As of December 17, 2009, the Maine CDC states that although 203 Mainers have now been hospitalized and the death toll has risen to 17 in Maine, H1N1 flu activity is decreasing in Maine, and vaccine availability is increasing rapidly, so all Mainers can now get the vaccine. Dr. Dora Anne Mills reminded Mainers that 150 Mainers die every year from regular [[influenza]]. As of December 24, 2009, Maine was one of the only 7 states reporting widespread influenza activity, though Maine's influenza activity was declining as well. As of January 7, 2010, H1N1 activity has decreased from widespread to regional for the first time since October 17, 2009. Although H1N1 activity in Maine has declined for the time being, H1N1 continues to circulate in Maine. H1N1 could return later this year, so it is still very important to get vaccinated against A/H1N1 influenza, Dr. Dora Anne Mills says. So far, 18 deaths, 225 hospitalizations, and 2220 cases have been confirmed.

As of January 14, the CDC states just 3 more patients required hospital care due to H1N1 disease, no new deaths occurred, and only 6 new cases were confirmed. However, one outbreak in a long term care facility was confirmed. As of January 28, H1N1 activity has decreased significantly, with the CDC classifying current influenza activity as sporadic. No new cases of A/H1N1 influenza were confirmed between January 21 and January 28.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/boh/maineflu/ Influenza: Maine CDC – Maine DHHS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of February 4, the Maine CDC reports that influenza activity has increased enough for the state to be again classified as having regional influenza activity, and that one person had died of confirmed A/H1N1 infection over the previous week, bringing the number of confirmed deaths from A/H1N1 to 19 in the state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=91047&amp;an=1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcohol flush reaction''' is a condition in which a person develops flushes or blotches associated with [[erythema]] on the face, neck, shoulders, and in some cases, the entire body after consuming [[alcoholic beverages]]. The reaction is the result of an accumulation of [[acetaldehyde]], a metabolic byproduct of the [[catabolic]] metabolism of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and is caused by an [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] deficiency.&lt;ref name="J. Yoo 2014 132"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Handbook of Asian American Health |last=  J.

This syndrome has been associated with an increased risk of [[esophageal cancer]] in those who drink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/news/health/mar2009/niaaa-23.htm Alcohol Flush Signals Increased Cancer Risk among East Asians] March 23, 2009 News Release - [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH)&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been associated with lower than average rates of alcoholism, possibly due to its association with adverse effects after drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name="Yi Peng, Hong Shi, Xue-bin Qi, Chun-jie Xiao, Hua Zhong, Run-lin Z Ma, Bing Su 2010 15"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yi Peng |author2=Hong Shi |author3=Xue-bin Qi |author4=Chun-jie Xiao |author5=Hua Zhong |author6=Run-lin Z Ma |author7=Bing Su |title=The ADH1B Arg47His polymorphism in East Asian populations and expansion of rice domestication in history |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=10 |page= 15|year=2010 |pmid=20089146 |pmc=2823730 |doi= 10.1186/1471-2148-10-15|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 36% of [[East Asian people|East Asian]]s (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans) show characteristic physiological responses to drinking alcohol that includes facial flushing, [[nausea]], headaches and a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]].&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lee, Haeok |author2= Kim, Sun S.|author3=You, Kwang Soo |author4=Park, Wanju |author5=Hua Zhong |author6=Yang, Jin Hyang |author7=Kim, Minjin |title=Asian Flushing: Genetic and Sociocultural Factors of Alcoholism Among East Asians|volume=37 |pages= 327–336|year=2014 |issue = 5|url=https://journals.lww.com/gastroenterologynursing/Abstract/2014/09000/Asian_Flushing__Genetic_and_Sociocultural_Factors.3.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PLOS2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:AsianFlushBack.JPG|thumb|The back of an Asian man showing alcohol flush reaction.]]
Individuals who experience the alcohol flushing reaction may be less prone to [[alcoholism]]. [[Disulfiram]], a drug sometimes given as treatment for alcoholism, works by inhibiting [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], causing a five to tenfold increase in the concentration of acetaldehyde in the body. The resulting irritating flushing reaction tends to discourage affected individuals from drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682602.html |title=Disulfiram |work=MedlinePlus Drug Information |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|emerg|151|Toxicity, Disulfiram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For measuring the level of flush reaction to alcohol, the most accurate method is to determine the level of acetaldehyde in the blood stream. This can be measured through both a breathalyzer test or a blood test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.criticalimprov.com/index.php/surg/article/viewArticle/982/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221234833/http://www.criticalimprov.com/index.php/surg/article/viewArticle/982/ |archive-date=2014-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, measuring the amount of alcohol metabolizing enzymes [[alcohol dehydrogenases]] and [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] through genetic testing can predict the amount of reaction that one would have. More crude measurements can be made through measuring the amount of redness in the face of an individual after consuming alcohol. Computer and phone applications can be used to standardize this measurement.

Other effects include "nausea, headache and general physical discomfort".&lt;ref&gt;http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/fall-2009/esophageal-cancer-and-the-‘asian-glow’&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cases of [[alcohol-induced respiratory reactions]], which involve [[rhinitis]] and worsening of [[asthma]], develop within 1–60 minutes of drinking alcohol and are due to the same causes as flush reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=KE|last2=Rans|first2=TS|title=Adverse reactions to alcohol and alcoholic beverages.|journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology|date=December 2013|volume=111|issue=6|pages=439–45|doi=10.1016/j.anai.2013.09.016|pmid=24267355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{alcohol metabolism formulae}}

Around 80% of [[East Asian people|East Asian]]s (less common in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent) have a variant of the gene coding for the enzyme [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] called ''[[ADH1B]]'', whereas almost all Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people have a variant of the gene called ''[[ADH1C]]'',&lt;ref name="Eng et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eng|first1=MY|last2=Luczak|first2=SE|last3=Wall|first3=TL|title=ALDH2, ADH1B, and ADH1C genotypes in Asians: a literature review.|journal=Alcohol research &amp; health : the journal of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|date=2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=22–7|pmid=17718397|pmc=3860439}}&lt;/ref&gt; both resulting in an alcohol dehydrogenase [[enzyme]] that converts alcohol to toxic [[acetaldehyde]] at a much higher efficiency than other gene variants (40- to 100-fold in case of ADH1B).&lt;ref name="Yi Peng, Hong Shi, Xue-bin Qi, Chun-jie Xiao, Hua Zhong, Run-lin Z Ma, Bing Su 2010 15"/&gt;

In about 50% of East Asians, the increased acetaldehyde accumulation is worsened by another gene variant, the [[mitochondria]]l ALDH2 allele, which results in a less functional [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] enzyme, responsible for the breakdown of acetaldehyde.&lt;ref name="Eng et al."/&gt; The result is that affected people may be better at metabolizing alcohol, often not feeling the alcohol "buzz" to the same extent as others, but show far more acetaldehyde-based side effects while drinking alcohol.

===Genetics===
[[File:ALDH2_rs671_genotype_frequency.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Genotype frequency distribution of ALDH2 (rs671).]]
Alcohol flush reaction is best known as a condition that is experienced by people of East Asian descent. According to the analysis by [[HapMap]] project, the rs671 allele of the ''[[ALDH2]]'' responsible for the flush reaction is rare among Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans. 30% to 50% of people of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ancestry have at least one ''ALDH2'' allele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs671|title=Rs671}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rs671 form of ALDH2, which accounts for most incidents of alcohol flush reaction worldwide, is native to [[East Asia]] and most common in southeastern China. It most likely originated among [[Han Chinese]] in central China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Refined Geographic Distribution of the Oriental ALDH2*504Lys (nee 487Lys) Variant|author =Hui Li|journal=Ann Hum Genet|year=2009|pmc=2846302|pmid=19456322|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2009.00517.x|volume=73|issue=Pt 3|pages=335–45|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another analysis correlates the rise and spread of rice cultivation in Southern China with the spread of the allele.&lt;ref name="Yi Peng, Hong Shi, Xue-bin Qi, Chun-jie Xiao, Hua Zhong, Run-lin Z Ma, Bing Su 2010 15"/&gt; The reasons for this positive selection aren't known, but it's been hypothesized that elevated concentrations of acetaldehyde may have conferred protection against certain parasitic infections, such as ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Oota|title=The evolution and population genetics of the ALDH2 locus: random genetic drift, selection, and low levels of recombination|year=2004|journal=[[Annals of Human Genetics]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Those with facial flushing due to ALDH2 deficiency may be [[homozygote]]s, with two alleles of low activity, or [[heterozygote]]s, with one low-activity and one normal allele.  Homozygotes for the trait find consumption of large amounts of alcohol to be so unpleasant that they are generally protected from [[esophageal cancer]], but heterozygotes are able to continue drinking. However, an ALDH2-deficient drinker who drinks two beers per day has six to ten times the risk of developing [[esophageal cancer]] as a drinker not deficient in the enzyme.&lt;ref name="PLOS2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brooks PJ, ((Enoch M-A)), Goldman D, ((Li T-K)), Yokoyama A |title=The Alcohol Flushing Response: An Unrecognized Risk Factor for Esophageal Cancer from Alcohol Consumption |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=6 |issue=3 |year=2009|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000050 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000050|pmid=19320537 |pmc=2659709 |pages=e50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/health/24blush.html?ref=scienceDrinkers’ Red Face May Signal Cancer Risk ], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that acetaldehyde is the cause of the flush is also shown by the clinical use of [[disulfiram]] (Antabuse), which blocks the removal of acetaldehyde from the body via ALDH inhibition. The high acetaldehyde concentrations described share similarity to symptoms of the flush (flushing of the skin, accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, throbbing headache, mental confusion and blurred vision).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wright C, Moore RD | year = 1990 | title = Disulfiram treatment of alcoholism | url = | journal = Am.

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=November 2017}}

==Treatment==
Since the mutation is a genetic issue, there is currently no cure for the flush reaction. Clinicians and the East Asian public generally know about the alcohol flushing response.&lt;ref name="PLOS2009"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2017}} Prevention would include not drinking alcohol.

*[[Rosacea]], also known as gin blossoms, is  a chronic facial skin condition in which capillaries are excessively reactive, leading to redness from flushing or telangiectasia.

He grew up in a family of doctors – his mother was a gynaecologist who later became a GP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: patient access pioneer Dr Amir Hannan|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/home/innovation-and-efficiency/innovation-network/qa-patient-access-pioneer-dr-amir-hannan/5065505.article#.VTzNdIq4_eM|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannan is a board member of the  Tameside and Glossop [[Clinical Commissioning Group]].

==General practice==
He took over Haughton Thornley Medical Centres in [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] which was formerly run by Dr [[Harold Shipman]] when he started his career. The practice has a large Bengali population. It is a very deprived neighbourhood. He saw opening records to patients as a way of rebuilding trust in a difficult situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Increasing access to patient records|url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/increasing-access-to-patient-records/5062710.article|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=[[Nursing Times]]|date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He  told the BBC: "The week before I started there was a sit-down protest in the waiting room, because the patients were not happy about this doctor that was being foisted on them. That gives you some idea of the battlefield I was walking into."  150 patients at the practice were given access to their medical records and test results over the internet in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Web records prove hit with patients|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6323587.stm|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=5 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prof [[Steve Field (medical doctor)|Steve Field]] of the [[Care Quality Commission]] recounted: “It was very difficult to recruit to Shipman’s practice because of [the lack of] trust locally. But Amir said, ‘Right from the start I will share everything with my patients, and gave them access to all their own records. He’s got examples of patients being admitted to hospital where they have had to show the consultants their record which may have saved their lives. It’s policy to try and make it happen. But it’s not moving quickly enough.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Failure to join up medical records is a 'health risk’, says GP chief inspector|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/failure-to-join-up-medical-records-is-a-health-risk-says-gp-chief-inspector-9707356.html|accessdate=30 November 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015|May}}, 34% of the patient population were accessing to their GP record. There was no difference between the proportion of Bengali patients doing so and the rest of the practice population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rising Stars: Inspiring campaign promises self care|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/supplements/rising-stars-inspiring-campaign-promises-self-care/5084979.article#.VX1bxba_UYA|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Record access==

He was one of the first GPs pioneering [[Patient record access]] using [[Egton Medical Information Systems|EMIS]] software.  He says "there are some doctors and nurses who have genuine concerns about patients suddenly being let loose to access their records without any controls in place or without clinicians having to do anything and a feeling of irresponsibility that that raises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hannan|first1=Amir|title=BACK TO SCHOOL FOR DOCTORS, NURSES AND PATIENTS|url=http://www.htmc.co.uk/displayarticle.asp?a=5&amp;c=3|website=Amir Hannan's Blog|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacqui Gladwin, a nursing lecturer who is one of his patients, was worried about online access.  She asked:"What happens if patients see information that is incorrect? How safe is the system? What happens if they see something distressing when the surgery is closed?"  She was surprised to find that other patients in the practice did not share her worries. At a meeting at the practice to discuss the development of records access, several patients had found errors in their records. They were positive about being able to identify errors and the response they had received when they reported them. They felt trusted to own the information, and secure when travelling abroad that they could allow other health professionals to access their medical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Increasing access to patient records|url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/increasing-access-to-patient-records/5062710.article |first=Jacqui |last=Gladwin|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=Nursing Times|date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He speaks regularly about the benefits of giving patients access to their full GP electronic health records, and about how this works at his practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Realising the potential of primary care|url=http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/events/realising-potential-primary-care|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=Kings Fund|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 2008 he authored the Patient Access to Medical Records pattern&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patient Access to Medical Records|url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/content/patient-access-medical-records|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=1 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Liberating Voices [[pattern language]].

Research in which Hannan participated showed that practices who give at least a third of their patients full online access to their records could experience a decrease in appointment demand of up to 12%.  Dr Brian Fisher, one of the other participants in the study conceded that as the practices concerned were leaders in their field with regard to offering online access to medical records, it could be difficult to extrapolate the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Giving patients online records access 'cuts appointment demand by 12%'|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/practice-topics/it/giving-patients-online-records-access-cuts-appointment-demand-by-12/20002460.article#.VTzF94q4_eM|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=[[Pulse (magazine)|Pulse]] |date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has defended the government's [[Summary Care Record]] project, which has been criticised by other GPs on the grounds of cost. Each time an SCR was accessed for a patient in 2012 it cost £1,200.  He says "The SCR isn’t a panacea, it’s just one solution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Pull the plug' on Summary Care Records, says GPC IT lead|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/pull-the-plug-on-summary-care-records-says-gpc-it-lead/20001851.article#.VTzHDIq4_eM|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=Pulse|date=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was, however, critical of the [[Health and Social Care Information Centre|care.data]] fiasco, saying "If patients felt that their data was leaking out, and I had not warned them about it, then that would destroy my relationship with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr Amir Hannan: 'This goes to the very heart of the doctor-patient relationship'|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/practice-topics/it/dr-amir-hannan-this-goes-to-the-very-heart-of-the-doctor-patient-relationship/20005677.article#.VTzMXoq4_eM|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=Pulse|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was ranked in the [[Health Service Journal]]'s list of Clinical Leaders in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HSJ Clinical Leaders 2015|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/leadership/top-leaders/clinical-leaders/hsj-clinical-leaders-2015/5087348.article#.Vd9s_JZIgYA|accessdate=27 August 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mary Starke Harper Geriatric Psychiatry Hospital, a separate facility on the same campus, provides an additional 100 beds for inpatient geriatric care.  The main facility was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==History==
The plans for a state hospital for the mentally ill in Alabama began in 1852. The new facility was planned from the start to utilize the "moral architecture" concepts of 1830s activists [[Thomas Story Kirkbride]] and [[Dorothea Dix]]. Dix's reformist ideas, in particular, are credited as the driving force behind the construction of the hospital. Architect [[Samuel Sloan (architect)|Samuel Sloan]] designed the Italianate building using the [[Kirkbride Plan]]. Construction of the building began in 1853 but was not completed until 1859. The hospital was the first building in Tuscaloosa with gas lighting and central heat,&lt;ref name="EOA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bryce Hospital (Alabama Insane Hospital) | url=http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1564 | last=Weaver |first=Bill | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Alabama | date=June 5, 2008 | accessdate=March 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "all clad in a fashionable Italianate exterior."&lt;ref name="bridging"/&gt;

The Alabama Insane Hospital opened in 1861.  It was later renamed for its first superintendent, Peter Bryce, who had first begun as a 27-year-old [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] pioneer from [[South Carolina]]. Bryce had been brought to the attention of the hospital trustees by Dix. He had studied mental-health care in Europe and worked in psychiatric hospitals in [[New Jersey]], as well as his native state of South Carolina.&lt;ref name="EOA"/&gt;  His tenure was marked by absolute discipline among the staff of the hospital. He demanded that patients be given courtesy, kindness and respect at all times. The use of shackles, [[straitjacket]]s and other restraints was discouraged, and finally abandoned altogether in 1882. Various work programs and other activities were encouraged, including farming, sewing, maintenance and crafts. Between 1872 and the early 1880s, some of the patients wrote and edited their own newspaper, called ''[[The Meteor]]''. These writings provide a rare inside look at life in a progressive mental institution in the late 19th century. At that time, Bryce's management and commitment to "scientific treatments" was recognized around the country as being in a class of its own.

==Decline==
During the 20th century, the patient population expanded while standards of care fell to abysmal levels. Alabama Governor [[Lurleen Wallace]] viewed the facility in February 1967, and was moved to tears after an overweight, mentally challenged nine-year-old attempted to hug her, crying, "Mama! Mama!" She lobbied her husband, [[George Wallace]] (who held the actual power of her governorship) for more funds for the institution.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{Cite book

In 1970, Alabama ranked last among [[U.S. state]]s in funding for mental health. Bryce Hospital at that time had 5,200 patients living in conditions that a ''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]'' editor likened to a [[concentration camp]]. That same year, a [[cigarette]] tax earmarked for mental-health treatment was cut. One hundred Bryce employees were laid off, including twenty professional staff. Members of the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Alabama]] attempted to file suit on behalf of the laid-off workers, but Federal Judge [[Frank Minis Johnson|Frank M. Johnson]] ruled that the courts had no standing to intervene on behalf of fired employees. He left open, however, the possibility of a suit filed on behalf of patients, whose quality of care was affected.

==''Wyatt v. Stickney''==

In October 1970, Ricky Wyatt, a fifteen-year-old who had always been labeled a "juvenile delinquent" and housed at Bryce despite not being indicated with a mental illness, became the named plaintiff in a [[class-action]] lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Wyatt"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2375 | title=Encyclopedia of Alabama | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aunt, W. C. Rawlins, was one of the employees who had been laid off. Together they testified about intolerable conditions and improper treatments designed only to make the patients more manageable. In 1971 the plaintiff class was expanded to include patients at Alabama's two other inpatient mental health facilities, [[Searcy Hospital]] ([[Mount Vernon, Alabama|Mt. Vernon]]) and Camp Partlow ([[Coker, Alabama|Coker]]). The resulting court-ordered agreements formed the basis for federal minimum standards for the care of people with mental illness or mental retardations who reside in institutional settings. In 1999 a new [[settlement agreement]] was made, recognizing a great deal of progress. The case was finally dismissed on December 5, 2003, with the finding by Judge [[Myron Thompson]] that Alabama was in compliance with the agreement.

The standards elaborated in that agreement have served as a model nationwide.  Known as the "Wyatt Standards," they are founded on four criteria for evaluation of care:
* Humane psychological and physical environment
* Qualified and sufficient staff for administration of treatment
* Individualized treatment plans
* Minimum restriction of patient freedom.

The case of ''Wyatt v. Stickney'' came to a conclusion after 33 years, through the tenure of nine Alabama governors and fourteen state mental health commissioners, the longest mental health case in national history. The State of Alabama estimates its litigation expenses at over $15 million.&lt;ref name="Wyatt"/&gt;

==Future of Bryce Hospital==

Gov. [[Bob Riley]] announced on December 30, 2009 that Bryce Hospital was to relocate into a newly constructed facility across McFarland Boulevard in Tuscaloosa, and the [[University of Alabama]] would take over the current Bryce campus.  For several years the university had sought the {{convert|180|acre|sing=on}} parcel of land, which is adjacent to its landlocked campus.&lt;ref name="tuscnews1"&gt;Bryce Hospital to remain in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20091230/NEWS/912309997/1007?p=1&amp;tc=pg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Riley said that a hospital for about 268 patients had been envisioned but the final size was yet to be determined. The deal, approved by Gov. Bob Riley and the [[Alabama Department of Mental Health]] on December 30, 2009 was worth $72 million in cash for Mental Health to build a replacement hospital. The university will pay $50 million in cash and Mental Health will get another $22 million in state bond money. The university pledged another $10 million to clean up environmental problems on the Bryce grounds and restore the main hospital building, construction of which started in 1853.&lt;ref name="tuscnews1"/&gt;

The sale of Bryce Hospital and Harper Center to UA was finalized on May 27, 2010 at a price of $87.75 million. $77 million would go to installments plus the aforementioned $10 million for ground improvements.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/05/88_million_sale_of_bryce_hospi.html November 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2014, the remaining patients were moved to a new facility and UA began a restoration project estimated at $40 million. Dan Wolfe, University of Alabama planner, revealed the two buildings will house a welcome center, 
two museums focusing on mental health and the history of the university, event space and classrooms for performing arts students. The project is expected to be complete by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2016/06/inside_the_spooky_skeleton_of.html November 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Acueducto_de_Chapultepec,_parte_posterior.jpg|thumb|250x250px|View of remaining arches of the Spanish built Chapultepec Aqueduct]]
The '''Chapultepec aqueduct''' (in Spanish: acueducto de Chapultepec) was built to provide potable water to [[Tenochtitlan]], now known as [[Mexico City]]. This fresh water was transported from the Chapultepec springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The remarkable hydrological works of the Aztec civilization|last=Villasenor|first=Raynal|publisher=Water for the Future:Hydrology in Perspective Proceedings of Rome Symposium IAHS|year=April 1987|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two aqueducts following the same route from the springs were built by the [[Aztec]]s during the 15th century, the first destroyed by flooding and the second by the Spanish. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] a colonial aqueduct was built, the remains of which are located near [[Metro Sevilla]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moon Mexico City|last=Humphrey|first=Chris|publisher=Avalon Travel|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59880-083-8|location=|pages=Page 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original Chapultepec aqueduct==
The water level under Tenochtitlan was only 4–5 feet below the city, however, it was not a viable source of freshwater as the water retrieved was brackish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519-1810|last=Gibbons|first=Charles|publisher=Standford University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shallow wells were constructed, and the water retrieved was used for household work. Construction of an aqueduct that brought fresh water, suitable for cooking and drinking, from Chapultepec springs to Tenochtitlan began in 1418.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aztec Archaeology and Ethnohistory|last=Berdan|first=Frances|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building relied on mud and plant material to create the foundation, which rested on artificial islands that were spread 3 to 4 meters apart.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Mounds consisting of mud were constructed on these islands and driven through with a wooden stake for support. The top of each mound had a hollowed out trough lined with compacted clay, and hollowed out logs were placed in the bottom of the flow path to bridge gaps between the islands. A wooden plank walkway flanked the aqueduct, making it easily accessible and a method of transportation from the city to the outlying areas.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscapes, Identities, and Development|last=Roca|first=Zoran|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the water reached the city, it was delivered to small reservoirs and select households through a network of canals that extended in the four cardinal directions and branched off to individual streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook to Life in the Aztec World|last=Aguilar-Moreno|first=Manuel|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=October 3, 2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its relative longevity, the composition of the aqueduct could not withstand the forces of nature.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Erosion weathered away the compacted clay, and in 1449, heavy rains triggered a flood that destroyed the aqueduct and effectively shut down Tenochtitlan for weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mexico To-day and To-morrow|last=Trowbridge|first=Edward D.|publisher=Macmillan|year=1919|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Chapultepec aqueduct==
After the destruction of the original aqueduct, the engineer, [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], lead the construction of another water system using sturdier materials following the same route as the original.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Return to the Center: Culture, Public Space, and City Building in a Global Era|last=Herzog|first=Lawrence Arthur|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-292-71262-1|location=|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aqueduct consisted of two mortar lined troughs made of stone masonry. The addition of the second trough allowed for water to be diverted to the second pipe when maintenance had to be performed on the other. This allowed for a continuous supply of fresh water to be delivered to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becerril, Jiménez|first=|date=March 2007|title=Potable water and sanitation in Tenochtitlan: Aztec culture|url=http://ws.iwaponline.com/content/7/1/147|journal=Water Science and Technology|volume=7|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the original aqueduct, the second rested on a chain of artificial islands. The pipes were secured to the islands by wood pilings attached to a foundation of sand, lime, and rock.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The aqueduct was constructed using wood, carved stone, and compacted soil, with portions made of hollowed logs, allowing canoes to travel underneath.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/28/aztec-empire-strategy-use-dual-pipes-in-your-aqueduct-for-hi.html|title=Aztec Empire Strategy: Use Dual Pipes in Your Aqueduct for High Availability - High Scalability -|website=highscalability.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial aqueduct==
[[File:FUENTE DE SALTO DEL AGUA.jpg|thumb|Replica of the Salto del Agua Fountain.]]After his arrival in the Aztec empire, [[Hernán Cortés|Hernan Cortes]] discovered the economic and political importance of the Chapultepec aqueduct. He took advantage of the city's dependence on the aqueduct and blocked the fresh water supply, eventually destroying it. Shortly after the Spanish conquest, he set about dividing the land among the conquistadors. He wanted to take the forest of Chapultepec for himself, but [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V, King of Spain]], denied his request and decreed that the springs were needed to provide the people with potable water and were thereby the property of the city of Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Construction of a new aqueduct started under the reigning Viceroy [[Fernando de Alencastre, 1st Duke of Linares|Fernando de Alencastre]], 1st Duke of Linares (1711-1716). The structure became known under another name as the Aqueduct of Belen, named after an old Belen convent it passed by.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Here and There in Mexico: The Travel Writings of Mary Ashley Townsend|last=Townsend|first=Mary Ashley|publisher=The University of Alabama Press|year=2001|isbn=9780817358266|location=|pages=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built along the same path as the Aztec engineered aqueducts, it was constructed using Roman architecture, reflected in its 904 arches. In completion, it reached a total length of 4663 [[Spanish customary units#Vara .28unit of length.29|varas]], roughly 4 kilometers. In conquest times, the aqueduct supplied the city with the majority of its freshwater, however, waterborne illness was a concern. In an effort to reduce the possibility of external contamination, iron and lead pipes were installed to replace the open troughs during the 19th Century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These shielded the water from air and outside contaminants but did not decrease the number of pathogen related illnesses and death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contributions to the Bacteriological Study of the Drinking Waters of the City of Mexico: Springs Bacteriological Analysis of the Waters of Chapultepec|last=Bell|first=Agrippa|publisher=The Sanitarian|year=|isbn=|location=Volume 31|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located on Chapultepec Avenue near Metro Sevilla, a small section, about twenty-two arches long, still survives today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also standing today are two fountains associated with the aqueduct. The first is found wedged between [[Chapultepec|Chapultepec Park]] and [[Metro Chapultepec]]. Constructed by the viceroy [[Agustín de Ahumada]], this fountain was designed to divert a water to this section of the city. It also served a decorative and historical purpose. However, it is no longer in its original location: it was restored, enlarged and moved to its current location by Roberto Alvarez Espinoza in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catalogo de Monumentos Escultoricos y Conmemorativos del Distrito Federal|last=Prado Nuñez|first=Ricardo|publisher=|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second fountain, Salto del Agua, was built at the intersection of [[Eje Central]] and Arcos de Belen Street, where the historic center meets [[Colonia Doctores]] and [[Colonia Obrera]]. While it is at the original location, it is not the original fountain. It had deteriorated badly, and a reproduction was made by Guillermo Ruiz. The remains of the original are on display at the [[Museo Nacional del Virreinato]] in [[Tepotzotlán]].

'''The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths''' ('''CEMD''') is a national programme investigating [[maternal death]]s in the UK and Ireland. Since June 2012, the CEMD has been carried out by the MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries) collaboration, commissioned by the [[Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership|Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP).]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.hqip.org.uk/hqip-appoint-mbrrace-uk-to-conduct-national-maternal-newborn-and-infant-clinical-outcome-review-programme |title=MBRRACE-UK appointed to conduct MNI-CORP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessor to MBRRACE-UK, CMACE (Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries) produced a report every triennium, analysing all maternal deaths from the previous three years divided into topic-specific chapters. Reports are now published on an annual basis, with each report focusing on a selection of chapters. Furthermore, each MBRRACE-UK report now contains the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Morbidity (CEMM), a study focusing on women who survived severe pregnancy problems, with the topic chosen in an open application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/topic-proposals|title=MBRRACE-UK topic proposal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 CEMM topic was maternal sepsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.12802/pdf |title= Maternal near-miss case reviews: the UK approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent report by the CEMD (and the first by MBRRACE-UK) was published in December 2014, and focused on deaths from [[Amniotic fluid embolism|AFE]], [[sepsis]], [[haemorrhage]], deaths from [[Neurology|neurological complications]], and deaths from other medical and surgical complications between 2009 and 2012. During the time that the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths has existed, there has been a fall in overall maternal deaths in the UK, with rates having fallen from 90 per 100,000 women giving birth in 1952&lt;ref&gt;Report on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in England and Wales 1952-1954, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; to around 10 per 100,000 at present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/downloads/files/mbrrace-uk/reports/Saving%20Lives%20Improving%20Mothers%20Care%20report%202014%20Lay%20Summary.pdf|title=MBRRACE-UK 2014 Report Lay summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maternal deaths==
{{main|Maternal death}}
According to the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group, which consists of representatives from the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), [[United Nations Population Division]], [[the World Bank]] and world-renowned academics, '''maternal death is''':

"The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.maternalmortalitydata.org/Definitions.html |title= Maternal mortality data definitions |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014105625/http://maternalmortalitydata.org/Definitions.html |archivedate= 14 October 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a late maternal death is one which occurs more than six weeks but less than one year after the end of pregnancy. Maternal deaths can be further divided by cause, typically into: direct deaths, resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (e.g. [[amniotic fluid embolism]], [[pre-eclampsia]]); indirect deaths, resulting from medical or medical health conditions exacerbated by pregnancy (e.g.  [[cardiac disease]]) or coincidental deaths, where the cause is unrelated to pregnancy (e.g. [[Road traffic accident|RTA]], [[homicide]]).

The CEMD reports on all maternal deaths in the UK and Ireland, including those that are late and/or coincidental.

==History of the CEMD==
The current system of confidential enquiries began in 1952, however, the history of smaller, local enquiries dates back to 1917 in [[Aberdeen]], with national enquiries across England, Scotland and Wales following in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="CEMD9799"&gt;Why Mothers Die  - CEMD in the United Kingdom 1997 – 1999, appendix 3&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal deaths during this period were particularly prevalent in poor, working-class families, thus a large part of these early local enquiries was focused on the social backgrounds of the women who died. Further emphasis was placed on educating women and their families on the importance of maternity care as well as an understanding of the warning signs of complications and the importance of seeking help.&lt;ref name="CEMD9799"/&gt;

Due to the large number of births taking place in [[home birth|non-clinical settings]], avoidable clinical factors were not the only consideration. There was an emphasis on the need for health care workers to improve hygiene standards and ensure training in the use of forceps, and to ensure deliveries requiring other forms of intervention were undertaken in hospital. These local enquiries, along with various medical advances (notably the introduction of antibiotics) were credited with a sharp decline in maternal deaths in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in England and Wales 1982-84, Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the [[Ministry of Health]] instituted the national confidential enquiry for both England and Wales, initially to reports its findings on a three-yearly basis, and since 2014 on a yearly basis. Since its inception, the overall aims of the enquiry have been:&lt;ref&gt;Saving Mothers’ Lives: Reviewing maternal deaths to make motherhood safer: 2006–2008, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

* To save more women’s and newborns’ lives, to reduce complications, and to improve the quality of maternity services for the benefit of all pregnant women, their infants, and their families. 
*Through the use of guidelines and recommendations, to help ensure that all pregnant and recently delivered women receive the best possible care, delivered in appropriate settings in a way that takes account of, and meets, their individual needs.

In Northern Ireland, a similar report to the CEMD was published from 1956–84, initially covering four years of maternal deaths at a time. However, due to falling maternal death rates in the country, the final reports covered a larger period of time. The final report covering years 1978-84 covered just 32 deaths.&lt;ref name="CEMD9799"/&gt; Currently, the agency NIMACH (Northern Ireland Maternal and Child Health) is responsible for collecting and analysing data in support of MBRRACE-UK.

Scotland also conducted a series of confidential enquiries, with the first dealing with maternal deaths from 1965-71.&lt;ref name="CEMD9799"/&gt;

For maternal deaths from 1985 onwards, a single report has been published for the whole of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="CEMD9799"/&gt; Since 2009, maternal deaths from the [[Republic of Ireland]] have also been included in the CEMD, with the agency MDE Ireland responsible for all data collection for maternal deaths from the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.ucc.ie/en/mde/about/|title=About MDE Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the first CEMD report was published in 1952, maternal deaths have fallen from 90 per 100,000 women giving birth in 1952 to around 10 per 100,000 at present.  It is regarded as the ‘gold standard’ for Confidential Enquiries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/rcog-statement-on-appointment-of-mbrrace-uk-to-conduct-national-maternal-newborn-and-infant-clinical-outcomes-programme/|title=RCOG statement on appointment of MBRRACE-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confidential enquiry process==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MBRRACE-UK Data Collection Process.jpg|thumb|right|Flow chart demonstrating how MBRRACE-UK data is collected and reviews]] --&gt;

A confidential enquiry is an enquiry designed to improve health and health care by collecting data, identifying any shortfalls in the care provided and devising recommendations to improve future care. They are confidential in the sense that the details of the patient/hospital/involved clinicians remain anonymous to those conducting the enquiry.

The CEMD collects and processes anonymous data of every maternal death in the UK and Ireland before they are looked at by several of the MBRRACE-UK expert assessors. MBRRACE-UK has approximately 100 assessors from different specialty groups including [[obstetrics]], [[anaesthesia]], [[intensive care]], [[midwifery]], [[pathology]], [[psychiatry]], [[general practice]], [[emergency medicine]], [[obstetric medicine]], [[neurology]], [[Infectious disease (medical specialty)|infectious diseases]] and [[cardiology]]. Each maternal death case is typically looked at by between ten and fifteen expert reviewers. All of the assessors for the CEMD are volunteers who are not remunerated for their work.&lt;ref name="SLIMC"&gt;SAVING LIVES, IMPROVING MOTHERS' CARE - Lessons learned to inform future maternity, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Once all data has been collected and each case has undergone review, multi-disciplinary chapter writing groups are convened, where the expert reviews of each case are examined to enable key learning themes to be drawn out for the final report. The lead member of each chapter writing group will then draft the initial chapter, which is then reviewed by the other group members and the Programme Lead before a final version is completed. Where possible, any recommendations by the CEMD are linked to national guidance from organisations such as [[NICE]] or [[Healthcare Improvement Scotland#Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network|SIGN.]]&lt;ref name="EXECSUM"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/downloads/files/mbrrace-uk/reports/Saving%20Lives%20Improving%20Mothers%20Care%20report%202014%20Exec%20Summary.pdf|title=SAVING LIVES, IMPROVING MOTHERS’ CARE Executive Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key findings ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MBRRACE-UK 2014 Lay Report Infogaphic.jpg|thumb|right|MBRRACE-UK infographic showing key lessons learned]]  --&gt;
The latest CEMD was published in 2014 and focused on surveillance of all maternal deaths from the period 2009-12 and confidential enquiries where the cause of death was from [[haemorrhage]], [[amniotic fluid embolism]], anaesthetic-related causes, neurological and other indirect causes. A further sample of survivors of [[septic shock]] were also subject to Confidential Enquiry.&lt;ref name="SLIMC"/&gt;

Between 2009 and 2012, 357 women died in the UK and Ireland during pregnancy or within six weeks of the end of their pregnancy. 106 of these were considered to be direct maternal deaths, representing a statistically significant decrease.&lt;ref name="EXECSUM"/&gt; The number of deaths from indirect causes increased however, with 215 women dying over the four-year period. The remaining 36 deaths were classified as coincidental. It was commented in news articles, as well as in the report itself that a significant number of late maternal deaths were attributable to psychiatric causes.&lt;ref name="SLIMC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/09/better-care-urged-pregnant-women-mental-health-problems-study |title=(The Guardian) Better care urged for pregnant women with mental health problems – study}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=  http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/12December/Pages/Significant-reduction-in-maternal-death-rates.aspx|title=(NHS) Around 1 in 10 maternal deaths due to flu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the overall fall, the researchers claimed there are ‘key areas that the health service can look to improve in order to reduce the number of maternal deaths from these indirect causes’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=  http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2014-12-09-uk-sees-fall-maternal-deaths |title=  UK sees a fall in maternal deaths}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report urged clinicians to ‘Think Sepsis’ after almost a quarter of maternal deaths were from sepsis. More specifically, the advice was for staff to take all appropriate observations and act on them when presented with an unwell pregnant (or recently pregnant) woman. Furthermore, rapid administration of intravenous antibiotics and escalating the care of the woman to senior doctors and midwives quickly were considered essential.&lt;ref name="EXECSUM"/&gt;

Another key recommendation of the report was to encourage clinicians to promote the [[flu vaccine]] to all pregnant women, with [[flu]] one of the leading causes of preventable death in pregnancy (1 in 11 of the women who died). It was reported that less than half of pregnant women eligible for a free flu vaccine had taken it up. The MBRRACE-UK report notes that of the maternal deaths caused by Flu, more than half could have been prevented had the woman received a [[Influenza vaccine|flu jab]].&lt;ref name="EXECSUM"/&gt;

In addition to the full report, MBRRACE-UK publishes an executive summary listing separate key areas for action for policy-makers, medical directors, doctors and midwives.

The executive summary, lay report and full MBRRACE-UK report is published online and available publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports |title=MBRRACE-UK reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''contact lens''', or simply '''contacts''', is a thin [[lens (optics)|lens]] placed directly on the surface of the [[eye]]. Contact lenses are considered medical devices and can be worn to [[corrective lens|correct vision]], or for [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] or therapeutic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=NM Farandos |author2=AK Yetisen |author3=MJ Monteiro |author4=CR Lowe |author5=SH Yun |title=Contact Lens Sensors in Ocular Diagnostics |journal= Advanced Healthcare Materials |year=2014 |doi= 10.1002/adhm.201400504 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.201400504/abstract |pmid=25400274 |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=792–810}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, it was estimated that 125 million people worldwide use contact lenses, including 28 to 38 million in the United States.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, J. [http://www.clspectrum.com/article.aspx?article=12733 "2004 Annual Report"]. ''Contact Lens Spectrum''. January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the worldwide market for contact lenses was estimated at $6.1 billion, while the US soft lens market was estimated at $2.1 billion.&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;Nichols, Jason J., et al [http://www.clspectrum.com/article.aspx?article=105083 "ANNUAL REPORT: Contact Lenses 2010"]. January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple analysts estimated that the global market for contact lenses would reach $11.7 billion by 2015.&lt;ref name="Nichols" /&gt; {{As of|2010}}, the average age of contact lens wearers globally was 31 years old, and two-thirds of wearers were female.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;Morgan, Philip B., et al. [http://www.clspectrum.com/article.aspx?article=105084 "International Contact Lens Prescribing in 2010"]. ''Contact Lens Spectrum''. October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

People choose to wear contact lenses for many reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. K. (1969), Contact Lens Notes, Some factors concerning patients' motivation, The Optician, 10 January, pages 32-33 (published in London, England).&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetics and cosmetics are the main motivating factors for people who want to avoid wearing [[glasses]] or to change the appearance of their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2379308 | year = 1990 | last1 = Sokol | first1 = JL | last2 = Mier | first2 = MG | last3 = Bloom | first3 = S | last4 = Asbell | first4 = PA | title = A study of patient compliance in a contact lens-wearing population | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 209–13 | journal = CLAO Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as [[keratoconus]] and [[aniseikonia]] that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nkcf.org/keratoconus-contact-lenses/|title=Contact Lenses for Keratoconus|last=|first=|date=February 21, 2018|website=National Keratoconus Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the contact lens market is likely to grow due to the increasing occurrence of eye-related conditions such as [[astigmatism]], [[hyperopia]] and [[myopia]]. The other drivers are increasing population, the desire to make fashion statements, and technological advancement. By the end of 2020, the value of the contact lens market is predicted to reach $13.5 billion.&lt;ref name="Contact lenses market"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hexaresearch.com/research-report/contact-lenses-industry/|title=Contact Lenses Market size, share Report, 2024 – Hexa Research|website=www.hexaresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins and first functional prototypes ===
[[File:Davinci.jpg|thumb|150px|Artist's impression of [[da Vinci]]'s method for neutralizing the refractive power of the cornea]]

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] is frequently credited with introducing the idea of contact lenses in his 1508 ''Codex of the eye, Manual D'',&lt;ref name="Heitz" /&gt; wherein he described a method of directly altering [[cornea]]l power by either submerging the head in a bowl of water or wearing a water-filled glass hemisphere over the eye. Neither idea was practically implementable in da Vinci's time.&lt;ref name="Schifrin" /&gt;{{rp|9}} He did not suggest his idea be used for correcting vision, as he was more interested in learning about the mechanisms of [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] of the eye.&lt;ref name="Heitz"&gt;Heitz, RF and Enoch, J. M. (1987) "Leonardo da Vinci: An assessment on his discourses on image formation in the eye." ''Advances in Diagnostic Visual Optics'' 19—26, Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Descartes|Descartes]] proposed another idea in 1636—a glass tube filled with liquid placed in direct contact with the cornea. The protruding end was to be composed of clear glass, shaped to correct vision; however, the idea was impracticable since it made [[blinking]] impossible.

In 1801, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] made a pair of basic contact lenses based on Descartes' model. He used wax to affix water-filled lenses to his eyes, which neutralized its refractive power. He then corrected for it with another pair of lenses.&lt;ref name="Schifrin"&gt;{{cite book |authors= Leonard G. Schifrin and William J. Rich |title=The Contact Lens Industry: Structure, Competition, and Public Policy |publisher=United States [[Office of Technology Assessment]] |date=December 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, like da Vinci's, Young's device was not intended to correct refraction errors. Sir [[John Herschel]], in a footnote of the 1845 edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia Metropolitana]]'', posed two ideas for the visual correction: the first ''"a spherical capsule of glass filled with [[gelatin|animal jelly]]"'',&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Ax8LDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;ots=Sd8pgbep83&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and ''"a mould of the cornea''" that could be impressed on "some sort of transparent medium".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyetopics.com/articles/18/1/The-History-of-Contact-Lenses "The History of Contact Lenses."] eyeTopics.com. Accessed 18 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Herschel reportedly never tested these ideas, they were both later advanced by several independent inventors such as Hungarian Dallos with István Komáromy (1929),{{clarify|date=July 2017}} who perfected a method of making molds from living eyes. This enabled the manufacture of lenses that, for the first time, conformed to the actual shape of the eye.

[[File:Adolf Fick-adjust.png|thumb|185px|In 1888, [[Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick]] was the first to successfully fit contact lenses, which were made from blown glass]]

In 1888, German ophthalmologist [[Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick]] constructed and fitted the first successful contact lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/adolfeugenfick.aspx|title=Adolf Eugen Fick (1852–1937)|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working in Zürich, he described fabricating [[Afocal system|afocal]] [[Scleral lens|scleral]] contact shells, which rested on the less sensitive rim of tissue around the cornea, and experimentally fitting them; initially on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on a small group of volunteers. These lenses were made from heavy blown glass and were {{convert|18–21|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter. Fick filled the empty space between cornea and glass with a dextrose solution. He published his work, ''"Contactbrille"'', in the journal ''Archiv für Augenheilkunde'' in March 1888.

Fick's lens was large and unwieldy, and could be worn only for a couple of hours at a time. [[August Müller (inventor)|August Müller]] in [[Kiel]], Germany, corrected his own severe myopia with a more convenient blown-glass scleral contact lens of his own manufacture in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2686057 | year = 1989 | last1 = Pearson | first1 = RM | last2 = Efron | first2 = N | title = Hundredth anniversary of August Müller's inaugural dissertation on contact lenses | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–41 | journal = Survey of ophthalmology | doi=10.1016/0039-6257(89)90041-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1887, [[Louis J. Girard]] invented a similar scleral form of contact lens.&lt;ref name="Timetables"&gt;{{The Timetables of Science|pages=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blown-glass scleral lenses remained the only form of contact lens until the 1930s when [[Polymethyl methacrylate|Perspex/Plexiglas]] was developed, allowing plastic scleral lenses to be manufactured for the first time. In 1936, optometrist [[William Feinbloom]] introduced plastic in lenses, making them lighter and more convenient.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Mandell. ''Contact Lens Practice'', 4th Edition. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; These lenses were a combination of glass and plastic. In 1939, Hungarian optometrist Dr István Györffy produced first fully plastic lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyorgy|first=Salacz|date=January 2001|title=Dr István Györffy, 1912–1999|url=https://www.contactlensjournal.com/article/S1367-0484(01)80040-0/abstract|journal=Contact Lens and Anterior Eye|language=English|volume=24|issue=4|pages=180–182|doi=10.1016/S1367-0484(01)80040-0|issn=1367-0484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1940, German optometrist [[Heinrich Wöhlk]] produced fully plastic lenses too, based on experiments performed during the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Corneal and rigid lenses (1949-1960s) ===

In 1949, the first "corneal" lenses were developed.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent No. [http://www.google.com/patents?id=BoBuAAAAEBAJ 2,510,438], filed 28 February 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Corneal Lens", ''The Optician'', 2 September 1949, pp. 141–144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Corneal Contact Lenses", ''The Optician'', 9 September 1949, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"New Contact Lens Fits Pupil Only", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 11 February 1952, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; These were much smaller than the original scleral lenses, as they sat only on the cornea rather than across all of the visible ocular surface, and could be worn up to sixteen hours a day. Polymethyl methacrylate&amp;nbsp;(PMMA) corneal lenses became the first contact lenses to have mass appeal through the 1960s, as lens designs became more sophisticated with [[Turning|improving manufacturing technology]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  On Oct. 18, 1964, in a television studio in Washington, D. C, [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] became the first President in the history of these United States to appear in public wearing contact lenses, under the supervision of Dr. Alan Isen, who developed the first commercially viable soft-contact lenses in the United states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosenthal |first1=J. William |title=Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting |date=1996 |publisher=Norman Publishing |isbn=0930405714 |page=379 |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=William D. |title=Soft‐Lens Clamor |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/18/archives/softlens-clamor-tiny-piece-of-plastic-attracts-wall-street-interest.html |accessdate=29 November 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=18 April 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/06/archives/but-they-make-marriage-contracts-with-girls-who-wear-contacts.html|title=nytimes archive|last=|first=|date=December 6, 1964|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early corneal lenses of the 1950s and '60s were relatively expensive and fragile, resulting in the development of a market for contact lens insurance. Replacement Lens Insurance, Inc. (now known as [[RLI Corp.]]) phased out its original flagship product in 1994 after contact lenses became more affordable and easier to replace.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Gas permeable and soft lenses (1959-current) ===

One major disadvantage of PMMA lenses is that they allow no oxygen to get through to the [[conjunctiva]] and cornea, causing a number of adverse and potentially serious clinical effects. By the end of the 1970s and through the '80s and '90s, a range of [[Oxygen permeability|oxygen-permeable]] but rigid materials were developed to overcome this problem. Chemist [[Norman Gaylord]] played a prominent role in the development of these new oxygen-permeable contact lenses.&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2007/09/23/norman_gaylord_84_helped_develop_type_of_contact_lens/|title=Norman Gaylord, 84; helped develop type of contact lens|access-date=6 October 2007 |author=Pearce, Jeremy|date=23 September 2007 |work=(New York Times News Service) |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, these [[polymers]] are referred to as ''[[RGP lens|rigid gas permeable]]'' or RGP materials or lenses. Though all the above contact lens types—sclerals, PMMAs and RGPs—could be correctly referred to as "rigid" or "hard", the latter term is now used to the original PMMAs, which are still occasionally fitted and worn, whereas "rigid" is a generic term for all these lens types; thus hard lenses (PMMAs) are a subset of rigid contact lenses. Occasionally, the term "gas permeable" is used to describe RGPs, which is somewhat misleading as soft contact lenses are also gas permeable in that they allow oxygen to get through to the ocular surface.

[[File:Prof. Ing. RTDr. Otto Wichterle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Otto Wichterle]] (pictured) and [[Drahoslav Lím]] introduced modern soft hydrogel lenses in 1959.]]
The principal breakthrough in soft lenses was made by Czech chemists [[Otto Wichterle]] and [[Drahoslav Lím]], who published their work ''"Hydrophilic gels for biological use"'' in the journal ''Nature'' in 1959.&lt;ref name="Wichterle"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wichterle O, Lim D | year = 1960 | title = Hydrophilic gels for biological use | doi = 10.1038/185117a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 185 | issue = 4706| pages = 117–118 | bibcode = 1960Natur.185..117W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[National Patent Development Corporation]] (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]], which started to manufacture them in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewgasson.co.uk/opioneers_wichterle.htm|title=CONTACT LENS HISTORY – Otto Wichterle|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129033858/http://www.andrewgasson.co.uk/opioneers_wichterle.htm|archivedate=29 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech scientists' work led to the launch of the first '''soft''' ([[Gel#Hydrogels|hydrogel]]) '''contact lenses''' in some countries in the 1960s and the first approval of the Soflens material by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort is achieved). Polymers from which soft lenses are manufactured improved over the next 25 years, primarily in terms of increasing oxygen permeability, by varying the ingredients. In 1972, British optometrist Rishi Agarwal was the first to suggest disposable soft contact lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Agarwal Rishi K | year = 1972 | title = Some Thoughts on Soft Lenses | url = | journal = The Contact Lens | volume = 4 | issue = 1| page = 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1988 | title = Editorial note | url = | journal = American Journal of Optometry and Physiological Optics | volume = 65 | issue = 9| page = 744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the first silicone hydrogel contact lenses were released by [[Ciba Vision]] in Mexico. These new materials encapsulated the benefits of silicone—which has extremely high [[oxygen permeability]]—with the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels that had been used for the previous 30 years. These contact lenses were initially advocated primarily for extended (overnight) wear, although more recently, daily (no overnight) wear silicone hydrogels have been launched.

In a slightly modified molecule, a polar group is added without changing the structure of the silicone hydrogel. This is referred to as the '''Tanaka monomer''' because it was invented and patented by [[Kyoichi Tanaka]] of Menicon Co. of Japan in 1979. Second-generation silicone hydrogels, such as [[galyfilcon A]] (Acuvue Advance, Vistakon) and [[senofilcon A]] (Acuvue Oasys, Vistakon), use the Tanaka monomer. Vistakon improved the Tanaka monomer even further and added other molecules, which serve as an internal [[wetting agent]].&lt;ref name="Szczotka-Flynn"&gt;{{cite web |work=Optometric Management |title=Looking at Silicone Hydrogels Across Generations |url=http://www.optometric.com/article.aspx?article=101727 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719173206/http://www.optometric.com/article.aspx?article=101727 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comfilcon A]] (Biofinity, CooperVision) was the first third-generation polymer. Its patent claims that the material uses two siloxy macromers of different sizes that, when used in combination, produce very high oxygen permeability (for a given water content). [[Enfilcon A]] (Avaira, CooperVision) is another third-generation material that is naturally wettable; its water content is 46%.&lt;ref name="Szczotka-Flynn" /&gt;

== Types ==
Contact lenses are classified in many different ways: by their primary function, material, wear schedule (how long a lens can be worn), and replacement schedule (how long before a lens needs to be discarded).

=== Functions ===

==== Corrective contact lenses ====
[[Corrective lens|Corrective]] contact lenses are designed to improve vision, most commonly by correcting [[refractive error]]. This is done by directly focusing light so it enters the eye with the proper [[Dioptre|power]] for clear vision.

A spherical contact lens bends light evenly in every direction (horizontally, vertically, etc.). They are typically used to correct [[myopia]] and [[hypermetropia]]. A [[toric lens|toric]] contact lens has a different focusing power horizontally than vertically, and as a result can correct for [[astigmatism]]. Some spherical rigid lenses can also correct for astigmatism. Because a toric lens must have the proper orientation to correct for a person's astigmatism, such a lens must have additional design characteristics to prevent it from rotating away from the ideal alignment. This can be done by weighting the bottom of the lens or by using other physical characteristics to rotate the lens back into position. Some toric contact lenses have marks or etchings that can assist the eye doctor or the user in fitting the lens. The first disposable toric contact lenses were introduced in 2000 by [[Vistakon]].

Correction of [[presbyopia]] (a need for a reading prescription different from the prescription needed for distance) presents an additional challenge in the fitting of contact lenses. Two main strategies exist: multifocal lenses and monovision.

'''Multifocal contact lenses''' (e.g. bifocals or progressives) are comparable to spectacles with [[bifocals]] or [[progressive lens]]es because they have multiple [[focus (optics)|focal points]]. Multifocal contact lenses are typically designed for constant viewing through the center of the lens, but some designs do incorporate a shift in lens position to view through the reading power (similar to bifocal glasses).

'''Monovision'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 802938 | year = 1975 | last1 = Lebow | first1 = KA | last2 = Goldberg | first2 = JB | title = Characteristic of binocular vision found for presbyopic patients wearing single vision contact lenses | volume = 46 | issue = 11 | pages = 1116–23 | journal = Journal of the American Optometric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the use of single-vision lenses (one focal point per lens) to focus an eye (typically the dominant one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of [[strabismus]] and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zane F. Pollard|author2=Marc F. Greenberg|author3=Mark Bordenca|author4=Joshua Elliott|author5=Victoria Hsu|title=Strabismus Precipitated by Monovision|journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology|volume=152|number=3| date=September 2011 |pages=479–482|doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2011.02.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monovision would also be unsuitable for an individual with only one functional eye. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Joanne M.|last2=Wick|first2=Kristan|last3=Shuley|first3=Vicki|last4=Pearce|first4=Brendon|last5=Evans|first5=Dean|date=1998-06-01|title=The effect of monovision contact lens wear on driving performance|journal=Clinical &amp; Experimental Optometry|volume=81|issue=3|pages=100–103|issn=1444-0938|pmid=12482258|doi=10.1111/j.1444-0938.1998.tb06727.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses.

===== Other types of vision correction =====
For those with certain [[color blindness|color deficiencies]], a red-tinted "X-Chrom" contact lens may be used. Although such a lens does not restore normal [[color vision]], it allows some color-blind people to distinguish colors better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9314196 | year = 1997 | last1 = Hartenbaum | first1 = NP | last2 = Stack | first2 = CM | title = Color vision deficiency and the X-Chrom lens | volume = 66 | issue = 9 | pages = 36–40, 42 | journal = Occupational Health &amp; Safety }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 6971497 | year = 1981 | last1 = Siegel | first1 = IM | title = The X-Chrom lens. On seeing red | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 312–24 | journal = Survey of ophthalmology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red-filtering contact lenses can also be an option for extreme light sensitivity in some visual deficiencies such as [[achromatopsia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achromatopsia.info/red-contact-lenses/ Red contact lenses for achromats&lt;/ref&gt;

ChromaGen contact lenses have been used and shown to have some limitations with vision at night although otherwise producing significant improvements in color vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11396392 | year = 2001 | last1 = Swarbrick | first1 = HA | last2 = Nguyen | first2 = P | last3 = Nguyen | first3 = T | last4 = Pham | first4 = P | title = The ChromaGen contact lens system: Colour vision test results and subjective responses | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 182–96 | journal = Ophthalmic &amp; Physiological Optics | doi=10.1046/j.1475-1313.2001.00583.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier study showed very significant improvements in color vision and patient satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Harris D "Colouring Sight: A study of CL fittings with colour enhancing lenses" 'Optician' 8 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Later work that used these ChromaGen lenses with [[Dyslexia|dyslexics]] in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial showed highly significant{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} improvements in reading ability over reading without the lenses.&lt;ref&gt;Harris DA, MacRow-Hill SJ "Application of ChromaGen haploscopic lenses to patients with dyslexia: a double masked placebo controlled trial" Journal of the American Optometric Association 25/10/99.&lt;/ref&gt; This system has been granted FDA approval for use in the United States.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}}

[[Magnification]] is another area being researched for future contact lens applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-07/24/magnifying-contact-lenses|title=Telescopic contact lens magnifies vision by 2.8 times on demand|work=Wired UK|access-date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embedding of telescopic lenses and electronic components suggests that future uses of contact lenses may become extremely diverse. However, there are still barriers that prevent transition of these technologies, from [[research and development]] to practical application and commercial availability.

==== Cosmetic contact lenses ====
[[File:Contact Grain.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Woman wearing a cosmetic type of contact lens; enlarged detail shows the grain produced during the manufacturing process. Curving of the lines of printed dots suggests these lenses were manufactured by printing onto a flat sheet then shaping it.]]
A cosmetic contact lens is designed to change the appearance of the eye. These lenses may also correct [[refractive error]]. Although many brands of contact lenses are lightly tinted to make them easier to handle, cosmetic lenses worn to change eye color are far less common, accounting for only 3% of contact lens fits in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan PB et al.[http://www.clspectrum.com/article.aspx?article=12741 "International Contact Lens Prescribing in 2004: An analysis of more than 17,000 contact lens fits from 14 countries in 2004 reveals the diversity of contact lens practice worldwide."] ''Contact Lens Spectrum.'' January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the FDA labels non-corrective cosmetic contact lenses as ''decorative contact lenses''. Like any contact lens, cosmetic lenses carry risks of mild to serious complications, including ocular redness, irritation and infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/news/releases.php?release=1670 Vanderbilt University Medical Center – Vanderbilt Eye Doctors Warn of the Dangers of Cosmetic Contact Lenses]. Mc.vanderbilt.edu (19 April 2010). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their medical nature, colored contact lenses, similar to regular ones, are illegal to purchase in the United States without a valid prescription. Those with perfect vision can buy color contacts for cosmetic reasons, but they still need their eyes to be measured for a "plano" prescription, meaning one with zero vision correction. This is for safety reasons so the lenses will fit the eye without causing irritation or redness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colorfuleyes.org/index.php/contact-lenses/colored-contacts/ "Color Contacts"]. colorfuleyes.org. February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colored contact lenses completely cover the iris, thus dramatically changing eye colour. Other colored contact lenses merely tint the iris, highlighting and beautifying its natural colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lenses-contact.co.uk/dictionary/coloured-contact-lenses.html|title=Coloured Contact Lenses|publisher=lenses-contact.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new trend in Japan, South Korea and China is the [[circle contact lens]], which extend the appearance of the iris onto the sclera by having a dark tinted area all around. The result is an appearance of a bigger, wider iris, a look reminiscent of dolls' eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecandys.com/news/finding-the-right-circle-lenses|title=How Do You Find the Right Circle Lens?|work=EyeCandy's|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the drawbacks of cosmetic lenses is not knowing how they will look before physically trying them on. This has led to an industry where lens retailers are heavily influenced by cutting edge [[digital fashion]] technology, specifically the Virtual Dressing Room technology. Virtual Dressing Room technology offers users the option to upload a photo so they can virtually try on different lenses and experience how they will look before committing to a purchase. Examples of retailers that currently offer this technology are Freshlook Color Studios and Colorful Eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshlookcontacts.com/color-studio/|title=Freshlook Color Studio|work=Freshlook|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorfuleyes.org/eye-color-changer|title=Eye Color Changer|work=Colorful Eyes|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic lenses can have more direct medical applications. For example, some contact lenses can restore the appearance and, to some extent the function, of a [[dyscoria|damaged]] or [[aniridia|missing]] [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].

==== Therapeutic scleral lenses ====
[[File:Scleral lens worn on an eye.jpg|thumb|right|Scleral lens, with visible outer edge resting on the sclera of a patient with severe dry eye syndrome]]
A [[scleral lens]] is a large, firm, oxygen permeable contact lens that rests on the sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses may be used to improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe [[dry eye syndrome]] (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), [[microphthalmia]], [[keratoconus]], [[corneal ectasia]], [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[aniridia]], neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order [[Aberrations of the eye]], complications post-corneal transplant and [[Keratoconus#Related disorders|pellucid degeneration]]. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caceres|first=Vanessa|title=Taking a second look at scleral lenses|journal=ASCRS EyeWorld|date=June 2009|url=http://www.eyeworld.org/article-taking-a-second-look-at-scleral-lenses|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Therapeutic soft lenses ====
Soft lenses are often used in the treatment and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. A bandage contact lens protects an injured or diseased cornea from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids thereby allowing it to heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eyemdlink.com/terminology/bandage_contact_lens.htm|title=Eye Health Guide – Eye Diseases, Eye Problems and Eye Conditions|work=All About Vision|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in the treatment of conditions including [[bullous keratopathy]], [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca|dry eyes]], [[corneal abrasion]]s and [[recurrent corneal erosion|erosion]], [[keratitis]], corneal [[edema]], [[descemetocele]], corneal ectasis, [[Mooren's ulcer]], anterior corneal dystrophy, and neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://new.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/downloads/Pub06_PART_45.pdf | title=45 COVERAGE ISSUES – SUPPLIES – DRUGS 11–91 45 | format=PDF | publisher=[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] | accessdate=1 March 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304101146/http://new.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/downloads/Pub06_PART_45.pdf | archivedate=4 March 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devicelink.com/mddi/archive/05/01/011.html|title=Qmed is the world's only directory of pre-qualified suppliers to the medical device and in vitro diagnostics industry. - Qmed|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materials ===
[[File:Contacteye.png|Right|thumb|Contact lenses, other than the cosmetic variety, become almost invisible once inserted in the eye. Most corrective contact lenses come with a light "handling tint" that renders the lens slightly more visible on the eye. Soft contact lenses extend beyond the cornea, their rim sometimes visible against the sclera.]]

==== Rigid lenses ====
Glass lenses were never comfortable enough to gain widespread popularity. The first lenses to do so were those made from [[polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA or Perspex/Plexiglas), now commonly referred to as "hard" lenses. Their main disadvantage is they do not allow [[oxygen]] to pass through to the [[cornea]], which can cause a number of adverse, and often serious, clinical events. Starting in the late 1970s, improved rigid materials which were [[Oxygen permeability|oxygen-permeable]] were developed. Contact lenses made from these materials are called [[rigid gas permeable]] lenses or 'RGPs'.

A rigid lens is able to cover the natural shape of the [[cornea]] with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct corneal astigmatism. Rigid lenses can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. Rigid lenses can also correct corneas with irregular geometries, such as those with [[keratoconus]] or post surgical [[Post-LASIK ectasia|ectasias]]. In most cases, patients with keratoconus see better through rigid lenses than through [[eyeglasses|glasses]]. Rigid lenses are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments than soft lenses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==== Soft lenses ====
Soft lenses are more flexible than rigid lenses, and can be gently rolled or folded without damaging the lens. While rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before comfort is achieved, new soft lens wearers typically report lens awareness rather than pain or discomfort.

Hydrogel lenses rely on their water content to transmit oxygen through the lens to the cornea.  As a result, higher water content lenses allowed more oxygen to the cornea.  In 1998, [[silicone hydrogel]], or Si-hy lenses became available. These materials have both the extremely high [[oxygen permeability]] of [[silicone]] and the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels. Because silicone allows more oxygen permeability than water, oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogels is not tied to the lenses' water content. Lenses have now been developed with so much oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear (extended wear). Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials.&lt;ref&gt;FDA Premarket Notification for [http://acuvue-now.com/latest-news/news-flash/121-green-light-for-1-day-acuvue-trueye.html "new silicone hydrogel lens for daily wear"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003075751/http://acuvue-now.com/latest-news/news-flash/121-green-light-for-1-day-acuvue-trueye.html |date=3 October 2008 }} 'July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disadvantages of [[silicone hydrogel]]s are that they are slightly stiffer and the lens surface can be hydrophobic, thus less "wettable" – factors that can influence comfort of lens use. New manufacturing techniques and changes to multipurpose solutions have minimized these effects. A surface modification process called plasma coating alters the lens surface's hydrophobic nature. Another technique incorporates internal rewetting agents to make the lens surface hydrophilic. A third process uses longer backbone polymer chains that results in less cross linking and increased wetting without surface alterations or additive agents.

Current brands of soft lenses are either traditional hydrogel or silicone hydrogel.  Because of drastic differences in oxygen permeability, replacement schedule, and other design characteristics, it is very important to follow the instructions of the eye care professional prescribing the lenses.

==== Hybrid ====
A small number of hybrid lenses exist. Typically these contact lenses consist of a rigid center and a soft "skirt".  A similar technique is the "piggybacking" of a smaller, rigid lens on the surface of a larger, soft lens. These techniques are often chosen to give the vision correction benefits of a rigid lens and the comfort of a soft lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|last1=White|first1=Neal|last2=Jennings|first2=Christopher|last3=Pelka|first3=Kevin|title=Hybrid contact lens|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US9625738B2/en|accessdate=28 February 2018|date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wear schedule ===
A "daily wear" (DW) contact lens is designed to be worn for one day and removed before sleeping. An "extended wear" (EW) contact lens is designed for continuous overnight wear, typically for up to 6 consecutive nights. Newer materials, such as silicone hydrogels, allow for even longer wear periods of up to 30 consecutive nights; these longer-wear lenses are often referred to as "continuous wear" (CW). EW and CW contact lenses can be worn overnight because of their high [[oxygen permeability]]. While awake, the eyes are mostly open, allowing oxygen from the air to dissolve into the tears and pass through the lens to the cornea. While asleep, oxygen is supplied from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid.  A lens hindering passage of oxygen to the cornea causes corneal hypoxia which can result in serious complications, such as [[corneal ulcer]] that, if left untreated, can permanently decrease vision. EW and CW contact lenses typically allow for a transfer of 5–6 times more oxygen than conventional softs, allowing the cornea to remain healthy, even with closed eyelids.

Wearing lenses designed for daily wear overnight has an increased risk for corneal infections, corneal ulcers and [[corneal neovascularization]]—this latter condition, once it sets in, cannot be reversed and will eventually spoil vision acuity through diminishing corneal transparency. The most common complication of extended wear is giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), sometimes associated with a poorly fitting contact lens.

=== Replacement schedule ===
Contact lenses are often categorized by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because they do not have to stand up to the wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of [[allergens]] and [[pathogen|germs]], making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular [[allergies]] or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.

Other disposable contact lenses are designed for replacement every two or four weeks. Quarterly or annual lenses, which used to be very common, are much less so. Rigid gas permeable lenses are very durable and may last for several years without the need for replacement. PMMA hards were very durable and were commonly worn for 5 to 10 years, but had several drawbacks.

Lenses with different replacement schedules can be made of the same material. Although the materials are alike, differences in the manufacturing processes determine if the resulting lens will be a "daily disposable" or one recommended for two or four week replacement. However, sometimes manufacturers use absolutely identical lenses and just repackage them with different labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1993-07-11/the-only-difference-is-when-you-throw-them-away|title=The Only Difference Is When You Throw Them Away|date=1993-07-12|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/ContactLenses/ucm062319.htm#dcl|title=Contact Lenses – Types of Contact Lenses.

== Manufacturing ==
Typically, soft contact lenses are mass-produced, while rigids are custom-made to exact specifications for the individual patient.

*Spin-cast lenses – A soft lens manufactured by whirling liquid silicone in a revolving mold at high speed.&lt;ref name="Cassin"&gt;Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. ''Dictionary of Eye Terminology''. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Diamond turning]] – This type is cut and polished on a CNC [[lathe]].&lt;ref name="Cassin" /&gt; The lens starts out as a cylindrical disk held in the jaws of the lathe that is equipped with an industrial-grade [[diamond]] as the cutting tool. The CNC lathe may turn at nearly 6000 RPM as the cutter removes the desired amount of material from the inside of the lens. The concave (inner) surface of the lens is then polished with some fine abrasive paste, oil, and a small polyester cotton ball turned at high speeds. To hold the delicate lens in reverse manner, wax is used as an adhesive. The lens' convex (outer) surface is thus cut and polished by the same process. This method can be used to shape rigid as well as soft lenses. In the case of softs, the lens is cut from a dehydrated polymer that is rigid until water is reintroduced.
*Molded – Molding is used to manufacture some brands of soft contact lenses. Rotating molds are used and the molten material is added and shaped by centripetal forces. Injection molding and computer control are also used to create nearly perfect lenses.&lt;ref&gt;Manufacture of soft contact lenses. [http://www.lensfinder.co.uk/information/contact-lens-manufacturing-process/ "Manufacture of soft contact lenses".]&lt;/ref&gt; The lens is kept moist throughout the entire molding process and is never dried and rehydrated.

Many companies make contact lenses. In the United States, there are five major manufacturers:&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission. [https://www.ftc.gov/reports/strength-competition-sale-rx-contact-lenses-ftc-study "The Strength of Competition in the Sale of Rx Contact Lenses: An FTC Study".] February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Novartis]]: through its [[Alcon]] subsidiary.
*[[Valeant Pharmaceuticals]]: through its [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]] subsidiary.
*[[The Cooper Companies]]: through its [[CooperVision]] subsidiary.
*[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]; maker of [[Acuvue]] lenses.
*[[X-Cel Specialty Contacts]]; maker of [[Westcon]] lenses.

== Prescriptions ==
[[File:Lens Basecurve.jpg|thumb|Diameter and base curve radius]]
The parameters specified in a contact lens prescription may include:
*Material / Brand name
*[[Base curve radius]] (BC, BCR)
*[[Diameter]] (D, OAD)
*[[Optical power|Power]] in [[dioptre|diopters]]
*Center thickness (CT)

Prescriptions for contact lenses and [[glasses]] may be similar, but are not interchangeable. Prescribing of contact lenses is usually restricted to various combinations of [[ophthalmologist]]s, [[optometrist]]s and [[optician]]s. An [[eye examination]] is needed to determine an individual's suitability for contact lens wear. This typically includes a [[refraction]] to determine the proper power of the lens and an assessment of the health of the eye's anterior segment. Many eye diseases prohibits contact lens wear, such as active infections, allergies, and dry eye.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R.K. (1970), Some reasons for not fitting contact lenses, The Optician, 4 December, page 623 (published in London, England).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keratometer|Keratometry]] is especially important in the fitting of rigid lenses.

=== United States ===
Contact lenses are prescribed by [[ophthalmologist]]s, [[optometrist]]s, or specially licensed [[optician]]s under the supervision of an eye doctor. Contact lenses can typically be ordered at the office that conducts the eye exam and fitting. The [[Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act]]&lt;ref name="FCLCA"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ164/html/PLAW-108publ164.htm "Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act"]. 15 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; gives consumers the right to obtain a copy of their contact lens prescription, allowing them to fill it at the lens provider of their choice.

== Complications ==
{{Main|List of contact lens complications}}
{{further|Effects of long-term contact lens wear on the cornea}}
[[File:Clare-314.jpg|thumb|CLARE (''contact lens associated red eye'') is a group of inflammatory complications from lens wear]]
Contact lenses are generally safe as long as they are used correctly. [[Complication (medicine)|Complications]] from contact lens wear affect roughly 5% of wearers yearly.&lt;ref name="Stamler"&gt;John Stamler. [http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic651.htm "Contact Lens Complications."] ''eMedicine.com.'' 1 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors leading to eye damage varies,&lt;ref name="Factors Leading to Eye Damage Caused by Contact Lenses"&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Contact Lenses Damage The Eye?|url=https://www.lensite.co.uk/Lens-Wearing-Guide/Contact-Lenses-Facts|publisher=Lensite|access-date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improper use of a contact lens may affect the [[eyelid]], the [[conjunctiva]], and, most of all, the whole structure of the [[cornea]].&lt;ref name="Stamler" /&gt; Poor [[Contact lens#Care|lens care]] can lead to infections by various [[microorganism]]s including [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and ''[[Acanthamoeba]]'' ([[Acanthamoeba keratitis|''Acanthamoeba'' keratitis]]).

Many complications arise when contact lenses are worn not as prescribed (improper wear schedule or lens replacement). Sleeping in lenses not designed or approved for extended wear is a common cause of complications. Many people go too long before replacing their contacts, wearing lenses designed for 1, 14, or 30 days of wear for multiple months or years. While this does save on the cost of lenses, it risks permanent damage to the eye and even loss of sight.

One of the major factors that causes complications is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally gets that oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long-term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include [[corneal neovascularization]], increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal [[edema]], endothelial [[polymegethism]], dry eye and potential increase in myopia.&lt;ref name="What's the Best Prescription for Healthy Contact Lens Wear?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the Best Prescription for Healthy Contact Lens Wear?|url=http://www.clspectrum.com/article.aspx?article=12590|publisher=Contact Lens Spectrum}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is why much of the research into the latest soft and rigid contact lens materials has centered on improving oxygen transmission through the lens.

Mishandling of contact lenses can also cause problems. [[Corneal abrasion]]s can increase the chances of infection.&lt;ref name="Corneal Abrasion in Emergency Medicine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corneal Abrasion in Emergency Medicine|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/799316-overview#a0199|publisher=Medscape Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with improper cleaning and disinfection of the lens, a risk of infection further increases. Decreased corneal sensitivity after extended contact lens wear may cause a patient to miss some of the earliest symptoms of such complications.&lt;ref name="The effects of long-term contact lens wear on corneal thickness, curvature, and surface regularity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Z.|author2=Pflugfelder, S.|title=The effects of long-term contact lens wear on corneal thickness, curvature, and surface regularity|journal=Ophthalmology|date=January 2000|volume=107|issue=1|pages=105–111|doi=10.1016/S0161-6420(99)00027-5|pmid=10647727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way contact lenses interact with the natural tear layer is a major factor in determining lens comfort and visual clarity. People suffering from [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca|dry eyes]] are particularly vulnerable to discomfort and episodes of brief blurry vision. Proper lens selection can minimize these effects.

All contact lenses sold in the United States are studied and approved as safe by the FDA when specific handling and care procedures, wear schedules, and replacement schedules are followed.

== Usage ==
Before touching the contact lens or the eye, it is important to [[handwashing|wash hands]] thoroughly with [[soap]] and rinse well. Soaps containing [[moisturizer]]s or [[allergen]]s should be avoided as these can cause eye irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Put Contacts in Your Eyes|url=http://coopervision.com/about-contacts/how-put-contacts-your-eyes|publisher=CooperVision|accessdate=20 November 2014|quote=use plain soap without any heavy moisturizers or perfumes. Rinse well and dry your hands. Again, this is to prevent transmitting anything unwanted to your eyes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drying of hands using towels or tissues before handling contact lenses can transfer lint (fluff) to the hands and, subsequently, to the lenses, causing irritation upon insertion. Towels, unless freshly laundered on high temperature wash, are frequently contaminated with large quantities of bacteria and, as such, should be avoided when handling lenses. Dust, lint and other debris may collect on the outside of contact lenses. Again, hand contact with this material, before handling contact lenses, may transfer it to the lenses themselves. Rinsing the case under a source of clean running water, before opening it, can help alleviate this problem. Next the lens should be removed from its case and inspected for defects (e.g. splits, folds, lint). A 'gritty' or rough appearance to the lens surface may indicate that a considerable quantity of proteins, lipids and debris has built up on it and that additional cleaning is required; this is often accompanied and felt by unusually high irritation upon insertion.

Make sure the soft lens is not inserted inside-out. Edge of a lens turned inside out has a different appearance, especially when the lens is slightly folded. Insertion of an inside-out lens for a brief time (less than one minute) should not cause any damage to the eye. Some brands of lenses have markings (e.g. numbers) on the rim that make it easier to tell the front of the lens from the back.

The technique for removing or inserting a contact lens varies depending upon whether the lens is soft or rigid. There are many subtle variations to insertion and removal techniques. Because of differences in anatomy, manual dexterity, and visual limitations, every person must find the technique that works best for them. In all cases, the insertion and removal of lenses requires some training and practice on part of the user.

=== Insertion ===
[[File:Contact Lens Ayala.jpg|thumb|200px|Inserting a contact lens]]

Contact lenses are typically inserted into the eye by placing them on the pad of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may be placed on the [[sclera]] (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes and then look towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.

When the lens first contacts the eye, it should be comfortable. By making sure that particular attention is given to the eyelid margins for the presence of inflammation and signs of debris in the lashes, wearing contact lenses should be easy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Increase contact lens comfort by paying attention to the lids|url=http://optometrytimes.modernmedicine.com/optometrytimes/news/increase-contact-lens-comfort-paying-attention-lids|publisher=OptometryTimes|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief period of irritation may occur, caused by a difference in [[pH]] and/or [[salinity]] between that of the lens solution and the tear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=pH consistency and stability of contact lens solutions|quote=The pH of contact lens solutions has been implicated in the comfort of contact lenses on insertion.|pmid=2584587 | volume=60|issue=10|author=Demas GN|journal=J Am Optom Assoc|pages=732–4|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye Care|url=http://www.contactlensheaven.com/eyecare.html|publisher=CLH|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, taking a break from lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the person should be seen as soon as possible by an eye doctor to rule out potentially serious [[contact lens#Complications|complications]].

=== Removal ===
[[File:Contact Lens Girl.jpg|thumb|Young woman removing contact lenses from her eyes in front of a mirror]]
Removing contact lenses incorrectly could result in damage to the lens and injury to the eye so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops out. With one finger on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral [[canthus (anatomy)|canthus]], the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins against the edge of lens allows the blink to break the [[capillary action]] that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable.

A soft contact lens may be removed by pinching the edge between the thumb and index finger. Moving the lens off the cornea first can improve comfort during removal and reduce risk of scratching the cornea with a fingernail. It is also possible to push or pull a soft lens far enough to the side or bottom of the eyeball to get it to fold then fall out, without pinching and thereby damaging it. If these techniques are used with a rigid lens, it may scratch the cornea.

There are also small tools specifically for removing lenses. Usually made of flexible plastic, they resemble small tweezers, or [[plunger]]s that suction onto the front of the lens. Typically these tools are used only with rigid lenses. Extreme care must be exercised when using mechanical tools or fingernails to insert or remove contact lenses.

=== Care ===
[[File:Lens-cover.jpg|thumb|right|Lens case to store contacts]]

Lens care varies depending on material and wear schedule. Daily disposables are discarded after a single use and thus require no cleaning. Other lenses need regular cleaning and disinfecting to prevent surface coating and [[contact lens#Complications|infections]].

There are many ways to clean and care for contact lenses, typically called care systems or lens solutions:
*Multipurpose solutions

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Care should be taken not to get hydrogen peroxide in the eye because it is very painful and irritating.  With "two-step" products, the hydrogen peroxide must be rinsed away with saline before the lenses may be worn. "One-step" systems allow the hydrogen peroxide to react completely, becoming pure water. Thus "one-step" hydrogen peroxide systems do not require the lenses to be rinsed before insertion, provided the solution has been given enough time to react.

*Enzymatic cleaner – Used for cleaning protein deposits off lenses, usually weekly, if the daily cleaner is not sufficient. Typically, this cleaner is in tablet form.
*Ultraviolet, vibration, or ultrasonic devices – Used to both disinfect and clean CLs. The lenses are inserted inside the portable device (running on batteries and/or plug-in) for 2 to 6 minutes during which both the microorganisms and protein build-up are thoroughly cleaned. These devices are not usually available in optic retailers but are in other stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Saline (medicine)|Saline]] solution
::Sterile saline is used for rinsing the lens after cleaning and preparing it for insertion. Saline solutions do not disinfect, so it must be used in conjunction with some type of disinfection system. One advantage to saline is that it cannot cause an allergic response, so it is well suited for individuals with sensitive eyes or strong allergies.
*Daily cleaner
::Used to clean lenses on a daily basis. A few drops of cleaner are applied to the lens while it rests in the palm of the hand; the lens is rubbed for about 20 seconds with a clean fingertip (depending on the product) on each side. Lens must then be rinsed. This system is commonly used to care for rigid lenses.

Aside from cleaning the contact lenses, it is highly advised to also clean the cases to avoid any possible infection. Replacing the case monthly, and storing it in a clean and safe environment is also recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.feelgoodcontacts.com/information/contactlenscare.aspx|title=Caring For Contact Lenses – Feel Good Contact Lenses|last=www.feelgoodcontacts.com|website=www.feelgoodcontacts.com|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact lenses can be mechanically cleaned of more substantial protein, lipid and debris build up by rubbing them between the clean pad of a finger and the palm of a hand, using a small amount of cleaning fluid as a lubricant. However, this method does not sterilize the lenses and so should be performed only before a full sterilization cycle (e.g. when putting the contact lens away at night).

Some products must be used only with certain types of contact lenses. Water alone will not at all disinfect the lens, and can lead to lens contamination causing potentially irreparable harm to the eye.

Contact lens solutions often contain [[preservative]]s such as [[benzalkonium chloride]] and [[benzyl alcohol]]. Preservative-free products usually have shorter [[shelf life|shelf lives]], but are better suited for individuals with an allergy or sensitivity to a preservative. In the past, [[thiomersal]] was used as a preservative. In 1989, thiomersal was responsible for about 10% of problems related to contact lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2630335 | year = 1989 | last1 = Wilson-Holt | first1 = N | last2 = Dart | first2 = JK | title = Thiomersal keratoconjunctivitis, frequency, clinical spectrum and diagnosis | volume = 3 | pages = 581–7 | journal = Eye (London, England) | doi=10.1038/eye.1989.91 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most products no longer contain thiomersal.

== Current research ==
A large segment of current contact lens research is directed towards the treatment and prevention of conditions resulting from contact lens contamination and colonization by foreign organisms. Clinicians tend to agree that the most significant complication of contact lens wear is microbial [[keratitis]] and that the most predominant microbial pathogen is ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, DM, Petroll, WM, Jester, JV &amp; Cavanagh, HD: Current concepts: contact lens related Pseudomonas keratitis. ''Cont Lens Anterior Eye'', 30: 94–107, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms are also major causative factors in bacterial keratitis associated with contact lens wear, although their prevalence varies across different locations. These include both the ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' species (''aureus'' and ''epidermidis'') and the ''[[Streptococcus]]'' species, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, S, Kunimoto, D, Rao, N, Garg, P &amp; Rao, G: Trends in antibiotic resistance of corneal pathogens: Part II. An analysis of leading bacterial keratitis isolates, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verhelst D, Koppen C, Looveren JV, Meheus A, Tassignon M | year = 2005 | title = Clinical, epidemiological and cost aspects of contact lens related infectious keratitis in Belgium: results of a seven-year retrospective study | url = | journal = Bull Soc Belge Ophtalmol | volume = 297 | issue = | pages = 7–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial keratitis is a serious focal point of current research due to its potentially devastating effect on the eye, including severe vision loss.&lt;ref&gt;Burd EM, Ogawa GSH, Hyndiuk RA. Bacterial keratitis and conjunctivitis. In: Smolin G, Thoft RA, editors. '''The Cornea'''. ''Scientific Foundations and Clinical Practice''. 3rd ed. Boston: Little, Brown, &amp; Co, 1994. p 115–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

One specific research topic of interest is how microbes such as ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated ''Pseudomonas'' binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zaidi T, Mowrey-McKee M, Pier GB | year = 2004 | title = Hypoxia increases corneal cell expression of CFTR leading to increased Pseudomonas aeruginosa binding, internalization, and initiation of inflammation | url = | journal = Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 4066–74 | doi=10.1167/iovs.04-0627| pmc = 1317302}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to alleviate [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] is to increase the amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility,&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney DF, Keay L, Jalbert I. Clinical performance of silicone hydrogel lenses. In Sweeney DF, ed. ''Silicone Hydrogels: The Rebirth of Continuous Wear Contact Lenses.'' Woburn, Ma: Butterworth Heinemann; 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft contact lenses. A recent study showed that ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' and ''[[Staphylococcus epidermis]]'' adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone hydrogel contact lenses than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' was 20 times stronger than that of ''Staphylococcus epidermidis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kodjikian L, Casoli-Bergeron E, Malet F, Janin-Manificat H, Freney J, Burillon C, Colin J, Steghens JP | year = 2008 | title = Bacterial adhesion to conventional hydrogel and new silicone hydrogel contact lens materials | url = | journal = Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol | volume = 246 | issue = | pages = 267–73 | doi=10.1007/s00417-007-0703-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This might partly explain why ''Pseudomonas'' infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel contact lenses showed that worn silicone contact lenses were less prone to ''Staphylococcus epidermidis'' colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses.&lt;ref name="Santos2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santos|first=Lívia |author2=Diana Rodrigues |author3=Madalena Lira |author4=M Elisabete C.

Another important area of contact lens research deals with patient compliance. Compliance is a major issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Agarwal R.K. | year = 1971 | title = A legally problematical but clinically interesting contact lens case | url = | journal = The Contact Lens | volume = 3 | issue = 3| page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pertaining to the use of contact lenses because patient noncompliance often leads to contamination of the lens, storage case, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yung MS, Boost M, Cho P, Yap M | year = 2007 | title = Microbial contamination of contact lenses and lens care accessories of soft contact lens wearers (university students) in Hong Kong | url = | journal = Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 11–21 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-1313.2006.00427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Midelfart J. |author2=Midelfart A. |author3=Bevanger L. | year = 1996 | title = Microbial contamination of contact lens cases among medical students | url = | journal = CLAO J | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 21–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gray T.B. |author2=Cursons R.T. |author3=Sherwan J.F. |author4=Rose P.R. | year = 1995 | title = Acanthamoeba, bacterial, and fungal contamination of contact lens storage cases | url = | journal = Br J Ophthalmol | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 601–605 | doi=10.1136/bjo.79.6.601|pmc=505174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, careful users can extend the wear of lenses through proper handling: there is, unfortunately, no disinterested research on the issue of "compliance" or the length of time a user can safely wear a lens beyond its stated use. The introduction of multipurpose solutions and daily disposable lenses have helped to alleviate some of the problems observed from inadequate cleaning but new methods of combating microbial contamination are currently being developed. A [[silver]]-impregnated lens case has been developed which helps to eradicate any potentially contaminating microbes that come in contact with the lens case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amos CF, George MD | year = 2006 | title = Clinical and laboratory testing of a silver-impregnated lens case | url = | journal = Cont Lens Anterior Eye | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 247–55 | doi=10.1016/j.clae.2006.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a number of [[antimicrobial]] agents are being developed that have been embedded into contact lenses themselves. Lenses with covalently attached [[selenium]] molecules have been shown to reduce bacterial colonization without adversely affecting the cornea of a rabbit eye&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathews SM, Spallholz JE, Grimson MJ, Dubielzig RR, Gray T, Reid TW | year = 2006 | title = Prevention of bacterial colonization of contact lenses with covalently attached selenium and effects on the rabbit cornea | url = | journal = Cornea | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 806–14 | doi=10.1097/01.ico.0000224636.57062.90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[octyl glucoside]] used as a lens surfactant significantly decreases bacterial adhesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Santos L |author2=Rodrigues D |author3=Lira M |author4=Oliveira R |author5=Oliveira Real, ME |author6=Vilar EY |author7=Azeredo J | year = 2007 | title = The effect of octylglucoside and sodium cholate in Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion to soft contact lenses | url = | journal = Optom Vis Sci | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 429–34 | doi=10.1097/opx.0b013e318058a0cc | pmid=17502827}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds are of particular interest to contact lens manufacturers and prescribing optometrists because they do not require any patient compliance to effectively attenuate the effects of bacterial colonization.

A recent area of research is in the field of [[Bionic contact lens|bionic lenses]]. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and [[light-emitting diodes]] and can harvest radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can display information beamed from a mobile device overcoming the small display size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses will also need to have an array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearer’s eyes. The lens could also serve as a head-up display for pilots or gamers.&lt;ref name=lc /&gt;

Drug administration through contact lenses is also becoming an area of research. One application is a lens that releases anesthesia to the eye for post-surgery pain relief, especially after PRK ([[photorefractive keratectomy]]) in which the healing process takes several days. One experiment shows that silicone contact lenses that contain vitamin E deliver pain medication for up to seven days compared with less than two hours in usual lenses.&lt;ref name=lc&gt;{{cite web|title=Contacts Release Anesthesia to Eyes of Post-Surgery Patients|url=http://www.lenscompare.co.uk/compare-contact-lenses-latest-research/|accessdate=4 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421013228/http://www.lenscompare.co.uk/compare-contact-lenses-latest-research/|archivedate=21 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study of the usage of contact lens is aimed to address the issue of [[macular degeneration]] (AMD or age-related macular degeneration). An international collaboration of researchers was able to develop a contact lens that can shift between magnified and normal vision. Previous solutions to AMD included bulky glasses or surgical implants. But the advancement of this new contact lens, which is made of polymethyl methacrylate, could offer an unobtrusive solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Ever Switchable Telescopic Contact Lens|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/meriameberboucha/2018/02/28/first-ever-switchable-telescopic-contact-lens/|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

[[File:Dracula 1958 c.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Christopher Lee]] as the title character in ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958) in one of the first uses of contact lens with makeup in films]]

===Films===
One of the earliest known [[motion pictures]] to introduce the use of contact lenses as a [[make-up artist]]'s device for enhancing the eyes was by the innovative actor [[Lon Chaney]] in the 1926 film ''[[The Road to Mandalay (1926 film)|The Road to Mandalay]]'' to create the effect of a character who had a blind eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silent Films, 1877–1996: A Critical Guide to 646 Movies|last=Klepper|first=Robert K.|publisher=McFarland|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Rueben Greenspoon]] applied them to Orson Welles for the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' in 1940.  In the 1950s, contact lenses were starting to be used in British color horror films. An early example of this is the British actor [[Christopher Lee]] as the [[Dracula]] character in the 1958 color horror film ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'', which helped to emphasize his horrific looking black [[pupils]] and red [[red eye (medicine)|bloodshot eyes]]. [[Tony Curtis]] wore them in the 1968 film ''[[The Boston Strangler (film)|The Boston Strangler]]''. Contact lenses were also used to better emphasize the sinister gaze of the demonic characters in 1968's ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' and 1973's ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''. Colored custom-made contact lenses are now standard makeup for a number of special effects-based movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yazigi|first=Monique P.|date=July 17, 1994|title=On Film, Them There Eyes Are Often Contact Lenses.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/movies/film-on-film-them-there-eyes-are-often-contact-lenses.html|journal=New York Times|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7712">:''This article deals with the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 which came into force on 13 November 2006. For the later regulations that came into force on 6th April 2012, see [[Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012]]''

The '''Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006''' came into force in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2006 and brought together a number of other asbestos related pieces of legislation.&lt;ref name="HSE asbestos regs 2006"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm HSE | The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  The pieces of legislation the regulations revoked and replaced were the 'Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002', the 'Asbestos (Licensing) Regulations 1983' and the 'Asbestos (Prohibitions) Regulations 1992'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2739/note/made Legislation.gov.uk | The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  Key elements of the regulations include a greater emphasis on training requiring anyone who may come into contact with [[Asbestos]] in the course of their work to be given suitable training.  Greater restrictions were also placed on the amount of exposure workers could be exposed to in the form of 'control limits'. The recently published 'Asbestos: The survey guide' (HSG264) is complementary to these regulations. When work with asbestos is being carried out the Regulations place a requirement on employers and self-employed workers to prevent exposure to asbestos fibres. 

==Duties arising from the regulations==
The Control of Asbestos 2006 regulations brought together three separate pieces of legislation which covered the prohibition of Asbestos, the control of asbestos at work and asbestos licensing.  They prohibit the import, supply and use of all types of asbestos and also continue to ban the second hand use of asbestos products such as asbestos boards and tiles.  The regulations require mandatory training to be given to anyone who may be exposed to asbestos whilst at work. This regulation will enable contracted workers on site to assess correctly the nature of a material before work is carried out, thus eliminating the risk of uncontrolled damage to Asbestos Containing Materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amiantus.co.uk/|title=Amiantus Asbestos Consultants {{!}} Its now your duty to Manage Asbetos|last=|first=|date=|website=www.amiantus.co.uk|access-date=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance workers who may be coming onto a premises to carry out a job must also be given training.&lt;ref name="HSE asbestos"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm HSE | Asbestos regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;  Should work need to be carried out that may result in the disturbing of asbestos then all measures should be taken to limit the exposure to asbestos fibres.  Any exposure to those fibres should be below the 'airborne exposure limit' of 0.1 fibres per cm³.&lt;ref name="HSE asbestos" /&gt;  The control limit is the maximum concentration of asbestos fibres in the air if measured over any continuous 4 hour period.  Any short term exposure to asbestos, as measured by continuous exposure over 10 minutes, should not exceed 0.6 fibres per cm³.  These exposures must be strictly controlled with respiratory protective equipment if exposure can be reduced in no other way.&lt;ref name="HSE asbestos" /&gt;  In terms of asbestos removal, any work should be carried out by a licensed contractor although any decision as to whether work is 'licensable' is based on the risk.  Anyone working on asbestos under the regulations must have a license issued by the Health and Safety Executive.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm HSE Web Site - Control of Asbestos Regulations] There are a number of exceptions to whether work is licensable.  These usually apply if it is clear from the risk assessment that any exposure will not exceed the control limit and the work is short and non-continuous; the work is to do with the sealing of asbestos containing materials and the material is in a good condition; air monitoring and control as in the collection of samples to determine whether a particular product contains asbestos.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HSE asbestos" /&gt; 

==Prosecutions arising from the regulations==
On 9 June 2009 a company in Swansea, Val Inco Europe Ltd, pleaded guilty to four charges under the Control of Asbestos Regulations and were fined £12,000 and ordered to pay £28,000 costs.  The charges were in relation to work carried out by a contractor, A-Weld, on a furnace at the companies premises.&lt;ref name="HSE press release" /&gt;  Although asbestos surveys had been carried out on their site, the interior of the plant and equipment had not been surveyed.  As a result, asbestos insulation material was disturbed and broken potentially giving rise to powders and fibres.&lt;ref name="HSE press release" /&gt;  Workers on the site also discovered a 'white material' which they believed to be asbestos and although the sample was sent away for tests, the site was not isolated and the work was allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="HSE press release" /&gt;  HSE principal inspector Andrew Knowles said that an "important aspect was the failure to provide asbestos awareness training for employees, which is a specific requirement where asbestos may be present in a workplace".&lt;ref name="HSE press release" /&gt;  He added "The failures in this case were entirely preventable and the defendant fell far short of the high standards required. This should serve as a warning to others about the dangers of asbestos and the legal requirement to manage it properly."&lt;ref name="HSE press release"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2009/coiw30409.htm HSE | Asbestos warning after company prosecuted]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asbestos and associated health risks==
{{Main|Asbestos}}
Asbestos is a naturally occurring group of [[silicate minerals]] that can readily be separated into thin strong fibres that are flexible, heat resistant and chemically inert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mii.org/Minerals/photoasbes.html Minerals | Asbestos]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world, asbestos was used extensively as a building material from the 1950s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="asbestos basics" /&gt; It was used as a means of fireproofing as well as insulation and any building built before 2000 could contain asbestos. Although Asbestos can be safe if the material is kept in good condition and undisturbed, if damaged asbestos fibres could become airborne and cause serious risks to health if inhaled.&lt;ref name="asbestos basics"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/basics.htm HSE | Asbestos basics]&lt;/ref&gt; Serious diseases including [[mesothelioma]], [[lung cancer]], and [[asbestosis]] could result if someone were to breathe in high levels of asbestos fibres. A particular risk if someone were to be working either on, or with, asbestos materials which had been damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/dangerous.htm HSE | why is asbestos dangerous?]&lt;/ref&gt; There are six forms of Asbestos although only three are commonly used, these are [[Chrysotile]] (white asbestos), the most common; [[Amosite]] (brown asbestos) which can often be found in ceiling tiles and as a fire retardant in thermal insulation products; [[Crocidolite]] (blue asbestos), commonly used in high temperature applications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071228042633/http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/aw/air/reg/asbestos/asbes3.htm Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources | Asbestos - History and Uses]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural competence in healthcare''' refers to the ability for [[healthcare professional]]s to demonstrate [[cultural competence]] toward patients with diverse [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, [[belief]]s, and feelings.&lt;ref name="TL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=TL|last2=Bazron|first2=BJ|last3=Dennis|first3=KW|last4=Isaacs|first4=MR|title=Towards a Culturally Competent System of Care: A Monograph on Effective Services for Minority Children Who Are Severely Emotionally Disturbed|journal=Georgetown University Child Development Center, CASSP Technical Assistance Center|date=March 1989|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED330171.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process includes consideration of the individual social, [[culture|cultural]], and [[feelings]] needs of patients for effective [[cross-cultural communication]] with their health care providers.&lt;ref name="betancourt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Betancourt|first1=Joseph R.|last2=Green|first2=Alexander R.|last3=Carillo|first3=J. Emilio|title=Cultural competence in health care: emerging frameworks and practical approaches|date=October 2002|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|location=New York, NY|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/betancourt_culturalcompetence_576.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of cultural competence in health care is to reduce [[health disparity|health disparities]] and to provide optimal care to patients regardless of their [[race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], [[ethnic background]], native languages spoken, and religious or cultural beliefs. [[Cultural competency training]] is important in health care fields where human interaction is common, including medicine, nursing, [[allied health]], mental health, social work, pharmacy, [[oral health]], and [[public health]] fields.

The term cultural competence was first used by Terry L. Cross and colleagues in 1989,&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; but it was not until almost a decade later that health care professionals began to be formally educated and trained in cultural competence. In 2002, cultural competence in health care emerged as a field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thackrah|first1=RD|last2=Thompson|first2=SC|title=Refining the concept of cultural competence: building on decades of progress|journal=The Medical Journal of Australia|date=8 July 2013|volume=199|issue=1|pages=35–38|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2013/199/1/refining-concept-cultural-competence-building-decades-progress|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been increasingly embedded into medical education curriculum since then.

Although cultural competence in healthcare is a global concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Neal R.|title=Cultural Competence in the Global Healthcare Industry|url=http://www.astd.org/Publications/Newsletters/ASTD-Links/ASTD-Links-Articles/2014/04/Cultural-Competence-in-the-Global-Healthcare-Industry|website=Association for Talent Development|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is primarily practiced in the [[United States]].

==Definitions==
Cultural competence is defined as a set of congruent behaviors, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals and that enables them to work effectively in cross-cultural situations.&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt; Essential elements that enable organizations to become culturally competent include valuing [[cultural diversity|diversity]], having the capacity for cultural [[self-assessment]], being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact, having institutionalized cultural knowledge, and having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt; By definition, diversity includes differences in race, ethnicity, age, gender, size, religion, sexual orientation, and physical and mental ability.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage® New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy''. (2005). Third Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, organizations should include these considerations in all aspects of [[policy making]], administration, practice, and service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Frameworks / Models, Guiding Values and Principles|url=http://nccc.georgetown.edu/foundations/frameworks.html#ccdefinition|website=National Center for Cultural Competence|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural competence involves more than having sensitivity or awareness of cultures. It necessitates an active process of learning and developing skills to engage effectively in cross-cultural situations and re-evaluating these skills over time.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Minority Health. (2002). ''Teaching cultural competence in health care: A review of current concepts, policies and practices''. Washington D.C.: U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. Contract Number: 282 - 98 - 0029.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competence is often used interchangeably with the term cultural competency.

==Cultural competence in various settings==

===Healthcare system===
A healthcare system, sometimes referred to as health system, is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver healthcare services to meet the health needs of target populations. A culturally competent health system not only recognizes and accepts the importance of cultural diversity at every level but also assesses the cross-cultural relations, stays vigilant towards any changes and developments resulting from cultural diversity, broadens cultural knowledge, and adapts services to meet the needs that are culturally-unique.&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt;

As more and more immigrants are coming to America, healthcare professionals with good cultural competence can use the knowledge and sensitivity that they obtain in order to provide holistic care for clients from other countries, who speak foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Judith M. |last2=Treas |first2=Leslie S. |title=Fundamentals of Nursing |volume=1 |publisher=Davis Company |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges for American healthcare systems to meet the health needs of the increasing number of diverse patients are becoming very obvious. The challenges include but are not limited to the following:&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Obstacle#Biopsychosocial and cultural barriers|Sociocultural barriers]]
* Poor cross-cultural communication
* [[Language barrier]]s
* Attitudes toward healthcare
* Beliefs in diagnosis and treatment
* Lack of cultural competence in the design of the system

===Leadership and workforce===
In response to a rapid growth of [[minority group|minorities population]] in the United States, healthcare organizations have responded by providing new services and undergoing health reforms in terms of diversity in leadership and workforce. Despite improvements and progress seen in some areas, minorities are still underrepresented within both healthcare leadership and workforce.&lt;ref name="betancourt" /&gt; To improve the weak minorities representation in leadership and workforce, an organization must acknowledge the importance of cultures, be sensitive to cultural differences, and establish strategic plans to incorporate cultural diversity.

According to the national survey of the U.S. healthcare leaders conducted by the search firm [[Witt/Kieffer]], respondents viewed diverse leadership as a valuable business builder. They associated it with improved patient satisfaction, successful decision-making, improved clinical outcomes, and stronger bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witt/Kieffer|title=Building the Business Case - Healthcare Diversity Leadership: a National Survey Report|date=2011|url=http://www.wittkieffer.com/file/thought-leadership/practice/Diversity%20as%20a%20business%20builder_2011.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To successfully recruit, mentor, and coach minority leaders in healthcare, it is important to keep these social science principles and cultural values in mind:&lt;ref&gt;Rich VL. Advancing diversity leadership in health care. ''Nursing administration quarterly''. Jul-Sep 2013;37(3):269-271.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Brand]]ing - how health care leaders brand diversity in their organizations? Without inclusion, branding would not be complete
* The concepts of self-categorization and "othering"
* Lack of leadership commitment - diversity and inclusion should be an imperative of their organization
* The compelling national demographics of healthcare leadership and workforce.

===Clinical practice===
To provide culturally sensitive patient-centered care, physicians should treat each patient as an individual, recognizing and respecting his or her beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name="like1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Like|first1=RCL|last2=Barrett|first2=TJ|last3=Moon|first3=J|title=Educating Physicians to Provide Culturally Competent, Patient-Centered Care|journal=Perspectives: A View of Family Medicine in New Jersey|date=Summer 2008|volume=7|issue=2|pages=10–20|url=http://www.ncsl.org/documents/health/NJAFPHandout52013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many physicians lack the awareness of or training in cultural competence. With the constantly changing [[demographic]]s, their patients are increasingly getting diverse as well. It is utterly important to educate physicians to be culturally competent so that they can effectively treat patients of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. 

Implicit bias aimed towards certain races or ethnicities is frequent in the healthcare field, specifically in the United States, commonly with Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and American Indians&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302903|title=Implicit Racial/Ethnic Bias Among Health Care Professionals and Its Influence on Health Care Outcomes: A Systematic Review|last=Hall, Chapman, et al.|first=|date=November 6, 2015|website=American Public Health Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Subconscious discrimination occurs regardless of the advancement of disease prevention in the United States, as shown by the significantly high mortality rates of the groups mentioned earlier in the paragraph&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This discrimination is shaped by attitudes of healthcare professionals, who often differ in effort and type of treatment based on the race and physical appearance of a patient. Carrying over to the diagnosis and treatment of minority patients, the disparities in quality of healthcare increase the likelihood of developing diseases such as asthma, HIV/AIDs and other life-threatening diseases&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. For example, a study that focused on the treatment and diagnosis differences between black women and white women in regards to breast cancer indicated this discrimination against minorities and its effects&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt, Whitman, Hurlbert|first=|date=March 2014|title=Increasing Black: White disparities in breast cancer mortality in the 50 largest cities in the United States|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877782113001513/1-s2.0-S1877782113001513-main.pdf?_tid=4224b31c-57f1-4040-b9d4-1a5dd67b475a&amp;acdnat=1539583937_26652ad07c2cd98be15e03c429be0f25|journal=The International Journal of Cancer Epidemiology, Detection, and Prevention|volume=|pages=|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, the study indicated that "white women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, [and] Black women are more likely to die from it."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  

The differences in responses from healthcare professionals to black patients versus white patients is drastic, indicated by subconscious negative perceptions of various races.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blair, Steiner, et al.|first=|date=January 2013|title=Clinicians' Implicit Ethnic/Racial Bias and Perceptions of Care Among Black and Latino Patients|url=https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S1544170913600086|journal=ClinicalKey|volume=11|pages=43-52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study that evaluated physicians' immediate assumptions made about different races "two-thirds of the clinicians subconsciously formed a bias against Blacks (43% moderate to strong) and Latinos (51% moderate to strong)".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Without intentionally concocting stereotypes about patients, these clinicians are indirectly negatively affecting the patients they mistreat. To remedy this, the study expresses support for clinicians to form a stronger connection with each patient and to focus on the patient at hand, rather than considering their race or background. This will help to prevent negative attitudes and tones when speaking with patients, creating a positive atmosphere that allows for equal environments and treatments for all patients, regardless of race or physical appearance&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.  

In response to the increasingly diverse population, several states ([[Washington (state)|WA]], [[California|CA]], [[Connecticut|CT]], [[New Jersey|NJ]], [[New Mexico|NM]]) have passed legislation requiring or strongly recommending cultural competency training for physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLAS Legislation Map|url=https://www.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov/Content/LegislatingCLAS.asp|website=Think Cultural Health|publisher=Office of Minority Health|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, New Jersey legislature enacted a law requiring all physicians to complete at least 6 hours of training in cultural competency as a condition for renewal of their New Jersey [[medical license]], whether or not they actively practice in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NJ Cultural Competency|url=http://www.state.nj.us/lps/ca/bme/press/cultural.htm|website=Office of Attorney General|publisher=New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians' responses to this CME requirement varied, both positively and negatively. But the overall feedback was positive towards the outcomes of participation in and satisfaction with the programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Like|first1=Robert C.|title=Educating clinicians about cultural competence and disparities in health and health care|journal=Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions|date=23 Sep 2011|volume=31|issue=3|pages=196–206|doi=10.1002/chp.20127}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to provide culturally competent care for their diverse patients, physicians should at the first step understand that patients' cultures can influence profoundly how they define health and illness, how they seek health care, and what constitutes appropriate treatment. They should also realize that their clinical care process could also be influenced by their own personal and professional experiences as well as biomedical culture.&lt;ref name="like1"/&gt; Dr. Like pointed out in one of his articles that "in transforming systems, transcultural nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals need to remember that cultural humility and cultural competence must go hand in hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Like|first1=Robert C.|title=Culturally Competent Managed Health Care: A Family Physician’s Perspective|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=October 1999|volume=10|issue=4|pages=288–289|doi=10.1177/104365969901000403}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Cultural competence in research is the ability of researchers and research staff to provide high quality research that takes into account the culture and diversity of a population when developing research ideas, design, and methodology. Cultural competence can be crucial for ensuring that the [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] is representative of the population and therefore application to a diverse number of people.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2001). ''Mental health: Culture, race, and ethnicity-A supplement to Mental health: A report of the Surgeon General''. Rockville, MD: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Mental Health Service.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that a study's subject enrollment reflect as closely as possible the target population of those affected by the health problem being studied.

In 1994, the National Institutes of Health established policy (Public Law 103-43) for the inclusion of women, children, and members of minority groups and their subpopulations in biomedical and behavioral clinical studies.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2010). ''Human Subjects Protection and Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children Guidelines for Review of NIH Grant Applications''. p. 1. Retrieved 11 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Overcoming challenges to cultural competence in research also means that [[institutional review board]] membership should include representatives of large communities and cultural groups as representatives.

===Medical education===
The critical importance of training medical students to be future culturally competent physicians has been recognized by accrediting bodies such as the [[Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education]]&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Jacques H. Ambrose, Susan Y. Lin, and Maria B. J. Chun (2013) ''Cultural Competency Training Requirements in Graduate Medical Education''. Journal of Graduate Medical Education: June 2013, Vol. 5, No. 2, pp. 227-231.&lt;/ref&gt; (ACGME) and the [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME) and other medical organizations such as [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM).

Culture is definitely beyond ethnicity and race. Healthcare professionals need to learn about the tolerance of other's beliefs. Professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with the caretaker's personal beliefs. Discovering one's own beliefs and their origin (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and moderates actions at times when others are cared for with different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.

According to the LCME standard for cultural competence, "the faculty and students must demonstrate an understanding of the manner in which people of diverse culture and belief systems perceive health and illness and respond to various symptoms, diseases, and treatments."&lt;ref&gt;Liaison Committee on Medical Education. ''Functions and structure of a medical school: standards for accreditation of medical education programs leading to the M.D. degree.'' Washington, D.C.: Association of American Medical Colleges; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the mandates, medical schools in the U.S. have incorporated teaching cultural competency in their curricula. A search on cultural competency in the curriculum of a medical school revealed that it was covered in 33 events in 13 courses in spring 2014. A similar search was performed on health disparities yielding 16 events in 10 courses covering the topic.

The cultural competence curriculum is intended to improve the interaction between patients and physicians and to assure that students will possess the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that enable them to provide high quality and culturally competent care to patients and their families as well as the general medical community.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). ''Cultural competence education for medical students''. Washington, DC: AAMC; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "visual intervention" was completed to educate healthcare professionals on the dangers of subconscious discrimination toward minority groups in order to lessen the common discrimination certain races or ethnicities face in a healthcare setting&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lightfoot, Chapman, Colby, et al.|first=|date=February 2015|title=Envisioning Health: A Trans-disciplinary, Community-Engaged Visual Intervention for Healthcare Providers on Implicit Bias Toward Latino/ a Immigrant Youth|url=https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00609-0/abstract|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This study allowed for physicians to focus more on the problems of their patients, and truly listening to their issues&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. By creating a supportive space that fosters a strong channel of communication, the study targeted the lack of connection between healthcare professionals and patients due to either language barriers or the patient's mistrust in the professional&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

===Patient education===
[[Doctor–patient relationship|Patient-Physician communication]] involves two sides. While physicians and other healthcare providers are being encouraged or required to be culturally competent in delivery of quality healthcare, it would be reasonable to encourage patients as well to be culturally sensitive and be aware that not all health care providers are equally competent in cultures. When it comes to illness, cultural beliefs and values affect greatly a patient's behavior in seeking healthcare. They should try their best to communicate their concerns relating to their beliefs, values and other cultural factors that might affect care and treatment to their physicians and other healthcare providers. If effective communication is unlikely achieved, then they should be provided with language assistance and interpretation services. Recognizing that patients receive the best care when they work in partnership with doctors, the [[General Medical Council]] issued guidance for patients "What to expect from your doctor: a guide for patients" in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/patients.asp |title=What to expect from your doctor: a guide for patients |publisher=[[General Medical Council]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/21839.asp |title=Press release: GMC publishes first guide for patients on what to expect from their doctor |publisher=General Medical Council |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228095906/http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/21839.asp |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to cultural competence==

===Language barriers===
[[Linguistic competence]] involves communicating effectively with diverse populations, including individuals with [[limited English proficiency]] (LEP), low [[literacy|literacy skill]]s or are not literate, disabilities, and individuals with any degree of [[hearing loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goode|first1=Tawara D.|last2=Jones|first2=Wendy|title=Definition of Linguistic Competence|url=http://nccc.georgetown.edu/documents/Definition%20of%20Linguistic%20Competence.pdf|website=National Center for Cultural Competence|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Census in 2011, 25.3 million people are considered limited English proficient, accounting for 9% of the U.S. population. Hospitals frequently admit LEP patients for treatment. With cultural and linguistic barriers, it is not surprising that it is hard to achieve effective communication between the health care providers and the LEP patients.

In order to improve communication and mutual understanding, health care systems have used the professionally trained interpreters to help [[health care provider]]s to communicate with patients whose English proficiency is limited. Studies have shown that trained professional interpreters or bilingual health care professionals have a positive effect on LEP patients' satisfaction, their quality of care, and outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Flores G. The impact of medical interpreter services on the quality of health care: a systematic review. ''Medical care research and review : MCRR''. Jun 2005;62(3):255-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) Standards in Health and Health Care developed by the [[Office of Minority Health]] (OMH) are intended to advance health equity, improve quality and help eliminate health care disparities.&lt;ref&gt;The Office of Minority Health (OMH). ''National Standards on Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS)'' - 2013; http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&amp;lvlID=15. Accessed July 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The three themes of the fifteen CLAS standards areGovernance, Leadership, and workforce; Communication and Language Assistance; and Engagement, Continuous Improvement, and Accountability. The standards clearly emphasized that the top levels of an organizational leadership hold the responsibility for CLAS implementation,  and that language assistance should be provided when needed, and quality improvement, community engagement, and evaluation are importance.&lt;ref&gt;Koh HK, Gracia JN, Alvarez ME. Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services–advancing health with CLAS. "The New England Journal of Medicine". Jul 17 2014;371(3):198-201.&lt;/ref&gt; that is a very good resource for healthcare systems and organizations to follow to become culturally and linguistically competent in the delivery of health care.

A '''cure''' is a substance or procedure that ends a medical condition, such as a [[medication]], a [[surgery|surgical operation]], a change in lifestyle or even a philosophical mindset that helps end a person's sufferings; or the state of being healed, or cured.

A '''remission''' is a temporary end to the [[medical sign]]s and [[symptom]]s of an incurable disease. Remissions can be of any length, from days to decades (depending on the disease). A [[disease]] is said to be '''incurable''' if there is always a chance of the patient [[relapsing]], no matter how long the patient has been in remission. An incurable disease may or may not be a [[terminal illness]]; conversely, a curable illness can still result in the patient's death.   

The proportion of people with a disease that are cured by a given treatment, called the '''cure fraction''' or '''cure rate''', is determined by comparing [[disease-free survival]] of treated people against a matched control group that never had the disease.&lt;ref name="isbn0-89838-555-5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fuller, Arlan F. |author2=Griffiths, C. M. |title=Gynecologic oncology |publisher=M. Nijhoff |location=The Hague |year=1983 |pages= |isbn=0-89838-555-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of determining the cure fraction and/or "cure time" is by measuring when the hazard rate in a diseased group of individuals returns to the hazard rate measured in the general population.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Estimating and modeling the cure fraction in population-based cancer survival analysis | vauthors=Lambert PC, Thompson JR, Weston CL, Dickman PW | journal=Biostatistics | year=2007 | volume=8 | issue=3 | pages=576–594 | doi=10.1093/biostatistics/kxl030| pmid=17021277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smoll 2012" /&gt;

Inherent in the idea of a cure is the permanent end to the specific instance of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nearing a Cancer Cure?
|publisher=Harvard Health Commentaries.  
|date=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/your_body/medical_care/curable.html What's the Difference Between a Treatment and a Cure?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413132723/http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/your_body/medical_care/curable.html |date=2008-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person has the [[common cold]], and then recovers from it, the person is said to be ''cured'', even though the person might someday catch another cold. Conversely, a person that has successfully managed a disease, such as [[diabetes mellitus]], so that it produces no undesirable symptoms for the moment, but without actually permanently ending it, is not cured.

Related concepts, whose meaning can differ, include ''response'', ''remission'' and ''recovery''.

== Statistical model ==
In complex diseases, such as cancer, researchers rely on statistical comparisons of [[disease-free survival]] (DFS) of patients against matched, healthy control groups.  This logically rigorous approach essentially equates '''indefinite remission''' with cure.&lt;ref name="pmid18083680"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barnes E |title=Between remission and cure: patients, practitioners and the transformation of leukaemia in the late twentieth century |journal=Chronic Illn |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=253–64 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18083680 |doi=10.1177/1742395307085333 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison is usually made through the [[Kaplan-Meier estimator]] approach.&lt;ref name="isbn0-471-41137-X"&gt;{{cite book |author=Friis, Robert H. |author2=Chernick, Michael L. |title=Introductory biostatistics for the health sciences: modern applications including bootstrap |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |location=New York |year=2003 |pages=348–349 |isbn=0-471-41137-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest '''cure rate model''' was published by Berkson and Gage in 1952.&lt;ref name="isbn0-471-41137-X" /&gt;  In this model, the survival at any given time is equal to those that are cured plus those that are not cured, but who have not yet died or, in the case of diseases that feature asymptomatic remissions, have not yet re-developed signs and symptoms of the disease.  When all of the non-cured people have died or re-developed the disease, only the permanently cured members of the population will remain, and the DFS curve will be perfectly flat.  The earliest point in time that the curve goes flat is the point at which all remaining disease-free survivors are declared to be permanently cured.  If the curve never goes flat, then the disease is formally considered '''incurable''' (with the existing treatments).

The Berkson and Gage equation is  
&lt;math&gt;S(t) = p + [(1 -p) \times S^*(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of people surviving at any given point in time, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion that are permanently cured, and &lt;math&gt;S^*(t)&lt;/math&gt; is an exponential curve that represents the survival of the non-cured people.

Cure rate curves can be determined through an analysis of the data.&lt;ref name="isbn0-471-41137-X" /&gt; The analysis allows the statistician to determine the proportion of people that are permanently cured by a given treatment, and also how long after treatment it is necessary to wait before declaring an asymptomatic individual to be cured.&lt;ref name="smoll 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Cure Fraction of Glioblastoma Multiforme | vauthors=Smoll NR, Schaller K, Gautschi OP | journal=Neuroepidemiology | year=2012 | issue=1 | doi=10.1159/000339319 | pmid=22776797 | volume=39 | pages=63–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cure rate models exist, such as the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]] and [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] model.&lt;ref name="isbn0-471-41137-X" /&gt; It is possible to use cure rate models to compare the efficacy of different treatments.&lt;ref name="isbn0-471-41137-X" /&gt; Generally, the [[survival curve]]s are adjusted for the effects of normal aging on mortality, especially when diseases of older people are being studied.&lt;ref name="isbn0-632-05531-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tobias, Jeffrey M. |author2=Souhami, Robert L. |title=Cancer and its management |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2003 |pages=11 |isbn=0-632-05531-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of the patient, particularly one that has received a new treatment, the statistical model may be frustrating.&lt;ref name="pmid18083680" /&gt;  It may take many years to accumulate sufficient information to determine the point at which the DFS curve flattens (and therefore no more relapses are expected).  Some diseases may be discovered to be technically incurable, but also to require treatment so infrequently as to be not materially different from a cure.  Other diseases may prove to have a multiple plateaus, so that what was once hailed as a "cure" results unexpectedly in very late relapses.  Consequently, patients, parents and psychologists developed the notion of '''psychological cure''', or the moment at which the patient decides that the treatment was sufficiently likely to be a cure as to be called a cure.&lt;ref name="pmid18083680" /&gt;  For example, a patient may declare himself to be "cured", and to determine to live his life as if the cure were definitely confirmed, immediately after treatment.

== Similar concepts ==
=== Remission ===  &lt;!-- target for redirect --&gt;
'''Remission''' is the state of absence of [[disease]] activity in patients known to have a [[chronic illness]] that cannot be cured.  It is commonly used to refer to absence of active [[cancer]] or [[inflammatory bowel disease]] when these diseases are expected to manifest again in the future. A '''partial remission''' may be defined for cancer as 50% or greater reduction in the measurable parameters of tumor growth as may be found on physical examination, radiologic study, or by biomarker levels from a blood or urine test. A '''complete remission''' is defined as complete disappearance of all such manifestations of disease. Each disease or even [[clinical trial]] can have its own definition of a partial remission.

===Others===
* A '''response''' is a partial reduction in symptoms after treatment.
* A '''recovery''' is a restoration of health or functioning.  A person who has been cured may not be fully recovered, and a person who has recovered may not be cured, as in the case of a person in a temporary remission or who is an asymptomatic carrier for an infectious disease.
* '''[[Preventive medicine|Prevention]]''' is a way to avoid an injury, sickness, disability, or disease in the first place, and generally it will not help someone who is already ill (though there are exceptions).  For instance, many babies and young children are vaccinated against [[polio]] and other [[infectious diseases]], which prevents them from contracting polio. But the vaccination does not work on patients who already have polio. A treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started. 
* '''[[Therapy]]''' treats a problem, and may or may not lead to its cure.  In incurable conditions, a treatment ameliorates the medical condition, often only for as long as the treatment is continued or for a short while after treatment is ended.  For example, there is no cure for AIDS, but treatments are available to slow down the harm done by HIV and extend the treated person's life.  Treatments don't always work.  For example, [[chemotherapy]] is a treatment for cancer, but it may not work for every patient.  In easily cured forms of cancer, such as childhood leukemias, testicular cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma, cure rates may approach 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dana-farber.org/abo/news/publications/pop/fall-winter-2008/what-is-a-cure_3.html What is a Cure?]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other forms, treatment may be essentially impossible.  A treatment need not be successful in 100% of patients to be considered curative.  A given treatment may permanently cure only a small number of patients; so long as those patients are cured, the treatment is considered curative.

== Examples ==
The most common example of a complete cure is a [[bacterial infection]] treated with [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dana-farber.org/abo/news/publications/pop/fall-winter-2008/what-is-a-cure_2.html What Is a cure?]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[World Health Organization]] established a goal to cure 85% of [[tuberculosis]] patients in [[Russia]]. They reached an 80% success rate, with 75% of the diseased cured, and 5% that had otherwise successfully finished treatment.

Another temple dedicated to Derzelas was built at [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]] - a [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|Greek colony]] on the shore of the [[Black Sea]] in the third century BC.

[[Darzalas Peak]] on [[Trinity Peninsula]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after the god.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/ SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ug2CfC7m?url=http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/ |date=2010-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=not specified|date=June 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7127">'''Dustiness''' is the tendency of [[particle]]s to become airborne in response to a mechanical or [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] stimulus.  Dustiness is affected by the particle shape, size, and inherent electrostatic forces.  Dustiness increases the risk of inhalation exposure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-147/|title=General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=5–10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dusty materials tend to generate [[aerosol]]s with high particle concentrations measured in number or in mass. The tendency of powdered materials to release airborne particles under external energies indicates their dustiness level.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Douglas E.|last2=Turkevich|first2=Leonid A.|last3=Roettgers|first3=Cynthia T.|last4=Deye|first4=Gregory J.|last5=Baron|first5=Paul A.|date=2013-03-01|year=|title=Dustiness of Fine and Nanoscale Powders|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/20041674.html|journal=The Annals of Occupational Hygiene|language=en|volume=57|issue=2|pages=261–277|doi=10.1093/annhyg/mes060|issn=0003-4878|pmc=3750099|pmid=23065675|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dusty level of powders directly affects [[Occupational dust exposure|worker exposure scenarios]] and associated health risks in occupational settings. Powder-based aerosol particles can pose advert effects when deposited in human respiratory systems via inhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9781483256719 |title=Pulmonary Deposition and Retention of Inhaled Aerosols |authors=Theodore F. Hatch, Paul Gross and George D. Clayton |isbn=978-1-4832-5671-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
A significant motivation for quantifying and measuring the dustiness of materials comes from the area of [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]]. The potential health impacts of suspended particles, particularly by inhalation, can be significant.

== Dustiness testing ==
The amount of dust produced during handling or processing of a powder can be affected by the nature of the handling process, the ambient humidity, the particle size and water content of the powder, and other factors. To measure dustiness of a particular powder in a replicable way, standardized testing procedures have been created and published. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== European Committee for Standardization - Continuous Drop and Rotating Drum ===
Various laboratory systems have been developed to test dustiness of fine powders. A European standard on dustiness testing has been established by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) since April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=GÖRAN |last=LIDÉN |title=Dustiness Testing of Materials Handled at Workplaces |journal=Ann Occup Hyg |year=2006 |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=437–439 |doi=10.1093/annhyg/mel042}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard is especially related to human exposure in workplace (EN 15051). It describes two methods: the rotating drum system and continuous drop system, both of which use gravity to stimulate the material and generate aerosols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Schneider T., Jensen KA |title=Combined single-drop and rotating drum dustiness test of fine to nanosize powders using a small drum |journal=Ann Occup Hyg |year=2008 |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=23–34 |doi=10.1093/annhyg/mem059|pmid=18056087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;The rotating drum method involves placing the powder in a cylinder containing baffles, while the continuous drop system involves allowing a stream of powder to fall onto a surface. While the drum approach has been successfully scaled down by some researchers, published standards call for tens or hundreds of grams of material, a stipulation that can prove problematic for nanomaterials, pharmaceuticals and other expensive powders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Aerosol generation system ===
Recently, an aerosol generation system based on laboratory funnel (resembling a fluidized bed) has been developed, which has the potential to become an alternative or supplementary method to the existing systems in dustiness testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Yaobo Ding, Michael Riediker |title=A system to assess the stability of airborne nanoparticle agglomerates under aerodynamic shear |journal=Journal of Aerosol Science |volume=88 |year=2015 |pages=98–108 |doi=10.1016/j.jaerosci.2015.06.001|bibcode=2015JAerS..88...98D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Yaobo Ding, Michael Riediker |title=A System to Create Stable Nanoparticle Aerosols from Nanopowders |journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments (JoVE) |volume=113 |issue=113 |year=2016 |pages=e54414 |doi=10.3791/54414|pmc=5091692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its performance was compared to other three aerosolization systems using the same test materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Yaobo Ding, Burkhard Stahlmecke, Araceli Sánchez Jiménez, Ilse L. Tuinman, Heinz Kaminski, Thomas A. J.

==Nanomaterials dustiness==
The dustiness of the [[nanomaterials]] can influence potential exposures and the selection of the appropriate engineering control during the manufacturing production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Electrostatic forces influence the stability of particle dispersion in air and effect the dustiness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Nanomaterials in dry powder form tend to pose the greatest risk for inhalation exposure, while nanomaterials suspended in a liquid typically present less risk via inhalation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Safety measures ===
The full life cycle of a nanomaterial should be considered when planning to control for dust exposure. Nanomaterial synthesis reactors, nanoparticle collection and handling, product fabrication with nanomaterials, product use, and product disposal are potential sources of dust exposure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] recommends the use of [[HEPA|high-efficiency particulate air]] (HEPA) filters on local exhaust ventilation, laboratory chemical hoods, lowflow enclosures, and any other containment enclosures as a best practice during the handling of engineered nanomaterials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5273">'''Efrat''' is an [[Israel]]i [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] group which tries to convince Jewish women not to undergo [[abortion]]s. To this end, the organization distributes explanatory materials and offers economic aid to pregnant women considering abortion.

The name "Efrat" comes from [[Books of Chronicles|I Chronicles]], in which Efrat is the name of [[Caleb]]'s wife (according to Jewish tradition, she is none other than [[Miriam]]). The [[Midrash Rabbah]] writes, "Why was she called Efrat? Because Israel was fruitful ("''paru''") and multiplied through her." This refers to her actions against [[Pharaoh#Pharaohs in the Bible|Pharaoh]]'s decree of infanticide, by which she saved the lives of many Israelite children.

Efrat's explanatory materials demonstrate the fetus' qualities of life during the different stages of pregnancy, with the goal of showing that the [[fetus]] is a human life. Additionally, the organization presents the medical dangers resulting from abortion, stories of women who had an abortion and later regretted it, and stories of women who planned to have an abortion but ultimately did not.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, the organization has concentrated on providing financial support to pregnant women who plan on having an abortion due to their economic situation.

The organization's approach is illustrated by the following, quoted from Efrat's website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is an abortion? Abortion means ending the life of child who is not sufficiently developed to survive outside its mother’s womb.

Although the vast majority of abortions are performed on socio-economic grounds, an abortion does not resolve financial or social difficulties. Very often, the psychological scars caused by an abortion only serve to complicate existing problems. Sometimes, it takes women a lifetime to resolve these issues.

Economic and social problems can be worked out. Situations can - and do - change. But a life can never be restored.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The organization's main offices are located in [[Jerusalem]], and is led by Dr. Eli J. Schussheim, and, according to the organization's website, has 2,800 volunteers working on the streets in Israel.

According to the publications by the organization, in 2006 it prevented the abortion of about 2,600 unborn children, and, in total, has prevented about 25,000 abortions as of 2007.

== Criticism ==
[[File:Efrat banner.JPG|thumb|right|230px|A banner of Efrat, 2012. The text: "Eventually, birth will determine our  existence as a Jewish state"]]
Various bodies, among them Mishpacha Hadasha ("New Family"), have attacked the organization. The central complaint is that the religious stance of the organization supports the protection of the pregnancy at almost any price and can make both mother and child miserable, such as in cases of teen pregnancies, or pregnancies that involve medical danger.

A law proposed by  [[Knesset]] Member Reshef Chayne of [[Shinui]] attempted to prevent Efrat from providing information to women considering abortion, on the basis he considered it harassment of the pregnant woman. The law was not passed, and certain legalists attacked it.

Another criticism was that the organization would station women outside offices where abortion permits are issued, with the aim of appealing to women visiting the offices. The [[Israel Religious Action Center]] appealed against the rules which regulate the pay grade of those who volunteer for [[Sherut Leumi|National Service]] by participating in Efrat's activities, claiming "infringement of privacy, dignity and freedom of conscience of the women," an appeal which was dismissed by the [[Supreme Court of Israel]].

In 2012, Efrat "ambassadors" were criticized for encouraging a pregnant teen not to have an abortion, because the teen couple later attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/161187#.UIpgPUbfSAg&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Efrat claims that a stance opposing abortion is legitimate, and that in many cases, going through with an abortion will later make the woman miserable. Additionally, the organization claims that it does not coerce women to not perform an abortion, and only provides information. It also wants to ensure that women are not forced into abortions out of economic concerns.

'''Elisabeth Schwarzhaupt''' (7 January 1901, [[Frankfurt am Main]] – 30 October 1986) was a German politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]].  She was [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]] in the [[Cabinet of Germany|German Cabinet]] from 1961 to 1966, the first woman to hold a [[Minister (government)|Minister]]ial position in Germany.

==Biography==
Schwarzhaupt was the daughter of an [[upper school]] principal who belonged to the [[German People's Party of Prussia]]. Her mother came from a wealthy merchant family. She was engaged to a Jewish doctor who fled to [[Switzerland]] and then the [[United States]] because of [[Nazi]] persecution.

After finishing school in 1920 Schwarzhaupt studied law in [[Frankfurt am Main]].  In 1930 she received her [[doctorate]] in law. She was a legal adviser on women's issues until 1932 when she worked as a ''Beauftragter Richter'' ("Mandated Judge") in [[Dortmund]] and Frankfurt am Main. She was dismissed in March 1933 in the wake of a judicial decree that women should no longer hold judicial office.
[[Image:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016393-0032, Bonn, Schwarzhaupt empfängt Ministerin aus Ägypten.jpg|thumb|left|Elisabeth Schwarzhaupt&lt;br/&gt; (right) in 1963 with the Egyptian Minister of Social Affairs [[Hikmat Abu Zayd]]]]
From 1935 she worked as a legal assistant at the Registry of the Evangelical Church in Berlin.  In 1947 she returned to [[Frankfurt am Main]], promoted by 1953 to ''Oberkirchenrätin'' ("Senior Church Adviser") and ''Geschäftsführerin der Evangelischen Frauenarbeit'' ("Director of Evangelical Women's Work").

On 10 December 1965 she was the first woman to be awarded the ''Großkreuz des Bundesverdienstkreuzes'' (loosely, "Grand Cross of the German [[Federal Cross of Merit]]").  From 1970 to 1972 she was the First Chairman of the [[German Women's Council]].  She was buried in the main cemetery in [[Frankfurt]].

During the [[Weimar Republic]] Elisabeth Schwarzhaupt was a member of the [[German People's Party]] .She belonged to the Christian Democratic Union from 1945 until her death.

==Offices and achievements==
From 1953 to 1969 she was a member of the German [[Bundestag]].  From 1957 to 1961 she was Deputy Chairman of the CDU/CSU Parliamentary Group.  Unlike most women in the party, she was vehemently opposed to a ruling called the "Stitch" ruling (pertaining to the rights of the husband in marital disputes).  Together with [[Margot Kalinke]] she orchestrated support for an opposition amendment to her own party's bill.  The ''Gesetz über die Gleichstellung von Mann und Frau auf dem Gebiet des bürgerlichen Rechts'' ("Law of Equality between Man and Wife in Civil Law") was enacted on 18 June 1957 without the Stitch Clause. In 1997 the German government issued a postage stamp with her image.

'''Ethylene oxide''', called '''oxirane''' by [[IUPAC]], is an [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] {{chem|C|2|H|4|O}}. It is a cyclic [[ether]] and the simplest [[epoxide]]: a three-membered ring consisting of one oxygen atom and two carbon atoms. Ethylene oxide is a colorless and flammable gas with a faintly sweet odor.  Because it is a [[strained ring]], ethylene oxide easily participates in a number of [[addition reaction]]s that result in ring-opening. Ethylene oxide is [[isomer]]ic with [[acetaldehyde]] and with [[vinyl alcohol]]. Ethylene oxide is industrially produced by [[oxidation]] of [[ethylene]] in the presence of [[silver]] [[catalyst]].

The reactivity that is responsible for many of ethylene oxide's hazards also make it useful. Although too dangerous for direct household use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals and intermediates. These products include detergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such as [[ethylene glycol]], ethanolamines, simple and complex glycols, [[polyglycol ether]]s, and other compounds. Although it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the manufacture of products like [[polysorbate 20]] and [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) that are often more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide itself is a very hazardous substance. At room temperature it is a flammable, [[carcinogenic]], [[mutagenicity|mutagenic]], irritating, and [[anaesthetic]] gas.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

As a toxic gas that leaves no residue on items it contacts, ethylene oxide is a surface [[disinfectant]] that is widely used in hospitals and the medical equipment industry to [[Sterilization (microbiology)#Ethylene oxide|replace steam in the sterilization]] of heat-sensitive tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJy5wdzi0yUC&amp;pg=PA309|page=309|title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design|volume=20|author1=McKetta, John J.  |author2=Cunningham, William A. |publisher=CRC Press|year=1984|isbn=0-8247-2470-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is so flammable and extremely explosive that it is used as a main component of [[thermobaric weapon]]s;&lt;ref name=e1/&gt;&lt;ref name=e2/&gt; therefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid to control its hazardous nature.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Rebsdat, Siegfried and Mayer, Dieter (2005) "Ethylene Oxide" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry''.

==History==
Ethylene oxide was first reported in 1859 by the [[France|French]] chemist [[Charles-Adolphe Wurtz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wurtz, A.|journal= Comptes rendus|volume= 48|pages= 101–105 |year=1859| title= Sur l'oxyde d'éthylène| url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30054/f101.image}}&lt;/ref&gt; who prepared it by treating [[2-chloroethanol]] with [[potassium hydroxide]]:

:Cl–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–OH + KOH → (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + KCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Wurtz measured the [[boiling point]] of ethylene oxide as {{Convert|13.5|C|}}, slightly higher than the present value, and discovered the ability of ethylene oxide to react with acids and salts of metals.&lt;ref name="oe1"&gt;{{cite book

This misconception persisted until 1896 when [[Georg Bredig]] found that ethylene oxide is not an [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref name="oe1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bredig, G.|author2= Usoff, A. |year=1896|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0cPmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA116 |title=Ist Acetylen ein Elektrolyt?|trans-title=Is acetylene an electrolyte?|journal=Zeitschrift für Elektrochemie|volume=3|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; That it differed from other [[ether]]s — particularly by its propensity to engage in addition reactions, which are typical of unsaturated compounds — had long been a matter of debate. The heterocyclic triangular structure of ethylene oxide was proposed by 1868 or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Freiherr von Gorup-Besanez|Eugen F. von Gorup-Besanez]], ed., ''Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie für den Unterricht auf Universitäten'' … [Textbook of Organic Chemistry for Instruction at Universities … ], 3rd ed.

==Chemical properties==
Ethylene oxide readily reacts with diverse compounds with opening of the ring. Its typical reactions are with nucleophiles which proceed via the '''[[Nucleophilic substitution|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2]]''' mechanism both in acidic (weak nucleophiles: water, alcohols) and alkaline media (strong nucleophiles: OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, RO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, RR'NH, etc.).&lt;ref name="traven" /&gt; The general reaction scheme is

: [[File:Ethylene oxide reactions.png|400px|Ethylene oxide reactions]]

and more specific reactions are described below.

===Addition of water and alcohols===
Aqueous solutions of ethylene oxide are rather stable and can exist for a long time without any noticeable chemical reaction, but adding a small amount of acid, such as strongly diluted [[sulfuric acid]], immediately leads to the formation of [[ethylene glycol]], even at room temperature:

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–OH

The reaction also occurs in the gas phase, in the presence of a [[phosphoric acid]] salt as a catalyst.&lt;ref name="oe3"&gt;{{cite book

| pages = 90–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction is usually carried out at about {{Convert|60|C|}} with a large excess of water, in order to prevent the reaction of the formed ethylene glycol with ethylene oxide that would form [[diethylene glycol|di-]] and [[triethylene glycol]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:2 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–O–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–OH

:3 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–O–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–O–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–OH

The use of alkaline catalysts may lead to the formation of [[polyethylene glycol]]:

:n (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HO–(–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–O–)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;–H

Reactions with [[alcohol]]s proceed similarly yielding ethylene glycol ethers:

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

:2 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–O–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

Reactions with lower alcohols occur less actively than with water and require more severe conditions, such as heating to {{Convert|160|C|}} and pressurizing to {{Convert|3|MPa||abbr=on}} and adding an acid or alkali catalyst.

Reactions of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols proceed in the presence of [[sodium]] metal, [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[boron trifluoride]] and are used for the synthesis of [[surfactants]].&lt;ref name="oe3" /&gt;

===Addition of carboxylic acids and their derivatives===
Reactions of ethylene oxide with [[carboxylic acid]]s in the presence of a catalyst results in glycol mono- and diesters:

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H → HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The addition of acid [[amide]]s proceeds similarly:
: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHC(O)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Addition of ethylene oxide to higher carboxylic acids is carried out at elevated temperatures (typically {{Convert|140-180|C|}}) and pressure ({{Convert|0.3-0.5|MPa||abbr=on}}) in an inert atmosphere, in presence of an alkaline catalyst (concentration 0.01–2%), such as hydroxide or carbonate of sodium or potassium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

:RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H → RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

===Adding ammonia and amines===
Ethylene oxide reacts with [[ammonia]] forming a mixture of mono-, di- and tri- [[ethanolamine]]s. The reaction is stimulated by adding a small amount of water.

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:2 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → (HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH

:3 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → (HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N

Similarly proceed the reactions with primary and secondary amines:

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–NHR

Dialkylamino ethanols can further react with ethylene oxide, forming amino polyethylene glycols:&lt;ref name="ect" /&gt;

:n (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH → R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O–(–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O–)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;–H

Trimethylamine reacts with ethylene oxide in the presence of water, forming [[choline]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Aromatic primary and secondary amines also react with ethylene oxide, forming the corresponding arylamino alcohols.

===Halide addition===
Ethylene oxide readily reacts with aqueous solutions of [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]], [[hydrobromic acid|hydrobromic]] and [[hydroiodic acid]]s to form [[halohydrin]]s. The reaction occurs easier with the last two acids:

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + HCl → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Cl

The reaction with these acids competes with the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene oxide; therefore, there is always a by-product of ethylene glycol with an admixture of diethylene glycol. For a cleaner product, the reaction is conducted in the gas phase or in an organic solvent.

Ethylene fluorohydrin is obtained differently, by boiling [[hydrogen fluoride]] with a 5–6% solution of ethylene oxide in [[diethyl ether]]. The ether normally has a water content of 1.5–2%; in absence of water, ethylene oxide polymerizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 0-8053-8790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halohydrins can also be obtained by passing ethylene oxide through aqueous solutions of metal halides:&lt;ref name="oe3" /&gt;

:2 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Cl + Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↓

===Metalorganic addition===
Interaction of ethylene oxide with organomagnesium compounds, which are [[Grignard reaction|Grignard reagents]], can be regarded as [[nucleophilic substitution]] influenced by [[carbanion]] organometallic compounds. The final product of the reaction is a primary alcohol:

: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + RMgBr -&gt; R-CH2CH2-OMgBr -&gt;[\ce{H2O}]
\overset{primary~alcohol}{R-CH2CH2-OH}&lt;/chem&gt;

Similar mechanism is valid for other organometallic compounds, such as alkyl lithium:

: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + \overset{alkyl~lithium}{RLi} -&gt; R-CH2CH2-OLi -&gt;[\ce{H2O}] R-CH2CH2-OH&lt;/chem&gt;

===Other addition reactions===

====Addition of hydrogen cyanide====
Ethylene oxide easily reacts with the [[hydrogen cyanide]] forming ethylene cyanohydrin:

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + HCN → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–CN

A slightly chilled (10–20&amp;nbsp;°C) aqueous solution of [[calcium cyanide]] can be used instead of HCN:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth

:2 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + Ca(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–CN + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Ethylene cyanohydrin easily loses water, producing [[acrylonitrile]]:

:HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–CN → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH–CN + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

====Addition of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans====
When reacting with the [[hydrogen sulfide]], ethylene oxide forms 2-mercaptoethanol and thiodiglycol, and with alkylmercaptans it produces 2-alkyl mercaptoetanol:

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–HS

:2 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → (HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + RHS → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–SR

The excess of ethylene oxide with an aqueous solution of hydrogen sulfide leads to the tris-(hydroxyethyl) sulfonyl hydroxide:

:3 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → [(HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

====Addition of nitrous and nitric acids====
Reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous solutions of [[barium nitrite]], [[calcium nitrite]], [[magnesium nitrite]], [[zinc nitrite]] or [[sodium nitrite]] leads to the formation of [[2-nitroethanol]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth

====Synthesis of crown ethers====

===Isomerization===
When heated to about {{Convert|400|C||sigfig=2}}, or to {{Convert|150–300|C||sigfig=2}} in the presence of a catalyst ([[aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[phosphoric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], etc.), ethylene oxide  [[isomerization|isomerizes]] into [[acetaldehyde]]:&lt;ref name="petrov"&gt;{{cite book

{{NumBlk|:| CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO* + M → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO + M*|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

In reaction ({{EquationNote|3}}), '''M''' refers to the wall of the reaction vessel or to a heterogeneous catalyst.
The moiety CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO* represents a short-lived (lifetime of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8.5&lt;/sup&gt; seconds), activated molecule of acetaldehyde. Its excess energy is about 355.6 kJ/mol, which exceeds by 29.3 kJ/mol the [[binding energy]] of the C-C bond in acetaldehyde.&lt;ref name="benson" /&gt;

In absence of a catalyst, the thermal isomerization of ethylene oxide is never selective and apart from acetaldehyde yields significant amount of by-products (see section [[Ethylene oxide#Thermal decomposition|Thermal decomposition]]).&lt;ref name="oe2"/&gt;

===Reduction reaction===
Ethylene oxide can be hydrogenated into ethanol in the presence of a catalyst, such as [[nickel]], [[platinum]], [[palladium]],&lt;ref name="oe2" /&gt; [[borane]]s, [[lithium aluminium hydride]] and some other [[hydride]]s.&lt;ref name="reduction"&gt;{{cite book

Conversely, with some other catalysts, ethylene oxide may be ''reduced'' by hydrogen to ethylene with the yield up to 70%. The reduction catalysts include mixtures of zinc dust and [[acetic acid]], of lithium aluminium hydride with [[titanium trichloride]] (the reducing agent is actually [[Titanium(II) chloride|titanium dichloride]], formed by the reaction between LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and TiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and of [[iron(III) chloride]] with [[butyllithium]] in [[tetrahydrofuran]].&lt;ref name="reduction" /&gt;

===Oxidation===
Ethylene oxide can further be oxidized, depending on the conditions, to [[glycolic acid]] or [[carbon dioxide]]:

: &lt;chem&gt;(CH2CH2)O{} + O2 -&gt;[\ce{AgNO3}] \overset{glycolic\ acid}{HOCH2CO2H}&lt;/chem&gt;

===Dimerization===
In the presence of acid catalysts, ethylene oxide dimerizes to afford [[dioxane]]:

The reaction mechanism is as follows:&lt;ref name="oe2" /&gt;

: [[File:Dioxan-HerstellungCZ.png|650px|Mechanism of dimerization]]

The dimerization reaction is unselective.  By-products include [[acetaldehyde]] (due to [[Ethylene oxide#Isomerization|isomerization]]). The selectivity and speed of dimerization can be increased by adding a catalyst, such as platinum, platinum-palladium, or [[iodine]] with [[sulfolane]].  2-methyl-1,3-[[dioxolane]] is formed as a side product in the last case.&lt;ref&gt;Stapp, Paul R. (21 December 1976) {{US Patent|3998848}} "Cyclodimerization of ethylene oxide"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymerization===

:MX&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; + ROH → MX&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;RO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

The resulting active complex reacts with ethylene oxide via the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' mechanism:

[[Anionic polymerization]] of ethylene oxide is assisted by bases, such as [[alkoxide]]s, [[hydroxide]]s, [[carbonate]]s or other compounds of alkali or [[alkaline earth metal]]s.&lt;ref name="glycol" /&gt; The reaction mechanism is as follows:&lt;ref name="poly" /&gt;

===Thermal decomposition===
Ethylene oxide is relatively stable to heating – in the absence of a catalyst, it does not dissociate up to {{Convert|300|C|}}, and only above {{Convert|570|C|}} there is a major [[exothermic]] decomposition, which proceeds through the radical mechanism.&lt;ref name="oe2"&gt;{{cite book

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O → •CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O• → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

When carrying the thermal decomposition of ethylene oxide in the presence of transition metal compounds as catalysts, it is possible not only to reduce its temperature, but also to have [[Ethyl group|ethyl]] as the main product, that is to reverse the ethylene oxide synthesis reaction.

==Laboratory synthesis==

===Dehydrochlorination of ethylene and its derivatives===
Dehydrochlorination of [[2-chloroethanol]], developed by Wurtz back in 1859, remains a common laboratory route to ethylene oxide:

:Cl–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–OH + NaOH → (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The reaction is carried out at elevated temperature, and beside [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], [[calcium hydroxide]], [[barium hydroxide]], [[magnesium hydroxide]] or [[carbonate]]s of alkali or alkaline earth metals can be used.&lt;ref name="oe5"&gt;{{cite book

===Direct oxidation of ethylene by peroxy acids===
Ethylene can be directly oxidized into ethylene oxide using [[peroxy acid]]s, for example, [[peroxybenzoic acid|peroxybenzoic]] or ''meta''-chloro-peroxybenzoic acid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Industrial synthesis==

===History===
Commercial production of ethylene oxide dates back to 1914 when [[BASF]] built the first factory which used the chlorohydrin process (reaction of ethylene chlorohydrin with calcium hydroxide). The chlorohydrin process was unattractive for several reasons, including low efficiency and loss of valuable chlorine into [[calcium chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The production of ethylene oxide accounts for approximately 11% of worldwide ethylene demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/ethylene/ Market Study: Ethylene]. Ceresana.com (December 2010). Retrieved on 2017-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chlorohydrin process of production of ethylene oxide===
Although the chlorohydrin process is almost entirely superseded in the industry by the direct oxidation of ethylene, the knowledge of this method is still important for educational reasons and because it is still used in the production of [[propylene oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Those steps are carried continuously. In the first column, hypochlorination of ethylene is carried out as follows:&lt;ref name="uk"&gt;{{cite book

:Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HOCl + HCl

:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HOCl → OH–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Cl

:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Cl–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Cl

To suppress the conversion of ethylene into the [[ethylene dichloride]] (the last reaction), the concentration of ethylene is maintained at about 4–6%, and the solution is heated by steam to the boiling point.&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt;

Next, aqueous solution of ethylene chlorohydrin enters the second column, where it reacts with a 30% solution of calcium hydroxide at {{Convert|100|C|}}:&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt;

:2 OH–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Cl + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The produced ethylene oxide is purified by [[rectified spirit|rectification]]. The chlorohydrin process allows to reach 95% conversion of ethylene chlorohydrin. The yield of ethylene oxide is about 80% of the theoretical value; for {{Convert|1|t|}} of ethylene oxide, about {{Convert|200|kg||abbr=on}} of ethylene dichloride is produced.&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt; But, the major drawbacks of this process are high chlorine consumption and effluent load. This process is now obsolete.

===Direct oxidation of ethylene===

====Usage in global industry====
Direct oxidation of ethylene was patented by Lefort in 1931. This method was repeatedly modified for industrial use, and at least four major variations are known. They all use oxidation by oxygen or air and a silver-based catalyst, but differ in the technological details and hardware implementations.&lt;ref name="eos"&gt;{{cite book

A similar production method was developed by Scientific Design Co., but it received wider use because of the licensing system – it accounts for 25% of the world's production and for 75% of world's licensed production of ethylene oxide.&lt;ref name = "cmpa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scidesign.com/Business/EO%20-%20EG%20Process/EO_EG_Process.htm |title=Ethylene Oxide/Ethylene Glycol Process |work=Process Licensing and Engineering |publisher=Scientific Design Company |accessdate=3 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716014802/http://www.scidesign.com/Business/EO%20-%20EG%20Process/EO_EG_Process.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A proprietary variation of this method is used by Japan Catalytic Chemical Co., which adapted synthesis of both ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol in a single industrial complex.

A different modification was developed Shell International Chemicals BV. Their method is rather flexible with regard to the specific requirements of specific industries; it is characterized by high selectivity with respect to the ethylene oxide product and long lifetime of the catalyst (3 years). It accounts for about 40% of global production.&lt;ref name="cmpa" /&gt;

Older factories typically use air for oxidation whereas newer plants and processes, such as METEOR and Japan Catalytic, favor oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Chemistry and kinetics of the direct oxidation process====
Formally, the direct oxidation process is expressed by the following equation:

: &lt;chem&gt;2CH_2=CH2 + O2 -&gt;[\ce{Ag}] 2(CH2CH2)O&lt;/chem&gt;, ΔH = −105 kJ/mol

However, significant yield of carbon dioxide and water is observed in practice, which can be explained by the complete oxidation of ethylene or ethylene oxide:

: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O,     ΔH = −1327{{nbsp}}kJ/mol
: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + 2.5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, ΔH = −1223{{nbsp}}kJ/mol

Here (ads) refers to particles adsorbed on the catalyst surface and (adj) to particles of silver, directly adjacent to the oxygen atoms. In this process, 1,2-dichloroethane, vinyl chloride are used as inhibitors so as to prevent further oxidation of ethylene oxide to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Here, the chemisorbed chlorine hinders dissociative chemisorption of atomic oxygen.

Thus the overall reaction is expressed as

:7 CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 6 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

and the maximum degree of conversion of ethylene to ethylene oxide is 6/7 or 85.7%.&lt;ref name="kilty" /&gt;

The catalyst for the reaction is metallic silver deposited on various matrixes, including [[pumice]], [[silica gel]], various [[silicate]]s and [[aluminosilicate]]s, [[alumina]] and [[silicon carbide]], and activated by certain additives ([[antimony]], [[bismuth]], [[barium peroxide]], etc.).&lt;ref name = "lebedev"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process temperature was optimized as {{Convert|220–280|C||sigfig=2}}. Lower temperatures reduce the activity of the catalyst, and higher temperatures promote the complete oxidation of ethylene thereby reducing the yield of ethylene oxide. Elevated pressure of {{Convert|1-3|MPa||abbr=on}} increases the productivity of the catalyst and facilitates absorption of ethylene oxide from the reacting gases.&lt;ref name="lebedev" /&gt;

Whereas oxidation by air is still being used, oxygen (&gt; 95% purity) is preferred for several reasons, such as higher molar yield of ethylene oxide (75–82% for oxygen vs. 63–75% for air), higher reaction rate (no gas dilution) and no need of separating nitrogen in the reaction products.&lt;ref name="ect" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Process overview ==
The production of ethylene oxide on a commercial scale is attained with the unification of the following [[Unit operations|unit processes]]:
* Main reactor
* Ethylene oxide [[scrubber]]
* Ethylene oxide de-sorber
* [[Stripping (chemistry)|Stripping]] and [[distillation column]]
* CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scrubber and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; de-scrubber

'''Main Reactor:''' The main reactor consists of thousands of catalyst tubes in bundles. These tubes are generally {{Convert|6|to|15|m|abbr=on|round=5}} long with an inner diameter of {{Convert|20|to|50|mm|abbr=on|1}}. The catalyst packed in these tubes is in the form of spheres or rings of diameter {{Convert|3|to|10|mm|abbr=on}}. The operating conditions of {{Convert|200-300|C||sigfig=2}} with a pressure of {{Convert|1-3|MPa||abbr=on}} prevail in the reactor. To maintain this temperature, the cooling system of the reactor plays a vital role. With the aging of the catalyst, its selectivity decreases and it produces more exothermic side products of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Ethylene oxide scrubber:''' After the gaseous stream from the main reactor, containing ethylene oxide (1–2%) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (5%), is cooled, it is then passed to the ethylene oxide scrubber. Here, water is used as the scrubbing media which scrubs away majority of ethylene oxide along with some amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and [[aldehydes]] (introduced by the recycle stream). Also, a small proportion of the gas leaving the ethylene oxide scrubber (0.1–0.2%) is removed continuously (combusted) to prevent the buildup of inert compounds (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Ar, and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which are introduced as impurities with the reactants.

'''Ethylene oxide de-sorber:''' The aqueous stream resulting from the above scrubbing process is then sent to the ethylene oxide de-sorber. Here, ethylene oxide is obtained as the overhead product, whereas the bottom product obtained is known as the ''glycol bleed''. When ethylene oxide is scrubbed from the recycle gas with an aqueous solution, ethylene glycols (viz. mono-ethylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol and other poly-ethylene glycols) get unavoidably produced. Thus, in-order to prevent them from building up in the system, they are continuously bled off.

Stripping and distillation column: Here, the ethylene oxide stream is stripped off its low boiling components and then distilled in-order to separate it into water and ethylene oxide.

'''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scrubber:''' The recycle stream obtained from the ethylene oxide scrubber is compressed and a side-stream is fed to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scrubber. Here, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gets dissolved into the hot aqueous solution of potassium carbonate (i.e., the scrubbing media). The dissolution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not only a physical phenomenon, but a chemical phenomenon as well, for, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with potassium carbonate to produce potassium hydrogen carbonate.

: K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

'''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; de-scrubber:''' The above potassium carbonate solution (enriched with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is then sent to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; de-scrubber where CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is de-scrubbed by stepwise (usually two steps) flashing. The first step is done to remove the hydrocarbon gases, and the second step is employed to strip off CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Applications==
[[File:Eo-usesEN.png|thumb|350px|Global industrial use of ethylene oxide in 2007.&lt;ref name="iars" /&gt;]]

Ethylene oxide is one of the most important raw materials used in  large-scale chemical production. Most ethylene oxide is used for synthesis of [[ethylene glycol]]s, including diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol, that accounts for up to 75% of global consumption. Other important products include ethylene glycol ethers, ethanolamines and ethoxylates. Among glycols, ethylene glycol is used as [[antifreeze]], in the production of [[polyester]] and [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET – raw material for plastic bottles), liquid coolants and solvents.

Polyethyleneglycols are used in perfumes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, [[lubricant]]s, [[paint thinner]]s and [[plasticizer]]s. Ethylene glycol ethers are part of brake fluids, detergents, solvents, lacquers and paints. Other products of ethylene oxide. Ethanolamines are used in the manufacture of soap and detergents and for purification of natural gas. Ethoxylates are reaction products of ethylene oxide with higher alcohols, acids or amines. They are used in the manufacture of detergents, surfactants, [[emulsifier]]s and [[dispersant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shell.com/home/content/chemicals/products_services/our_products/ethylene_oxide_glycols/ethylene_glycols/product_overview/ |title=Ethylene oxide product overview |work=Ethylene oxide |publisher=Shell Chemicals |accessdate=8 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121211063906/http://www.shell.com/home/content/chemicals/products_services/our_products/ethylene_oxide_glycols/ethylene_glycols/product_overview/ |archivedate=11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas synthesis of ethylene glycols is the major application of ethylene oxide, its percentage varies greatly depending on the region: from 44% in the [[Western Europe]], 63% in [[Japan]] and 73% in [[North America]] to 90% in the rest of [[Asia]] and 99% in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Production of ethylene glycol ===
Ethylene glycol is industrially produced by non-catalytic hydration of ethylene oxide at a temperature of {{Convert|200|C|}} and a pressure of {{Convert|1.5-2|MPa||abbr=on}}:&lt;ref name="MEG"&gt;{{cite book

By-products of the reaction are diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and polyglycols with the total of about 10%, which are separated from the ethylene glycol by distillation at reduced pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another synthesis method is the reaction of ethylene oxide and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (temperature {{Convert|80–120|C|}} and pressure of {{Convert|5.2|MPa||abbr=on}}) yielding [[ethylene carbonate]] and its subsequent hydrolysis with decarboxylation:&lt;ref name = "MEG" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shell OMEGA technology (Only Mono-Ethylene Glycol Advantage) is a two-step synthesis of ethylene carbonate using a [[phosphonium]] halide as a catalyst. The glycol yield is 99–99.5%, with other glycols practically absent. The main advantage of the process is production of pure ethylene glycol without the need for further purification. The first commercial plant which uses this method was opened in 2008 in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090514033943/http://www.shell.com/home/content/chemicals/innovation/leading_edge_technology/omega_delivers_ethylene_glycol/omega_delivers_ethylene_glycol.html OMEGA delivers for ethylene glycol makers], Shell (October 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Dow METEOR (Most Effective Technology for Ethylene Oxide Reactions) is an integrated technology for producing ethylene oxide and its subsequent hydrolysis into ethylene glycol. The glycol yield is 90–93%. The main advantage of the process is relative simplicity, using fewer stages and less equipment.

Conversion to ethylene glycol is also the means by which waste ethylene oxide is scrubbed before venting to the environment. Typically the EtO is passed over a matrix containing either sulfuric acid or potassium permanganate.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

=== Production of glycol ethers ===
The major industrial esters of mono-, di- and triethylene glycols are methyl, ethyl and normal butyl ethers, as well as their acetates and phthalates. The synthesis involves reaction of the appropriate [[alcohol]] with ethylene oxide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The reaction of monoesters with an acid or its anhydride leads to the formation of the esters:

:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H + HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OR → ROCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCOCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

=== Production of ethanolamines ===
In the industry, [[ethanolamine]]s (mono-, di- and triethanolamines) are produced by reacting [[ammonia]] and ethylene oxide in anhydrous medium at a temperature of {{Convert|40-70|C||-1}} and pressure of {{Convert|1.5-3.5|MPa||abbr=on}}{{nbsp}}MPa:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

All three ethanolamines are produced in the process, while ammonia and part of methylamine are recycled. The final products are separated by vacuum [[distillation]]. Hydroxyalkylamines are produced in a similar process:

Monosubstituted products are formed by reacting a large excess of amine with ethylene oxide in presence of water and at a temperature below {{Convert|100|C|}}. Disubstituted products are obtained with a small excess of ethylene oxide, at a temperature of {{Convert|120–140|C||-1}} and a pressure of {{Convert|0.3-0.5|MPa||abbr=on|round=5}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;!-- [[File:Alkoxylation process.png|thumb|left|550px|Schematic image of the production ethoxylates &lt;ref name="buss" /&gt;]] --&gt;
Industrial production of ethoxylates is realized by a direct reaction of higher alcohols, acids or amines with ethylene oxide in the presence of an alkaline catalyst at a temperature of {{Convert|120–180|C||-1}}.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on a three-stage continuous process. In the first stage, the initiator or catalyst of the reaction and the feedstock are fed into the container, where they are mixed, heated and vacuum dried. Then reaction is carried out in a special insulated reactor in an inert atmosphere (nitrogen) to prevent a possible explosion of ethylene oxide. Finally, the reaction mixture is neutralized, degassed and purified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buss-ct.com/e/reaction_technology/alkoxylation.php?navid=36 |title=Alkoxylation |work=BUSS LOOP Reactor |publisher=Buss ChemTech AG |accessdate=21 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308161412/http://www.buss-ct.com/e/reaction_technology/alkoxylation.php?navid=36 |archivedate=8 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production of acrylonitrile ===
Currently, most [[acrylonitrile]] (90% in 2008) is produced by the SOHIO method, which is based on the catalytic oxidation of [[propylene]] in the presence of ammonia and bismuth phosphomolybdate. However, until 1960 a key production process was addition of [[hydrogen cyanide]] to ethylene oxide, followed by dehydration of the resulting [[cyanohydrin]]:&lt;ref name="ACS Landmarks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/acrylonitrile/index.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223214113/http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/acrylonitrile/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=The Sohio Acrylonitrile Process |work=National Historic Chemical Landmarks |publisher=American Chemical Society |accessdate=25 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===
Ethylene oxide is used as an accelerator of maturation of tobacco leaves and [[fungicide]].&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; Ethylene oxide is also used as a main component of [[thermobaric weapon]]s (fuel-air explosives).&lt;ref name=e1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=PA136|page=136|title=Weapons of mass destruction: an encyclopedia of worldwide policy, technology, and history, Volume 2|author1=Croddy, Eric  |author2=Wirtz, James J. |isbn=1-85109-490-3|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATiYCfo1VcEC&amp;pg=PA142|page=142|title=Explosives|author1=Meyer, Rudolf |author2=Köhler, Josef |author3=Homburg, Axel |publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2007|isbn=3-527-31656-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Periam B.; Gay, Lewis L. and Husler, Edward L.

Ethylene is used in the synthesis in [[2-butoxyethanol]], which is a solvent used in many products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Toxicological Profile for 2-Butoxyethanol and 2-butoxyethanol acetate|date=August 1998|publisher=US Dept of Health and Human Services|author=Harris O.|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification of ethylene oxide==
[[Gas chromatography]] is the principal method for analysis and detection of ethylene oxide.&lt;ref name="iars" /&gt;

An inexpensive test for ethylene oxide exploits its precipitation of solid hydroxides of metals when it is passed through aqueous solutions of their salts:

:2 (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Cl + Mn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↓

Similarly, ethylene oxide is detected by the bright pink color of the indicator when passing air through aqueous solutions of some salts of sodium or potassium (chlorides, iodides, thiosulfates, etc.) with the addition of [[phenolphthalein]]:&lt;ref name="oe4"&gt;{{cite book

: (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O + NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HO–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Cl + NaOH

Other methods of ethylene oxide detection are&lt;ref name="oe4" /&gt; color reactions with [[pyridine]] derivatives and hydrolysis of ethylene glycol with [[periodic acid]]. The produced [[iodic acid]] is detected with [[silver nitrate]].

==Fire and explosion hazards==
Ethylene oxide is extremely flammable, and its mixtures with air are explosive. When heated it may rapidly expand, causing fire and explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safework.ru/ilo/ICSC/cards/view/?0155 |title=Ethylene oxide |work=ICSC/International Chemical Safety Cards |publisher=Institute of Industrial Safety, Labour Protection and Social Partnership |accessdate=21 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228201427/http://www.safework.ru/ilo/ICSC/cards/view/?0155 |archivedate=28 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of industrial accidents have been attributed to ethylene oxide explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov/csb-issues-final-report-in-2004-explosion-at-sterigenics-international-facility-in-ontario-california-notes-lack-of-engineering-controls-understanding-of-process-hazards/|title=CSB Issues Final Report in 2004 Explosion at Sterigenics International Facility in Ontario, California: Notes Lack of Engineering Controls, Understanding of Process Hazards - Investigations - News - CSB |author= |date= |website=www.csb.gov |accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov/videos/ethylene-oxide-explosion-at-sterigenics/|title=Ethylene Oxide Explosion at Sterigenics - Safety Videos - Multimedia - CSB |author=|date= |website=www.csb.gov |accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=105522072|title=OSHA Inspection Detail |author= |date= |website=www.osha.gov |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fires caused by ethylene oxide are extinguished by traditional media, including [[Fire retardant foam|foam]], carbon dioxide or water. Suppression of this activity can be done by blanketing with an [[inert gas]] until total pressure reaches non explosive range. Extinguishing of burning ethylene oxide is complicated by that it can continue burning in an inert atmosphere and in water solutions. Fire suppression is reached only upon dilution with water above 22:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Results of human epidemiological studies on workers exposed to ethylene oxide differ. There is evidence from both human and animal studies that inhalation exposure to ethylene oxide can result in a wide range of carcinogenic effects.

Ethylene oxide is toxic by inhalation, with a US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] permissible exposure limit calculated as a TWA (time weighted average) over 8 hours of 1{{nbsp}}ppm, and a short term exposure limit (excursion limit) calculated as a TWA over 15 minutes of 5{{nbsp}}ppm.&lt;ref name="msds"/&gt;  At concentrations in the air about 200 parts per million, ethylene oxide irritates [[mucous membrane]]s of the nose and throat; higher contents cause damage to the trachea and bronchi, progressing into the partial collapse of the lungs.

Because the odor threshold for ethylene oxide varies between 250 and 700 ppm, the gas is already at toxic concentrations when it can be smelled. Even then, the odor of ethylene oxide is sweet, aromatic, and can easily be mistaken for the pleasant aroma of [[diethyl ether]], a common laboratory solvent of very low toxicity.

'''Food presentation''' is the art of modifying, processing, arranging, or decorating [[food]] to enhance its [[aesthetic]] appeal.

The visual presentation of foods is often considered by [[chef]]s at many different stages of [[food preparation]], from the manner of tying or sewing meats, to the type of cut used in chopping and slicing meats or vegetables, to the style of [[mold (cooking implement)|mold]] used in a poured dish. The food itself may be decorated as in elaborately [[Cake decorating|iced cakes]], topped with ornamental [[Sugar sculpture|sometimes sculptural]] consumables, drizzled with [[sauces]], sprinkled with [[seeds]], powders, or other toppings, or it may be accompanied by edible or inedible [[Garnish (food)|garnishes]].

Historically, the presentation of food has been used as a show of wealth and power. Such displays often emphasize the complexity of a dish's composition as opposed to its flavors. For instance, ancient sources recall the hosts of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] banquets adding precious metals and minerals to food in order to enhance its aesthetic appeal. Additionally, [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] aristocrats hosted feasts involving sculptural dishes and shows of live animals. These banquets existed to show the culture and affluence of its host, and were therefore tied to social class. Contemporary food aesthetics reflect the autonomy of the chef, such as in [[nouvelle cuisine]] and Japanese bento boxes. Dishes often involve both simplistic and complex designs. Some schools of thought, like French nouvelle cuisine, emphasize minimalism while others create complicated compositions based on modern aesthetic principles.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gastronomica|last=McBride|first=Ann|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=38–46|quote=|jstor=10.1525/gfc.2010.10.1.38|doi=10.1525/gfc.2010.10.1.38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the presentation of food reflects societal trends and beliefs.

==Plating==
The arrangement and overall styling of food upon bringing it to the plate is termed plating.&lt;ref name="Book"/&gt; Some common styles of plating include a 'classic' arrangement of the main item in the front of the plate with vegetables or starches in the back, a 'stacked' arrangement of the various items, or the main item leaning or 'shingled' upon a vegetable bed or side item.&lt;ref name="Banquet"/&gt; Item location on the plate is often referenced as for the face of a clock, with six o'clock the position closest to the diner. A basic rule of thumb upon plating, and even in some cases prepping, is to make sure you have the 5 components to a dish; protein, traditionally at a 6 o'clock position, vegetable, at a 2 o'clock position, starch at an 11 o'clock position, sauce and garnish.

==History==

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:Scène de banquet, fresque, Herculanum.jpg|thumb|Roman banquet scene from Herculanum, Italy]]
Banquets were important social events, usually hosted in private residences for friends and clients. The Romans placed great focus on the appearance of their dining room ([[triclinium]]), decorating it with [[mural]]s and [[mosaic]]s, as well as lavish [[sculpture]]s and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NAGY|first=HELEN|date=2005-01-01|title=Review of The Roman Banquet: Images of Conviviality|jstor=41587315|journal=Vergilius (1959-)|volume=51|pages=131–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall purpose of a private banquet was entertainment, not only through live performances, but also through the presentation of the food itself. The meal consisted of three courses- [[appetizers]], main course, and [[dessert]]- brought out in elaborate rituals.&lt;ref name="Banquet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raff|first1=Katharine|title=The Roman Banquet Essay Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/banq/hd_banq.htm|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the main course was sometimes served to the tune of trumpets at particularly luxurious events. Foods that were particularly valued were [[Game (hunting)|wild game]], such as [[pheasant]] and [[Wild boar|boar]], certain kinds of fish, and wild [[Berry|berries]], mainly because of their exoticism and high price. Some ancient writers recount Emperor [[Claudius]] adding crushed pearls to wine and flecks of gold to peas solely to increase their cost. Others recall live animals being served as shows of entertainment and richness. For instance, at one event [[Mackerel as food|mackerels]] were pickled live in order to showcase their silvery bodies thrashing in vinegar. Overall, Roman aristocrats desired to showcase their wealth and luxury through the presentation of food.&lt;ref name="The Fine Art of Food"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leith|first1=Prue|title=The Fine Art of Food|date=1987|publisher=Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, vol. 135, no. 5373|pages=687–698|jstor=41374374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
Medieval aristocrats also desired to entertain and impress through food. [[Banquet]]s were usually huge feasts with diverse choices of dishes. Social etiquette dictated that the wealthy and powerful be given beautiful and elaborate dishes while the poor be given simple food, usually scraps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thoughts for Food, I: French Cuisine and French Culture|last=Clark|first=Priscilla P.|publisher=American Association of Teachers of French|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such banquets not only entertained guests, but also showed the wealth of the host. In particular, the patron sometimes commissioned artists to create complicated sculptures made from food items to awe and inspire.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bermingham|first1=Ann|title=Food Masquerade|date=2010|publisher=Gastronomica, vol. 10, no. 2|pages=9–12|jstor=10.1525/gfc.2010.10.2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular sculpture was a pregnant woman modeled in [[marzipan]] or [[sugar paste]]. Other favorites were pies or cakes designed to expel live birds when cut open and multicolored jellies stacked together, dyed with [[spice]]s and vegetable matter.  Furthermore, since these foods often were not preserved properly and were somewhat rotted when stored, the stench of decaying food was covered with spices and other aromas. This indicates the medieval hosts concern with presentation as opposed to flavor.&lt;ref name="The Fine Art of Food"/&gt;

==Contemporary==
{{see also|Cake decorating}}
In the same way, contemporary food reflects both personal and societal aesthetic beliefs. While cuisine in the past was intrinsically related to wealth and social status, contemporary cuisine is much less distinguished by class. The disintegration of highbrow and lowbrow foods has led to increased accessibility of various foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Josée|last2=Baumann|first2=Shyon|date=2007-01-01|title=Democracy versus Distinction: A Study of Omnivorousness in Gourmet Food Writing|jstor=518923|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=113|issue=1|pages=165–204|doi=10.1086/518923|citeseerx=10.1.1.217.5091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, it is possible to find a hamburger at a five star restaurants and exotic cuisines on street corners. Therefore, contemporary food presentation is determined much more by modern aesthetics and creativity than displays of wealth and power.

===France===
Nouvelle cuisine is a school of French cooking that rejects ostentatious displays of food in favor of simple presentation and high-quality ingredients. In contrast to historical chefs that obeyed the orders of patrons, this manner of cooking elevates the chef from a skilled worker to an inventor and artist. The aesthetic of nouvelle cuisine emphasizes [[minimalism]], serving fewer courses and utilizing simple plating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Market Rebels: How Activists Make or Break Radical Innovations, The French Revolution: Collective Action and the Nouvelle Cuisine Innovation|last=Rao|first=Hayagreeva|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=69–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chefs were extremely creative in constructing innovative recipes and plating.

===Japan===
[[File:Imitation duck bento box (4113208447).jpg|thumb|Example of a bento box]]

==== Bento Box ====
A bento box is a Japanese meal traditionally consisting of rice, meat/fish, and vegetables served in a portable box. In [[Japan]], as well as in the [[United States]], a large focus is placed on the aesthetic arrangement of the food. There have even been contests to see who can come up with the most inventive way of creating bento boxes, allowing for creativity in amateur chefs and everyday people. Sometimes bento boxes are used to make sculptural designs, such as rice shaped to look like animals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These specific types of bento boxes are known as '''[[Kyaraben]]''' or '''charaben''', ''(''キャラ弁'')'' a shortened form of '''character bento'''. ''(''キャラクター弁当 ''kyarakutā bentō)'' Kyaraben are most often made by mothers to encourage their children to eat more nutritious diets and as a way of showing their love and dedication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/14/foodanddrink/japan-food-snap-power-of-cute-oped/index.html|title=The ultimate act of love? The truth behind Japan's charaben culture|last=Dale|first=Joshua Paul|website=CNN|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kaiseki ====
[[Kaiseki]] (懐石) is a Japanese multi-course [[haute cuisine]] dinner consisting of 7-14 courses, often served at [[Ryokan (inn)|''ryokan'']], but also in small restaurants known as ''[[ryōtei]]'', particularly in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/japan/travel-tips-and-articles/68913|title=Kaiseki-ryōri: Japanese haute cuisine|last=Yanagihara|first=Wendy|date=August 2010|website=Lonely Planet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large focus of kaiseki is in the elaborate preparation and aesthetic presentation of these meals to enhance the natural flavors of fresh, local ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/foodanddrink/guide-to-kaiseki-cuisine/index.html|title=Kyoto cuisine: A beginner's guide to kaiseki|last=CNN|first=Elaine Yu and Amanda Sealy|website=CNN|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meals are often garnished with edible leaves and flowers to enhance the seasonality of the meal and its ingredients and are arranged to resemble natural plants and animals.

Kaiseki dinners most commonly involve an appetizer, sashimi, a simmered dish, a grilled dish, and a steamed dish. Other dishes may be added or omitted depending on the chef.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kitchen-theory.com/kaisekidining/|title=Kaiseki – The Art of Japanese Dining|last=Youssef|first=Jozef|date=January 10, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science ===
Modern science can illuminate how and why people respond in certain ways to food plating and presentation. According to a [[Sociology|sociological]] study, people react differently to various aesthetic principles such as [[color]], [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (including a number of components, placement of components, and use of negative space), [[design]], and the organization of a plate. They found that participants responded best to plates with four different colors, three different components, some empty space, and with a disorganized and casual design. This research is particularly important because understanding how food presentation affects how people eat can be used in the study of [[health]] and [[nutrition]]. For instance, another study showed that participants who ate off of uncleaned tables (i.e. all uneaten food was left on the table) ate less than those that had their tabled periodically cleaned. This is presumably because those that could see the leftovers of what they had eaten were less likely to take more food. This could be useful, for instance, in combatting the [[obesity]] endemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zampollo|first=Francesca|last2=Wansink|first2=Brian|last3=Kniffin|first3=Kevin M.|last4=Shimizu|first4=Mitsuru|last5=Omori|first5=Aki|date=2012-02-01|title=Looks Good Enough to Eat How Food Plating Preferences Differ Across Cultures and Continents|url=http://ccr.sagepub.com/content/46/1/31|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=31–49|doi=10.1177/1069397111418428|issn=1069-3971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of science in food aesthetics is the development of molecular food in [[Spain]], which emphasizes the essence of food using scientific elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albala|first1=Ken|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia, Volume 4|date=May 2011|publisher=Greenwood|page=335|url=http://publisher.abc-clio.com/9780313376276/1502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular science can break down the roles of carbohydrates and protein in order to isolate what creates particular tastes. For instance, modern science makes it possible to freeze ice cream using liquid nitrogen and create wine using sugars, creating efficient and visually interesting new dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nhn.ou.edu/~johnson/Education/SeeS_SZ/Chemistry_of_Cooking/Supplemental/2004_Sciam-KitchenPhysics.pdf|title=Chemistry and Physics in the Kitchen|last=Nicholas Kurti and Herve This-Benckhard|first=|date=1994|work=Scientific American|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trends and fads===
{{see also|2010s in food}}
Like other aspects of culture, food presentation is subject to trends and [[fad]]s. For instance, "unicorn food", a style of presentation that uses a [[rainbow]] color palette to decorate food, became popular in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manrepeller.com/2017/04/starbucks-unicorn-frappuccino.html|title=Unicorn Food is the New Millennial Obsession - Man Repeller|date=2017-04-18|work=Man Repeller|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SBUX"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39641432|title=Starbucks joins 'unicorn food' craze with new drink|date=2017-04-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/style/unicorn-food-starbucks.html|title=‘Unicorn Food’ Is Colorful, Sparkly and Everywhere|last=Stack|first=Liam|date=2017-04-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-19|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pastel-like hues are supposed to represent the colors of the mythical [[unicorn]].&lt;ref name="SBUX" /&gt;

'''Grosse Isle''' ({{lang-fr|Grosse Île}}, "big island"), is located in [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] in [[Quebec]], Canada. It is one of the islands of the 21-island Isle-aux-Grues [[archipelago]]. It is part of the municipality of [[Saint-Antoine-de-l'Isle-aux-Grues]], located in the [[Chaudière-Appalaches]] region of the province.

Also known as '''Grosse Isle and the Irish Memorial National Historic Site''', the island was the site of an immigration depot which predominantly housed Irish immigrants coming to Canada to escape the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], 1845-1849.&lt;ref name="Bruemmer"/&gt; In 1832, the [[Lower Canada|Lower Canadian Government]] had previously set up this depot to contain an earlier [[cholera]] [[epidemic]] that was believed to be caused by the large influx of European immigrants, and the station was reopened in the mid-Nineteenth Century to accommodate Irish migrants who had contracted typhus during their voyages. Thousands of [[Irish Canadians|Irish]] were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848.

It is believed that over 3000&lt;ref name="Parks Canada Website"&gt;A. Charbonneau: [http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/qc/grosseile/natcul/natcul1b_E.asp Parks Canada Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806130736/http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/qc/grosseile/natcul/natcul1b_E.asp |date=2006-08-06 }}, retrieved August 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Irish died on the island and over 5000&lt;ref name="Parks Canada Website"/&gt; are currently buried in the cemetery there; many died en route. Most who died on the island were infected with [[typhus]], which sprang up from the conditions there in 1847. Grosse Isle is the largest burial ground for refugees of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] outside Ireland. After [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867, the buildings and equipment were modernized to meet the standards of the new Canadian government's immigration policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/immigrants/021017-2131.01-e.html Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience] at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; The island is sometimes called Canada's [[Ellis Island]] (1892-1954), an association it shares with [[Pier 21]] immigration facility in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Johnston, "Canada's Ellis Island", ''The Beaver'', February - March 2009, p. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that in total, from when it was set up in 1832 to the closing in 1932, almost 500,000 Irish immigrants passed through Grosse Isle on their way to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/MaguireIrishAmerica8/index.php ''The Irish Exodus to Canada: Grosse Isle, 1847-8'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival==
On arrival at Grosse Isle, emigrant ships were not permitted to sail onwards unless they had assured the authorities that they were free of disease. Those with fever cases on board were required to fly a blue flag.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toronto Star|The Toronto Star]], 2 May 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. George Douglas, Grosse Isle's chief medical officer, recorded that by mid-summer the quarantine regulations in force were 'physically impossible' to carry out, making it necessary for the emigrants to stay on board their ships for many days. Douglas believed that washing and airing out the ships would be enough to stop the contagion spreading between infected passengers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Cecil Woodham-Smith]]: ''The Great Hunger - Ireland 1845-1849'', published by Penguin Books, 1991 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Whyte, pseudonymous author of the ''1847 Famine Ship Diary: The Journey of a [[coffin ship|Coffin Ship]]'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Robert Whyte's ''1847 Famine Ship Diary: The Journey of an Irish Coffin Ship'', published by Mercier Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; described how on arrival at Grosse Isle the Irish emigrant passengers on the ''Ajax'' dressed in their best clothes and helped the crew to clean the ship, expecting to be sent either to hospital or on to Quebec after their long voyage. In fact, the doctor inspected them only briefly and did not return for several days. By mid-summer doctors were examining their charges very perfunctorily, allowing them to walk past and examining the tongues of any who looked feverish. In this way, many people with latent fever were allowed to pass as healthy, only to succumb to their sickness once they had left Grosse Isle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On 28 July 1847, Whyte recorded the neglect of his fellow passengers, who 'within reach of help' 'were to be left enveloped in reeking pestilence, the sick without medicine, medical skill, nourishment, or so much as a drop of pure water'. However, conditions on other Irish emigrant ships were still worse. Two Canadian priests who visited the ''Ajax'' described the holds of other vessels where they had been 'up to their ankles in filth. The wretched emigrants crowded together like cattle and corpses remain[ed] long unburied'. Whyte contrasted this with the condition of German immigrants arriving at Grosse Isle. These were all free of sickness, 'comfortably and neatly clad, clean and happy'. ''[[The Times]]'' also commented on the 'healthy, robust and cheerful' Germans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The exact numbers of those who died at sea is unknown, although Whyte himself estimated it at 5293. During the crossing itself, bodies were thrown into the sea, but once the ships had reached Grosse Isle they were kept in the hold until a burial on land became possible. The dead were dragged out of the holds with hooks and 'stacked like cordwood' on the shore.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;The Great Shame by [[Thomas Keneally]], published by Vintage in 1999&lt;/ref&gt; On July 29, 1847 Whyte described 'a continuous line of boats, each carrying its freight of dead to the burial ground... Some had several corpses so tied up in canvas that the stiff, sharp outline of death was easily traceable'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Even those passengers who escaped typhus and other diseases were weakened by the journey. The Senate Committee of the United States on Sickness and Mortality in Emigrant Ships described the newly disembarked emigrants as 'cadaverous' and 'feeble'. Most had been misled by passage-brokers into believing that they would be provided with food on the ship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Accommodation==
Before the 1847 crisis, invalids were placed in hospitals while the healthy carried out their quarantine periods in sheds. However, in 1847 the island was quickly overwhelmed. Tents were set up to house the influx of people, but many new arrivals were left lying on the ground without shelter. Robert Whyte records seeing 'hundreds... literally flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land as they could'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Anglican Bishop of Montreal, Bishop Mountain, recalled seeing people lying opposite the church screaming for water, while others lay inside the tents without bedding. One child he saw was covered in vermin; another who had 'been walking with some others, sat down for a moment, and died'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many children were orphaned.

Accommodation was found in the sheds, which were filthy and crowded, with patients lying in double tiers of bunks which allowed dirt from the top bunk to fall onto the lower. According to the Senate Committee's report, two or three invalids would be placed together in one berth, irrespective of age or sex. There was no bread: meals consisted of tea, gruel or broth served three times a day.&lt;ref&gt;''The Grosse Île Tragedy'' by J. Jordan, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; As drinking water was carted, there was never enough for the fever patients. One Catholic priest, Father Moylan, reported giving water to invalids in a tent who had not been able to drink for 18 hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Quebec Gazette'', July 23, 1847&lt;/ref&gt; The sheds were not originally intended to house fever patients and had no ventilation; new sheds were built without privies. The Senate Committee stated that because of the lack of personnel and space, the invalids lay in their own excrement for days and there were insufficient staff to take away those who died during the night.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  The hospitals themselves had very little equipment and planks for bedding were not always available, meaning that it was spread on the ground and became soaked.

At Quebec, the French and English speaking Catholic clergy ministered to the discharged emigrants and convalescents brought from the island. Father McMahon, founder of St. Patrick's Church (Quebec City), took a leading part in organizing relief to the sufferers and orphans of that awful period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jorban|first1=S|title=Grosse Isle Tragedy|url=https://archive.org/stream/grosseisletraged00jorduoft/grosseisletraged00jorduoft_djvu.txt|website=Archive.org|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
As well as a shortage of accommodation, there was a serious lack of medical personnel to care for the sick. Dr. Douglas attempted to enlist nurses from among the healthy female passengers with the promise of high wages, but fear of disease meant none accepted. Nurses were expected to sleep alongside the sick and share their food; they had no privacy, often caught the fever themselves and were not helped when they fell ill. Prisoners from the local jail were released to carry out the nursing, but many stole from the dead and the dying.&lt;ref&gt;The Grosse Île Tragedy by J. Jordan, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; All of the medical officers involved became ill at some stage, with four doctors dying of typhus. Under the Passenger Act of 1842, ships were not obliged to carry a doctor, and only two doctors arrived as passengers. One of these was a Dr. Benson from Dublin, a man with experience working in fever hospitals in Ireland. He arrived on May 21, volunteered to help the sick, contracted typhus himself and was dead within six days.

More than forty Irish and French Canadian priests and Anglican clergymen were active on Grosse Isle, many becoming ill themselves. The Chief Pastor, Bishop Power, contracted fever and died after delivering the last sacraments to a dying woman in September. The Mayor of Montreal, [[John Easton Mills]], also died in the course of caring for the sick.&lt;ref&gt;The Voyage of the Naparima by James Magnan, published by Carraig Books in 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of immigrants after Grosse Isle==
{{See also|Goose Village, Montreal#Typhus epidemic|Irish Quebecers}}
[[File:Victoriatown Big Black Rock.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Black Rock, Montreal]]
Many immigrants who passed the perfunctory quarantine checks at Grosse Isle fell sick soon afterwards. Some died in the camp for the 'healthy', tents on the eastern side of Grosse Isle. When a priest, Father O'Reilly, visited this area in August, he gave the last rites to fifty people. In the week leading up to August 18 alone, 88 deaths occurred among the 'healthy'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On June 8, Dr. Douglas warned the authorities of Quebec and Montreal that an epidemic was about to strike. On the previous Sunday between 4,000 and 5,000 'healthy' had left Grosse Isle, of whom Dr. Douglas estimated two thousand would develop fever within three weeks. Thousands were being discharged into Montreal, weak and helpless, some crawling because they could not walk, others 'lying on the wharves, dying'. Immigrants in Quebec were described as 'emaciated objects' huddled 'in the doors of churches, the wharves and the streets, apparently in the last stages of disease and famine'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

From 1847 to 1848, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 Irish died from ship fever in [[fever shed]]s set up at [[Goose Village, Montreal|Windmill Point]] in Montreal. Their remains were discovered in 1859 by workers building the [[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria Bridge]], who erected the Black Rock memorial in their honour.&lt;ref name="Bruemmer"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/Seeking+hope+they+found+death/1645325/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601112744/http://www.montrealgazette.com/Seeking%2Bhope%2Bthey%2Bfound%2Bdeath/1645325/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-06-01 |title=Seeking hope, they found death |last=Bruemmer |first=Rene |date=2009-05-30 |work=Montreal Gazette |publisher=Canwest |accessdate=2009-05-30 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Its inscription reads:

:"To preserve from desecration the remains of 6000 immigrants who died of ship fever A.D.1847-8 this stone is erected by the workmen of Messrs. Peto, Brassey and Betts employed in the construction of the Victoria Bridge A.D.1859."

Other cities, including Kingston and Toronto, were anxious to push immigrants on. Whyte recorded seeing one family sheltering under boards by the side of the road and commented that 'there is no means of learning how many of the survivors of so many ordeals were cut off by the inclemency of a Canadian winter'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

One immigrant who did survive was the grandfather of [[Henry Ford]], founder of the [[Ford Motor Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/schools/4_11/tandy/pdf/background_aut2006.pdf BBC Guide to Irish Emigration]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
A national memorial, the Celtic Cross, was unveiled on site on August 15, 1909. Designed by Jeremiah O'Gallagher, Country President of the Ancient Order of Hibernians at the time, the monument is the largest of its kind in North America. In 1974, the government of Canada declared the island a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|1189|Grosse Île and the Irish Memorial|31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial was erected on the island in 1997.

==Timeline of the 1847 crisis==
{{main article|1847 North American typhus epidemic}}
This timeline has been derived from [[Cecil Woodham-Smith|Cecil Woodham-Smith's]] work ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-1849'', first published by Hamish Hamilton in 1962.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===February===
On February 19, the medical officer in charge of the quarantine station at Grosse Isle, Dr George M. Douglas, requested £3,000 to assist with an expected influx of Irish immigrants. He was granted £300, a small steamer and permission to hire a sailing vessel for not more than £50.

===March===
Quebec citizens petitioned [[Henry George Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]], Secretary of State for the Colonies, to take action in the face of the expected rise in immigration.

===April===
The Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners published their seventh report without any mention of the approaching crisis.

===May===
Chief Emigration Officer Alexander Carlisle Buchanan failed to report concerns to the Canadian government because it was "not within the control of [his] department".

Dr. Douglas, believing 10,600 emigrants had left Britain for Quebec since April 10, requested £150 for a new fever shed. The authorities promised him £135. Preparations were made for 200 invalids.

On May 17 the first vessel, the ''Syria'', arrived with 430 fever cases. This was followed by eight more ships a few days later. Dr Douglas wrote that he had 'not a bed to lay [the invalids] on... I never contemplated the possibility of every vessel arriving with fever as they do now'. One week later seventeen more vessels had appeared at Grosse Isle. By this time, 695 people were already in hospital. Only two days afterwards the number of vessels reached thirty, with 10,000 immigrants now waiting to be processed. By May 29, a total of 36 vessels had arrived. The end of May saw forty ships forming a line two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long down the [[St. Lawrence River]]. According to Dr Douglas, each one was affected by fever and dysentery. 1100 invalids were accommodated in sheds and tents, or laid out in rows in the church.

Due to the lack of space on Grosse Isle, Dr. Douglas required healthy passengers to stay on ship for fifteen days once the sick had been removed, by way of quarantine. Infection flourished on board the ships. One ship, the ''Agnes'', reached Grosse Isle with 427 passengers of whom only 150 survived the quarantine period.

===June===
On June 1, the Catholic archbishop of Quebec contacted all Catholic bishops and archbishops in Ireland, asking them to discourage their diocesans from emigrating. Despite this, of the 109,000 emigrants who had left for British North America, almost all were Irish.

On June 5, 25,000 Irish immigrants were quarantined on Grosse Isle itself or waiting in the ships anchored nearby.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===July===
By mid-summer 2500 invalids were quarantined on Grosse Isle, and the line of waiting ships stretched several miles. At the end of the month, Dr. Douglas abandoned the quarantine regulations because they were 'impossible' to enforce. His new instructions were that the healthy would be released after a cursory check by the doctor.

===October===
Ice blocks the St. Lawrence and immigration ceases.

==1848 to the present==
This information was taken from ''Île of Irish Tears'', an article appearing in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' on 2 May 1992.

'''1862:''' A total of 59 casualties die on the island, 34 from typhus. Medical improvements, the abandonment of slow-sailing ships in favour of steam ships and tougher quarantine regulations helped slow the spread of disease.

'''1870 - 1880:''' Only 42 deaths are reported on Grosse Isle during this decade.

'''1880 - 1932:''' Grosse Isle continues to act as a quarantine station against typhus, [[cholera]], [[beriberi]], [[smallpox]] and [[bubonic plague]].

'''1909:''' [[Ancient Order of Hibernians|The Ancient Order of Hibernians]] in America set up a Celtic cross with inscriptions in Irish, English and French, in memory of those who died during 1847 and 1848.

'''1932:''' Grosse Isle ceases to be a quarantine station. By this time, immigrants are arriving at many different ports and the city hospitals are capable of dealing with them.

'''1939 - 1945 (approx):''' Used by the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] to research [[Biological warfare|bacteriological warfare]], including the manufacture of anthrax.

'''1956:''' Taken over by [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|Agriculture Canada]] for quarantining animals.

'''1974:''' Declared a National Historic Site by the Canadian government.

'''1993:''' Grosse Isle becomes a national historic park operated by [[Parks Canada]].

'''1997:''' A memorial is erected in memory of those who died on the island.&lt;ref&gt;The Toronto Star, 2 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish Memorial National Historic Site==
Visitors can tour many of the buildings used for the immigrants and by the islanders.  The disinfection building features the original showers, waiting rooms and steam disinfection apparatus, as well as a multimedia exhibit about the island's history.  A walking trail or trolley are available for visits of the village and hospital sector, including the 1847 [[lazaretto]] (quarantine station), [[Catholic]] chapel, [[Anglican]] chapel, the superintendent’s gardens, the eastern wharf and a transport museum. In season, costumed interpreters portray various islanders, such as the quarantine station's staff, the nurse, Catholic priest, [[Carting business|carter]] and school teacher.

The lazaretto features an exhibit about the tragic experiences of the immigrants in 1847.

A walking trail leads to the [[Celtic cross]] and the Irish Memorial, which honours the memory of the immigrants, the employees of the quarantine station, the sailors, the doctors and the priests who perished on this island.

Grosse Île and the Irish Memorial National Historic Site were twinned on May 25, 1998, with the [[Famine Museum]] in [[Strokestown]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/qc/grosseile/natcul/natcul1.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hangnail''' is a small, torn piece of [[skin]], more specifically [[eponychium]] or [[paronychium]], next to a [[fingernail]] or [[toenail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hangnail Hangnail], The Free Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and treatment==
Daily use of [[lotion|hand lotion]] or hand cream may help prevent the formation of hangnails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/beauty/nails/treating-a-hangnail-topic-overview Treating a Hangnail - Topic Overview], WebMD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HabifChapman2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas P.

For home treatment, the [[American Academy of Dermatology]] recommends [[hand washing|washing the hands]], clipping the loose piece of skin with a clean [[nail clipper]] or [[Scissors#Grooming|nail scissors]], and applying [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[antibiotics|antibiotic ointment]] if the area appears [[inflammation|inflamed]]. Persistent hangnails should be evaluated by a [[physician]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aad.org/dermatology-a-to-z/for-kids/about-nails/hangnails Hangnails], American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
{{main article|Paronychia}}
Hangnails can become infected and cause [[paronychia]], a type of skin infection that occurs around the nails. Treatments for paronychia vary with severity, but may include soaking in hot salty water, the use of oral antibiotic medication, or [[Incision and drainage|clinical lancing]]. Paronychia itself rarely results in further complications but can lead to [[abscess]], permanent changes to the shape of the nail or the spread of infection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001444.htm Paronychia], MedLine Plus&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3232">The '''Health Datapalooza''' is an annual conference which exists to promote access to [[open data in the United States]] for the purpose of improving [[public health]]. Since its inception in 2010, Health Datapalooza has become the gathering place for people and organizations creating knowledge from data and pioneering innovations that drive health policy and practice.

==History==
The first Health Datapalooza was a meeting organized in 2010 in response to the newly established website and database HealthData.gov.&lt;ref name="2014 Lohr"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/chasing-the-entrepreneurial-opportunity-in-obamacare/?_r=0 |title=Chasing Entrepreneurial Opportunity in the Affordable Care Act |first=Steve |last=Lohr |work=bits.blogs.nytimes.com |date=19 November 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Obama administration invited 45 people to gather to consider 30 data sets and develop some prototype application using them within 30 days.&lt;ref name="2014 Lohr"/&gt;

'''Health in Portugal''' is characterized by the existence of a high quality healthcare system (ranked as the 9th best in Europe and 12th in the World), allowing the country to achieve good rankings in several health indices.

==Statistics==
According to the latest [[Human Development Report]], the average [[life expectancy]] in 2014 was 80.0 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688?lang=en|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository|work=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese healthcare system was ranked number 12 in overall performance by the World Health Organization in a 2000 report ranking the healthcare systems of each of the 190 United Nations member nations. Nonetheless it ranked number 27 as the most expensive per capita healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization ranking of health systems]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[Eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%).
Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung [[cancer]] (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cancer of the cervix and the prostate are more frequent.
Portugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the late 1980s.

Portugal’s [[infant mortality rate]] has dropped sharply since the 1980s, when 24 of 1000 newborns died in the first year of life. It is now around 3 deaths per a 1000 newborns. This improvement was mainly due to the decrease in neonatal mortality, from 15.5 to 3.4 per 1000 live births.

People are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services.
Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090225002655/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 it was estimated that 13.09% of the population has diabetes, costing about $2,011 per person per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10: Which country has the highest rates of diabetes in Europe? The UK’s position might surprise you…|url=http://www.diabetes.co.uk/blog/2015/08/which-country-highest-diabetes-europe/|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=Diabetes UK|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madeira]] had the third highest death rate from respiratory diseases of any region in Europe in 2015 at 151 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">The '''healthy user bias''' is a [[bias]] that can damage the validity of [[epidemiologic]] studies testing the [[efficacy]] of particular [[therapies]] or interventions. Specifically, it is a [[sampling bias]]: the kind of subjects that voluntarily enroll in a [[clinical trial]] and actually follow the experimental regimen are not representative of the general population. They can be expected, on average, to be healthier as they are concerned for their health and are predisposed to follow medical advice, both factors that would aid one's health. In a sense, being healthy or active about one's health is a precondition for becoming a subject of the study, an effect that can appear under other conditions such as studying particular groups of workers (i.e. someone in ill health is unlikely to have a job as [[manual labor]]er).

'''High-grade serous carcinoma''' ('''HGSC''') is a type of tumour that arises from the [[Serous membrane|serous]] epithelial layer in the [[abdominopelvic cavity]] and is mainly found in the [[ovary]]. HGSCs make up the majority of [[ovarian cancer]] cases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shih|first=Ie-Ming|last2=Kurman|first2=Robert J.|date=2004-05-01|title=Ovarian Tumorigenesis: A Proposed Model Based on Morphological and Molecular Genetic Analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000294401063708X|journal=The American Journal of Pathology|volume=164|issue=5|pages=1511–1518|doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63708-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have the lowest survival rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olivier|first=R.

HGSC is distinct from low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) which arises from ovarian tissue, is less aggressive and is present in stage I ovarian cancer where tumours are localised to the ovary.

Although originally thought to arise from the [[squamous]] epithelial cell layer covering the ovary, HGSC is now thought to originate in the Fallopian tube epithelium. HGSC is much more invasive than LGSC with a higher fatality rate - although it is more sensitive to [[Platinum-based antineoplastic|platinum-based chemotherapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santillan|first=A.|last2=Kim|first2=Y.w.|last3=Zahurak|first3=M.l.|last4=Gardner|first4=G.j.|last5=Giuntoli|first5=R.l.|last6=Shih|first6=I.m.|last7=Bristow|first7=R.e.|date=2007-05-01|title=Differences of chemoresistance assay between invasive micropapillary/low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1525-1438.2007.00820.x/abstract|journal=International Journal of Gynecological Cancer|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=601–606|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1438.2007.00820.x|issn=1525-1438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmeler|first=Kathleen M.|last2=Sun|first2=Charlotte C.|last3=Bodurka|first3=Diane C.|last4=Deavers|first4=Michael T.|last5=Malpica|first5=Anais|last6=Coleman|first6=Robert L.|last7=Ramirez|first7=Pedro T.|last8=Gershenson|first8=David M.|date=2008-03-01|title=Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum|journal=Gynecologic Oncology|volume=108|issue=3|pages=510–514|doi=10.1016/j.ygyno.2007.11.013|issn=1095-6859|pmid=18155273}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to its rapid growth rate. In rare cases, HGSCs can develop from LGSCs,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dehari|first=Reiko|last2=Kurman|first2=Robert J.|last3=Logani|first3=Sanjay|last4=Shih|first4=Ie-Ming|date=2007-07-01|title=The development of high-grade serous carcinoma from atypical proliferative (borderline) serous tumors and low-grade micropapillary serous carcinoma: a morphologic and molecular genetic analysis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=The+Development+of+High-grade+Serous+Carcinoma+From+Atypical+Proliferative+(Borderline)+Serous+Tumors+and+Low-grade+Micropapillary+Serous+Carcinoma%253A+A+Morphologic+and+Molecular+Genetic+Analysis|journal=The American Journal of Surgical Pathology|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1007–1012|doi=10.1097/PAS.0b013e31802cbbe9|issn=0147-5185|pmid=17592266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dehari|first=Reiko|last2=Kurman|first2=Robert J.|last3=Logani|first3=Sanjay|last4=Shih|first4=Ie-Ming|date=2007-07-01|title=The development of high-grade serous carcinoma from atypical proliferative (borderline) serous tumors and low-grade micropapillary serous carcinoma: a morphologic and molecular genetic analysis|journal=The American Journal of Surgical Pathology|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1007–1012|doi=10.1097/PAS.0b013e31802cbbe9|issn=0147-5185|pmid=17592266}}&lt;/ref&gt; but generally the two types arise independently of each other.

== Risk factors ==

=== Environmental risk factors ===
The ‘incessant [[ovulation]]’ theory is suggested by the strong [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between the number of ovulatory cycles of an individual and their risk of ovarian cancer.&lt;ref name="SwanSong"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fathalla |first=M. F. |date=2013-01-01 |title=Incessant ovulation and ovarian cancer - a hypothesis re-visited |journal=Facts, Views &amp; Vision in ObGyn |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=292–297 |issn=2032-0418 |pmc=3987381 |pmid=24753957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend is reflected in the protective effects of pregnancy, parity and breastfeeding against ovarian cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Risch|first=H. A.|last2=Marrett|first2=L. D.|last3=Howe|first3=G. R.|date=1994-10-01|title=Parity, contraception, infertility, and the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=140|issue=7|pages=585–597|issn=0002-9262|pmid=7942759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gwinn|first=M.

J.|date=2013-12-01|title=Origin and molecular pathogenesis of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma|journal=Annals of Oncology|volume=24 Suppl 10|pages=x16–21|doi=10.1093/annonc/mdt463|issn=1569-8041|pmid=24265397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SwanSong" /&gt;

Ovulation is accepted as the cause of ovarian cortical inclusion cysts, the precursor [[lesion]]s of serous carcinomas, and lower numbers of these cortical inclusion cysts are thought to be the mechanism by which reducing lifetime ovulations can lower the risk of developing HGSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DastranjTabrizi|first=Ali|last2=MostafaGharabaghi|first2=Parvin|last3=SheikhzadehHesari|first3=Farzam|last4=Sadeghi|first4=Liela|last5=Zamanvandi|first5=Sharareh|last6=Sarbakhsh|first6=Parvin|last7=Ghojazadeh|first7=Morteza|date=2016-01-01|title=Impact and mechanistic role of oral contraceptive pills on the number and epithelial type of ovarian cortical inclusion cysts; a clinicopathology and immunohistochemical study|journal=Diagnostic Pathology|volume=11|pages=30|doi=10.1186/s13000-016-0482-6|issn=1746-1596|pmc=4802821|pmid=27000861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a temporal association with [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|menopausal hormone therapy]] and incidence of HGSC was found,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Hannah P.|last2=Anderson|first2=William F.|last3=Rosenberg|first3=Philip S.|last4=Trabert|first4=Britton|last5=Gierach|first5=Gretchen L.|last6=Wentzensen|first6=Nicolas|last7=Cronin|first7=Kathleen A.|last8=Sherman|first8=Mark E.|date=2013-06-10|title=Ovarian cancer incidence trends in relation to changing patterns of menopausal hormone therapy use in the United States|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|volume=31|issue=17|pages=2146–2151|doi=10.1200/JCO.2012.45.5758|issn=1527-7755|pmc=3731982|pmid=23650423}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Polycystic ovary syndrome|polycystic ovarian syndrome]] (PCOS) was shown to contribute to a doubling of the risk of ovarian cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schildkraut|first=J. M.|last2=Schwingl|first2=P. J.|last3=Bastos|first3=E.|last4=Evanoff|first4=A.|last5=Hughes|first5=C.|date=1996-10-01|title=Epithelial ovarian cancer risk among women with polycystic ovary syndrome|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=88|issue=4 Pt 1|pages=554–559|issn=0029-7844|pmid=8841217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Endometriosis]] can increase risk for other ovarian cancer subtypes, but is not associated with HGSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Celeste Leigh|last2=Templeman|first2=Claire|last3=Rossing|first3=Mary Anne|last4=Lee|first4=Alice|last5=Near|first5=Aimee M.|last6=Webb|first6=Penelope M.|last7=Nagle|first7=Christina M.|last8=Doherty|first8=Jennifer A.|last9=Cushing-Haugen|first9=Kara L.|date=2012-04-01|title=Association between endometriosis and risk of histological subtypes of ovarian cancer: a pooled analysis of case-control studies|journal=The Lancet.

This classification has more relevance to research rather than to clinical practice.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Lauren Patterson|last2=Gaillard|first2=Stephanie|last3=Wang|first3=Yihong|last4=Shih|first4=Ie-Ming|last5=Secord|first5=Angeles Alvarez|date=2015-01-01|title=Adenocarcinoma of Mullerian origin: review of pathogenesis, molecular biology, and emerging treatment paradigms|journal=Gynecologic Oncology Research and Practice|volume=2|pages=1|doi=10.1186/s40661-015-0008-z|issn=2053-6844|pmc=4880836|pmid=27231561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Serous membrane|serous]] membrane is a particular type of secretory epithelium which covers organs in body cavities and secretes serous fluid to reduce friction from muscle movement. Serous membrane lining the abdominopelvic cavity is called the [[peritoneum]]; that lining heart and mediastinum is the [[pericardium]], and that lining the thoracic cavity and lungs is the [[Pulmonary pleurae|pleura]]. Technically a ‘serous carcinoma’ can occur anywhere on these membranes, but high-grade serous carcinoma is generally limited to the peritoneal area.

While until recently HGSC was thought to arise from simple differentiation of cortical inclusion cysts (CICs) of [[Germinal epithelium (female)|ovarian surface epithelium]] (OSE), the cell origin of HGSC is now understood to be much more complex, with evidence for other sites of origin, both intra- and extra-ovarian, having come to light.

The common Müllerian origin of the Fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper vagina has resulted in the proposal that peritoneal high-grade serous carcinoma is a spectrum of a single disease.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Relevant animal models of HGSC can only be developed when the cell origin is properly understood. However, as HGSC tends to have the same clinical behaviour, regardless of its primary cell origin, determining cell origin is less important for clinical treatment, but may be of relevance when looking for biomarkers.

The specific process by which a HGSC arises may be related to the BRCA mutation status of the individual,&lt;ref name="Perets 751–765"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howitt|first=Brooke E.|last2=Hanamornroongruang|first2=Suchanan|last3=Lin|first3=Douglas I.|last4=Conner|first4=James E.|last5=Schulte|first5=Stephanie|last6=Horowitz|first6=Neil|last7=Crum|first7=Christopher P.|last8=Meserve|first8=Emily E.|date=2015-03-01|title=Evidence for a dualistic model of high-grade serous carcinoma: BRCA mutation status, histology, and tubal intraepithelial carcinoma|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Evidence+for+a+dualistic+model+of+high-grade+serous+carcinoma%253A+BRCA+mutation+status,+histology,+and+tubal+intraepithelial+carcinoma|journal=The American Journal of Surgical Pathology|volume=39|issue=3|pages=287–293|doi=10.1097/PAS.0000000000000369|issn=1532-0979|pmid=25581732}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the p53 mutation status.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A 2007 paper describes the process of determining cell of origin as “Tumour origin is typically assigned to the organ presenting with the dominant tumour mass.

It is recognised that HGSC can have variable and complex primary origins, but understanding and determining this will give insight into its pathogenesis.

=== Pathogenesis ===
Assuming a fimbrial origin, as observed in the majority of HGSC cases,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; the current understanding of HGSC genesis suggests a process by which STIC fimbrial cells implant into the ovary as cortical inclusion cysts through the ovulation rupture site.

To account for instances where there is no STIC involvement, endosalpingiosis or ''de novo'' metaplasia of ovarian surface epithelium inclusions are also possible. A much rarer occurrence is the differentiation of HGSC from LGSC.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Vaginal ultrasonography|Transvaginal ultrasonography]] as well as cancer marker [[CA-125|CA125]] level analysis is often used to determine potential malignancy of suspect pelvic masses.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colombo|first=N.|last2=Peiretti|first2=M.|last3=Parma|first3=G.|last4=Lapresa|first4=M.|last5=Mancari|first5=R.|last6=Carinelli|first6=S.|last7=Sessa|first7=C.|last8=Castiglione|first8=M.|last9=ESMO Guidelines Working Group|date=2010-05-01|title=Newly diagnosed and relapsed epithelial ovarian carcinoma: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up|journal=Annals of Oncology|volume=21 Suppl 5|pages=v23–30|doi=10.1093/annonc/mdq244|issn=1569-8041|pmid=20555088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgical [[Cancer staging|staging]] is the procedure by which the abdominal cavity and lymph nodes are examined for malignant tissue, usually via [[laparoscopy]]. Tissue [[Biopsy|biopsies]] may be taken for further analysis. It is not until this histological analysis stage that actual diagnosis of HGSC can be made.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

If glands are seen to fuse with intricate, extensive papillae featuring epithelial tufting with solid nests surrounded by a space alongside irregular slit-like spaces, then serous carcinoma is suspected.

Distinguishing between LGSC and HGSC:&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vang|first=Russell|last2=Shih|first2=Ie-Ming|last3=Kurman|first3=Robert J.|date=2009-09-01|title=Ovarian low-grade and high-grade serous carcinoma: pathogenesis, clinicopathologic and molecular biologic features, and diagnostic problems|journal=Advances in Anatomic Pathology|volume=16|issue=5|pages=267–282|doi=10.1097/PAP.0b013e3181b4fffa|issn=1533-4031|pmc=2745605|pmid=19700937}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Necrosis]] is common in HGSC and absent in LGSC, as are giant (multi- or mononucleated) tumour cells.
# [[Psammoma body|Psammoma bodies]] are more frequent in low-grade serous carcinoma.
# Tp53 expression is assessed for mutations, overexpression or absence –  common features of high-grade serous carcinomas.
# LGSCs are generally limited to micropapillary growth patterns, whereas HGSCs can exhibit admixed patterns.
Distinction of HGSC from high-grade endometrioid carcinoma is not always possible.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The progression of HGSC may also be determined from examining the [[cadherin]] expression profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quattrocchi|first=Livia|last2=Green|first2=Andrew R.|last3=Martin|first3=Stewart|last4=Durrant|first4=Lindy|last5=Deen|first5=Suha|date=2011-07-01|title=The cadherin switch in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma is associated with disease progression|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=The+cadherin+switch+in+ovarian+high-grade+serous+carcinoma+is+associated+with+disease+progression|journal=Virchows Archiv: An International Journal of Pathology|volume=459|issue=1|pages=21–29|doi=10.1007/s00428-011-1082-1|issn=1432-2307|pmid=21509572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Screening ===
As ovarian cancer is rarely symptomatic until an advanced stage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nagle|first=Christina M.|last2=Francis|first2=Jane E.|last3=Nelson|first3=Anne E.|last4=Zorbas|first4=Helen|last5=Luxford|first5=Karen|last6=de Fazio|first6=Anna|last7=Fereday|first7=Sian|last8=Bowtell|first8=David D.|last9=Green|first9=Adèle C.|date=2011-06-01|title=Reducing time to diagnosis does not improve outcomes for women with symptomatic ovarian cancer: a report from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study Group|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|volume=29|issue=16|pages=2253–2258|doi=10.1200/JCO.2010.32.2164|issn=1527-7755|pmid=21537035}}&lt;/ref&gt; regular pre-emptive screening is a particularly important tool for avoiding the late stage at which most patients present. However, A 2011 US study found that transvaginal ultrasound and cancer marker CA125 screening did not reduce ovarian cancer mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buys|first=Saundra S.|last2=Partridge|first2=Edward|last3=Black|first3=Amanda|last4=Johnson|first4=Christine C.|last5=Lamerato|first5=Lois|last6=Isaacs|first6=Claudine|last7=Reding|first7=Douglas J.|last8=Greenlee|first8=Robert T.|last9=Yokochi|first9=Lance A.|date=2011-06-08|title=Effect of screening on ovarian cancer mortality: the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=JAMA|volume=305|issue=22|pages=2295–2303|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.766|issn=1538-3598|pmid=21642681}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a more recent UK study found that up to 20% of ovarian cancer deaths could be prevented through annual performance of these procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Ian J.|last2=Menon|first2=Usha|last3=Ryan|first3=Andy|last4=Gentry-Maharaj|first4=Aleksandra|last5=Burnell|first5=Matthew|last6=Kalsi|first6=Jatinderpal K.|last7=Amso|first7=Nazar N.|last8=Apostolidou|first8=Sophia|last9=Benjamin|first9=Elizabeth|date=2016-03-05|title=Ovarian cancer screening and mortality in the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS): a randomised controlled trial|journal=Lancet|volume=387|issue=10022|pages=945–956|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01224-6|issn=1474-547X|pmc=4779792|pmid=26707054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention for an individual deemed at risk of HGSC has, up until recently, been (bilateral or unilateral) removal of both the ovary and the Fallopian tube (salpingo-[[oophorectomy]]).

With hormonal and even morbidity issues resulting from ovary removal, and the increased evidence for the role of the Fallopian tubes HGSC pathogenesis, optimisation of this procedure has been to remove just the Fallopian tube(s) (salpingectomy) with the ovaries remaining until age of menopause &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oliver Perez|first=M.

Tubal ligation is a less impactful prophylactic treatment shown to significantly reduce the risk of HGSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sieh|first=Weiva|last2=Salvador|first2=Shannon|last3=McGuire|first3=Valerie|last4=Weber|first4=Rachel Palmieri|last5=Terry|first5=Kathryn L.|last6=Rossing|first6=Mary Anne|last7=Risch|first7=Harvey|last8=Wu|first8=Anna H.|last9=Webb|first9=Penelope M.|date=2013-04-01|title=Tubal ligation and risk of ovarian cancer subtypes: a pooled analysis of case-control studies|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|volume=42|issue=2|pages=579–589|doi=10.1093/ije/dyt042|issn=1464-3685|pmc=3619957|pmid=23569193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Cytoreductive “[[debulking]]” surgery may be performed prior to chemotherapy treatment in order to decrease the physical mass of the tumour and thus reduce the number of chemotherapy cycles needed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The typical advanced presentation as well as extra-ovarian spread seen in HGSC can require aggressive debulking procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Donna|last2=Han|first2=Lucy|date=2015|title=The role of the fallopian tube in ovarian serous carcinogenesis: biologic mechanisms and clinical impacts|url=http://www.ajceog.us/files/ajceog1311002.pdf|journal=American Journal of Clinical and Experimental Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=2|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases total abdominal [[hysterectomy]] will be performed, in other cases where the patient intends to bear children a salpingo-oophorectomy is performed instead.

Typical chemotherapy is six cycles of intraperitoneally-delivered platinum-base adjuvant chemotherapy with agents such as [[carboplatin]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Measurements of blood CA125 levels are used to determine patient response to the treatment.

Between 20% and 30% of patients relapse within six months of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berns|first=Els M. J.

== Epidemiology ==
A study of incidence rates in the US between 1992 and 1999 found that the age-specific incidence rate for HGSC doubles every 10 years up until age 55, where it plateaus at approximately 20 cases per 100,000 women - before dropping dramatically after age 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quirk|first=Jeffrey T.|last2=Natarajan|first2=Nachimuthu|last3=Mettlin|first3=Curtis J.|date=2005-10-01|title=Age-specific ovarian cancer incidence rate patterns in the United States|journal=Gynecologic Oncology|volume=99|issue=1|pages=248–250|doi=10.1016/j.ygyno.2005.06.052|issn=0090-8258|pmid=16095676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Jake Red Cloud was born in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, to a Quechua father and a Lakota mother. Jake's father took on the Red Cloud name as a translation from his Quechua name and in honor of his wife's family and their great warrior traditions. Jake was brought up in an isolated and rural part of the reservation. They had very little money even for the necessities. Growing up on the reservation the conditions were substandard, and only the strong survived. On the reservation there was much buried ordnance and hazardous materials from closed US nuclear bomb ranges on the reservation. Being constantly exposed to these materials residents either became very sick with high levels of cancers, or showed genetic mutations which were difficult to explain. Jake early on showed an amazing resiliency to physical harm along with a sixth sense about events before they would occur. When Jake reached age he entered into the [[US Army]] where he served for several years in an [[United States Army Rangers|Airborne Ranger]] unit before qualifying for [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] selection. After doing several tours as a [[Delta Force]] operator he decided to retire so he could go back to the reservation and help take care of his parents there.&lt;ref name="comicbookdb"/&gt;

'''Reverend Father Jean-Marie Coquard''' (27 November 1859 – 27 June 1933) was a French Christian medical missionary who traveled to Abeokuta, Nigeria, which is the capital of the [[Ogun State]], to provide surgery and care. He was supervisor and visitor at the Abeokuta missionary and doctor to the Egba Government and Royal Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for establishing the [[Sacred Heart Hospital, Abeokuta|Sacred Heart Hospital]] in Abeokuta, being the longest serving missionary of the Society for African Missions, receiving an OBE for his work, being recognized by the government of Nigeria, and being “a stubborn individualist with a contentious streak” and one of the outstanding missionaries of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==

Jean-Marie Coquard was born on November 27, 1859, in the Diocese of Nantes, France into a Catholic working-class family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Marie Coquard: A Brief Biography|url=&lt;http://www.sma.ie/africa-module/1050-jean-marie-coquard-a-brief-biography&gt;|publisher=Society of African Missions|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coquard was the second child and only son of Marie Louise and Francois-Marie Coquard, a ''paludier'' and cattle farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years after his birth, Coquard's family moved to the hamlet of Fontainebras. However, much of Coquard early life and schooling took place in the village of [[Mesquer]], where he attended the school of the Brothers of Christian Instruction. Then, at fourteen, Coquard enrolled in the merchant navy, where he first developed his love for the sea and desire to travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coquard recalled his years in the merchant navy fondly, writing many years later after becoming a missionary in Africa, “To see so many beautiful sailing ships in port and to chat with the crewmen makes going to sea irresistible for a twelve-year old boy from Mesquer.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missionary journey==
At the age of 24, while in [[Montevideo]] with the merchant navy, Coquard encountered the Sacred Heart Missionaries of Betharram, a group of Christian missionaries that ran a prestigious school. Given his interest in a priestly calling as well as the idea of becoming a missionary, Coquard commenced schooling in Montevideo for the next four years. However, in 1886, Coquard learned that he was rejected as a candidate for priesthood with the Sacred Heart Missionaries. Yet, remaining undiscouraged, Coquard took rejection from Sacred Heart as a direction from God to go to Africa. Thus, Coquard applied for, and this time was accepted, to the [[Society of African Missions]]. Then, in 1890, Coquard sailed to West Africa, where he would remain for the last 43 years of his life, with the exception of two short return trips to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Marie Coquard: A Brief Biography|url=&lt;http://www.sma.ie/africa-module/1050-jean-marie-coquard-a-brief-biography&gt;|publisher=Society of African Missions|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Christian involvement in Yorubaland==
Coquard's involvement in Abeokuta was one of the many missionary influences in [[Yorubaland]] over the years. The earliest Christian missionaries to Yorubaland came from Europe and America with the goal of proselytizing the [[Egba people|Egba]] tribe. Initially, Christianity was not well received, but with time, Egba chiefs in [[Abeokuta]] allowed missionary work as a means of protection against hostile neighbors. However, missionaries quickly realized and exploited the fact that [Abeokuta]] could serve as the central gateway for Christianity to spread throughout Yorubaland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akinbode|first1=Rahmon|title=The Impact of Christian Missionary Activities in Yourbaland 1842-1999; A Bibliography|date=1999|publisher=Options Book and Information Services|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Christian missionaries in Yorubaland, and Abeokuta specifically, had mixed and numerous social, religious, economic, and political impacts in the region.

Socially, the introduction of Christianity encouraged the expansion of cultural heritage in Yorubaland. That is, Christianity brought the increased study of European languages as well as newer systems of education and thought, including the establishment of primary, secondary, and technical schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akinbode|first1=Rahmon|title=The Impact of Christian Missionary Activities in Yourbaland 1842-1999; A Bibliography|date=1999|publisher=Options Book and Information Services|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abeokuta Grammar School]] was the first secondary school in Nigeria, established by the Anglicans in 1908. Coquard promoted education for women as well, and the school began to admit girls in 1914. The Abeokuta Grammar School teaches not just academics but character with expressions such as “my character is greater than my books.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Abeokuta Grammar School|url=http://www.agsoba-na.org/school-history.html|website=AGSOBA North America|publisher=Abeokuta Grammar School Old Boys Association|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Terrien of the Abeokuta mission opened [[St. Gregory's College|St. Gregory's College]] in 1928 as the first Catholic Secondary School. In addition, Yorubaland experienced newer styles of architecture, which become evident in the details of chapels and cathedrals. Coquard's Sacred Heart Hospital also had a very European style as it had two wings, both two stories with columns and terraces and two towers that overlooked a square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole town of Abeokuta was rapidly modernizing with the introduction of an automobile, motorcycles, electricity, and a water tower. Coquard wrote at the time of the Sacred Heart Hospital's opening, “Thus you see, if not in the twinkling of an eye, certainly day by day, this great town is undergoing a transformation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religiously, Christianity had an adverse effect on traditional religious practices of the regions by encouraging the development of various institutions that promoted higher ideals and standards of morality. Christian influence also led to the emergence of the African church movements, including the [[Church of the Lord (Aladura)|Church of the Lord]], the [[Christ Apostolic Church]], and others. The Abeokuta was supposed to be the capital for efforts to convert West Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akinbode|first1=Rahmon|title=The Impact of Christian Missionary Activities in Yourbaland 1842-1999; A Bibliography|date=1999|publisher=Options Book and Information Services|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Abeokuta mission, there were prayers twice a day. Moreover, at the hospital Coquard claimed that they treated not just the body, but also the soul. The mission gained the respect of the people of Abeokuta as they cured patients with illnesses that used to be a death sentence. And thus many of the Abeokuta people began to convert. They baptized over three hundred people in just the first year Coquard was there. Additionally, they were able to continue teaching Christianity to the students of St. Gregory's School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Christian missionary work intervened considerably in Yoruba politics. In order to maintain their own security and survival, missionary societies invited European intervention in government, often to destructive effect. For example, at the encouragement of British missionaries, the British Consul to Yorubaland bombed [[Lagos]] in order to force out Portuguese influence and maintain British control of the region. Furthermore, such intervention eventually facilitated annexation and colonization efforts later in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akinbode|first1=Rahmon|title=The Impact of Christian Missionary Activities in Yourbaland 1842-1999; A Bibliography|date=1999|publisher=Options Book and Information Services|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abeokuta government actually was very supportive of the mission with little adverse effect. The government backed construction of the hospital which eventually provided dependable primary care to the people. Within the Abeokuta mission, there were frequent power struggles, particularly involving Coquard as he was very independent and self-assured, but the vicariate did not attempt to influence the local politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missionary work==
Jean-Marie Coquard was ordained a priest in 1880. He left Europe in November of the same year after a formal departure ceremony which the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyon attended. The Archbishop honored ten missionaries all leaving for Africa by kissing their feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they landed in Lagos after twenty-five days at sea, Coquard was greeted by excited school children and stood in awe at the benediction. He wrote in a letter to Rev. Father Planque, superior-general of the African missions of Lyons, “it is impossible to describe the joy of my Christians.” He claimed that it was at the Corpus Christi procession that night that “Christ the Saviour went out from the walls of our modest church, for the first time, to show Himself to His people ; and...each one seemed to understand that something grand and majestic was passing, and, without being able to explain the reason, felt awed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vicariate-Apostolic of Benin, Africa|url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=BOSTONSH19010316-01.2.46|accessdate=9 December 2014|issue=11|publisher=The Sacred Heart Review|date=16 March 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival in Abeokuta in 1890, Coquard was put in charge of medical work at the mission dispensary under the guidance of Fr. Justin François.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Marie Coquard: A Brief Biography|url=&lt;http://www.sma.ie/africa-module/1050-jean-marie-coquard-a-brief-biography&gt;|publisher=Society of African Missions|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But four days after Coquard's arrival, he was left as the mission supervisor while François was traveling. He didn't know the language, so patients and mission boys served as his interpreters. 
	
With the exception of a five-week apprenticeship, Coquard was largely self-taught. Although he had received no formal medical training, he reportedly demonstrated an extraordinary interest and ability for medical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Marie Coquard: A Brief Biography|url=&lt;http://www.sma.ie/africa-module/1050-jean-marie-coquard-a-brief-biography&gt;|publisher=Society of African Missions|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the mission, there were no actual medical professionals, but they received permission from the [[Propaganda Fide]] for the clergy to perform surgery. Coquard quickly became much sought-after and beloved among the Egba people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=BOSTONSH19110930-01.2.23#|accessdate=12 December 2014|issue=15|publisher=The Sacred Heart Review|date=30 September 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, he was officially put in charge of the dispensary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
He also sought to help the lepers who were forced to live outside the city. He and Father François wanted to build a more permanent home for them, a goal they worked toward for six years. Finally in 1897, the leprosarium was realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Over the course of his time at the Abeokuta mission, Coquard wrote frequently to Le Petit Messager to gain support for various mission projects. He described the Egba people living in Abeokuta and stressed that often patients left the mission not only cured of illness but also converted. In response to his articles, European readers of the journal sent him medical equipment and books as well as church props such as altar cloths, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Marie Coquard: A Brief Biography|url=&lt;http://www.sma.ie/africa-module/1050-jean-marie-coquard-a-brief-biography&gt;|publisher=Society of African Missions|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters to the Messenger, Coquard focused on the difference Christianity could have on the children taken into the orphanage at the mission and encouraged the sponsoring of individual children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
His primary goal, however, was building a hospital for the sick, the orphans, and the elderly. After spending some time at the mission, Coquard was convinced of the importance of his medical work for the mission, and he began advocating for the hospital despite the blatant lack of resources. He cited the expense of the time taken for long journeys to see patients who could not be accommodated due to lack of space at the mission and the fact that sometimes patients even had to sleep in the horse's stable. The mission then began accepting payment for medical care at the request of one of the Egba chiefs who wanted to ensure that the Egba people would receive proper care. The funds were a considerable help since the mission was barely staying afloat, and the financial boost allowed Coquard's hospital to be approved. Even with all the financial support from Europe as well, they still lacked the capital to actually complete the hospital. Coquard accordingly used a portion of the funds that were specifically designated for the leprosarium, for which he was criticized by many. The hospital was eventually completed in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
After the death of Father François in 1895, Coquard became the superior in Abeokuta. However, the following year when it became apparent that he wasn't following certain restrictions, he was sent to South America to fundraise. He was angry about being forced out of his position, but he had every intention of returning. As for the actual fundraising work, he called it pitiable since the people he was requesting donations from were so poor. He came back with an idea as well as the funding for a Christian village. He used the new project as a way to ensure his continued position at the mission, and in 1902, he was named visitor, responsible for the spiritual welfare of the confreres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
He began advocating for an addition to the leprosarium and for a newer hospital in 1903. His plans were for a grand two story hospital building. Bishop Lang found the layout including towers and terraces excessive and Bishop Paul Pellet ordered Coquard to only build a one-story building, but Coquard began construction without their approval. The Egba government and the Egba people held him in high regard and supported the construction of the new hospital. Although Coquard's strong personality often put him at odds with Society of African Missions leaders, Coquard's labor and medical work culminated in the establishment of the Sacred Heart Hospital. On May 5, 1911 with the [[Egba Alake|Alake]], his court, and members of the government in attendance, the new Sacred Heart Hospital was opened by the governor of Lagos, [[Walter Egerton|Sir Walter Egerton]], who had also laid the foundation stone in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Since Coquard was getting older, they wanted to be able to ensure that the hospital would not collapse after his decease. The government promised to ensure the hospital's future, and Coquard decided it would be best if the hospital was put under a doctor's supervision immediately while he just continued with administration work. However, instead of the government continuing the hospital's existence as initially planned, the Wuerzburg Institute ended up providing staff for the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In 1917, orders from the Propaganda Fide prevented Coquard from even practicing first-aid. In his anger, Coquard wrote letters that were offensive to many high-standing mission leaders. Because Coquard had brought the mission into debt, repeatedly disobeyed Bishop Terrien's orders and was now disrespecting his supervisors, many wanted him to be removed. In 1919, Coquard resigned from his position as superior of the Abeokuta mission. He was recalled to France, but the Egba people were outraged and petitioned for him to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In 1923, he tried to implement a nursing sisterhood since there were so many women, both young and old, who spent their lives working at the hospital but never earned a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; This progressive idea of women's education sadly was never realized. He did, however, open a school for midwives two years later that in 1998 became a general nursing school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sacred Heart Hospital, Abeokuta - A Brief History|url=http://www.geocities.ws/sacredheartabeokuta/history.htm|website=Sacred Heart Hospital|publisher=Sacred Heart Hospital|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In 1933, after many dedicated years of missionary service Coquard died in Abeokuta.

==Comparison==
Father Coquard made contributions in Abeokuta much like [[Albert Schweitzer]] did in [[Lambaréné]], [[Gabon]] in French Equatorial Guinea. While Schweitzer was religious and claimed that his mission was given to him by Jesus, he was not technically a religious missionary; yet he filled a quite similar role to that of Coquard. Both men were in charge of the medical efforts at their respective missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foege|first1=Albert Schweitzer ; with a new foreword by William H.|title=The primeval forest : including On the edge of the primeval forest ; and, More from the primeval forest|date=1998|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press in association with the Albert Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=9780801859588|edition=Johns Hopkins paperbacks}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both pioneered efforts to create hospitals as well as leprosariums and also undertook expansions of the medical buildings. Additionally, they did much of the work single-handedly. Father Coquard was Sacred Heart's primary architect, fundraiser, and supervisor, as Albert Schweitzer had been of the hospital in Lambaréné. They were both proud men who had strong egos.
	
They also both wrote a significant amount over the course of their missionary work. Schweitzer wrote a book, The Primeval Forest, while Coquard wrote numerous articles and the Cronique d’Abeokuta, a history of the mission. Schweitzer and Coquard referred to the relationship between Europeans and Africans in the same way in their writing, calling Europeans “older brothers” and “elder brothers” respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foege|first1=Albert Schweitzer ; with a new foreword by William H.|title=The primeval forest : including On the edge of the primeval forest ; and, More from the primeval forest|date=1998|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press in association with the Albert Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=9780801859588|edition=Johns Hopkins paperbacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vicariate-Apostolic of Benin, Africa|url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=BOSTONSH19010316-01.2.46|accessdate=9 December 2014|issue=11|publisher=The Sacred Heart Review|date=16 March 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; While neither man was overtly racist, this language has racist undertones implying a belief in the superiority of whites over blacks. For Coquard at least, this viewpoint is a result of the fact that he was in Africa as a religious missionary; clearly he believed his culture was dominant if his intentions were to convert the West Africans. And Schweitzer grapples frequently with the issue of race in his book as he tries to see blacks as equals but still has different expectations of Africans. One difference between the men is that Schweitzer clearly segregated his hospital, building a separate building for white patients while Coquard's hospital according to the Lagos Standard, “makes no distinction of creed or colour in the objects of its benevolence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lagosian on Dits|publisher=The Lagos Standard|date=25 October 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schweitzer and Coquard both performed work that resulted in the availability of medical care for West Africans, indicating that they did care about the African people but saw white men as higher up the social ladder.

==Legacy==
Jean-Marie Coquard is remembered for his 43 years of missionary work in Yorubaland, only returning to Europe twice in so many years. He holds the record within the Society of African Missions for the longest missionary tour at 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Marie Coquard: A Brief Biography|url=&lt;http://www.sma.ie/africa-module/1050-jean-marie-coquard-a-brief-biography&gt;|publisher=Society of African Missions|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The Sacred Heart Hospital was his greatest accomplishment. It is the oldest hospital outside of Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sacred Heart Hospital, Abeokuta - A Brief History|url=http://www.geocities.ws/sacredheartabeokuta/history.htm|website=Sacred Heart Hospital|publisher=Sacred Heart Hospital|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As written in The Lagos Standard on Wednesday, Oct 25, 1911, “the hospital itself is a monument of what can be accomplished through the energy, zeal, patience, and devotion of a single individual...who was described by Sir Walter Egerton as having been ‘his architect, engineer, and labourer’ in building the hospital.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lagosian on Dits|publisher=The Lagos Standard|date=25 October 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the opening of the new hospital in 1911, the government built a road from the Alake’s palace to the hospital, which they called Fr. Coquard Road in tribute to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was made a chief by Alake Ademola and given the title Baasegun of Egba and later also named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by the British Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sacred Heart Hospital, Abeokuta - A Brief History|url=http://www.geocities.ws/sacredheartabeokuta/history.htm|website=Sacred Heart Hospital|publisher=Sacred Heart Hospital|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigeria|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/30th-april-1932/28/nigeria|accessdate=12 December 2014|publisher=The Tablet|date=30 April 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, a new locomotive was named “the Jean-Marie Coquard” by the Nigerian government so no one would forget the priest-doctor. A Memorial School was planned, but with the decease of its chief proponent, Bishop O’Rourke, the school was named St. Peter's instead. In 1954, a life-size bronze statue was erected in front of the original hospital in his honor. It was unveiled by the Alake himself with the archbishop in the audience, and the same night the Abeokuta chief talked about Coquard's work and accomplishments on the radio. The following day, a mass was held to repose his soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Edmund, M.|title=Cross and Scalpel: Jean-Marie Coquard Among the Egba of Yorubaland|date=2012|publisher=HEBN Publisher PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
He was a confident and often stubborn man. He was determined to achieve his goals and sought powerful positions. He often chafed under the rule of others and had frequent disagreements with his superiors. Although he was disinclined to obey the directions of his supervisors, he interacted with them in an honorable manner. He was on good terms with the Egba government as well as the British colonial representatives and was always a good friend to the Egba people. The Lagos Standard wrote that Coquard “laboured so earnestly for the betterment of our race. Since his arrival at Abeokuta, Father Coquard has won the affections of the people, where by his medical skill he has rendered signal services to all without distinction of race.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Catholic University of America|title=American Ecclesiastical Review, 1904|date=2013|publisher=Forgotten Books|location=London|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_American_Ecclesiastical_Review_v31_1000525781/155|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Meyers Rosenfield''' (June 1, 1910 — April 16, 2006) was an American community leader, active in special education and services for people with developmental disabilities in Texas.

==Early life and education==
Mary Meyers was born into a Jewish family in Russia and arrived in the United States as an infant with her family in 1911. In 1912 the Meyers family settled in [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross E. Milloy, [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/29/us/small-town-jewry-on-wane-in-texas.html "Small-town Jewry on Wane in Texas"] ''New York Times'' (April 29, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; She remembered helping to knit blankets as a child during [[World War I]], and volunteering at the town's library when it opened in the 1920s. She was recognized as a founding member of the [[Wharton, Texas|Wharton]] chapter of [[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America|Hadassah]], having attended the chapter's first meeting at age 6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isjl.org/texas-wharton-encyclopedia.html Wharton, Texas], ''Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities'' (Goldring-Woldenberg Institute on Southern Jewish Life, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; 

She graduated from high school in 1929 and studied art and design at the College of Industrial Arts (now [[Texas Woman's University]]) in [[Denton, Texas]].&lt;ref name="TWU"&gt;[http://www.twu.edu/twhf/tw-mrosen.asp Mary Meyers Rosenfield] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208093140/http://www.twu.edu/twhf/tw-mrosen.asp |date=2013-02-08 }}, Texas Women's Hall of Fame (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Mary Meyers Rosenfield and Alva Spellman founded an independent school for children with developmental disabilities in [[El Campo, Texas]] in 1950. She successfully lobbied the local school district to hire its first special educator. In 1952, she added an "Opportunity Center" for young adults with intellectual disabilities, and soon after, a summer camp for disabled children. In 1968, the residential [[Texas state supported living centers|Richmond State School]] opened with her efforts, to provide therapies and activities for adults with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref name="Halvorson"&gt;Barry Halvorson, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-gFZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CEYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3455%2C3525835 "A Lifetime for Others: Mary Rosenfield Will Be in the Texas Women's Hall of Fame for Helping Educate, Treat the Mentally Challenged"] ''Victoria Advocate'' (October 16, 2004): 1, 7A.&lt;/ref&gt; "I did it because it needed to be done," she explained late in life.&lt;ref&gt;Fay Brachman and Debbye Rice, [http://www.txjhs.org/sites/default/files/1996_january_0.pdf "Mary Meyers Rosenfield of El Campo, Texas--She's Still Going Strong!"] ''Texas Jewish Historical Society Newsletter'' (January 1996): 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenfield was the founding president of the El Campo chapter of [[Arc of the United States|ARC]], and was on the organization's state board. She was named Citizen of the Year by the El Campo Chamber of Commerce in 2004, the same year she was inducted into the [[Texas Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="Halvorson" /&gt; Governor [[Rick Perry]] named her a recipient of the Yellow Rose Award.&lt;ref name="HR230"&gt;[http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/793/billtext/html/HR00230I.htm 793 H. R. 230], Texas House of Representatives.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mary Meyers married George Rosenfield, a businessman, in 1937. They had two daughters. Their younger daughter Rita Sue was born with developmental disabilities, and lived at Richmond State School as an adult, beginning in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Downing, [http://www.houstonpress.com/news/texas-is-willing-to-close-state-schools-sending-profoundly-mentally-disabled-persons-into-the-community-6725193 "Texas is Willing to Close State Schools, Sending Profoundly Mentally Disabled Persons into the Community"] ''Houston Press'' (December 23, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mary Rosenfield was active in her community beyond disability-related projects, serving as president of the Ladies' Auxiliary at the [[American Legion]], as a Girl Scout leader, and as a member of the El Campo Garden Club.&lt;ref name="TWU" /&gt;

Mary Meyers Rosenfield was widowed in 1990, and died in April 2006, age 96. Her gravesite is in the Shearith Israel cemetery in Wharton. A resolution marking her lifetime achievements was introduced into the Texas House of Representatives after her death.&lt;ref name="HR230" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8385">'''MedInfo'''  is the name of the [[international]] [[medical informatics]] [[Academic conference|conference]] organized initially every 3 years and now every other year by the [[International Medical Informatics Association]]. It is the most important international conference in the field with 3000+ health and medical informatics professions attending from all over the world. MedInfo also serves to bring together all officers of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Board together with national representatives in the General Assembly of IMIA.

The General Assembly elects the officers of IMIA. The IMIA Board consists of the President (the Past or the Elect President), Treasurer and Secretary as its officers. In addition it has other Vice Presidents for targeted areas: Membership, MedInfo, Services, Special Affairs, Strategic Plan Implementation, and Working Groups. With the exception of the President and the Vice President of MedInfo all officers serve a three-year term that can be extended for a second three-year term.

'''''Mulligan Stew''''' is an American children's educational television series, produced and sponsored by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Extension Service and its youth outreach program, [[4-H]].

Taking its name from the [[Mulligan stew (food)|hobo dish]], ''Mulligan Stew'' aired in syndication beginning in the fall of 1972 and continued in reruns on [[public television]] into the early 80s. 

The six-episode series follows the adventures of a group of five school-age musicians and their mentor, all dedicated to teaching others about good nutrition and developing healthier eating habits.  The series, along with various educational materials including a companion comic book with additional adventures of the characters, was developed by the [[Michigan State University]] Cooperative Extension Service.

== Overview ==
The series centers on the humorous adventures of a group of five school-aged kids who are all members of a rock band called "Mulligan Stew" (also referred to as the "Stews" or the "Mulligan Stew Force").

The band members are: 
*'''Mulligan''' (Larry Friedman), the leader; occasionally plays guitar
*'''Maggie''' (Sherry Wright), identified by her long blond pigtailed hair; keyboards
*'''Mike''' (Steven Einbender), an Italian; drums
*'''Manny''' (Benjamin Sands), a Black preteen; bass
*'''Micki''' (Mi-On Hahm), a young Asian girl; guitar

(Mulligan, Maggie and Micki all sing lead vocals on most of the band's songs while Mike and Manny usually handle backing vocals.)  The group's clubhouse is a basement in a brownstone apartment, fully furnished with a kitchen, shortwave radio, home gym, laboratory, and even a small stage where they rehearse their music. 

Their grownup advisor and mentor is '''Wilbur Dooright''' (Barry Michlin), a bespectacled, bumbling accountant who, in some episodes, gives the kids their assignments "from upstairs", assumed to be a secret governmental organization (paying homage to the spy films and TV shows of the day).  Wilbur provides much of the comic relief throughout the series.

== "4-4-3-2" balanced diet message ==

An integral and ubiquitous part of the program's message was the "4-4-3-2" balanced diet program, part of the [[History of USDA nutrition guides|standard USDA nutrition guidelines/recommendations]] promoted during the 1960s and 1970s. The use of dietary supplements was strongly discouraged; it was taught that all nutritional needs, including the proper intake of vitamins, minerals, fats and carbohydrates, could be adequately obtained solely by adhering to a balanced diet, with appropriate servings from the "basic four" food groups. This message was enthusiastically repeated by the children several times per episode. (The "basic four" food groups were updated by USDA in subsequent decades by the 1990s-era "Food Guide Pyramid" and the current "MyPlate" nutritional guidelines program.)

== Production and development ==

''Mulligan Stew'' was developed in early 1971 by the USDA Extension Service, and filmed by the USDA Motion Picture Service (which for many years prior produced educational cinematic films and TV programs for public viewing). ''Mulligan Stew'' was developed based on plan and design proposals by Developmental Committees, [[Iowa State University]] Extension Service 4-H Nutrition Television Programs. The [[Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program]] (EFNEP) provided a grant to produce the series. (4-H is the official youth outreach and development program of the land-grant universities' Cooperative Extension Services and USDA.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://4-hhistorypreservation.com/History/Television/|title=4-H Television Series|website=4-hhistorypreservation.com|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The target audience of the program was older elementary school students, fourth through sixth grade.

Eleanor Wilson, the national 4-H TV coordinator at the time, was tapped to be the series' technical advisor. Wilson subcontracted with Iowa State University to develop an outline of educational concepts for the series. USDA Extension then hired Ira Klugerman to direct the series. Klugerman, who came from a background of children's television at [[WQED (TV)|WQED]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, came up with the title and general treatment for the series. V. "Buddy" Renfro was the credited producer.

Production began on location in southeast Washington, DC in 1971 (the opening sequence was filmed at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]]). Other filming locations included major production partner Michigan State University's home base of [[Lansing, Michigan]], and on location for one episode at [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston. The low budget of the project proved to be a significant challenge, as well as the unique challenges of working with child actors.

The producers wanted the style of the series to reflect trends begun in other popular and innovative TV shows such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In|Laugh-In]]''. Puppetry and animation were frequently used. Sometimes one or two of the kids would conduct "man-on-the-street" interviews, asking ordinary citizens about nutrition-related topics. All of the music, including the theme song and the various songs sung by the kids during an episode (many times in musical "romps" reminiscent of the ones seen on ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' TV series), were composed and arranged by Washington, DC musician and recording engineer Paul Brier, and performed by a rock combo credited on screen as "The Eye".

''Mulligan Stew'' premiered on October 4, 1972, during the National 4-H Week at the National 4-H Center in Washington, DC. The program was considered a success, especially by previous standards for television outreach sponsored by 4-H. The series had a moderate impact on kids making better choices in what they ate, and provided 4-H with a sizable marketing, promotional and public relations boost. Thanks in part to the popularity of ''Mulligan Stew'', 4-H membership was boosted to an all-time high in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cahe.nmsu.edu:16080/pubs/resourcesmag/summer01/4-Hyouth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031028230526/http://www.cahe.nmsu.edu:16080/pubs/resourcesmag/summer01/4-Hyouth.html |archivedate=2003-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to air in reruns on public television until 1981.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="909">The '''National Care Standards''' are a set of standards for care services in Scotland. 

They were set up by the [[Scottish Government]], as required by the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001. The standards were devised  after considerable consultation with service providers, service users, various expert bodies and individuals, and the public. The standards are subject to regular review and revision as necessary.

The National Care Standards are used by service providers to maintain and improve the quality of services provided. The [[Care Inspectorate (Scotland)|Care Inspectorate]] is also required by law to apply them when regulating care services.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Osteochondritis dissecans''' ('''OCD''' or '''OD''') is a [[joint]] disorder in which cracks form in the [[articular cartilage]] and the underlying [[subchondral bone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11789|title=Definition of Osteochondritis dissecans|accessdate=20 February 2009|author=Shiel WC Jr|publisher=MedicineNet, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; OCD usually causes pain and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. [[Physical examination]] typically reveals an [[Joint effusion|effusion]], tenderness, and a [[crepitus|crackling sound with joint movement]].

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
OCD is caused by blood deprivation in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone to die in a process called [[avascular necrosis]]. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation ([[dissection]]) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage.&lt;ref name="pmid7273527"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pappas AM|title=Osteochondrosis dissecans|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=158|pages=59–69|year=1981|pmid=7273527|doi=10.1097/00003086-198107000-00009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1157398"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Woodward AH, Bianco AJ |title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=110|pages=35–41|year=1975|pmid=1157398|doi=10.1097/00003086-197507000-00007|volume=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pettrone|first=FA|year=1986|title=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Symposium on Upper Extremity Injuries in Athletes|location=St. Louis, Missouri|publisher=CV Mosby|isbn=978-0-8016-0026-5|pages=193–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by [[Radiography|X-rays]], [[computed tomography]] (CT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans.

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Non-surgical treatment is rarely an option as the ability for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, [[Stem cell transplantation for articular cartilage repair|stem cell transplantation]], and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of [[Lying (position)|immobilization]] and [[physical therapy]]. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, [[isometric exercise]]s, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
OCD occurs in 15 to 30 people per 100,000 in the general population each year.&lt;ref name="pmid9012566"/&gt; Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active [[adolescent]]s.&lt;ref name="Inoue1991"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Inoue, Goro|title=Bilateral osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow treated by Herbert screw fixation|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=25|issue=3|pages=142–144|year=1991|pmid=1777781|doi=10.1136/bjsm.25.3.142|pmc=1478853}} See introduction and discussion sections on incidence&lt;/ref&gt; Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. [[Franz König (surgeon)|Franz König]] coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an [[inflammation]] of the bone–[[cartilage]] interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, [[osteonecrosis]], accessory ossification center, [[osteochondrosis]], and hereditary epiphyseal [[dysplasia]]. Some authors have used the terms ''osteochondrosis dissecans'' and ''osteochondral fragments'' as [[synonym]]s for OCD.

==Signs and symptoms==
In osteochondritis dissecans, fragments of [[cartilage]] or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and [[inflammation]]. These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice.&lt;ref name="pmid10643956-patient information handout"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hixon AL, Gibbs LM |title=What Should I Know About Osteochondritis Dissecans?|journal=American Family Physician|volume=61|issue=1|page=158|date=January 2000|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000101/20000101d.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; OCD is a type of [[osteochondrosis]] in which a [[lesion]] has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.&lt;ref name="pmid6807595"/&gt;

People with OCD report activity-related pain that develops gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement.&lt;ref name="pmid10643956"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hixon AL, Gibbs LM |title=Osteochondritis dissecans: a diagnosis not to miss|journal=American Family Physician|volume=61|issue=1|pages=151–6, 158|date=January 2000|pmid=10643956|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000101/151.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage&amp;nbsp;I; however, the onset of stage&amp;nbsp;II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage&amp;nbsp;II, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. [[Non-specific symptom]]s, caused by similar injuries such as [[sprain]]s and [[strain (injury)|strains]], can delay a definitive diagnosis.&lt;ref name="urlOCDofKNEE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eorthopod.com/osteochondritis-dissecans-of-the-knee/topic/68|title=Adolescent Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Knee|accessdate=21 September 2008|author=eOrthopod.com|publisher=Medical Multimedia Group, LLC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001222250/http://www.eorthopod.com/osteochondritis-dissecans-of-the-knee/topic/68|archivedate=1 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical examination typically reveals fluid in the joint, tenderness, and [[crepitus]]. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty [[hemarthrosis]]. Although there is no significant [[pathologic]] gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid [[tibia]]l spine impingement on the [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] aspect of the [[Medial condyle of femur|medial condyle of the femur]].&lt;ref name="pmid8613454"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schenck RC Jr|author2=Goodnight JM|title=Osteochondritis dissecans|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Osteochondritis dissecans diagram.JPEG|thumb|Tunnel or notch view X-ray of the right knee from a patient with osteochondritis dissecans—cystic changes and irregular border are indicated by arrows on the [[Anatomical terms of location|medial]] side compared to the [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] side]]
Osteochondritis dissecans differs from "wear and tear" degenerative [[osteoarthritis|arthritis]], which is primarily an articular surface problem. Instead, OCD is a problem of the bone underlying the cartilage, which may secondarily affect the articular cartilage. Left untreated, OCD can lead to the development of degenerative arthritis secondary to joint incongruity and abnormal wear patterns.&lt;ref name="pmid18500061"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Detterline AJ, Goldstein JL, Rue JP, ((Bach BR Jr)) |title=Evaluation and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee|journal=Journal of Knee Surgery|volume=21|issue=2|pages=106–15|year=2008|pmid=18500061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD occurs when a loose piece of bone or cartilage partially (or fully) separates from the end of the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply ([[osteonecrosis]]) and decalcification of the [[Trabecular bone|trabecular bone matrix]]. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the [[joint]] stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees,&lt;ref name="pmid6807595"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Clanton TO, DeLee JC |title=Osteochondritis dissecans. History, pathophysiology and current treatment concepts|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|volume=167 |pages=50–64|date=July 1982|pmid=6807595|issue=167|doi=10.1097/00003086-198207000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.&lt;ref name="pmid17980849"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kadakia AP, Sarkar J |title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the talus involving the subtalar joint: a case report|journal=Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery|volume=46|issue=6|pages=488–92|year=2007|pmid=17980849|doi=10.1053/j.jfas.2007.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In skeletally immature individuals, the blood supply to the [[epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal bone]] is good, supporting both [[osteogenesis]] and [[chondrogenesis]]. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of [[necrosis]] occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both [[osteocytes]] and [[chondrocytes]]. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral [[avascular necrosis]] and consequently OCD.&lt;ref name="topic57webmd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/89718-overview|title=Knee Osteochondritis Dissecans|accessdate=2 October 2008|vauthors=Jacobs B, Ertl JP, Kovacs G, Jacobs JA |work=eMedicine|publisher=Medscape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four minor stages of OCD have been identified after trauma. These include [[revascularization]] and formation of granulation (scar) tissue, absorption of necrotic fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With delay in the revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive [[arthritis|arthritic]] deterioration.&lt;ref name="topic57webmd"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
To diagnose osteochondritis dissecans, an [[X-ray]], [[CT scan]] or [[MRI scan]] can be performed to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both.&lt;ref name="pmid12591666"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Boutin RD, Januario JA, Newberg AH, Gundry CR, Newman JS|title=MR imaging features of osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral sulcus|journal=American Journal of Roentgenology|volume=180|issue=3|pages=641–5|date=March 2003|pmid=12591666|url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/180/3/641.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090318145650/http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/180/3/641.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 March 2009|format=PDF|doi=10.2214/ajr.180.3.1800641|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally a [[nuclear medicine]] [[bone scan]] is used to assess the degree of loosening within the joint.&lt;ref name="Mesgarzadeh"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mesgarzadeh M, Sapega AA, Bonakdarpour A, Revesz G, Moyer RA, Maurer AH, Alburger PD |title=Osteochondritis dissecans: analysis of mechanical stability with radiography, scintigraphy, and MR imaging|journal=Radiology|volume=165|issue=3|pages=775–80|date=1 December 1987|pmid=3685359|url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/reprint/165/3/775|doi=10.1148/radiology.165.3.3685359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical examination===
Physical examination often begins with examination of the patient's [[Gait (human)|gait]]. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid [[tibia]]l spine impingement on the [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] aspect of the [[Medial condyle of femur|medial condyle of the femur]].&lt;ref name="pmid8613454"/&gt;

Next, the examining physician may check for weakness of the [[quadriceps]]. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The [[Wilson test]] is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the [[Lower extremity of femur|femoral condyle]].&lt;ref name="pmid6022357"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson JN|title=A diagnostic sign in osteochondritis dissecans of the knee|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume|volume=49|issue=3|pages=477–80|date=April 1967|pmid=6022357|url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/49/3/477.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029061547/http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/49/3/477.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2008|df=|doi=10.2106/00004623-196749030-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of [[flexion]] and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.&lt;ref name="pmid12975201"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Conrad JM, Stanitski CL |title=Osteochondritis dissecans: Wilson's sign revisited|journal=Am J Sports Med|volume=31|issue=5 |pages=777–8|year=2003|pmid=12975201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical examination of a patient with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, [[crepitus]], and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both.&lt;ref name="cooperwebmd"/&gt; The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are [[extrinsic]] and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.&lt;ref name="OCDPatella-IO"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Livesley PJ, Milligan GF |date=29 November 2004|title=Osteochondritis dissecans patellae|journal=International Orthopaedics|volume=16|issue=2|pages=126–129|publisher=Springer Berlin / Heidelberg|location= |issn=0341-2695|pmid=1428308|doi=10.1007/BF00180201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diagnostic imaging===
X-rays show lucency of the [[ossification]] front in juveniles. In older people, the lesion typically appears as an area of [[Osteosclerosis|osteosclerotic]] bone with a [[radiodensity|radiolucent]] line between the osteochondral defect and the [[epiphysis]]. The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and on the amount of knee [[flexion]] used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.&lt;ref name="pmid852179"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harding WG 3rd.|title=Diagnosis of osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyles: the value of the lateral x-ray view|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|volume=123|pages=25–6|date=March–April 1977|pmid=852179|issue=123|doi=10.1097/00003086-197703000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is useful for staging OCD lesions, evaluating the integrity of the joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage [[edema]] in the area of the irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the [[articular cartilage]] and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, [[Articular cartilage damage|articular]] surface integrity, and fragment displacement.&lt;ref name="pmid2009106"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0749-8063(91)90087-E|vauthors=De Smet AA, Fisher DR, Graf BK, Lange RH |title=Characterizing osteochondral lesions by magnetic resonance imaging|journal=Arthoscopy|volume=7|issue=1|pages=101–4|year=1991|pmid=2009106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2117355"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Smet AA, Fisher DR, Graf BK, Lange RH |title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: value of MR imaging in determining lesion stability and the presence of articular cartilage defects |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=155 |issue=3 |pages=549–53 |date=September 1990 |pmid=2117355 |doi= 10.2214/ajr.155.3.2117355|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions.

[[Computed tomography]] (CT) scans and [[Technetium-99m]] [[bone scan]]s are also sometimes used to monitor the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion.&lt;ref name="pmid11044029"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bui-Mansfield LT, Kline M, Chew FS, Rogers LF, Lenchik L |title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the tibial plafond: imaging characteristics and a review of the literature|journal=American Journal of Roentgenology|volume=175|issue=5|pages=1305–8|date=1 November 2000|pmid=11044029|url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/175/5/1305|doi=10.2214/ajr.175.5.1751305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow and the amount of [[osseous]] uptake.

===Classification===
OCD is classified by the progression of the disease in stages.
There are two main staging classifications used; one is determined by MRI diagnostic imaging while the other is determined [[Arthroscope|arthroscopically]]. However, both stagings represent the pathological conditions associated with OCD's natural progression.&lt;ref name="pmid10643956"/&gt;

While the arthroscopic classification of bone and cartilage lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging is the main form of staging used in this article.&lt;ref name="pmid10887249"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Takahara M, Ogino T, Takagi M, Tsuchida H, Orui H, Nambu T |title=Natural progression of osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum: initial observations|journal=Radiology|volume=216|issue=1 |pages=207–12|date=1 July 2000|pmid=10887249|url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/216/1/207?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;titleabstract=osteochondritis+dissecans&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT|doi=10.1148/radiology.216.1.r00jl29207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stages&amp;nbsp;I and II are stable lesions. Stages&amp;nbsp;III and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the cartilage has allowed [[synovial fluid]] between the fragment and bone.

The articular cartilage's capacity for repair is limited:&lt;ref name="pmid17530379"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Moriya T, Wada Y, Watanabe A, etal |title=Evaluation of reparative cartilage after autologous chondrocyte implantation for osteochondritis dissecans: histology, biochemistry, and MR imaging|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Science|volume=12|issue=3|pages=265–73|date=May 2007|pmid=17530379 |doi=10.1007/s00776-007-1111-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular cartilage which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend to lead to deterioration of the articular surface.&lt;ref name="urlMedscape-ACT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/420393|title=Autologous chondrocyte transplantation|accessdate=17 September 2008|author=Bobic V|year=2000|publisher=Medscape}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson Stage&amp;nbsp;II, III).&lt;ref name="orthogateKNEEOCD"/&gt;

===Non-surgical===
Candidates for non-operative treatment are limited to skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small, intact lesion and the absence of loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.&lt;ref name="pmid13438964"/&gt;

Once candidates for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds according to the lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for four to six weeks or even up to six months in [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] to remove shear stress from the involved area;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sofop.org/data/Upload/Images/file/POSNA%20Curriculum/2.8.5%20osteochondritisDissecansLower.pdf |title=Osteochondritis dissecans|accessdate=21 November 2008|format=PDF|publisher=Société Française d'Orthopédie Pédiatrique}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted.&lt;ref name="orthogateKNEEOCD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedars-sinai.edu/12907.html|title=Treating osteochondritis dissecans|accessdate=22 November 2008|publisher=Cedars-Sinai Health|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212014412/http://www.cedars-sinai.edu/12907.html|archivedate=12 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those demonstrating healing by increased [[radiodensity]] in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.&lt;ref name="pmid17980849"/&gt;

===Surgery===
[[File:OATS-Arthroscopic Scan1.jpg|thumb|Arthroscopic image of OATS surgery on the [[medial condyle of femur|medial femoral condyle]] of the knee]]

The choice of surgical versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial.&lt;ref name="pmid18509814"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nobuta S, Ogawa K, Sato K, Nakagawa T, Hatori M, Itoi E |title=Clinical outcome of fragment fixation for osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow|journal=Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences|volume=113|issue=2|pages=201–8|year=2008|pmid=18509814|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/diva/getDocument?urn_nbn_se_pub_diva-232-2__fulltext.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.3109/2000-1967-232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the type and extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist for the treatment of persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy [[hyaline]] cartilage in [[glycosaminoglycan]] concentration, [[Histology|histological]], and [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] appearance.&lt;ref name="pmid18006675"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=LaPrade RF, Bursch LS, Olson EJ, Havlas V, Carlson CS |title=Histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of failed articular cartilage resurfacing procedures for osteochondritis of the knee: a case series|journal=American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=36|issue=2|pages=360–8|date=February 2008|pmid=18006675|doi=10.1177/0363546507308359}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.

====Intact lesions====
If non-surgical measures are unsuccessful, drilling may be considered to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. [[Arthroscopic]] drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD,&lt;ref name="pmid2768313"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bradley J, Dandy DJ|title=Results of drilling osteochondritis dissecans before skeletal maturity|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

====Hinged lesions====
Pins and screws can be used to secure flap (sometimes referred to as hinged) lesions.&lt;ref name="pmid2206180"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0749-8063(90)90073-M|vauthors=Johnson LL, Uitvlugt G, Austin MD, Detrisac DA, Johnson C |title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: arthroscopic compression screw fixation |journal=Arthroscopy|volume=6|issue=3|pages=179–89|year=1990|pmid=2206180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone pegs, metallic pins and screws, and other bioresorbable screws may be used to secure these types of lesions.&lt;ref name="pmid3665256"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomson NL|title=Osteochondritis dissecans and osteochondral fragments managed by Herbert compression screw fixation|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=224|pages=71–8|date=November 1987|pmid=3665256|doi=10.1097/00003086-198711000-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Full thickness lesions====

}}

The three methods most commonly used in treating full thickness lesions are arthroscopic drilling, abrasion, and microfracturing.

In 1946, Magnusson established the use of stem cells from [[bone marrow]] with the first surgical [[debridement]] of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into [[fibrocartilage]] and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal [[hyaline cartilage]] and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this can be attributed to the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.&lt;ref name="pmid9850792"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mandelbaum BR, Browne JE, Fu F, etal |title=Articular cartilage lesions of the knee|journal=American Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=26|issue=6|pages=853–61|year=1998|pmid=9850792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempts to address the weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques have been designed to fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is [[autologous]] [[chondrocyte]] implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated [[femur|femoral]] defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the [[Intercondylar fossa of femur|intercondylar notch]] of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations.&lt;ref name="pmid8078550"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brittberg M, Lindahl A, Nilsson A, Ohlsson C, Isaksson O, Peterson L |title=Treatment of deep cartilage defects in the knee with autologous chondrocyte transplantation|journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=331|issue=14|pages=889–95|date=October 1994|pmid=8078550|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/331/14/889|accessdate=17 September 2008|doi=10.1056/NEJM199410063311401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10818982"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Peterson L, Minas T, Brittberg M, Nilsson A, Sjögren-Jansson E, Lindahl A |title=Two to Nine-year outcome after autologous chondrocyte transplantation of the knee|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=374|pages=212–34|date=May 2000|pmid=10818982|doi=10.1097/00003086-200005000-00020|volume=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.&lt;ref name="pmid9875939"&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Driscoll SW|title=The healing and regeneration of articular cartilage|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume|volume=80|issue=12|pages=1795–1812|date=December 1998|pmid=9875939|url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/80/12/1795.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029061541/http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/80/12/1795.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to OATS, arthroscopic articular cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.&lt;ref name="pmid16517314"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stone KR, Walgenbach AW, Freyer A, Turek TJ, Speer DP |title=Articular cartilage paste grafting to full-thickness articular cartilage knee joint lesions: a 2- to 12-year follow-up |journal=Arthroscopy |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=291–9 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16517314 |doi=10.1016/j.arthro.2005.12.051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unstable lesions====
Some methods of fixation for unstable lesions include countersunk compression screws and [[Timothy Herbert|Herbert screws]] or pins made of stainless steel or materials that can be absorbed by the body.&lt;ref name="pmid17337729"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kocher MS, Czarnecki JJ, Andersen JS, Micheli LJ |title=Internal fixation of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee |journal=American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=712–8 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17337729 |doi=10.1177/0363546506296608}}&lt;/ref&gt; If loose bodies are found, they are removed. Although each case is unique and treatment is chosen on an individual basis, ACI is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people.

====Rehabilitation====
Continuous passive motion (CPM) has been used to improve healing of the articular surface during the postoperative period for people with full-thickness lesions. It has been shown to promote articular cartilage healing for small (&lt; 3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) lesions in rabbits.&lt;ref name="pmid7440603"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salter RB, Simmonds DF, Malcolm BW, Rumble EJ, MacMichael D, Clements ND |title=The biological effect of continuous passive motion on the healing of full-thickness defects in articular cartilage. An experimental investigation in the rabbit |journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=1232–51 |date=December 1980 |pmid=7440603 |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/62/8/1232.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318145705/http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/62/8/1232.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Rodrigo and Steadman reported that CPM for six hours per day for eight weeks produced an improved clinical outcome in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid8590122"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodrigo JJ, Steadman JR, Syftestad G, Benton H, Silliman J |title=Effects of human knee synovial fluid on chondrogenesis in vitro |journal=American Journal of Knee Surgery |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=124–9 |year=1995|pmid=8590122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rehabilitation program often involves protection of the compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative [[analgesics]], namely a mix of [[opioids]] and [[NSAIDs]], are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/89718-treatment|title=Knee Osteochondritis dissecans: treatment &amp; medication |accessdate=14 February 2009|vauthors=Jacobs B, Ertl JP, Kovacs G, Jacobs JA |date=28 July 2006|work=eMedicine |publisher=Medscape}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straight leg raising and other [[isometric exercise]]s are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal [[physical therapy]] program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.&lt;ref name="orthogateKNEEOCD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orthogate.org/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=185 |title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee |accessdate=16 November 2008 |date=28 July 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Orthogate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
The prognosis after different treatments varies and is based on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate.&lt;ref name="cooperwebmd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic639.htm|title=Definition of osteochondritis dissecans|accessdate=18 September 2008|vauthors=Cooper G, Russell W |work=eMedicine|publisher=Medscape}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting children between the ages of 5 and 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors=Fleisher GR, Ludwig S, Henretig FM, Ruddy RM, Silverman BK |year=2005|title=Textbook of Pediatric Emergency Medicine|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=0-7817-5074-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oA7qSOvYZxUC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1703&amp;lpg=RA2-PA1703&amp;dq=free+ebook+osteochondritis|page=1703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors=Simon RR, Sherman SC, Koenigsknecht SJ |year=2006|title=Emergency Orthopedics: The Extremities|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=0-07-144831-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nMXRDsufkMwC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=osteochondritis+dissecans|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prognosis is good for stable lesions (stage&amp;nbsp;I and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal.&lt;ref name="pmid10795030"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cahill BR|title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: Treatment of juvenile and adult forms|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|volume=3|issue=4|pages=237–47|date=July 1995|pmid=10795030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery in juveniles can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes ([[Mesenchymal stem cell|stem cells]]) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint.&lt;ref name="Cartilage+GrowthPlates"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bogin B|title=Patterns of Human Growth|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ScfPjwF3BngC|accessdate=20 February 2009|edition=2|date=January 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-56438-7|page=102|chapter=Mammalian Growth|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ScfPjwF3BngC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=growth+plates+bone+remodeling&amp;source=web&amp;ots=gGxVx5XMbV&amp;sig=KvWHnkgb5y7IktTLmoCcHNlqIF8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xCefSc-cGY-EtgeWjJz_DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA101,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stage&amp;nbsp;III and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment.

OCD is a relatively rare disorder, with an estimated [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year.&lt;ref name="pmid9012566"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Obedian RS, Grelsamer RP |title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the distal femur and patella|journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|volume=16|issue=1|pages=157–74|date=January 1997|pmid=9012566|doi=10.1016/S0278-5919(05)70012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widuchowski W ''et al.'' found OCD to be the cause of articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies.&lt;ref name="pmid17428666"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Widuchowski W, Widuchowski J, Trzaska T |title=Articular cartilage defects: study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies |journal=The Knee|volume=14|issue=3|pages=177–82|date=June 2007|pmid=17428666|doi=10.1016/j.knee.2007.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1.&lt;ref name="pmid6807595"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KonigNOPMID"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nagura S|title=The so-called osteochondritis dissecans of Konig|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|volume=18|pages=100–121|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, OCD has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports.&lt;ref name="pmid8917149"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williamson LR, Albright JP |title=Bilateral osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow in a female pitcher|journal=Journal of Family Practice|volume=43|issue=5|pages=489–93|date=November 1996|pmid=8917149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.&lt;ref name="pmid2722949"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bradley J, Dandy DJ|title=Osteochondritis dissecans and other lesions of the femoral condyles|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

While OCD may affect any joint, the knee—specifically the [[Medial condyle of femur|medial femoral condyle]] in 75–85% of knee cases—tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases.&lt;ref name="pmid6807595"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6501330"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hughston JC, Hergenroeder PT, Courtenay BG|title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyles|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

==History==
The condition was initially described by [[Alexander Monro (primus)]] in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Medical Essays and Observations |title=Part of the cartilage of the joint separated and ossified|author=Munro A|year=1738 |volume=4|page=19}} cited in {{cite journal |author=Burns RC |date=September 1939 |title=OSTEOCHONDRITIS DISSECANS |journal=CMAJ |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=232–5 |pmc=537458 |pmid=20321457}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1870, [[James Paget]] described the disease process for the first time, but it was not until 1887 that [[Franz König (surgeon)|Franz König]] published a paper on the cause of loose bodies in the joint.&lt;ref name="pmid1868560"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garrett JC|title=Osteochondritis dissecans|journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|volume=10|issue=3|pages=569–93|date=July 1991|pmid=1868560}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper, König concluded that:&lt;ref name="konig"&gt;{{cite journal|author=König F|title=Uber freie Korper in den gelenken|journal=Deutsche Zeitschrift für Chirurgie |volume=27|issue=1–2|pages=90–109|date=December 1888|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m57696053j598h56/fulltext.pdf?page=1|language=German|doi=10.1007/BF02792135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Trauma had to be very severe to break off parts of the joint surface.
# Less severe trauma might contuse the bone to cause an area of necrosis which might then separate.
# In some cases, the absence of notable trauma made it likely that there existed some spontaneous cause of separation.
König named the disease "osteochondritis dissecans",&lt;ref name="pmid3316236"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barrie HJ|title=Osteochondritis dissecans 1887–1987.

In 1922, Kappis described this process in the ankle joint.&lt;ref name="kappis"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kappis M|title=Weitere beitrage zur traumatisch-mechanischen entstehung der "spontanen" knorpela biosungen|journal=Deutsche Zeitschrift für Chirurgie |volume=171|pages=13–29|year=1922|language=German|doi=10.1007/BF02812921}}&lt;/ref&gt; On review of all literature describing transchondral fractures of the [[Talus bone|talus]], Berndt and Harty developed a classification system for staging of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs).&lt;ref name="pmid15173311"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Berndt AL, Harty M |title=Transchondral fractures (osteochondritis dissecans) of the talus|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

OCD also is found in animals, and is of particular concern in horses, as there may be a hereditary component in some [[horse breed]]s.&lt;ref name="Thomas2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomas, Heather Smith|title=Osteochondritis Dissecans in Thoroughbreds.

OCD has also been studied in other animals—mainly dogs, especially the [[German Shepherd Dog|German Shepherd]]&lt;ref name="Ch.84OCD"/&gt;—where it is a common primary cause of [[elbow dysplasia]] in medium-large breeds.&lt;ref name="Pead and Guthrie"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew Pead|author2=Sue Guthrie|title=Elbow Dysplasia in dogs – a new scheme explained|url=http://www.bva.co.uk/public/documents/chs_elbow.pdf|publisher=[[British Veterinary Association]] (BVA)|accessdate=16 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002022122/http://www.bva.co.uk/public/documents/chs_elbow.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In animals, OCD is considered a developmental and metabolic disorder related to cartilage growth and endochondral [[ossification]]. Osteochondritis itself signifies the disturbance of the usual growth process of cartilage, and OCD is the term used when this affects joint cartilage causing a fragment to become loose.&lt;ref name="Pubmed1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Berzon JL |title=Osteochondritis dissecans in the dog: diagnosis and therapy|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=175|issue=8|pages=796–9|year=1979|pmid=393676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Columbia Animal Hospital the frequency of affected animals is dogs, humans, pigs, horses, cattle, chickens, and turkeys, and in dogs the most commonly affected breeds include the German Shepherd, Golden and Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Saint Bernard.&lt;ref name="CAH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Osteochondrosis, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)|url=http://www.petshealthrx.com/encycEntry.cfm?ENTRY=8&amp;COLLECTION=EncycIllness&amp;MODE=full|work=Category: Canine |publisher=Columbia Animal Hospital|date=n.d.|accessdate=13 September 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050325013242/http://www.petshealthrx.com/encycEntry.cfm?ENTRY=8&amp;COLLECTION=EncycIllness&amp;MODE=full |archivedate = 25 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although any joint may be affected, those commonly affected by OCD in the dog are: shoulder (often bilaterally), elbow, knee and [[Hock (zoology)|tarsus]].&lt;ref name="CAH"/&gt;

The problem develops in puppyhood although often subclinically, and there may be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, [[arthroscopy]], or [[MRI]] scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.&lt;ref name="Ch.84OCD"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Lenehan TM, Van Sickle DC |veditors=Nunamaker DM, Newton CD |chapter=Chapter 84: Canine osteochondrosis|chapterurl=http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/saortho/chapter_84/84mast.htm|title=Textbook of small animal orthopaedics|url=http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/saortho/index.html|publisher=Lippincott|location=Philadelphia|year=1985|isbn=0-397-52098-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].&lt;ref name="Ch.84OCD"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1551">The '''radix entomolaris''' is an additional root in human's [[mandibular]] [[molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth. The human mandibular teeth have two roots usually. In rare cases, however, a root may develop between the [[distal]] and the [[mesial]] roots which is called entomolaris, if it is located [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|lingual]] to the tooth. Such a phenomenon is named radix paramolaris in case an extra root is [[buccal space|buccal]] to a molar tooth.&lt;ref&gt;Chauhan, R., and S. Singh.

'''Tobacco smoking among South Africans''' is quite a customary practice, but in recent years, the percentage of smokers has decreased. This is largely due to the increase in the precaution of the [[dangers of smoking]] and enforcement of stricter legislation on the tobacco industry.  In 1996 the provinces with the highest percentage and prevalence of smoking include Northern Cape (55%), Western Cape (48%) and North-West (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Priscilla|date=1996|title=Smoking status, knowledge of health effects and attitudes towards tobacco control in South Africa|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/samj/article/view/157285|journal=South African Medical Journal|volume=86|pages=1389–1393|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of smokers still remains stagnant. Despite the efforts to bring awareness to the risks that come with smoking, there is still a high prevalence of tobacco use in South Africa; and it is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20786190.2017.1340251|title=Prevalence and factors associated with tobacco use among adults attending selected healthcare facilities in Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa|last=|first=|date=|work=South African Family Practice|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
As more significant studies are published on smoking and second handing inhalation of smoke, the South African public has become more educated on the dangers of smoking. This has led to the overall decline in number of smokers and thus number of related deaths. Currently, approximately 50,000 South Africans die per year due to the effects smoking such as an increased risk for [[lung cancer]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]. In 2000 approximately 34,108 males and 10,306 died due to the various consequences of smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health24.com/Medical/Stop-smoking/News/Law-catches-up-with-smokers-20120721|title=Law catches up with smokers|work=Health24|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the latest South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2012 only about 16.4% of South Africans smoked which is a substantial drop from 32% in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health24.com/Medical/Stop-smoking/News/Ground-breaking-SA-smoking-study-leads-to-new-insights-20130919|title=SA smoking study reveals shocking details|work=Health24|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease is attributed to legislation which led to restrictions in advertisement, and an increase tobacco prices. However, a Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 21% of students in grades 8-11 smoke. This shows little to no change between 2002 and 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legislation ==

=== The Tobacco Products Control Act (1993) ===
In order to combat the dangers of smoking, legislation has been increasingly put into place in order to deter the public from smoking. Beginning in 1993 with the [[Tobacco Products Control Act, 1993|Tobacco Products Control Act]], South African began to pass legislation to in order to protect the public. It was fully implemented and enforced in 1995, meaning smoking in public places became some-what regulated. In addition, the act prohibited some aspects of advertisement, the promotion of tobacco products, and the publicity of a sponsorship is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mujuzi|first=JD|date=2010|title=Smoking in the workplace in South Africa: Law and practice relating to the rights and obligations of employers and employees|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/sajbl/article/view/69971|journal=South African Journal of Bioethics and Law|volume=3|pages=No. 2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merchandise containing tobacco may be visible when being sold, however costumers are not allowed to handle the products prior to the purchase. Labeling was limited in some aspects, however was not heavily regulated until 1999. Notably the act prohibited the sale of tobacco products to minor under the age of 16.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/tobacco/training/success_stories/en/best_practices_south_africa_surveillance.pdf|title=The Surveillance and Monitoring of Tobacco in South Africa|last=Swart|first=Dehran|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act (1999) ===
The Tobacco Products Control Act of 1993 was considered to be incomplete and incomprehension, and in 1999 the South African government passed the [[Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act, 1999|Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act]]. This created stricter regulations for public smoking and banned smoking in public places such as restaurants, the work place and public transport. Being set into motion in 2001 the act prohibited all forms of tobacco advertising and promotion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, the act suggests penalties for those who transgress the law. The act also places a limit on the permissible levels of [[nicotine]] and tar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Squats.svg|right|thumb|400px|The parallel back squat]]
In [[strength training]] and fitness, the '''squat''' is a compound, full body exercise that trains primarily the [[muscle]]s of the [[thigh]]s, [[hip]]s and [[gluteal muscles|buttocks]], [[quadriceps femoris muscle]] ([[Vastus lateralis muscle|vastus lateralis]], [[vastus medialis]], [[vastus intermedius muscle|vastus intermedius]] and [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]]), [[hamstring]]s, as well as strengthening the [[bone]]s, [[ligament]]s and insertion of the [[tendon]]s throughout the lower body. Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and [[Muscle hypertrophy|size]] of the legs as well as developing [[core stability|core strength]]. Squats are typically used to hone back, thigh, and hip stability.&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt; [[Isometric exercise|Isometrically]], the [[human back|lower back]], the upper back, the [[rectus abdominis muscle|abdominals]], the trunk muscles, the costal muscles, and the [[shoulder]]s and arms are all essential to the exercise and thus are trained when squatting with the proper form.&lt;ref name="Starting Strength"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Mark Rippetoe|last=Rippetoe|first=Mark | name-list-format = vanc |title=Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training, p.8|year=2007|publisher=The Aasgaard Company|isbn=0-9768054-2-1|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of [[powerlifting]], together with [[deadlift]]s and [[bench press]]. It is also considered a staple in many popular recreational exercise programs.

When people discuss volume, the equation is sets performed times number of repetitions times external weight.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shoepe|first=Todd | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017|title=Volume Estimations for Combined Free-Weight and Rubber-Band Resistance Exercise|url=https://login.libproxy.scu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=126785397&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Kinesiology|volume=49.2|pages=169–177|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding resistance to squats has been shown to affect the power and speed of the exercise.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loturco I, Pereira LA, Moraes JE, Kitamura K, Cal Abad CC, Kobal R, Nakamura FY | title = Jump-Squat and Half-Squat Exercises: Selective Influences on Speed-Power Performance of Elite Rugby Sevens Players | journal = PLOS One | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = e0170627 | date = 2017-01-23 | pmid = 28114431 | pmc = 5256944 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0170627 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though free-weight numbers fit nicely into the volume equation, adding resistance can complicate the equation and make volume less easy to calculate.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; More specifically, people have found that they can increase resistance while exercising by utilizing chains or rubber bands.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; One study discovered that the physical demand of exercises with resistance increases in a linear relationship with intensity.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reis VM, Garrido ND, Vianna J, Sousa AC, Alves JV, Marques MC | title = Energy cost of isolated resistance exercises across low- to high-intensities | journal = PLOS One | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = e0181311 | date = 2017-07-24 | pmid = 28742112 | pmc = 5524349 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0181311 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in energy expenditure during squatting can be attributed to the various forms of movements, intensities, weights, repetitions, and types of items (Smith machine or barbell).&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

Individuals who are interested in strength training can utilize barbell squat in training and rehabilitation programs.&lt;ref name=":74"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Escamilla RF, Fleisig GS, Lowry TM, Barrentine SW, Andrews JR | title = A three-dimensional biomechanical analysis of the squat during varying stance widths | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 984–98 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11404665 | url = https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2001/06000/A_three_dimensional_biomechanical_analysis_of_the.19.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; If executed with proper form, the squat has the potential to develop knee stability.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Escamilla RF | title = Knee biomechanics of the dynamic squat exercise | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 127–41 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11194098 | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.738.6180&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if done incorrectly, injuries to the knees and back can occur.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fry AC, Smith JC, Schilling BK | title = Effect of knee position on hip and knee torques during the barbell squat | journal = Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 629–33 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14636100 | url = http://luciano.si/images/blog015_raziskava.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel squat is one way to increase knee flexion while activating the quadriceps and hamstrings.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the standard squat, it is crucial to have the shin vertical to minimize stress on the knee.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Variations in squats include various knee placements and squat depths. For example, knees can be placed in knees in, knees out, and knees over toes; whereas squats can be performed at roughly 20°, 50°, and 80°.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The parallel squat is more preferred than the deep squat because the potential of injury on the cruciate and menisci ligaments is higher in the latter.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Muscles engaged==
;Primary muscles:
[[Gluteus maximus]] (glutes), [[quadriceps]] (quads)&lt;ref name="ACE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/135/bodyweight-squat |title=Bodyweight Squat |work=acefitness.org |publisher=[[American Council on Exercise]] |access-date=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Secondary muscles (synergists/stabilizers):
*[[Erector spinae]], [[transverse abdominis]], [[gluteus medius]]/[[Gluteus minimus|minimus]] (abductors), [[Adductor muscles of the hip|adductors]], [[soleus muscle|soleus]], [[gastrocnemius]], [[hamstrings]]&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;

==Form==
[[File:Squat.png|upright|thumb|A [[deep squat]]]]
The movement begins from a standing position. Weight is often added; typically in the form of a loaded barbell but [[dumbbell|dumbbells]] and [[kettlebell|kettlebells]] may also be used. When a barbell is used, it may be braced across the upper trapezius muscle (a high bar squat) or held lower across the upper back and rear deltoids (a low bar squat).&lt;ref name = Brown2000&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to exercise science | first = SP | last = Brown | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2000 | publisher = Lippincott Wims &amp; Wilkins| isbn = 0-683-30280-9 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cThxFwYl3ZoC&amp;pg=PA280 280–1] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is initiated by moving the hips back and bending the knees and hips to lower the torso and accompanying weight, then returning to the upright position.

Squats can be performed to varying depths. The competition standard is for the crease of the hip (top surface of the leg at the hip joint) to fall below the top of the knee;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/fileadmin/data/Technical_Rules/2013_Technical_Rules_english.pdf Technical Rules Book 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319094920/http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/fileadmin/data/Technical_Rules/2013_Technical_Rules_english.pdf |date=19 March 2013 }}.

''Bigger Faster Stronger'', March/April 2008, pp. 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Squatting below parallel qualifies a squat as deep while squatting above it qualifies as shallow.&lt;ref name = Brown2000/&gt; Some authorities caution against [[deep squat]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kellis E, Arambatzi F, Papadopoulos C | title = Effects of load on ground reaction force and lower limb kinematics during concentric squats | journal = Journal of Sports Sciences | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1045–55 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16194981 | doi = 10.1080/02640410400022094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the forces on the [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] and [[Posterior cruciate ligament|PCL]] decrease at high flexion, compressive forces on the [[meniscus (anatomy)|menisci]] and articular cartilages in the knee peak at these same high angles.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, HM, and Gilewich, GB (1999) ''Musculoskeletal Assessment: Joint Range Of Motion And Manual Muscle Strength''. Baltimore, MD: Williams and Wilkins, p. 374, {{ISBN|0683303848}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the relative safety of deep versus shallow squats difficult to determine.

As the body gradually descends, the hips and knees undergo [[flexion]], the ankle extends ("[[dorsiflexion|dorsiflexes]]") and muscles around the joint contract [[Eccentric contraction|eccentrically]], reaching maximal contraction at the bottom of the movement while slowing and reversing descent. The muscles around the hips provide the power out of the bottom. If the knees slide forward or cave in then tension is taken from the hamstrings, hindering power on the ascent. Returning to vertical contracts the muscles [[Concentric contraction|concentrically]], and the hips and knees undergo [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] while the ankle [[Plantarflexion|plantarflexes]].&lt;ref name = Brown2000/&gt;

Two common errors include descending too rapidly and flexing the torso too far forward. Rapid descent risks being unable to complete the lift or causing injury. This occurs when the descent causes the squatting muscles to relax and tightness at the bottom is lost as a result. Over-flexing the torso greatly increases the forces exerted on the lower back, risking a [[spinal disc herniation]].&lt;ref name = Brown2000/&gt;

Another error where health of the knee joint is concerned is when the knee is not aligned with the direction of the toes. If the knee is not tracking over the toes during the movement this results in twisting/shearing of the joint and unwanted torque affecting the ligaments which can soon result in injury. The knee should always follow the toe. Have your toes slightly pointed out in order to track the knee properly.

===Common Errors===
Some common squat posture mistakes include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Squat|url=http://www.lift.net/exercises/how-to-squat-with-proper-form/|work=lift.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Eirik | last = Sandvik | name-list-format = vanc |title=The 11 Worst Squat Mistakes | url = https://www.t-nation.com/training/the-11-worst-squat-mistakes|website=T NATION|access-date=7 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heels off floor: Raising the heels compromises balance and reduces the contribution of the gluteus and hamstring muscles.
* Knees not in line with toes: If the knees are not in line with the toes it means they have entered a [[valgus position]], which adversely stresses the knee joint.
* Poor foot placement: Placing the feet in an compensatory or asymmetric position can lead to structural problems in the movement.
* Allowing the back to round.

==Equipment==
Various types of equipment can be used to perform squats.

A [[power cage]] can be used to reduce risk of injury and eliminate the need for a [[spotting (weight training)|spotting]] partner. By putting the bar on a track, the [[Smith machine]] reduces the role of hip movement in the squat and in this sense resembles a [[leg press]].&lt;ref name = SST121&gt;[[#SST|Cornacchia]], pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HNkMkJ9XOwC&amp;pg=PA121 121], [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HNkMkJ9XOwC&amp;pg=PA125 125].&lt;/ref&gt; The '''monolift''' rack allows an athlete to perform a squat without having to take a couple of steps back with weight on as opposed to conventional racks. Not many powerlifting federations allow monolift in competitions (WPO, GPC, IPO).

Other equipment used can include a [[weight lifting belt]] to support the torso and boards to wedge beneath the [[ankle]]s to improve stability and allow a deeper squat ([[Olympic weightlifting#Equipment|weightlifting shoes]] also have wooden wedges built into the sole to achieve the same effect). Wrist straps are another piece of recommended equipment; they support the wrist and help to keep it in a straightened position. They should be wrapped around the wrist, above and below the joint, thus limiting movement of the joint. Heel wedges and related equipment are discouraged by some as they are thought to worsen form over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9963-616-03-8 | title = The Insider's Tell-All Handbook on Weight-Lifting Technique | vauthors = McRobert S | publisher = CS Publishing | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The barbell can also be cushioned with a special padded sleeve.

==World records==
On 8 October 2011, Jonas Rantanen of [[Finland]] performed a squat with a weight of 575&amp;nbsp;kg (1268&amp;nbsp;lb) at the Bullfarm Powerlifting Championships in [[Helsinki]], beating the previous record by Donnie Thompson (USA) of 573&amp;nbsp;kg (1265&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seriouspowerlifting.com/2545/news/jonas-rantanen-breaks-world-record-squat Jonas Rantanen Breaks World Record Squat].

==Variants==
The squat has a number of variants, some of which can be combined:

===Barbell===
[[File:Front-squat-1-857x1024.png|thumb|left|upright|Starting position of a front squat, using the "California" or cross-armed grip.]]
[[File:Zecher-squats-1.gif|thumb|upright|Zercher squat]]
[[File:The Hack Squat George Hackenschmidt.jpg|thumb|right|The Hack squat as pictured page 70 of George Hackenschmidt's book "The Way to Live" (1908)]]
*'''Back squat''' – the bar is held on the back of the body upon the upper trapezius muscle, near to the base of the neck. Alternatively, it may be held lower across the upper back and rear deltoids. In [[powerlifting]] the barbell is often held in a lower position in order to create a lever advantage, while in [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] it is often held in a higher position which produces a posture closer to that of the [[clean and jerk]]. These variations are called '''low bar''' (or '''powerlifting squat''') and '''high bar''' (or '''olympic squat'''), respectively.
**'''Sumo squat ''' – the barbell is rested on the shoulders in the usual squat position. The legs should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart and the feet should be pointed outwards. when squatting, you should feel a stretch on the adductor longues and adductor magnus muscles which are found on the inner thigh.
**'''Box squat''' – at the bottom of the motion the squatter will sit down on a bench or other type of support then rise again. The box squat is commonly utilized by power lifters to train the squat.  Pausing on the box creates additional stimulus in the hips and glutes. Some people believe this form of isometric training allows for greater gains in the squat compared to a traditional Olympic style squat, while others contend that the increased spinal loading creates more opportunity for injury.
*'''Front squat''' – the weight (usually a barbell) is held in front of the body across the [[clavicle]]s and [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]s in either a [[Clean and jerk|clean]] grip, as is used in [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], or with the arms crossed and hands placed on top of the barbell.
*'''Hack squat''' – the barbell is held in the hands just behind the legs; this exercise was first known as Hacke (heel) in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = George | last = Hackenschmidt | title = The Way To Live in Health and Physical Fitness | location = York | year = 1908 | page = 70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to European strength sports expert and Germanist Emmanuel Legeard this name was derived from the original form of the exercise where the heels were joined. The hack squat was thus a squat performed the way Prussian soldiers used to click their heels ("Hacken zusammen").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les Fondamentaux|last = Emmanuel|first = Legeard | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = |year = 2008|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hack squat was popularized in the [[English-speaking countries]] by early 1900s wrestler [[George Hackenschmidt]]. It is also called a "'''rear [[deadlift]]'''".
*'''Overhead squat''' – the barbell is held overhead in a wide-arm [[snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]] grip; however, it is also possible to use a closer grip if balance allows.
*'''Zercher squat''' – the barbell is held in the crooks of the arms, on the inside of the elbow. One method of performing this is to [[deadlift]] the barbell, hold it against the thighs, squat into the lower portion of the squat, and then hold the bar on the thighs as you position the crook of your arm under the bar and then stand up. This sequence is reversed once the desired number of repetitions has been performed. Named after Ed Zercher, a 1930s [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]].
*'''Deep knee bend on toes''' - similar to a normal back squat only the lifter is positioned on their forefeet and toes, with their heels raised, throughout the repetition. Usually, the weight used is not more than moderate in comparison to a flat footed, heavy back squat.
*'''Loaded squat jump''' - the barbell is positioned similarly to a back squat. The exerciser squats down, before moving upwards into a jump, and then landing in approximately the same position. The loaded squat jump is a form of [[Plyometrics#Loaded plyometrics|loaded plyometric]] exercise used to increase explosive power. Variations of this exercise may involve the use of a trap bar or dumbbells.

===Lunge===
*'''Split squat''' – an assisted one-legged squat where the non-lifting leg is rested on the ground a few 'steps' behind the lifter, as if it were a static [[Lunge (exercise)|lunge]].
*'''Bulgarian squat''' – performed much like a split squat, but the foot of the non-lifting leg is rested on a knee-high platform behind the lifter.

===Other===
*'''Belt squat''' – is an exercise performed the same as other squat variations except the weight is attached to a hip belt i.e. a [[dip belt]]
*'''Goblet squat''' – a squat performed while holding a [[kettlebell]] next to one's chest and abdomen with both hands.
*'''Sissy squat''' – a squat with several sorts (dumbbell, weight plate, [[Smith machine]], barbell, bodyweight). In the most common  variant, a dumbbell is held behind the legs while the heels are lifted off the ground and the torso remains flat while the lifter leans backwards; sometimes done with a plate held on the chest and one arm holding onto a chair or beam for support. Unlike most other squat variations, [[Vince Gironda]] promoted sissy squat as a [[rectus femoris]] isolation exercise.
*'''Smith squat''' – a squat using a Smith machine. Hack squats can be done easily this way, as in the picture. A Smith squat is often considered inferior to the free-weight variant because of the lack of recruitment of auxiliary muscles and limited range of movement.
*'''Trap bar squat''' – a [[trap bar]] is held with hands at the sides. This movement is more correctly called a lift.

===Bodyweight===
[[File:Kniebeuge.jpg|thumb|left|Bodyweight squat]]
*'''Bodyweight squat''' – done with no weight or barbell, often at higher repetitions than other variants.
*'''Overhead squat''' – a non-weight bearing variation of the squat exercise, with the hands facing each other overhead, biceps aligned with the ears, and feet hip-width apart. This exercise is a predictor of total-body flexibility, mobility, and possible lower body dysfunction.
*'''Face the wall squat''' – performed with or without weights. It is primarily to strengthen the vertebrae tissues.{{vague|date=October 2014}} In the Chinese variant (面壁蹲墙) weights are not used. Toes, knees and nose line up almost touching the wall. Advanced forms include shoeless, wrists crossed behind the back, and fists in front of forehead, all performed with toes and knees closed and touching the wall.
[[File:Squat, baithak, Hindu squat, possibly 'The Great Gamma'.png|thumb|A photo of an Indian wrestler performing baithaks (Hindu squats).]]
*'''Hindu squat''' – also called a baithak, or a deep knee bend on toes. It is performed without weight, with the heels raised, and body weight placed on the forefeet and toes; during the movement, the knees track far past the toes. The baithak was a staple exercise of ancient Indian wrestlers. It develops strength, endurance and flexibility throughout the legs, calves, lower back and thighs. To perform a baithak, the exerciser stands on their forefeet with their hands by their sides. They bend their legs and squat down. They then stand up again. There is only a relatively small movement of the arms.
*'''Hindu Jumper Squat''' – Done without weight. Similar to Hindu squat, but a bounce / light forward or backward jump of about six inches is added before and after each rep. Then land in a squat with heels elevated. Then jump back to the starting position. Repeat as many times as you can.
*'''Jump squat''' – a [[plyometrics]] exercise where the squatter engages in a rapid eccentric contraction and jumps forcefully off the floor at the top of the range of motion.
*'''Pistol''' – a bodyweight single leg squat done to full depth, while the other leg is extended off the floor. Sometimes dumbbells, kettlebells or [[medicine balls]] are added for resistance.
*'''Shrimp squat''' – also called the ''flamingo squat'', a version of the pistols squat where instead of extending the non-working leg out in front, it is bent and placed behind the working leg while squatting, perhaps held behind in a hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight-exercises/ Periodic Table of Bodyweight Exercises with Clickable Videos]. Strength.stack52.com. Retrieved on 2015-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pistol squat.jpg|thumb|right|Medicine ball pistol squat]]
*'''Monkey F*****''' – In American military training, this type of squat is used to warm up before a session of physical exercise. It is performed by the person standing with feet at distance of shoulder length. In a bent position and the arms goes between the legs, and around to the outside of the ankles and grab the back of the ankle. During this exercise the hips are lowered repeatedly, and the appearance of this exercise lead to its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ltugAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25&amp;lpg=PT25&amp;dq=monkey+fucker+exercise&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9YuzN5Dq7g&amp;sig=mQiyxkJLvIQzqjoO0fHpnRAALnA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjijKyi35DdAhWHL48KHRchDZE4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=monkey+fucker+exercise&amp;f=false|title=Combat and Other Shenanigans: A Humorous Memoir from the Iraq War|first=Piers|last=Platt|date=25 February 2014|publisher=Piers Platt|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injury considerations==
Although the squat has long been a basic element of weight training, it has in recent years been the subject of considerable controversy.  Some trainers allege that squats are associated with injuries to the [[Lumbar vertebrae|lumbar spine]] and [[knee]]s.&lt;ref name = SST120&gt;[[#SST|Cornacchia]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HNkMkJ9XOwC&amp;pg=PA120 120].&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, continue to advocate the squat as one of the best exercises for building muscle and strength. Some coaches maintain that [[incomplete squat]]s (those terminating above parallel) are both less effective and more likely to cause injury&lt;ref name="Starting Strength"/&gt; than a [[full squat]] (terminating with hips at or below knee level). A 2013 review concluded that deep squats performed with proper technique do not lead to increased rates of degenerative knee injuries and are an effective exercise. The same review also concluded that shallower squats may lead to degeneration in the lumbar spine and knees in the long-term.&lt;ref name="Hartmann2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartmann H, Wirth K, Klusemann M | title = Analysis of the load on the knee joint and vertebral column with changes in squatting depth and weight load | journal = Sports Medicine | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 993–1008 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23821469 | doi = 10.1007/s40279-013-0073-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squats Used in Physical Therapy===
[[File:Kirk-karwoski-squat.jpg|thumb|Man completing a heavy squat exercise. ]]

Squats can be used for some rehabilitative activities because they hone stability without excessive compression on the tibiofemoral joint and anterior cruciate ligament.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaberzadeh S, Yeo D, Zoghi M | title = The Effect of Altering Knee Position and Squat Depth on VMO : VL EMG Ratio During Squat Exercises | journal = Physiotherapy Research International | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 164–73 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 25962352 | doi = 10.1002/pri.1631 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that deeper squats are associated with higher compressive loads on patellofemoral joint.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; As a result, it is possible that people who suffer from pain in the patellofemoral joint cannot squat at increased depths. For some knee rehabilitation activities, patients might feel more comfortable with knee flexion between 0 and 50° because it places less force compared to deeper depths.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Another study shows that decline squats at angles higher than 16° may not be beneficial for the knee and fails to decrease calf tension.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Other studies have indicated that the best squat to hone quadriceps without inflaming the patellofemoral joint occurs between 0–50°.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Combining single-limb squats and decline angles have been used to rehabilitate knee extensors.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jim | name-list-format = vanc |date=2008|title=A Biomechanical Investigation of a Single-Limb Squat: Implications for Lower Extremity Rehabilitation Exercise.|url=https://login.libproxy.scu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=34918982&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=43|pages=477–482|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducting squats at a declined angle allows the knee to flex despite possible pain or lack of mobilization in the ankle.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; If therapists are looking to focus on the knee during squats, one study shows that doing single-limb squats at a 16° decline angle has the greatest activation of the knee extensors without placing excessive pressure on the ankles.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This same study also found that a 24° decline angle can be used to strengthen ankles and knee extensors.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

'''Strong for Surgery''' is a [[public health]] campaign and quality improvement (QI) initiative launched in Washington State in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strong for Surgery Launches Awareness Campaign to Advance Pre-Surgical Healthcare Quality Improvement|agency=PR Newswire|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong for Surgery works with participating hospitals and clinics to integrate checklists into the pre-operative phase of clinical practice for elective surgeries. The checklists are used to screen patients for potential risk factors that can lead to surgical complications, in order to provide appropriate interventions to ensure better surgical outcomes. The checklists target four areas which are known to be highly-influential determinants of surgical outcomes: Nutrition, Glycemic Control, Medication Management, and Smoking Cessation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landro|first1=Laura|title=Need Surgery?

[[File:Kortill Vanster - geograph.org.uk - 126160.jpg|thumb|The company's main treatment works are on the right]]
'''Veolia Water East''', formerly known as '''Tendring Hundred Water Services''', was a privately owned company supplying water to the [[Tendring District|Tendring]] peninsula in north east [[Essex]] within an area of {{Convert|352|km2|sqmi}}. In July 2009, the company, a subsidiary of [[Veolia Water]] UK since 1989, part of [[Veolia Environment]], changed its name from Tendring Hundred Water.

In 2012, following the sale of Veolia Water's UK water supply business, it was merged with [[Veolia Water Southeast]] and [[Veolia Water Central]] to form [[Affinity Water]] on 1 October 2012.

The drinking '''[[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]''' sector in '''[[Guatemala]]''' is characterized by low and inconsistent service coverage, especially in rural areas; unclear allocation of management responsibilities; and little or no regulation and monitoring of service provision.

== Access ==
In 2015, around 1 million people lacked access to "improved" water and 6 million lacked access to [[Improved sanitation|"improved" sanitation]]. In Guatemala, 93% of the total population had access to "improved" water, 98% of the urban population and 87% of the rural population. As for sanitation, 64% of the total population, 78% and 49%, urban and rural respectively, had access to "improved" sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://washwatch.org/en/countries/guatemala/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Guatemala|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wssinfo.org/documents/?tx_displaycontroller%5Bregion%5D=&amp;tx_displaycontroller%5Bsearch_word%5D=guatemala&amp;tx_displaycontroller%5Btype%5D=country_files|title=WHO / UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme: Documents|website=www.wssinfo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]] [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]], access to water and sanitation services has slowly risen over the years in Guatemala. In 1990, 81% of the total population had access to improved water sources, while in 2004, 90% of the population had access. Sanitation coverage has also risen, from 62% of the total population having access to adequate sanitation in 1990, to 86% with access in 2004. The government of Guatemala estimates that the population with access to water services is growing at a rate of at least 100,001 people every year.&lt;ref name="iadb.org"&gt;[[Inter-American Development Bank]]. 2003.

Accurate and reliable data regarding coverage in rural areas is unavailable. Conflicting statistics as to the percentages of the population using improved drinking water sources present difficulties in assessing the seriousness of the problem. Although the data above shows that water and sanitation coverage in both rural and urban areas is fairly high in Guatemala, the National Water and Sanitation Information System (Sistema Nacional de Informacion de Agua y Saneamiento) (SAS), which collects and maintains information regarding water and sanitation in rural communities, released information in 2002 indicating that only 53% of homes (it is assumed that this statistic refers to households in rural areas due to the rural focus of SAS) had access to water services.&lt;ref name="lib.utexas.edu"&gt;[[United Nations Development Program]]. 2002. “Metas del Milenio: Informe de Avance de Guatemala”. Guatemala. [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/benson/lagovdocs/guatemala/federal/presidente/metas/metas-2002.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The SAS considers accessible services to be less than 1&amp;nbsp;kilometer from a home and that at least 20&amp;nbsp;liters of water is available to each person every day.&lt;ref name="lib.utexas.edu"/&gt; While 24,000 rural communities exist in Guatemala, SAS has only collected data from 36% of these, making it difficult to determine the actual number of individuals lacking services.&lt;ref name="iadb.org" /&gt; 
  
Access to water in urban areas is irregular, as 80% of urban water systems function for an average of 12&amp;nbsp;hours every day.&lt;ref name="bvsde.paho.org"&gt;Organización Panamericana de la Salud (OPS), OMS. 2000. “Evaluación de los Servicios de Agua Potable y Saneamiento 2000 en las Américas.”  [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/eswww/eva2000/guatemala/caliserv/calidad.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As of the year 2000, 25% of water in urban systems was disinfected and only 1% of all collected sewage water has been treated.&lt;ref name="bvsde.paho.org" /&gt;

== Quality of service ==
The water and sanitation sector in Guatemala is characterized by “low coverage, poor [[Water supply#Service quality|quality services]], and deteriorating physical assets,”&lt;ref name="iadb.org" /&gt; related to a need for increased investments in basic infrastructures. Population growth, [[agricultural expansion]], unevenly distributed services, and polluted sources have contributed to the inability of citizens to access adequate amounts of clean water.

== History and recent events ==
[[File:Un-guatemala.png|thumb|450px|A map of Guatemala.]]
{{See also|Guatemalan civil war}}

In 1996 the government of Guatemala and the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]], the guerilla movement, signed a peace accord which ended 36&amp;nbsp;years of a civil, guerilla war.&lt;ref name="lib.utexas.edu"/&gt; This conflict left over 100,000 Guatemalans dead and created over 1&amp;nbsp;million internally displaced refugees.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;[[Central Intelligence Agency]]. 2006. The World Factbook. Guatemala. [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gt.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This recent tumultuous history, along with a fairly new constitution written in 1985 and then again amended in 1993, can explain a lack of information regarding water and sanitation, as well as low service coverage.

While many improvements have been made since the end of the war, Guatemala continually suffers from political violence and corruption, drug trafficking, and a large trade deficit.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; In light of these problems, it has been difficult for the national government to raise funds internally, or to attract assistance and investment from international donors and financial institutions.&lt;ref name="waterforpeople.org"&gt;[http://www.waterforpeople.org/programs/central-america/guatemala.html  Water for People. 2005. “Strategy Paper-Guatemala.”]&lt;/ref&gt; These financial setbacks prevent needed improvements in the countries’ general infrastructure, such as education, public health, and water and sanitation systems.

From 1991 to 1998 the President of the Republic created a Secretary of Hydrological Resources whose mission was to order and plan the water sector and to make a Water Law.&lt;ref name="marn.gob.gt" /&gt; Several proposals for the law were turned down, largely due to the lack of a legal and institutional framework for managing water resources in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="marn.gob.gt" /&gt;

In 1995 COPECAS, in collaboration with other principal institutions, conducted a country-wide analysis of water and sanitation to address disorganization, contradictions and discrepancies in the sector.&lt;ref name="bvsde.paho.org" /&gt; This study led to changes in the coordination and management of the sector, such as giving INFOM the responsibility to manage the sector.

In 1999 the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA) was given responsibility for creating an Integrated Management Plan for Hydrological Resources, which will focus on water resources in terms of a political, legal and institutional framework, information and sustainability, and education.&lt;ref name="bvsde.paho.org" /&gt;

In 2002 the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] gave Guatemala support for the reform and reorganization of INFOM in order to better serve and assist municipalities.&lt;ref name="iadb.org" /&gt;

== Responsibilities for water and sanitation ==

=== Policy ===

There are a multitude of government entities involved in water and sanitation and none of them has been assigned a clear leadership role in the sector. The [http://www.mspas.gob.gt/ Ministry of Health], the Municipal Development Agency (Instituto de Fomento Municipal)([http://www.infom.org.gt/ INFOM]), the [http://www.marn.gob.gt/ Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources] and the [http://www.segeplan.gob.gt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=108 Planning Secretariat] in the President's Office and all have a role, albeit ill-defined, in determining policies and strategies for water and sanitation, as well as for water resources management.&lt;ref&gt;Latinosan 2007 - Conferencia Latinoamericana de Saneamiento: Informe de Guatemala, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

INFOM, created in 1957, is a decentralized public institution whose mission is to support municipalities through the provision of administrative, financial, and technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infom.org.gt/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1  Instituto de Fomento Municipal (INFOM). 2006. Gobierno de Guatemala]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the Government Decree 376-97 gave INFOM the responsibility to manage the political and strategic aspects of the water and sanitation sector in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="iadb.org" /&gt;

In the same year, the Executive Unit of the Rural Aqueduct Program (Unidad Ejectora del Programa de Acueductos Rurales) (UNEPAR) and the Highlands Drinking Water and Sanitation Project (Proyecto de Agua Potable y Saneamiento del Altiplano) (PAYSA), programs for rural water and sanitation that had formerly been under the Ministry of Health, were placed under the management of INFOM. Although UNEPAR is placed under INFOM it continues to have separate financing from the national budget as well as the German Development Bank [[KfW]].&lt;ref name="iadb.org" /&gt; UNEPAR also manages the data base of SAS.

A Permanent Coordinating Committee for Water and Sanitation (Comité Permanente de Coordinación de Agua y Saneamiento) (COPECAS) was created in 1985 by the Government Decree (Acuerdo Gubernativo) 10036-85 to coordinate the work of all public agencies in the water and sanitation sector,&lt;ref name="Ambiente 1997"&gt;Centro Panamericano de Ingeniería Sanitaria y Ciencias del Ambiente (CEPIS). 1997. “Progress in the Privatization of Water-Related Public Services: Country-by-Country Review for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.” Guatemala. [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/muwww/fulltext/ppm/ppmguat.html]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is inactive. The committee is supported by the Pan–American Health Organization ([[PAHO]]).&lt;ref name=Colom&gt;{{cite web|last=Colom de Moran|first=Elisa|year=2005|title=Estudio de los Cambios Legales en el Marco de la Privatizacion del Agua en Guatemala.|publisher=Menschenrecht Wasser, Brot fur die Welt|location=Germany|url=http://www.menschen-recht-wasser.de/downloads/Situacion_Legal_del_Agua_en_Guatemala.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no law granting all people the right to clean drinking water in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="waterforpeople.org"/&gt;

=== Regulation===
'''The Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS)''' is legally responsible for monitoring drinking water quality at a national level.&lt;ref name="Ambiente 1997"/&gt;
They provide water quality testing services for private and public operators.

'''The Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN)''', along with INFOM, is officially responsible for environmental regulation in the water and sanitation sector.&lt;ref name=Colom/&gt; However, there is no real effective environmental management in the sector.&lt;ref name="bvsde.paho.org" /&gt;

Economic regulation in the sector is practically non-existent. Tariffs for service provision are determined by politics, and there are no organizations which monitor providers in order to detect abuses of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Centro Panamericano de Ingeniería Sanitaria y Ciencias del Ambiente (CEPIS). 2000. “Evaluación de los Servicios de Agua Potable y Saneamiento 2000 en las Américas”. Guatemala. [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/eswww/eva2000/guatemala/informe.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Provision of services===

According to the law the provision of services is a responsibility of municipalities. Article 253 of the Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala gives the country's 332 [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipalities]] the responsibility to use their resources to provide public services.&lt;ref name="pdba.georgetown.edu"&gt;[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Guate/guate93.html  Republic of Guatemala. “1985 Constitution with 1993 Reforms.”]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the Municipal Code published as Government Decree 12-2002 confirmed the legal responsibility of municipalities to deliver public services, including water and sanitation, to all those living in urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name="iadb.org" /&gt;

Municipalities have a difficult time serving urban and especially rural areas due to a lack of resources. In reality, therefore, a variety of public, communal and private entities provide services alongside the municipalities.

==== Direct municipal service provision ====

Water and sanitation services can be provided directly by a single municipality or through a group of municipalities who are organized to provide services together (“mancomunidades”).&lt;ref name="iadb.org" /&gt;

==== Municipal companies ====

The Municipality of [[Guatemala City]] created the Municipal Water Company (Empresa Municipal de Agua) (EMPAGUA) in 1972 to manage Guatemala City’s sewage and water services. Today it is the largest municipal water provider in the country.&lt;ref name="Ambiente 1997"/&gt; XELAGUA manages the water supplies in [[Quetzaltenango]], Guatemala’s second largest city.&lt;ref name="bvsde.paho.org" /&gt;

==== Bulk water provision to Guatemala City ====

The Executive Unit of the National Xayá-Pixcayá Aqueduct (Unidad Ejecutora del Acueducto Nacional Xayá-Pixcayá), managed under the Ministry of Public Communications, Transportation and Labor, administers, operates, and maintains the National Aqueduct which supplies bulk water to [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref name="Ambiente 1997"/&gt;

==== Local private operators in Guatemala City ====

Several independent companies distribute potable water by tanker trucks and through private networks to rural and urban communities, serving at least 32% of [[Guatemala City]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;Solo, Tova Maria. 2003 . “Independent Water Entrepreneurs in Latin America: The other private sector in water services.” Washington, D.C.: [http://water.worldbank.org/publications/independent-water-entrepreneurs-latin-america-other-private-sector-water-services World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''National Mariscal Water Company (Compañía Nacional de Agua de Mariscal)''' is the largest and oldest of these companies, providing services to approximately 14% of the population of Guatemala City.&lt;ref name="Ambiente 1997"/&gt;

==== Community-based organizations ====

Communities themselves, through water committees (Comités administradores de agua potable, or CAAP), provide services in rural areas. Water committees are considered to be private operators and are regulated by the Civil Code. Committees are elected by community members and are responsible for the collection of tariffs and the operation and maintenance of the system.&lt;ref name="iadb.org" /&gt;

It is written in Article 122 of the Constitution that all land within a 50-meter radius of a source of water is owned by the government of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="pdba.georgetown.edu"/&gt; Communities and other private operators must purchase the land and water rights for a water source before developing a new system.

=== Assistance to community-based organizations ===

Assistance to community-based service providers is a key function in the water and sanitation sector. In Guatemala this function is not clearly assigned to a government institution. INFOM, through UNEPAR (see above under policy), does provide this function. In addition, many [[NGO]]s also support community-based organizations.

One of them is Servicios para el Desarrollo (SER), a local NGO dedicated entirely to water and sanitation through its program "Agua para todos". Created in 1996, SER counts among its ranks 14 professionals from various disciplines dedicated to support communities in finding sustainable integrated, sustainable and affordable water and sanitation solutions. It also tries to raise the awareness of civil society and the state concerning water and sanitation, and undertakes research and documentation to systematically assess experiences in the sector.

Another is [[Agua del Pueblo]] (AdP) [http://www.aguadelpueblo.org/]. Founded in 1972 in San Lucas Toliman, AdP has constructed more than 700 rural potable water projects. The State of Missouri incorporated the non-profit Agua del Pueblo-USA in 1973.  At the time the state of Missouri only allowed English-named corporations.  Agua del Pueblo-USA is also known as the People's Consultants [https://sites.google.com/site/thepeoplesconsultants/].&lt;ref&gt;Chipman, C., V. Strait and B Clemens, 2014 "Who Cares About the Community? Agua del Pueblo as a case study for water-related non-profit work": American Journal of Social Issues and Humanities 4(6): 319-334.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually Agua del Pueblo's founders incorporated the Guatemalan: "Associacion para Agua del Pueblo"AdP is now headquartered in Quezaltenango with offices in Coban, Alta Vera Paz and Poptun, El Peten. AdP uses water as a means to the ultimate goal of rural development.&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, M. S Smith and B Clemens 2012 “Does it pay to invest in potable water in the developing world: Relationships between external financing and economic development in sustainable community-run integrated projects” Journal of International Development Article: first published online: 27 SEP: DOI: 10.1002/jid.2880&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, several faith-based NGO's such as Water For Life International (www.h2oforlife.org), have been actively drilling fresh water wells, providing sanitation and educating the rural population about hygiene and health. Most of these groups have locations both in Guatemala and in the USA. Most also accept volunteers interested in helping Guatemala's poor overcome water poverty and provide ways in which to get involved.

==Financial aspects==

=== Tariffs and cost recovery ===

Water tariffs for municipally-managed systems are set by municipal councils for urban areas and by water users, through general meetings of users, for rural areas. In the case of privately owned small networks, which exist mainly in Guatemala City, and private water tankers, tariffs and prices are set by the private service providers. Since metering is not common, tariffs usually take the form of a monthly flat fee. Tariffs vary greatly from one locality to the other. In Guatemala city it stood at US$2.1 per month for 15&amp;nbsp;cubic meters, while in other towns it was as low as US$0.5 per month for 7.5&amp;nbsp;cubic meters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winisisonline.com.ar/ser/downloads/SITUACION%20DEL%20AGUA/SA%20(0034).pdf Nuevas opciones publicas-privadas para el financiamiento de sistemas rurales/aislados INFOM 2003 Carlos García Bickford] p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost recovery in municipal and communal systems is generally low and usually revenues are barely sufficient to cover operating costs and routine maintenance. However, there are exceptions. For example, a program supported by USAID since 1992 in the Altiplano required communities to repay 50% of investment costs, which they did with only very limited payment arrears, showing the willingness of communities to pay for water supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winisisonline.com.ar/ser/downloads/SITUACION%20DEL%20AGUA/SA%20(0034).pdf Nuevas opciones publicas-privadas para el financiamiento de sistemas rurales/aislados INFOM 2003 Carlos García Bickford] p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investment ===

In 2005 investments in water and sanitation stood at only US$14&amp;nbsp;million or about US$1/capita, one of the lowest levels in Latin America.&lt;ref name="Saneamiento p. 1"/&gt;

In 1999 investments had been much higher. The [[WHO]] estimated them at Quetzales 285.8&amp;nbsp;million (US$37.1).&lt;ref name="Salud 2000"&gt;Organización Panamericana de la Salud (OPS), OMS. 2000. “Evaluación de los Servicios de Agua Potable y Saneamiento 2000 en las Américas.” Quoted from public investment Branco of the Secretaría de Planificación y Programación de la Presidencia (SEGEPLAN).  [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/eswww/eva2000/guatemala/caliserv/calidad.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
This represented approximately 0.2% of the [[Gross Domestic Product]] and 1.5% of total government expenditures for 1999.&lt;ref name="Salud 2000" /&gt;
Spending by the central government increased dramatically in the sector, with only US$6.07&amp;nbsp;million spent in 1995 to US$56.13&amp;nbsp;million spent in 1998.&lt;ref name="bvsde.paho.org" /&gt;
Investments in the sector lagged far behind other sectors in 1998, especially when taking into consideration the previously small investments made in water and sanitation. For example, spending in each of the sectors of Education, Culture and Sports; Transportation; Defense and Security; and Work and Social Provision, exceeded that of the sector for Water and Sanitation by an average of 900%.&lt;ref name="bvsde.paho.org" /&gt;

Government sponsored investment is channeled through various organizations, including INFOM and UNEPAR, the Ministry of Health, the Social Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversión Social) (FIS), and the National Fund for Peace (Fondo Nacional para la Paz) (FONAPAZ).&lt;ref name="bvsde.paho.org" /&gt;
The lack of cohesion amongst these organizations prohibits the coordinated growth and advancement of the water and sanitation sector. Various [[NGO]]s directly assist communities, especially in rural areas.

=== Financing ===

A large share of the financing for water and sanitation comes from foreign donors. Communities and local governments, however, also make significant contributions in the form of unqualified labor, local materials and cash contributions. For example, under the program "Agua, fuente de paz" initiated in 1992, communities contributed 35% and local governments and other local stakeholders 25% of project costs, with only 40% financed by donors. The program supported 800 rural communities, focusing on those in extreme poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Latinosan 2007 - Conferencia Latinoamericana de Saneamiento: Informe de Guatemala, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== External support ==

The main donors currently active in the sector are the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and [[NGO]]s such as [[CARE (relief)]] and Agua del Pueblo. Since 1994, the FIS has invested US$160&amp;nbsp;million in water and sanitation projects.&lt;ref name="iadb.org" /&gt;

=== Interamerican Development Bank ===

A US$100,000 technical assistance grant for the [http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=GU-T1034&amp;Language=English GU-T1034 : Strengthening Office of the Presidential Commissioner for Water] was approved in September 2005.

A loan of $50&amp;nbsp;million for a [http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=GU0150&amp;Language=English GU0150 : Rural Water Investment Program]
was approved in 2003 for the construction of potable water and sanitation projects to benefit a minimum of 500,000 new rural consumers. Loan components also include institutional strengthening of INFOM and community strengthening.

=== KfW ===

KfW supported rural water and sanitation through a series of four projects implemented by UNEPAR and INFOM. The first three projects, executed between 1987 and 1998, benefited 165 communities in the western and eastern departments at a cost of 28&amp;nbsp;million Euros. A 2005 evaluation found that about 90% of the water systems were "properly operated and maintained", although only very few water committees disinfected water. The report also states that latrines built with support of the project were in good conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/ebank/EN_Home/About_Us/Local_Presence/LatinAmeri90/Office_Guatemala/index.jsp KfW Rural Water and Sanitation Projects 2005 Closing Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

loan for community based projects implemented by the Social Fund FIS. The project was approved in 1998 and closed in 2003. It included 14% (US$7&amp;nbsp;million) dedicated to water and sanitation.&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;{{cite web

[[Water supply]] and [[sanitation]] in [[Panama]] is characterized by relatively high levels of access compared to other Latin American countries. However, challenges remain, especially in rural areas.

== Access ==
According to the [http://www.minsa.gob.pa/ Ministry of Health], in 2006 97% had access to potable water and also 97% had access to at least basic sanitation. [[WHO]]'s and [[UNICEF]]'s [http://www.wssinfo.org/about-the-jmp/introduction/ Joint Monitoring Program (JMP)] estimates access to improved water supply in 2004 at 97% in urban areas and 82% in rural areas, while access to improved sanitation was 75% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas. The table below is updated with 2009 JMP data for water and sanitation coverage.

== Service quality ==
Despite a lack of statistical data about water quality and continuity of supply, potable water is perceived to be of good quality in Panama and most users receive continuous service.

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==
Responsibilities for the sector are allocated by the '''Panamanian Water Law''', which was approved in 1997. As of 2016, the government considered reforming the water sector. by breaking up IDAAN into municipal-level service companies.&lt;ref name="Reforma IDAAN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Idaan sería convertido en varias empresas para optimizar el servicio|url=http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/nacion/idaan-seria-convertido-en-varias-empresas-para-optimizar-el-servicio-1039740|publisher=Panama Americas|accessdate=26 August 2016|date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Panama-CIA WFB Map.png|550px|thumb|A map of Panama.]]

=== Policy and regulation ===
The [http://www.minsa.gob.pa Panamanian Health Ministry] is responsible for defining the sector's policy, whereas the ''Autoridad Nacional de los Servicios Públicos'' [http://www.asep.gob.pa/default.asp/ ASEP] or National Authority for Public Services acts as regulatory agency.

Responsibility for water resources is vested in two institutions: The [http://www.anam.gob.pa ''Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente''] or National Environment Authority and the [http://www.acp.gob.pa ''Autoridad del Canal de Panamá''] or Panama Canal Authority.

=== Service provision ===
According to the Water Law, the ''Instituto de Acueductos y Alcantarillados Nacionales'' ([http://www.IDAAN.gob.pa IDAAN]) is responsible for water and sanitation services in urban areas with more than 1,500 inhabitants, thus preventing decentralization to municipalities. The only exception is the municipality of [[Boquete]], which manages its own water supply and sanitation system.

There are approximately 3,300 water supply systems in rural areas, of which 1,800 are managed by ''Juntas Administrativas de Acueductos Rurales'' (JAARs) or Rural Water Boards. The remaining are managed by Health Committees.

== History and recent developments ==
[[Image:Colon Panama.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Colón, Panama|Colón]], Panama.]]
IDAAN was created in 1961 and was made responsible for investments in water supply in urban areas and a significant increase in coverage of potable water and - to a lesser extent - sanitation. The institution disposed of high financial capacities and human resources during its first decades. However, IDAAN's financial situation deteriorated significantly due the absence of any tariff increase until 1982.

To face up IDAAN's weakness, its privatization was proposed at the end of the 1990s, following the telecommunications and electricity sector. At the same time, an agency for economic regulation of public services was created, which is now the ANSP. In 1997, a Water Law was adopted, defining the regulatory and institutional framework for water supply and sanitation.

Privatization was abandoned until a change of government in 1999. Under [[Mireya Moscoso]]'s administration, [http://repository.unm.edu//handle/1928/12517/ Law 77] was approved to modify the Water Law, permitting privatization and strengthening IDAAN. To significantly increase IDAAN's investments in urban areas, the government decided in 2003 to use financial resources earned through the telecommunication and electricity companies' privatization.

In 2006, the government of [[Martín Torrijos]] established the ''Programa de Desarrollo Comunitario para Infraestructura Pública'' (PRODEC) or Community Development for Public Infrastructure Program (see below).

== Tariffs and cost recovery ==
Neither the tariffs of IDAAN, nor rural tariffs are sufficiently high to cover investment costs. In 2011 IDAAN incurred operating costs (including depreciation) of 131 million Balboas (one Balboa equals one US dollar) and had operating revenues of only 104 million Balboas, resulting in an operating deficit of 27 million Balboas. This was the second-highest annual operating deficit since 1994. Prior to 1994 IDAAN had a small operating surplus in most years.&lt;ref&gt; Autoridad Nacional de los Servicios Publicos (ASEP), Direccion Nacional de Electricidad, Agua Potable y Alcantarillado Sanitario: [http://200.46.47.233/images/estadisticas_actualizada_mensualmente_2012_de_agua/INGRESOS%20Y%20GASTOS%20OPERATIVOS%201984-2010-%202011%20IDAAN%20(%2020%20).pdf Compendio historico de los ingresos y gastos operativos de los principales rubros del IDAAN, año 1984-2012], retrieved on June 30, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; The tariff structure does not provide incentives to save water. Since half of urban and almost all rural users don't dispose of water meters, those users do not receive bills based on consumption.&lt;ref&gt; Autoridad Nacional de los Servicios Publicos (ASEP):[http://www.asep.gob.pa/agua/Anexos/TARIFA_1_IDAAN2.pdf Tarifas de Agua y Alcantarillado del IDAAN], retrieved on June 30, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

Those who have meters pay a fixed tariff for the first 8,000 gallons (30 cubic meters) each month in Panama City and for 6,000 gallons (23 cubic meters) in other cities and towns. These consumption levels are far above a basic water need of 50 liter per capita per day which corresponds to 6 cubic meters per month for a family of four. In 2012 the monthly residential water and sewer bill for a consumption of 30 cubic meters was 7.92 Balboas in Panama City (0.26 Cents per cubic meter) and 6.56 Balboas in other cities (0.29 Cents per cubic meter).&lt;ref&gt; Autoridad Nacional de los Servicios Publicos (ASEP):[http://www.asep.gob.pa/agua/Anexos/TARIFA_1_IDAAN2.pdf Tarifas de Agua y Alcantarillado del IDAAN], retrieved on June 30, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; This compares to USD 3 per cubic meter for residential water use in, for example, Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As of 2016, water users had accumulated substantial arrears in water bill payments to IDAAN. The utility is owed $104 million USD in past-due bills, of which $79 million USD is from residential customers, $16 million USD from public agencies and $10 million USD from businesses. IDAAN has disconnected many customers in an effort to secure payments.&lt;ref name="Reforma IDAAN"/&gt;

== Investment and financing ==
In 2005, IDAAN invested US$49m in urban areas. FIS and MINSA invested a much lower amount in rural areas. The bulk of investments was in water supply, while much less was invested in sanitation. PRODEC aims at investing US$100m of the Panama Canal's gains into community infrastructure, including water supply and sanitation. The use of these funds is decided on a participatory basis through consultative councils at the local level. Furthermore, the National Investment Fund invests in potable water, in particular in rural areas.

== External support ==
The World Bank supports the sector through a US$32m loan for the Water Supply and Sanitation in Low-Income Communities Project which is executed by the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt; [http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P082419 Worldbank: Water Supply and Sanitation in Low-Income Communities]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) supports the sector through various projects. The US$45m Panama City and Bay of Panama Sanitation Project, approved in 2006 and executed by the Ministry of Health, supports the extension of the capital's sanitation network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=PN0062&amp;Language=English IDB: Panama City and Bay of Panama Sanitation Project]&lt;/ref&gt; The sustainable development projects in [[Darién Province]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=PN0116&amp;Language=English IDB: Darien Sustainable Development]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bocas del Toro Province]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=PN-L1016&amp;Language=English IDB: Multiphase Sustainable Development Program for Bocas del Toro - Phase II]&lt;/ref&gt; include support of water supply and sanitation systems. 

The Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) supports sanitation in the city and the bay of Panama through a loan for constructing a sewage plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbic.go.jp/autocontents/english/news/2007/000087/index.htm JBIC Provides Japanese ODA Loan to Panama]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) approved a loan to support sanitation in Panama City in 2007.

==Education and career==
DeJong received his AB degree from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1973, and subsequently received his MA and PhD from [[Stanford University]]. He received his PhD in 1977 in [[social psychology]]. From 1995 to 2004, he was the director of the [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse and Violence Prevention]].&lt;ref name=bu&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/william-dejong/ | title=William DeJong, PhD | work=Boston University | accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
DeJong's research covers multiple areas in the field of [[public health]], including [[alcohol control|alcohol]] and [[tobacco control]], health communications, and health promotion.&lt;ref name=bu/&gt; In 2014, he co-authored a [[review article]] that found that the United States' [[legal drinking age]] of 21 had saved lives since it was raised to that level as a result of a law passed in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeJong|first1=W|last2=Blanchette|first2=J|title=Case closed: research evidence on the positive public health impact of the age 21 minimum legal drinking age in the United States.|journal=Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs. Supplement|date=2014|volume=75 Suppl 17|pages=108–15|pmid=24565317|lay-url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/24/study-the-debate-is-over-higher-drinking-age-saves-lives|lay-source=U.S. News &amp; World Report|lay-date=24 February 2014|doi=10.15288/jsads.2014.75.108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
DeJong has been critical of [[designated driver]] programs, saying in 1994 that there was no evidence that they were effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-12-30/news/9412300160_1_designated-driver-programs-designated-driver-idea-drunk | title=Designated Driver A Good Idea Some Say Is Backfiring | work=Chicago Tribune | date=30 December 1994 | accessdate=3 March 2016 | author=Armstrong, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, when [[California State University]] adopted a new set of anti-drinking policies such as treatment programs and advisory boards, DeJong said that this represented a major change from the previous approach most schools used to address drinking on their campuses, which previously focused mainly on communicating messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/12/local/me-21429 | title=Cal State OKs Assault on Student Drinking | work=Los Angeles Times | date=12 July 2001 | accessdate=3 March 2016 | author=Rhone, Nedra}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also said that almost all experts agree that [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] is effective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-01/news/mn-19199_1_alcoholics-anonymous | title=AA Quietly Marks 60 Years of Deep Impact on Society | work=Los Angeles Times | date=1 July 1995 | accessdate=3 March 2016 | author=Perry, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has harshly criticized the alcoholic beverage industry for, according to him, "rely to a great extent on underage drinkers and abusive drinkers for the profits that they make."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2014/11/28/the_alcohol_industry_doesnt_want_you_to_drink_responsibly_partner/ | title=The alcohol industry doesn’t want you to drink responsibly | work=Salon | date=28 November 2014 | accessdate=3 March 2016 | author=Silverstein, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;
