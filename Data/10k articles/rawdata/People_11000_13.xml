      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5944">'''Abdul Majid''' ({{lang-ar| عبد المجيد }}) is a Muslim male given name and, in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''[[Majid (given name)|Majid]]''. The name means "servant of the All-glorious", ''Al-Majīd'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''e''. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part may appear as Majid, Majeed, Mecid (Turkish), Magid (Egyptian) or in other ways. The whole name is subject to variable spacing and hyphenation. 

There is a distinct but closely related name, '''Abdul Maajid''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الماجد }}), with a similar meaning, formed on the Qur'anic name ''Al-Mājid''. The two names are difficult to distinguish in transliteration, and some of the names below are instance of the latter one.

'''Angelica Balabanoff''' (or '''Balabanov''', '''Balabanova'''; {{lang-ru|Анжелика Балабанова}} &amp;ndash; ''Anzhelika Balabanova''; 4 August 1878&lt;ref name="IISG" /&gt; &amp;ndash; 25 November 1965) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]]-[[Jewish]]-[[Italy|Italian]] [[Communism|communist]] and [[Social Democracy|social democratic]] activist. She served as secretary of the [[Comintern]] and later became a political party leader in [[Italy]].

==Biography==
[[File:Angelica Balabanoff - David Ben Gurion 1962.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Angelica Balabanoff visiting [[David Ben Gurion]] in [[Tel Aviv]], 1962]]
Balabanoff was born into a wealthy family in [[Chernihiv]], [[Russian Empire]], where she rebelled against her mother's strictness.&lt;ref name="RussInItalia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shachtman" /&gt; While attending the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], she was exposed to political radicalism. After her graduation with degrees in [[philosophy]] and [[literature]], she settled in [[Rome]] and began to organize immigrant workers in the [[Textile manufacturing|textile industry]], joining the Partito Socialista Italiano ([[Italian Socialist Party]], which she later became the leader of) in 1900. She became closely associated with [[Antonio Labriola]], [[Giacinto Menotti Serrati]], [[Benito Mussolini]], and [[Filippo Turati]] (the founder of the [[Italian Socialist Party]]).

She moved further to the left during the [[World War I|First World War]], becoming active in the [[Zimmerwald Conference|Zimmerwald Movement]]. During the war, she spent some time in exile in neutral [[Sweden]], where she was affiliated with the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left]] Socialist movement and became a close friend of the Swedish Communist leaders [[Ture Nerman]], [[Fredrik Ström]], [[Zeth Höglund]] and [[Kata Dalström]].

When the [[Russian Revolution]] broke out in 1917, Balabanoff joined the [[Bolshevik Party]] and travelled to Russia. According to [[Emma Goldman]], she became disillusioned with the style of socialism in Russia and "[she] had become rooted in the soil of Italy."&lt;ref name="Goldman" /&gt; Balabanoff told Goldman of her discomfort about temporarily living in the [[Narishkin Palace]].&lt;ref name="Goldman" /&gt; She became secretary of the [[Comintern|Communist]] [[Third International]] in 1919 and worked alongside [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], and Emma Goldman, as well as many others. She became an open critic of [[Bolshevism]] and left Russia in 1922, travelling back to Italy and joining with [[Giacinto Menotti Serrati]]. After Serrati left to rejoin the Communists, she led his [[Maximum programme|Maximalist]] group until the rise of [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]] forced her into exile in [[Switzerland]], where she edited ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'' and became the secretary of the [[Paris Bureau]]. While addressing a socialist meeting in Lausanne, she first encountered Mussolini, who at the time was still a socialist; her first impression of him was not flattering: "I had never seen a more wretched human being ... he seemed more concerned with his inner turmoil than what I was saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Balabanoff |first=Angelica |date=1938 |title=My Life as a Rebel |url= |location=London |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |page=60 |isbn= |author-link=Angelica Balabanoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later moved to [[Paris]], then [[New York City]] at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. When the war ended, she returned to Italy and joined the [[Italian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]], which became the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party]] (after including the [[United Socialist Party (Italy, 1949–1951)|United Socialist Party]]).

==Early life and education==
Arsen Avakov was born to an [[Armenians|Armenian]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armenian Arsen Avakov Elected as Ukraine’s Interim Interior Minister|url=http://asbarez.com/119929/armenian-arsen-avakov-elected-as-ukraine%E2%80%99s-interim-interior-minister/|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=[[Asbarez]]|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sindelar|first=Daisy|title=Who's Who In Ukraine's 'Kamikaze' Cabinet|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-whos-who-cabinet/25279592.html|accessdate=12 April 2014|date=27 February 2014|agency=[[RFE/RL]]|quote=Arsen Avakov (50)&amp;nbsp;– Baku-born and of Armenian origin...}}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 2, 1964 in settlement imeni Kirova (since 1992 [[Rəsulzadə]], located within [[Binəqədi raion]]) of [[Baku]], [[Soviet Azerbaijan]].

===Minister of Internal Affairs===
On February 27, 2014, Avakov was appointed Acting [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine]]. He described [[List of active separatist movements in Europe#Ukraine|pro-Russian separatists]] as "[[Terrorism|terrorists]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/avakov-over-30-terrorists-killed-in-east-ukraine-operation-346392.html Avakov: Over 30 'terrorists' killed in east Ukraine operation]" ''Kyiv Post''. May 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]] requested that Avakov be placed on [[Interpol]]'s wanted list for "the use of prohibited means and methods of warfare, aggravated murder, the obstruction of professional activities of journalists, and abduction."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_06_21/Russia-puts-Ukraines-acting-interior-minister-Dnepropetrovsk-governor-on-intl-wanted-list-4457/ Russia puts Ukraine's interior minister, Dnepropetrovsk governor on int'l wanted list]". [[Voice of Russia]]. June 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 2014, a [[Moscow]] district court arrested him [[wiktionary:in absentia|in absentia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140709/190858843/Moscow-Court-Arrests-in-Absentia-Ukrainian-Interior-Minister.html Moscow Court Arrests in Absentia Ukrainian Interior Minister Avakov], [[RIA Novosti]] (9 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 Avakov became a founding member of his new party [[People's Front (Ukraine)|People's Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Golovniov|first=Igor|url=http://www.demotix.com/news/5721391/yatseniuk-elected-head-political-council-peoples-front-party#media-5721330|title=Yatseniuk elected head of political council of People's Front Party|publisher=[[Demotix]]|date=9 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102023758/http://www.demotix.com/news/5721391/yatseniuk-elected-head-political-council-peoples-front-party|archivedate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avakov has published twelve scientific papers, one monograph, and a number of essays on political and social issues.

In November 2014, Ukraine's chief rabbi [[Yaakov Bleich]] condemned Avakov's appointment of  [[Azov Battalion]] deputy commander and leading [[Patriot of Ukraine]] member [[Vadym Troyan]] as [[Kiev Oblast]] police chief, and demanded that "if the interior minister continues to appoint people of questionable repute and ideologies tainted with fascism and right-wing extremism, the interior minister should be replaced."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Kiev-regional-police-head-accused-of-neo-Nazi-ties-381559 Kiev regional police head accused of neo-Nazi ties], [[The Jerusalem Post]] (12 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A number of experts point out that during Avakov's time as Minister of Internal Affairs, the reform of main Ukrainian law enforcement agency fell through.&lt;ref name=rpapas&gt;[http://argumentua.com/stati/reforma-pol-ts-yak-profanats-ya-sabotazh Reform of police as profanation and sabotage (Реформа поліції як профанація і саботаж)].

==Personal life==
Avakov is married and has a son&lt;ref name=LIGA&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://file.liga.net/person/574-arsen-avakov.html Short bio], LIGA&lt;/ref&gt; Oleksandr. At the age of 25 his son volunteered for the special police detachments [[Kyiv-1 Battalion]] in August 2014 and fought in the [[Siege of Sloviansk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/08/8/7034290 Son of Avakov volunteers], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (8 August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segodnya.ua/ukraine/syn-avakova-sluzhit-v-batalone-kiev-1-542981.html Сын Авакова служит в батальоне «Киев-1»]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26131">[[Image:Klaus Fuchs ID badge.png|right|thumb|[[Klaus Fuchs]], arguably the most important of the identified "atomic spies" for his extensive access to high-level scientific data and his ability to make sense of it through his technical training.]]

"'''Atomic spies'''" or "'''atom spies'''" were people in the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[Canada]] who are known to have [[espionage|illicitly given information]] about [[nuclear weapon]]s production or design to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]] and the early [[Cold War]]. Exactly what was given, and whether everyone on the list gave it are still matters of some scholarly dispute, and in some cases, what were originally seen as strong testimonies or confessions were admitted as fabricated in later years. Their work constitutes the most publicly well-known and well-documented case of [[nuclear espionage]] in the [[history of nuclear weapons]]. There was a movement among nuclear scientists to share the information with the world scientific community, but it was firmly quashed by the U.S. government.

Confirmation about espionage work came from the [[Venona project]], which intercepted and decrypted Soviet intelligence reports sent during and after [[World War II]]. They provided clues to the identity of several spies at Los Alamos and elsewhere, some of whom have never been identified. Some of this information was available, but not usable in court for secrecy reasons during the 1950s trials. Additionally, records from Soviet archives, which were briefly opened to researchers after the fall of the Soviet Union, included more information about some spies.

==Importance==
Before [[World War II]], the theoretical possibility of [[nuclear fission]] occasioned intense discussion among leading physicists world-wide. Scientists from the [[Soviet Union]] were later recognized for their contributions to the understanding of a nuclear reality, and won several Nobel Prizes. Soviet scientists such as [[Igor Kurchatov]], [[Lev Landau|L. D. Landau]], and [[Cyril Sinelnikov|Kirill Sinelnikov]] helped establish the idea of, and prove the existence of, a splittable atom. Dwarfed by the [[Manhattan Project]], the significance of the Soviet contributions is rarely understood or credited outside of the field of physics. According to several sources, it was understood on a theoretical level that the atom provided for extremely powerful and novel releases of energy, and could possibly be utilized in the future for military purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Michael. The Russian-A(merican) Bomb: The Role of Espionage in the Soviet Atomic Bomb Project. J. Undergrad. Sci. 3: 103–108 (Summer 1996) http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jus/0302/schwartz.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In recorded comments, the physicists lamented their inability to achieve any kind of practical application from the discoveries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} This would show that the scientists thought the creation of an atomic weapon was a pipe-dream and untenable. According to a United States Congressional joint committee, although the scientists could conceivably have been first to generate a man-made fission reaction, in reality they lacked the ambition, funding, engineering capability, [[leadership]], and ultimately, the capability to do so. The undertaking would be of an unimaginable scale, and the resources required to engineer for such use as a nuclear bomb, and nuclear power were deemed too great to pursue.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Soviet Atomic Espionage. Chapters 2–3 United States Government Printing Office, Washington 1951. https://archive.org/stream/sovietatomicespi1951unit#page/n3/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Leo Szilard]] through their [[Einstein–Szilárd letter]] of August 2, 1939, the [[United States]]&amp;nbsp;— in collaboration with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Canada]]&amp;nbsp;— recognized the potential significance of an atomic bomb and embarked in 1942 upon work to achieve a usable device. Estimates suggest that during the quest to create the atomic bomb $2 billion, eighty-six thousand tons of silver, and twenty-four thousand skilled workers drove the research-and-development phase of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08&lt;/ref&gt;  Those skilled workers included the people to maintain and operate the machinery necessary for research. The largest Western facility had five hundred scientists working on the project, as well as a team of fifty to derive the equations for the cascade of neutrons required to drive the reaction. The fledgling equivalent Soviet program was quite different: The program consisted of fifty scientists, and a mere two mathematicians trying to work out the equations for the particle cascade.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08f&lt;/ref&gt;  The research and development of techniques to produce sufficiently enriched uranium and plutonium were beyond the scope and efforts of the Soviet group. The knowledge of techniques and strategies that the Allied programs employed, and which Soviet espionage obtained, might have played a role in the rapid development of the Soviet bomb after the war.

The research and development of methods suitable for [[dopant|doping]] and separating the highly reactive isotopes needed to create the payload for a nuclear warhead took years, and consumed a vast amount of resources. The United States and Great Britain dedicated their best scientists to this cause and constructed three plants, each with a different isotope-extraction method.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, "Atomic Espionage: from Fuchs to the Rosenburgs" in The Haunted Wood, (New York: Random House Inc, 1999), 172–222.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Allied program decided to use gas-phase extraction to obtain the pure uranium necessary for an atomic detonation.&lt;ref name="archive.org" /&gt;  Using this method, it took large quantities of uranium ore and other rare materials such as graphite to successfully purify the U-235 isotope. The quantities required for the development were also beyond the scope and purview of the Soviet program.

The Soviet Union did not have natural uranium-ore mines at the start of the nuclear arms race. A lack of materials made it very difficult to conduct novel research or to map out a clear pathway to achieving the fuel they needed. The Soviet scientists became frustrated with the difficulties of producing uranium fuel cheaply, and they found their industrial techniques for refinement lacking. The use of information stolen from the Manhattan Project eventually rectified the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein and Vassiliev,Atomic Espionage, 180–85&lt;/ref&gt; Without such information, the problems the Soviet atomic team experienced would have taken many years to correct, affecting the production of a Soviet atomic weapon significantly.

The missing link that explains the great leaps in the Soviet Union's atomic program is the espionage information and technical data that [[Moscow]] succeeded in obtaining from the Manhattan Project. Once the Soviets had learned of the American plans to develop an atomic bomb during the 1940s, Moscow began actively seeking agents to get information.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein and Vassiliev,Atomic Espionage, 190–200&lt;/ref&gt;  Moscow sought very specific information from its intelligence cells in America, and demanded updates on the progress of the Allied project. Moscow was also greatly concerned with the procedures being used for U-235 separation, what method of detonation was being used, and what industrial equipment was being used for these techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein and Vassiliev,Atomic Espionage,180&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain this information from the Manhattan Project, the Soviet Union needed spies who had security clearance high enough to have access to classified information and who could understand and interpret what they were stealing. Moscow also needed reliable spies who believed in the communist cause and who would provide accurate information. One such Soviet spy, [[Theodore Hall]], had worked on the development of the bombs dropped in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes,Marian. "Spies Who Spilled Atomic Bomb Secrets". Smithsonian.com,April 20, 2009. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Spies-Who-Spilled-Atomic-Bomb-Secrets.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Hall provided the specifications of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. This information allowed the Soviet scientists a first-hand look at the successful set up of an atomic weapon built by the Manhattan Project.

Although Hall's information proved helpful to the Soviet cause, the most influential of the atomic spies was [[Klaus Fuchs]]. Fuchs, a German-born British physicist, went to America to work on the atomic project and became one of its lead scientists. Fuchs had become a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany | Communist Party]] in 1932 while still a student in Germany. At the onset the Third Reich Fuchs fled to Great Britain (1933), where he eventually became one of the lead nuclear physicists in the British program. In 1943 he moved to the United States to collaborate on the Manhattan Project.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, ''Spies Who Spilled'', 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Fuchs's position in the atomic program, he had access to most, if not all, of the material Moscow desired. Fuchs was also able to interpret and understand the information he was stealing, which made him an invaluable resource. Fuchs provided the Soviets with detailed information on the gas-phase separation process. He also provided specifications for the payload, calculations and relationships for setting of the fission reaction, and schematics for labs producing weapons-grade isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein and Vassiliev, ''Atomic Espionage'', 200–10&lt;/ref&gt;  This information helped the smaller under-manned and under-supplied Soviet group with a hard push in the direction of the successful detonation of a nuclear weapon.

The Soviet nuclear program would have eventually been able to develop a nuclear weapon without the aid of espionage, but a basic understanding of the usefulness of an atomic weapon, the sheer resources, and the talent did not develop until much later.{{When|date=October 2016}} Espionage helped the Soviet scientists identify which methods worked and prevented wasting valuable resources on techniques which the development of the American bomb had proven ineffective. The speed at which the Soviet nuclear program achieved a working bomb with so few resources depended on the amount of information acquired through espionage. During the Cold War trials that espionage was touted{{By whom|date=October 2016}} as one of the most significant intelligence coups in human history.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:717-money-bag.svg|thumb|The "money bag" emoji (💰).|176x176px]]

A '''bagman''' (or '''bag man''') is a person or paymaster designated to collect or distribute illicitly gained money ("[[:wikt:dirty money|dirty money]]"), such as bribes to public officials, or money that is collected in a criminal enterprise, such as a "[[protection racket]]" or in the running of a [[Numbers game|numbers racket]]. A bagman may also act as an intermediary in such transactions. "Bagman" is also a (mainly) British term for a traveling salesman. The first known use of the term occurred in 
1808.&lt;ref&gt;"Bagman," [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bagman merriam-webster.com]. Retrieved 2017-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bagman may also be known as a '''delivery boy''' or '''running man''', and he may receive a fraction of the money collected. Though it connotes someone who carries a bag of money, the term may also apply to a person who performs other small tasks for those involved in [[organized crime]], such as [[chauffeur]]ing or transporting goods.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The term is sometimes used in other contexts involving controversial money transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2013/06/04/nigel_wrights_role_as_party_bagman_deserves_scrutiny_mcquaig.html|title=Nigel Wright’s role as party bagman deserves scrutiny: McQuaig|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mary-anastasia-ogrady-iran-and-argentina-the-defectors-tale-1427065218|title=Iran and Argentina: The Defectors’ Tale: O'Grady|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagman is also used just to mean assistant in military or police contexts as seen in the series [[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]].

''For the British artist, see [[Eileen Simpson (artist)]]''

'''Eileen Simpson''' (1918 – October 21, 2002) was an American writer and psychotherapist. Her 1982 book ''Poets in their Youth'' records her life with first husband [[John Berryman]] and his circle of poets, including [[Delmore Schwartz]] and [[Robert Lowell]]. In 1984 she was a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts in General Nonfiction.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellows: Eileen Simpson|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/eileen-simpson/|website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|accessdate=1 May 2016|ref=Guggenheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born Eileen Patricia Mulligan in New York City, Simpson was orphaned by age 7 and sent by relatives to a New Jersey boarding school. She struggled with undiagnosed dyslexia, a condition later identified by Berryman.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Dinitia|title=Eileen Simpson, 84, Memoirist Of Life With John Berryman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/24/arts/eileen-simpson-84-memoirist-of-life-with-john-berryman.html|accessdate=1 May 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=Oct 24, 2002|ref=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simpson met Berryman at a New Year's party in New York in 1941, soon after her graduation from Hunter College,&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Lee|title=The Poet's Keeper: Rereading Eileen Simpson's 'Poets in Their Youth'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/books/review/rereading-eileen-simpsons-poets-in-their-youth.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 May 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=Feb 6, 2015|ref=Siegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were married the following year at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]]. The couple moved to [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], and Berryman found work lecturing at [[Harvard]], and later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Berryman, like other poets of his generation, would continue to earn his living through academic postings. Simpson meanwhile supported his poetry practice first with secretarial positions, and later, as a psychology student, with work at a Princeton clinic.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yardley"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yardley|first1=Jonathan|title=In the Beginning, Such a Happy Couplet|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/15/AR2006101501018.html|accessdate=1 May 2016|publisher=Washington Post|date=Oct 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Poets in Their Youth'' ==
Simpson's eleven years of marriage to Berryman were turbulent. As Berryman struggled as an artist, Simpson supported him practically and emotionally, even as his personal problems and behavior worsened. Simpson remained an astute and sympathetic observer of Berryman, his poet and writer colleagues, and their wives and families, including [[Randall Jarrell]], [[Delmore Schwartz]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Jean Stafford]], and [[R.P. Blackmur]], all of whom appear in ''Poets in Their Youth''.

Simpson's ''Times'' obituary concludes that "madness and despondency were the principal motifs of her life" with Berryman and his circle.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Between Berryman's alcoholism, infidelities, suicidal urges, and persistent self-destructive tendencies, Simpson was forced to conclude that "no amount of love and care could protect him from external circumstances, and that these could bring him to the edge of madness."&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simpson|first1=Eileen|title=Poets in Their Youth: A Memoir|date=2014|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|isbn=0374235597|ref=Simpson}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 11 years of marriage, she writes: "The job of net-holder had exhausted me."

Still, as the ''Washington Post'' reviewer Jonathan Yardley noted, it was a union characterized by "much happiness", and Simpson's enduring love and affection for Berryman, and the poets and poets' wives of their circle, are principal strengths of her memoir: a "cleareyed compassion... is characteristic of "Poets in Their Youth," which never sensationalizes these brilliant but wildly erratic young men, only seeks to understand them."&lt;ref name="Yardley" /&gt; While ''New Yorker'' poetry editor Howard Moss, writing in the New York Review of Books on the occasion of its publication, called it "too forgiving by far",&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moss|first1=Howard|title=Good Poems, Sad Lives|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1982/07/15/good-poems-sad-lives/|accessdate=1 May 2016|publisher=The New York Review of Books|date=July 15, 1982|ref=Moss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Siegel, reviewing its reissue in the ''New York Times'', ascribes to the memoir "an almost uncanny clemency and a kind of cerulean objectivity", calling it "both a memorial to the men Simpson admired and an admonitory epitaph on lives lived at often false and ugly odds with their own aspirations toward truth and beauty."&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;

Simpson left Berryman in 1953, divorcing officially in 1956. Berryman would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize for "The Dream Songs" in 1965, and eventually committed suicide in 1972.&lt;ref name="Yardley" /&gt; Simpson's memoir was published in 1982 by Random House, and reissued in 2014 by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. The title is taken from Wordsworth's "Resolution and Independence":
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
“We poets in our youth begin in gladness; / But thereof comes in the end despondency and madness”.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Later life ==
In 1960, Eileen married Robert Simpson, a banker and diplomat, and relocated to Paris. Unable to continue her psychotherapist practice, she turned to writing, publishing a novel and two personal memoirs as well as studies in psychology. After the death of her second husband, she married Francis X. Baine, who died in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">'''Farid Essebar''' ({{lang-ar|'''فريد الصبار'''}}) (born in 1987, known as '''Diabl0''') is a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[black hat]] [[Security hacker|hacker]]. He was one of the two people (along with [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] [[Atilla Ekici]]) behind the spread of the [[Zotob]] [[computer worm]] that targeted [[Windows 2000]] [[operating system]]s in 2005. Among the affected were [[CNN]], [[ABC News]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[United Parcel Service]], [[Boeing]] and also the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].

[[Microsoft]] used 50 investigators and had put a $250,000 reward for the capture of the hacker(s). Microsoft's General counsel declared on August 26, 2005 that "The fact that we were able to see these arrests in less than two weeks and see them halfway around the world really drives that point home."

Essebar is a [[Russians|Russian]] citizen, also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Notorious-Hacker-Diabl0-Arrested-in-Thailand-432817.shtml | title=Notorious Hacker Diabl0 Arrested in Thailand | accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
{{Main article|Zotob (computer worm)#Arrest of the coders|l1=Arrest of the coders}}

===Intentions===
It is believed that his intention was to facilitate [[credit card]] forgery [[Confidence trick|scams]]. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] believes that [[Atilla Ekici]] paid Farid Essebar to [[Source code|code]] the worm.

===Other accusations===
In July 2006, investigators stated that Essebar may have authored more than 20 viruses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcwelt.de/news/englishnews/118950/ (pcwelt.de) - "Zotob author may be virus mastermind"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Arrest===
On 17 March 2014, Essebar was arrested in [[Thailand]] after a 2-year investigation by Thai police. The investigation was triggered by a complaint from Swiss authorities over an alleged infiltration of a Swiss bank that caused billions of dollars' damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le hackeur marocain, Farrid Essebar arrêté en Thaïlande|url=http://telquel-online.com/content/le-hackeur-marocain-farrid-essebar-arr%C3%AAt%C3%A9-en-tha%C3%AFlande-0|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=[[Telquel]]|date=18 March 2014|author=Yassine Majdi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10054">'''Felix A. Sommerfeld''' (May 28, 1879&amp;nbsp;– after 1930) was a [[German secret service]] agent in [[Mexico]] and the United States between 1908 and 1919. He was chief of the [[Mexican Secret Service]] under President [[Francisco I. Madero]], worked as a diplomat and arms buyer for [[Venustiano Carranza]] and [[Pancho Villa|Francisco "Pancho" Villa]], and ran the Mexican portion of Germany's war strategy in North America between 1914 and 1917.

== Biography ==
Born on May 28, 1879 in [[Schneidemuehl]], [[Province of Posen|Posen]], Germany, Sommerfeld grew up in a middle class Jewish household as the youngest son of Pauline and Isidor Sommerfeld.&lt;ref&gt;http://trees.ancestry.de/tree/13912585/family/&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing high school Sommerfeld began studies in Berlin as a [[mining engineer]]. However, for unknown reasons he dropped out and came to the United States in 1898 to visit his brother.&lt;ref&gt;Staatsarchiv Hamburg, Bestand: 373-7 I, VIII (Auswanderungsamt I), Seite 353 (Mikrofilm Nr. K_1754)&lt;/ref&gt; In the excitement over the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], the 19-year-old joined the army but deserted a few months after.&lt;ref&gt;New York in the Spanish–American War, 1898: part of the report of the adjutant-general of the state for 1900. Volume II, Registers of organizations, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 Sommerfeld, this time as a German soldier, went to war in China to put down the [[Boxer Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums, Heft 34, August 24, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; He was a "[[Meldereiter]]," German for horse messenger. When he returned in 1901 he completed his mining engineering studies and returned to the United States in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Staatsarchiv Hamburg, 373-7 I, VIII A 1 Band 135, Seite 2251 (Mikrofilm Nr. K_177)&lt;/ref&gt; After briefly staying with his brother Julius in Chicago, Sommerfeld set out to the West as a prospector. He worked his way through Arizona, Sonora (Mexico) and Durango (Mexico) until 1905 when he returned to Chicago totally broke.&lt;ref&gt;City Directory, Chicago, Illinois, 1905, page 1477&lt;/ref&gt; Not much is known about the German adventurer between 1906 and 1908. It is possible that he returned to Germany and received secret service training in Berlin.

In 1908, he suddenly showed up in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua, Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Heribert von Feilitzsch, ''In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; He again worked as a mining engineer, however, in reality he became an informant for the German government.{{sfn|Katz|p=335}} Chihuahua was ripe with rebellion and Sommerfeld did all he could to find out as much as possible about the anti-reelection movement led by wealthy Coahuila land owner, [[Francisco I. Madero]]. After the fraudulent elections that brought [[Porfirio Díaz]] yet another term as president in 1910, the Mexican Revolution erupted. Sommerfeld ostensibly worked for [[AP News]] but filed regular intelligence reports for the German government.{{sfn|Katz|p=335}}

When forces supporting Madero succeeded in overthrowing the Diaz in May 1911, Sommerfeld joined the new president's entourage, first as a personal assistant, then as Mexico's chief of the secret service. Working under the direction of the president's brother, [[Gustavo A. Madero]], Sommerfeld led the Mexican secret service.&lt;ref&gt;Heribert von Feilitzsch, ''In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; He helped put down the [[Pascual Orozco|Orozco uprising]] in the spring of 1912, in the course of which he led the largest foreign secret service organization ever operating on U.S. soil.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Harris, III and Louis R. Sadler, ''The Underside of the Mexican Revolution'': El Paso, 1912, ''The Americas'', Vol. 39, No. 1 (July, 1982), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The secret service organization Sommerfeld built included Mexican-Americans, Mexican expatriates, other German agents such as [[Horst von der Goltz]] and [[Arnold Krumm-Heller]], as well as two of the most notorious soldiers of fortune of the decade, [[Sam Dreben]] and [[Emil Lewis Holmdahl]].

In 1913, after Madero's overthrow and murder by [[Victoriano Huerta]], Sommerfeld left Mexico under the protection of German ambassador [[Paul von Hintze]], went to [[Washington, D.C.]] where he received funds from lawyer and Madero supporter [[Sherburne Hopkins]] and  signed up with the rebel movement assembled to overthrow Huerta. Governor of Coahuila, [[Venustiano Carranza]], who declared against Huerta's regime and created the Constitutionalist revolutionary movement against it, sent Sommerfeld to [[El Paso]] and [[San Antonio]] to organize weapons for the revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives RG 65 M1085 Roll 853 file 232, William Offley to Department, May 23, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;  Access to arms was a key element of a successful military movement. Northern Mexico's access to the border made procuring arms easier than in southern Mexico, where the Zapatistas operated.  Sommerfeld also functioned as a liaison between the U.S. government and Carranza.&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ''The Constitutionalist Years'', 279&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1914, Sommerfeld began working closer with successful [[Constitutionalist Army]] General, [[Pancho Villa]], commander of the [[División del Norte]]. When Villa and Carranza split their alliance after the defeat of Huerta in July 1914 and a civil war of the winners ensued, Sommerfeld stayed with Villa as his chief weapons buyer in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lazaro De La Garza Collection, University of Texas, Benson Library, Austin, TX, Box 1, Folder C, Villa to De La Garza, 4-14-1914&lt;/ref&gt; Sommerfeld also lobbied the U.S. government on Villa's behalf to receive diplomatic recognition. The task brought Sommerfeld close to General [[Hugh Lenox Scott]] and American Secretary of War, [[Lindley Miller Garrison]], both of whom he assisted numerous times when U.S. nationals found themselves in trouble in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;For example in the case of Emil Holmdahl, Papers of Hugh Lenox Scott, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., Box 15, General Correspondence, F.A. Sommerfeld to L.M. Garrison, July 10, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Sommerfeld was questioned following the mysterious disappearance of prominent writer [[Ambrose Bierce]], who had attached himself to Villa's forces but then vanished without a trace.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Katz, ''The Life and Times of Pancho Villa''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1998, p. 865.&lt;/ref&gt;

When World War I broke out in August 1914, Sommerfeld moved to New York ostensibly to represent [[Pancho Villa]]'s interests but actually worked for German Naval Attache [[Karl Boy-Ed]].{{sfn|Katz|p=412}} In his function as a specialist on Mexican affairs, Sommerfeld helped the German government sell arms and ammunition they had bought to keep them out of enemy Entente hands. Sommerfeld also had great knowledge of U.S. munitions factories, their capacities, order status etc. His intelligence reports had a great influence on the formulation of Germany's war strategy vis-a-vis the United States. In 1915, Sommerfeld funneled large numbers of arms to Pancho Villa, the value being estimated to about $340,000 (About $7 million in today's value).{{sfn|Katz|p=336}} Despite having large numbers of arms, Villa was decisively defeated by Constitutionalist Army General [[Álvaro Obregón]] in a series of battles in the Bajio, the most famous of which is the [[Battle of Celaya]] in 1915.  Villa's huge army of movement, largely using massed cavalry charges, fell before Obregón's superior strategy and tactics of trenches improvised from agricultural irrigation ditches and machine guns. Villa's División del Norte ceased to exist, and Villa became a guerrilla leader rather than the general of a major army of movement.

In March 1916, Villa and a small group of men attacked the city of [[Columbus, NM]]. The Battle of Columbus resulted in civilian casualties and prompted the U.S. to send General [[John J. Pershing]] on a Punitive Mission, which was unsuccessful in its attempt to capture Villa. Sommerfeld, who had offered to the German government in May 1915 that he could create an incident which would provoke a war between the U.S. and Mexico, became a prime suspect in Villa's attack on Columbus.{{sfn|Katz|p=333}} However, no investigator or historian has been able to prove Sommerfeld's involvement.

In June 1918, Sommerfeld was interned in [[Fort Oglethorpe (prisoner-of-war camp)|Fort Oglethorpe]], GA as an enemy alien.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', June 21, 1918, "Held as Enemy Alien."&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in 1919. A few trips back and forth to Mexico have been recorded in the 1920s and 30s. However, the German agent disappeared in the 1930s, so far without a trace.

==Education==
A social entrepreneur and multi-disciplinary practitioner with an eclectic professional background, Gibril was educated at Serekunda Primary School in the [[Gambia]] (1973–79) and attended grammar school and Sixth Form at Gambia High School (1979–86). He then studied at five universities in London. He has a Combined Honours bachelor's degree in Law, Finance &amp; Management and postgraduate degrees in Development Studies and Environmental Sciences. He also had professional training in Ethical Investment, Economic History, Policy Analysis, Transport and Urban Management, Environmental and Quality Management.

== Business and social enterprise ==
Gibril has been a director of GK Partners&lt;ref name=gmpartners&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us - GK Partners|url=http://www.gkpartners.co.uk/about-us/index.html|website=GK Partners|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2004 – advising socially responsible businesses and social enterprises. Through its "Access to Finance" and "Access to Property" programmes, GK Partners has helped companies raise millions of pounds of investment from ethical finance sources. From 2001 to 2004, Gibril was one of a small team of the people who developed a social enterprise business support framework in the UK through a programme funded by the Department of Trade and Industry (now called [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]]). Their work included the development of social enterprise business models, different forms of social investment schemes and legislation for [[Community Interest Companies]] in the [[Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004]].

Gibril established his first business in 1993 supporting SMEs, social enterprises, charities and voluntary organisations. He worked in corporate law, business and financial management, organisational development and quality assurance. Since the early 1990s, he has directly supported hundreds of companies and organisations across a wide and diverse range of sectors. In 2003, he received special commendation from the board of the then London Business Support Network.

He was a special adviser to the Institute of Islamic Banking and Insurance (IIBI),&lt;ref name=iibi&gt;{{cite web|title=IIBI Lecture – November 2009|url=http://www.islamic-banking.com/page144651620.aspx|website=Institute of Islamic Banking and Insurance|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping them gain charitable status as a learned association. He designed an "Access to Islamic Finance" (A2IF) training programme delivered by IIBI. In 2009, he convened and chaired the first A2IF conference in the UK that brought together the SME, ethical finance, business angel and Islamic finance sectors. Between 1990 and 1993, Gibril was a lecturer and tutor at various private colleges in London, teaching business law, accounting and management. He is a present or past member of several professional and academic bodies including the [[Chartered Institute of Arbitrators]], [[Chartered Management Institute]], [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]], [[Institution of Environmental Sciences]] and the [[Royal Society of Arts]].

He also served on the boards of multimillion-dollar funds that invest in developing countries, including [[DFID]]’s Global Poverty Action Fund and the EC-UN Joint Migration and Development Initiative.&lt;ref name=jmdi&gt;{{cite web|title=JMDI Migrant advisory board|url=http://www.migration4development.org/en/content/jmdi-migrant-advisory-board|website=JMDI|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently the Interim Executive Director of the Africa-Europe Diaspora Development Platform (ADEPT).&lt;ref name=adept&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa Europe Development Platform|url=http://www.adept-platform.org|website=Africa Europe Development Platform|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been involved with African Foundation for Development (AFFORD)&lt;ref name=afford&gt;{{cite web|title=AFFORD|url=http://www.afford-uk.org/|website=AFFORD|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 1997 and served as chairman of the charity for a decade. AFFORD is a pioneering diaspora organisation that focused on enhancing the formal and informal role of diasporas in the development of countries of origin or heritage. It has devised and delivered innovative job creation schemes in Africa.  Since 2000, Gibril has been applying the lessons of social enterprise, ethical finance and urban regeneration in the UK, to international development challenges.

Between 2000 and 2005, Gibril was an associate lecturer with The [[Open University]], teaching on the MSc course in Global Development Management. In 2003, he founded RemitAid™&lt;ref name=remitaid&gt;{{cite web|title=RemitAid|url=http://www.afford-uk.org/images/Documents/RemitAid%20Introduction%20-%20Updated%20May%202012.pdf|website=RemitAid|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a programme to transform remittances into a sustainable form of international development finance using tax reliefs and other macroeconomic policies. In 2005, the UK held the presidency of the EU and chaired of the G8 simultaneously. The Blair government set up the Commission for Africa. Gibril, together with others such as [[Trevor Manuel]] (then South African Finance Minister) was on the panel that advised the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown on the agenda for the Gleneagles G8 Summit.

Prof Maathai later became a supporter of the RemitAid™ proposal. In 2008, Gibril organised the introduction of the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]] to Francophone Africa.

He served as Treasurer of the Panel of [[Independent custody visitor]] in Lambeth (Brixton). He was part of the group that advised both the Home Secretary and Metropolitan Police Commissioner on putting custody visiting on a legislative footing and giving responsibility to Police Authorities. This led to the promulgation of Section 51 of the Police Reform Act 2002.&lt;ref name=reformact2002&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Reform Act 2002|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/51|website=Legislation|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004,&lt;ref name=2010chatham&gt;{{cite web|title=The African Diaspora within a Global Context|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/events/view/156513|website=Chatham House|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed Justice of the Peace and part-time magistrate in the London Commission Area within Her Majesty’s Court and Tribunal Service. He has been a sitting magistrate for over a decade in courts in Wimbledon, Richmond, Lavender Hill and Kingston.

Between 1988 and 1997, Gibril was a volunteer youth leader at Pedro Youth Club in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]],&lt;ref name=pedroclub&gt;{{cite web |title=Pedro Youth Club History |url=http://www.pedroclub.com/history.html |website=Pedro Youth Club |accessdate=5 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125115919/http://www.pedroclub.com/history.html |archivedate=25 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; running the Naataangeh Study Group. He led research projects, wrote papers and ran weekly workshops on African and diaspora history and anthropology. In 1993, he published a paper on "Blacks of the Pacific: African Origins of Melanesian Peoples".

The '''Horned Serpent''' appears in the mythologies of many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://altreligion.about.com/library/glossary/symbols/bldefsavanyu.htm Horned serpent, feathered serpent]&lt;/ref&gt;  Details vary among tribes, with many of the stories associating the mystical figure with water, rain, lightning and thunder.  Horned Serpents were major components of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] of North American prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  last = Townsend | first = Richard F. |  title = [[Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand]]| publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-300-10601-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  editors = F.

Horned serpents also appear in European and [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern mythology]].

== In Native American cultures ==
[[Image:snakerock.jpg|thumb|250px|Rock art depicting a Horned Serpent, at Pony Hills and [[Cookes Range|Cook's Peak]], New Mexico]]
Horned serpents appear in the [[oral history]] of numerous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures, especially in the [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern Woodlands]] and [[Great Lakes]].

[[Muscogee Creek]] traditions include a Horned Serpent and a Tie-Snake, ''estakwvnayv'' in the [[Muscogee Creek language]]. These are sometimes interpreted as being the same creature and sometimes different—similar, but the Horned Serpent is larger than the Tie-Snake. To the [[Muscogee people]], the Horned Serpent is a type of underwater serpent covered with iridescent, crystalline scales and a single, large crystal in its forehead. Both the scales and crystals are prized for their powers of divination.&lt;ref&gt;Grantham 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; The horns, called ''chitto gab-by'', were used in medicine.&lt;ref name=g52&gt;Grantham 52&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson Lewis, a Muscogee Creek informant to [[John R. Swanton]], said, "This snake lives in the water has horns like the stag. It is not a bad snake. ... It does not harm human beings but seems to have a magnetic power over game."&lt;ref name=g25&gt;Grantham 25&lt;/ref&gt; In stories, the Horned Serpent enjoyed eating sumac, ''[[Rhus glabra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grantham 26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alabama people]] call the Horned Serpent, ''tcinto såktco'' or "crawfish snake", which they divide into four classifications based on its horns' colors, which can be blue, red, white, or yellow.&lt;ref name=g25/&gt;

[[Yuchi people]] made effigies of the Horned Serpent as recently as 1905. An effigy was fashioned from stuffed deerhide, painted blue, with the antlers painted yellow. The Yuchi Big Turtle Dance honors the Horned Serpent's spirit, which was related to storms, thunder, lightning, disease, and rainbows.&lt;ref name=g52/&gt;

Among Cherokee people, a Horned Serpent is called an ''uktena''. Anthropologist [[James Mooney]], describes the creature:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who know say the Uktena is a great snake, as large around as a tree trunk, with horns on its head, and a bright blazing crest like a diamond on its forehead, and scales glowing like sparks of fire. It has rings or spots of color along its whole length, and can not be wounded except by shooting in the seventh spot from the head, because under this spot are its heart and its life. The blazing diamond is called Ulun'suti—"Transparent"—and he who can win it may become the greatest wonder worker of the tribe. But it is worth a man's life to attempt it, for whoever is seen by the Uktena is so dazed by the bright light that he runs toward the snake instead of trying to escape. As if this were not enough, the breath of the Uktena is so pestilential, that no living creature can survive should they inhale the tiniest bit of the foul air expelled by the Uktena. Even to see the Uktena asleep is death, not to the hunter himself, but to his family.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Chromesun moundville stone palette01.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Tie-snakes on a [[Mississippian Culture|Mississippian]] sandstone plate from the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]]]]

According to [[Sioux]] belief, the ''[[Unktehila|Unhcegila]]'' (''Ųȟcéǧila'') are dangerous reptilian water monsters that lived in ancient times. They were of various shapes. In the end the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbirds]] destroyed them, except for small species like snakes and lizards. This belief may have been inspired by finds of [[dinosaur]] fossils in Sioux tribal territory. The Thunderbird may have been inspired partly by finds of [[pterosaur]] skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;Morell, Virginia (December 2005).

==In European iconography==
[[Image:Gundestrupkedlen- 00054 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The antlered deity of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], commonly identified with [[Cernunnos]], holding a ram-horned serpent and a [[torc]].]]
The ram-horned serpent is a well-attested cult image of north-west Europe before and during the Roman period. It appears three times on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], and in Romano-Celtic Gaul was closely associated with the horned or antlered god [[Cernunnos]], in whose company it is regularly depicted. This pairing is found as early as the fourth century BC in Northern Italy, where a huge antlered figure with [[torc]]s and a serpent was [[rock drawings in Val Camonica|carved on the rocks]] in [[Val Camonica]].&lt;ref name="GreenHorned"&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Miranda |title=Animals in Celtic Life and Myth |pages=227–8}}
Celtic Mars: carving at the curative sanctuary at Mavilly (Cote d'Ôr).
Celtic Mercury: carving at Beauvais (Oise) and Néris-les-Bains (Allier).
Association with the solar wheel: Gundestrup cauldron, altar at Lypiatt (Gloucestershire).
&lt;/ref&gt;

A bronze image at [[Étang-sur-Arroux]] and a stone sculpture at [[Sommerécourt]] depict Cernunnos' body encircled by two horned snakes that feed from bowls of fruit and corn-mash in the god's lap. Also at Sommerécourt is a sculpture of a goddess holding a cornucopia and a pomegranate, with a horned serpent eating from a bowl of food. At [[Yzeures-sur-Creuse]] a carved youth has a ram-horned snake twined around his legs, with its head at his stomach. At [[Cirencester]], Gloucestershire, Cernunnos' legs are two snakes which rear up on each side of his head and are eating fruit or corn. According to Miranda Green, the snakes reflect the peaceful nature of the god, associated with nature and fruitfulness, and perhaps accentuate his association with regeneration.&lt;ref name="GreenHorned"/&gt;

Other deities occasionally accompanied by ram-horned serpents include "[[Celtic Mars]]" and "[[Celtic Mercury]]". The horned snake, and also conventional snakes, appear together with the [[solar wheel]], apparently as attributes of the sun or sky god.&lt;ref name="GreenHorned"/&gt;

The description of Unktehi or Unktena is, however, more similar to that of a [[Lindorm]] in Northern Europe,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} especially in Southern Scandinavia, and most of all as described in folklore in Eastern Denmark (including the provinces lost to Sweden in 1658). There, too, it is a water creature of huge dimensions, while in Southern Sweden it is a huge snake, the sight of which was deadly.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This latter characteristic is reminiscent of the [[basilisk]].

==In Mesopotamian iconography==
In Mesopotamian mythology [[Ningishzida]], is sometimes depicted as a serpent with horns. In other depictions, he is shown as human but is accompanied by ''[[Bašmu|bashmu]]'', horned serpents. Ningishzida shares the epithet ''[[Ušumgallu|ushumgal]]'', "great serpent", with several other Mesopotamian gods.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== Early life ==

At the age of 14, Fernandez appeared on the popular BBC television series ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]''. In October 2012, following a series of [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|sexual abuse allegations]] made against the series' late host [[Jimmy Savile]], Fernandez claimed that Savile had touched her inappropriately during the recording.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19925372 Jimmy Savile 'groped Julie Fernandez when she was 14']. BBC News. 12 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Her acting career began in 1992 when she starred as Vanessa Lockhead in the short-lived BBC [[soap opera]] ''[[Eldorado (TV series)|Eldorado]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Passed/Failed: An education in the life of Julie Fernandez, actress |publisher= Independent|date=16 October 2008|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-julie-fernandez-actress-962101.html|accessdate=2010-08-29 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to play [[Sean Maguire]]'s [[girlfriend]] in BBC1 drama ''[[Dangerfield (TV series)|Dangerfield]]'' before landing the role of Brenda in ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.

She set up [[The Disability Foundation]], a British pan-disability charity boasting one of the largest disability information databases in the UK. In January 2003, she co-hosted the opening ceremony for the [[European Year of People with Disabilities]] in [[Athens]].

In 2004, Fernandez formed a [[television]] production company called [[The Wheelie Good Company]] and spent the time since working on new programme ideas.

She appeared as a regular guest on the quiz show ''[[HeadJam]]''.

Fernandez also runs an [[arts and craft]] small business in Cambridgeshire, ''Bee Crafty'', specialising in patchwork and quilting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realbusiness.co.uk/article/21428-the-offices-julie-fernandez-on-starting-her-own-business|title=The Office's Julie Fernandez on starting her own business - Real Business|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justa Canaviri''' (born 1963) is an [[Aymara people|Aymara]], Bolivian woman who has become noted for her dress in the traditional Chola dress and [[bowler hat]], outspokenness on issues such as family violence, LGBT rights, and indigenous rights. Often called Bolivia's most recognizable ''[[Cholo#Bolivia|chola]]'', Canaviri changed the face of Bolivian television, when she began broadcasting her cooking show by introducing for the first time an indigenous woman as the main presence. In 2014, she was honored as one of the BBC's [[100 Women (BBC)|100 Women Series]].

== Early life==
Justa Elena Canaviri Choque was born on 13 August 1963 in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] to Filomena Choque and Ambrosio Canaviri. The second of four daughters in the family, Canaviri studied at the Tecnimod Academy with a focus on sewing and design, social work and took additional training in Bolivian gastronomy, studying the national food and pastries. She raised three children, Indira, Addis and José,{{sfn|Gourmetravel|2014}} working as a house cleaner to support them.{{sfn|Aguirre|2014}}

==Career==
In 1999, Canaviri met the Bolivian screenwriter Guillermo Aguirre, who thought that she could work in television. He helped her secure work as a presenter on a television program, "La Cancha", which introduced products to consumers.{{sfn|Aguirre|2014}} After that show ended, she worked as a host on two short-lived programs, "Sábado Estelar" and "Fiebre de Sábado con la Canasta de La Justa".{{sfn|Gourmetravel|2014}} Because she could not find additional television work and she liked working in the medium, she wrote a program called "La Wislla de La Justa" and began pitching it to various independent producers.{{sfn|Gourmetravel|2014}}{{sfn|Aguirre|2014}} ''{{ill|Radio Televisión Popular|es|RTP Bolivia}}'' (RTP Bolivia), agreed to produce the show in 2002. Canaviri's program centered on food,{{sfn|Aguirre|2014}} but with Canaviri discussing political and social issues, as well as presenting cultural traditions.{{sfn|''Página Siete''|2014}} Within three months the program had become a hit and she began to think of producing it independently. After ten months, she went to work at the ''{{ill|PAT Network|es|Red PAT}}'' and the program was renamed "La Justa",{{sfn|Aguirre|2014}} where she remained for the next three years.{{sfn|Gourmetravel|2014}}

Canaviri was a trendsetter. Before she went on the air, television in Bolivia was dominated by those of European ancestry. Proud of her heritage, Canaviri wanted her program to depict who she really was. She wore her hair in [[braid]]s, topped with the [[bowler hat]] typically worn by ''[[Cholo#Bolivia|cholas]]'', and the traditional multi-pleated [[pollera]]s.{{sfn|Gourmetravel|2014}}{{sfn|''El Universo''|2008}}{{sfn|Colanzi|2015}} In 2006, Canaviri moved her show to ''[[TV Boliviana|Bolivia TV]]''.{{sfn|Aguirre|2014}} where she continued to present lively conversation and recipes. In 2013, when she felt that Bolivia TV wanted a younger image and was trying to censor her discussions,{{sfn|Linarez|1 February 2013}} Canaviri expanded her options and began airing her program on ''Virgen de Copacabana TV'' in [[El Alto]], becoming the first presenter to air a program on two separate channels.{{sfn|Linarez|27 February 2013}}

Canaviri broke the concepts of beauty and stereotypes associated with indigenous women, becoming "the most famous chef on Bolivian television".{{sfn|Colanzi|2015}} She discussed such topics as weight,{{sfn|Linarez|1 February 2013}} violence against women and abuse,{{sfn|Avendaño|2015}} discrimination against indigenous people and their rights,{{sfn|''La Prensa Bolivia''|2014}} and LGBT issues in Bolivia. In 2014, she was honored by the BBC as one of the most inspirational [[100 Women (BBC)|100 Women]] of the year.{{sfn|''BBC''|2014}} That same year, she was selected by [[Kimberly-Clark|Kimberly-Clark Bolivia]] as one of the women models in their golden years who would represent their Poise brand of products.{{sfn|''El Diario''|2014}} She has become one of the most influential women in Bolivia{{sfn|Avendaño|2015}}{{sfn|''La Prensa Bolivia''|2014}} and has participated as a chef and in workshops for women in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]] and the United States.{{sfn|Gourmetravel|2014}}

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Neptune City, New Jersey]], into a middle-class Conservative Jewish family of Russian and Dutch descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lgbtjewishheroes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kaye-Bornsteins-Gender-and-Genre-Bending.pdf |title=Kate Bornstein's Gender and Genre Bending |publisher=LGBT Jewish Heroes |accessdate=2012-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812035308/http://lgbtjewishheroes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kaye-Bornsteins-Gender-and-Genre-Bending.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bornstein studied Theater Arts with [[John Emigh]] and Jim Barnhill at [[Brown University]] (Class of '69). She joined the [[Church of Scientology]], becoming a high ranking lieutenant in the [[Sea Org]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/04/kate-bornstein-gender-outlaw-queer-and-pleasant-danger-interview | title=&amp;quot;A Queer and Pleasant Danger&amp;quot;: Kate Bornstein, Trans Scientology Survivor | work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | accessdate=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/books/atheologies/5988/no_longer_at_sea%3A_kate_bornstein_talks_scientology/ | title=No Longer At Sea: Kate Bornstein Talks Scientology | work=[[Religion Dispatches]] | accessdate=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/9780807001653 | title=A Queer and Pleasant Danger by Kate Bornstein – Powell's Books | accessdate=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later became disillusioned and formally left the movement in 1981. Bornstein's antagonism toward Scientology and public split from the church have had personal consequences; Bornstein's daughter, herself a Scientologist, no longer has any contact per Scientology's policy of [[disconnection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Transition and post-op===
Bornstein never felt comfortable with the belief of the day that all trans women are "women trapped in men's bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bornstein|first=Kate|title=Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women, and the Rest of Us|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415908973|pages=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyYFckiB-tkC&amp;dq=bornstein+women+trapped+in+mens+bodies&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not identify as a man, but the only other option was to be a woman, a reflection of the [[gender binary]], which required people to identify according to only two available genders. Another obstacle was the fact that Bornstein was attracted to women. She had [[sex reassignment surgery]] in 1986.

Bornstein settled into the lesbian community in San Francisco, and wrote art reviews for the gay and lesbian paper ''[[The Bay Area Reporter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piechota|first=Jim|title=Surviving Scientology|url=http://www.bayareareporter.net/arts/art_article.php?sec=books&amp;article=717|accessdate=Feb 13, 2013|newspaper=Bay Area Reporter|date=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, she began to identify as neither a man nor a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lavelle|first1=Ciara|title=Eileen Myles, the Property Brothers, and Others Coming to Miami Book Fair 2016|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/eileen-myles-the-property-brothers-and-others-coming-to-miami-book-fair-2016-8740577|accessdate=13 March 2018|publisher=Miami New Times|date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This catapulted Bornstein back to performing, creating several performance pieces, some of them one-person shows. It was the only way that she knew how to communicate life's paradoxes.

Bornstein also teaches workshops and has published several gender theory books and a novel. ''Hello Cruel World'' was written to derail "teens, freaks, and other outlaws" from committing suicide. "Do whatever it takes to make your life more worth living," Bornstein writes, "just don't be mean."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://katebornstein.typepad.com/kate_bornsteins_blog/2010/10/dont-be-mean-really.html |title=Don't Be Mean? Really? |author=Kate Bornstein |work=Kate Bornstein Is A Queer and Pleasant Danger—this is her blog |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer diagnosis===
In August 2012, Bornstein was diagnosed with lung cancer. Doctors thought that she was cancer-free after surgery, but it emerged in February 2013 that the disease had returned. Laura Vogel, a friend of hers, launched a GoFundMe campaign on March 20 to help fund the cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Glennisha|title=Kate Bornstein, Transgender Activist And Theorist, Receives Support For Cancer Fundraiser|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/kate-bornstein-cancer-fundraiser_n_2926015.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In 1989, Bornstein created a theatre production in collaboration with Noreen Barnes, ''Hidden: A Gender'',  based on parallels between her own life and that of the [[intersex]] person [[Herculine Barbin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lgbtjewishheroes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kaye-Bornsteins-Gender-and-Genre-Bending.pdf |title=Kate Bornstein's Gender and Genre Bending |publisher=LGBT Jewish Heroes |accessdate=2012-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812035308/http://lgbtjewishheroes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Kaye-Bornsteins-Gender-and-Genre-Bending.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Bornstein's ''Hello, Cruel World: 101 Alternatives to Suicide for Teens, Freaks, and Other Outlaws'' was a Lambda Literary Award Finalist for LGBT Nonfiction and Honorbook for the Stonewall Children's and Young Adult Literature.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sevenstories.com/authors/220-kate-bornstein&lt;/ref&gt; Bornstein edited ''Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation'' in collaboration with [[S.

'''Kenneth T. Williams''' (born 1965) is a [[Cree]] playwright. He is from the [[Gordon First Nation]], [[Saskatchewan]] in what is known as [[Treaty 4]] territory. However, from the age of 12 through his early adulthood he lived off-reserve in Edmonton.&lt;ref name="edmontonjournal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/theatre/cafe-daughter-gets-its-alberta-premiere|title=Café Daughter gets its Alberta première|date=November 25, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams completed a B. A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curiousarts.ca/kenneth-t-williams-tells-the-story-of-math|title=Kenneth T. Williams tells the story of math - curious arts|date=January 26, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then became the first Indigenous person to earn an M.F.A. in playwriting from the University of Alberta in 1992. He currently lives in Saskatoon but still spends much of his time in Edmonton.&lt;ref name="edmontonjournal.com"/&gt;

==Career==
Williams jokes he had the worst career path in Canadian theatre. He worked as an encyclopedia salesman on reserve, a bartender, a drummer and joined the Reservists. Then, for 15 years, Williams dabbled in journalism, writing art and literature reviews for journals.&lt;ref name="edmontonjournal.com"/&gt; Williams wrote a half-dozen plays before finally getting one produced: Thunderstick in 2001.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/scene/theatre/2011/03/30/thunderstick-isnt-the-first-play/|title=Thunderstick: PTE play stars Lorne Cardinal and Craig Lauzon - CBC Manitoba|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was panned by the Globe and Mail when it premiered in Toronto, earning a half star rating.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/theatre-and-performance/as-idle-no-more-heats-up-cree-playwright-kenneth-t-williams-descends-on-toronto/article7540876/|title=As Idle No More heats up, Cree playwright Kenneth T. Williams descends on Toronto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Canada, the play fared better especially among native audiences. The play continued to tour for 10 years playing in every major city across Canada.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; In 2013 Thunderstick went on a four-city tour in Western Canada, and featured [[Lorne Cardinal]] of ''[[Corner Gas]]'' fame and [[Craig Lauzon]] of [[Air Farce]] who traded off roles in the two hander on alternate nights.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="winnipegfreepress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts/terrific-night-of-comic-theatre-for-14-year-old-boys-119110854.html|title=Terrific night of comic theatre... for 14-year-old boys|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Willams devoted himself full time to playwriting. The jump worked for him and since then his plays Café Daughter, Gordon Winter,&lt;ref name="pressreader.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20110507/287247414065005|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunderstick,&lt;ref name="winnipegfreepress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article-353153/vancouver/thunderstick-top-its-game|title=Thunderstick is at the top of its game|date=October 15, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/stage/theatre/thunderstick/|title=Thunderstick|date=January 28, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts/split--personalities-118973874.html|title=Split  personalities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bannock Republic, Suicide Notes, and Three Little Birds have been produced across Canada, including at Canada's [[National Arts Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nac-cna.ca/en/bio/kenneth-t.-williams|title=Kenneth T. Williams - Biographies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams may be best known for Café Daughter, which was nominated for a Sterling award for Outstanding Production in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/theatre/sterling-award-nominations-salute-the-best-in-edmonton-theatre|title=Sterling Award nominations salute the best in Edmonton theatre|date=June 6, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Café Daughter was warmly received &lt;ref name="edmontonjournal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/local-arts/reclaiming-identity-against-the-odds-cafe-daughter|title=Reclaiming identity against the odds: Cafe Daughter|date=November 27, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2015/11/27/colin-maclean-review-cafe-daughter|title=Colin MacLean review: Cafe Daughter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/stage/cafe-daughter/|title=Café Daughter|date=January 16, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it toured major cities across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muskratmagazine.com/compelling-indigenous-dance-and-theatre-productions/ |title=Compelling Indigenous Dance and Theatre Productions |work=Muskrat Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams loosely based the play on the life of Senator [[Lillian Dyck]] whom he met when she received an Aboriginal Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://artsandscience.usask.ca/news/n/3539/Cafe_Daughter_has_family_roots (originally published in the ''Saskatoon Star Phoenix'')&lt;/ref&gt; Dyck's mother encouraged her to hide her native identity as she was growing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ammsa.com/publications/windspeaker/caf%C3%A9-daughter-reveals-secret-and-dream|title=Café Daughter reveals the secret and a dream - Windspeaker - AMMSA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the play "Gordon Winters" the role had been played by the indigenous actor [[Gordon Tootoosis]], who played the lead. The play based on the fall from grace experienced by real-life First Nations Leader [[David Ahenakew]] whose was disgraced after making anti-Semitic comments to a reporter.&lt;ref name="pressreader.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2011/07/06/actor_and_activist_gordon_tootoosis_dies.html|title=Actor and activist Gordon Tootoosis dies - Toronto Star|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His latest play, In Care, about a mother struggling against the child welfare system also received positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestarphoenix.com/entertainment/local-arts/preview-in-care-looks-to-affect-viewers-and-effect-change|title=PREVIEW: In Care looks to affect viewers and effect change|date=October 19, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/in-care-focuses-on-child-welfare-system-1.3812302|title=New play, In Care focuses on child welfare system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestarphoenix.com/entertainment/local-arts/review-in-care-mixes-drama-with-real-life|title=REVIEW: In Care mixes drama with real life|date=October 23, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Li Kaigu''' (李楷固), also known as '''Wu Kaigu''' (武楷固) from 700 to 705, formally the Duke of Yan (燕公), was a general during the reign of [[Wu Zetian]]. He was of [[Khitan people|Khitan]] ethnicity.

== Career ==
In 696, the Khitan rose against Chinese hegemony under the leadership of [[Li Jinzhong]] and his brother-in-law [[Sun Wanrong]]. At the time, Li Kaigu was a general under Li Jinzhong. By 697 Li Jinzhong had died and Sun had been defeated and killed. Li Kaigu and fellow Khitan general Luo Wuzheng (駱務整) surrendered to Wu Zetian's [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou Dynasty]]. Initially, Zhou generals wanted to put Li Kaigu and Luo Wuzheng to death in retaliation for their victories over Zhou forces, but the chancellor [[Di Renjie]] intervened and persuaded Wu Zetian to make them her generals.

Li Kaigu was subsequently able to suppress the remaining Khitan forces. In 700, Li Kaigu was named Duke of Yan and subsequently took the surname "Wu". (Presumably, he changed his surname back to "Li" after Wu Zetian's son, Emperor Zhongzong of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]], returned to the throne in 705 following a coup that restored the Dynasty).

Li Kaigu was unable to defeat [[Go of Balhae|Dae Jo-yeong]], who eventually established the kingdom of [[Balhae]]. Li Kaiju's date of death is unknown.

== Battle of Tianmenling ==
The [[Battle of Tianmenling|Battle of the Astronomical Battle]] or the Battle of the Tiananmen Ling took place in 698 between the Gaoqing Daojongong and the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]].

After the destruction of [[Goguryeo]] by [[Silla]] and the coalition forces of the party, [[Go of Balhae|Dae Joo - young]] went to the lord of the party with his father. In May of 696, when Lee Jing-Chong and Son-Man-榮ong of Rebellion revolted in the Tang dynasty, they were caught up in the confusion. Then, in spite of the emancipation policy of Huan Teng Wu, Goguryeo created a force in the east.

The Tang Dynasty sent an armed force. Dae Joo-young defeated them by rallying gunwale, a group of people from the Malgalese and Goguryeo. Dae defeated them in the royal court and laid the foundations for establishing the [[Bohai Sea]]. In AD 698, Dae built the pavilion under the Dongmoo-san in Jilin castle.

== In popular culture ==

[[Jeong Bo-seok]] portrays Li Kaiju in [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]]'s ''[[Dae Jo Yeong (TV series)]]''.

[[File:Walk of Fame Category Motion Pictures.jpg|thumb|Film camera icon included on all motion picture stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame]]
This '''list of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars''' includes all actors who have been inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in the category of [[film|motion pictures]]. This list does not include any non-acting professionals with motion picture stars, nor does it include any [[Film director|directors]] or [[Film producer|producers]] with acting credits that are minor when compared to their directing and producing credits. This list also excludes all actors with television or live theatre stars on the Walk of Fame, as well as all animal actors and fictional characters.

The star locations and the years of the induction ceremonies are available on the official Hollywood Walk of Fame website maintained by the Hollywood [[Chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/starfinder/type/motion-pictures |title=Walk of Fame Star Search - Search Results for 'type = motion-pictures' |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |date=n.d. |accessdate=April 26, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508021219/http://www.walkoffame.com/starfinder/type/motion-pictures |archivedate=May 8, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The years of birth and death are available in the biographical articles on the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Hollywood Star Walk website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/list/ |title=''Los Angeles Times'' Hollywood Star Walk |website=latimes.com |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |date=n.d. |accessdate=April 26, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508021245/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/list/ |archivedate=May 8, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more accurate birth years from government records—such as birth certificates, census and military records—for some actors via their Wikipedia article sources.

{{double-dagger}} only acting awards are considered in this list; Academy Award information is available on the official [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] database website via dynamically-generated lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ |title=The Official Academy Awards® Database |website=awardsdatabase.oscars.org |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=n.d. |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

==List of actors==
The list is designed to be sortable by clicking on any of the column headings; however, sorting is only possible if [[JavaScript]] is enabled in your web browser. If viewing on a mobile device, switch to the ''desktop view'' to enable sorting (click on the word ''Desktop'' at the [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars#External links|bottom of the page]]).

The initial sort order is by actor surnames. Clicking the same column heading a second time sorts in the reverse order. For example:
* to see the actors in order along Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, click on the '''Address''' column heading; reverse the order by clicking the same column heading a second time
* to group the actors with males separated from females, click the second column heading; click once for females first or twice for males first
* to see all the actors sorted from youngest to oldest, click the '''Age''' column heading once; click again to reverse the order.

This is a '''list of missing people organizations''' grouped by international or United States location. A missing person is a person who has disappeared, and whose status as alive or dead cannot be confirmed as their location and fate is not believed known.

*[[INTERPOL]] is involved in missing person cases through the maintenance of an International Missing Persons Database.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interpol.int/notice/search/missing&lt;/ref&gt; The database is populated by INTERPOL member countries through the use of yellow notices.  [[Interpol notice|INTERPOL Notices]] are international requests for cooperation or alerts allowing police in member countries to share critical crime-related information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interpol.int/INTERPOL-expertise/Notices&lt;/ref&gt; In missing person cases a Yellow Notice can be requested by any [http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/World member country].  They are designed to help locate missing persons, often minors, or to help identify persons who are unable to identify themselves. Where a member country requests it, the Yellow Notice is published to the web and can be linked to the INTERPOL suite of border management tools.

'''Mahfiruz Hatice Hatun'''{{Cref2|a}} ({{circa}} 1590 – by 1610 or 1620) was a wife of [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Ahmed I]] (r. 1603–17) and mother of Sultan [[Osman II]] (r. 1618–22).

==Life==
According to historian Baki Tezcan, nothing is known about her except her probable name and period of death.{{sfn|Tezcan|2007|p=350}}{{Cref2|b}} Her Muslim name, ''Mahfiruz'', means "favourite of the crescent". Such peculiar names were given to the women of the [[Imperial Harem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paulus Cassel|title=An Explanatory Commentary on Esther: With Four Appendices Consisting of the Second Targum Translated from the Aramaic with Notes : Mithra : the Winged Bulls of Persepolis : and Zoroaster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3lAAAAAIAAJ|year=1888|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|page=56|quote=favourite of the crescent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first of Ahmed I's three women and bore him [[Osman II]]. With the birth of Osman, the couple's first child, Ahmed became the youngest Ottoman sultan to become father, and Osman was the first Ottoman first-born prince to be born in the Imperial capital of [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="Tezcan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Baki Tezcan|title=The Second Ottoman Empire: Political and Social Transformation in the Early Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4Ur_agZi2oC&amp;pg=PA115|date=13 September 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51949-6|pages=115–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Şehzade Bayezid (November 1612 – murdered by Murad IV, 27 July 1635, Constantinople, Topkapı Palace, buried in Ahmed I Mausoleum, Sultan Ahmed Mosque), with Mahfiruz;[9][10]

==Assessment by Peirce==
The date of her death is undetermined. There are evidence that strongly suggests that she died at latest by 1610.{{sfn|Tezcan|2007|p=350}} According to [[Leslie P. Peirce]], she was alive when Osman was enthroned as sultan in 1618 after the deposition of incompetent [[Mustafa I]]; Peirce believes that she was not living in the palace during his son's reign nor did she act as ''[[valide sultan]]'', as privy purse registers listed no ''valide sultan'' during Osman's reign.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} Also from the middle of 1620, Osman's governess, the ''daye hatun'', began to receive an extraordinary large stipend, one thousand aspers a day rather than her usual two hundrend aspers, an indication that she was now the official stand-in for the Valide Sultan.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} Mahfiruz may have fallen out of favour, judging by her absence in the palace and burial in Eyüb rather than with her husband, and never have recovered her status as a royal consort.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} Venetian ambassador Contarini reported the beating of a woman who had irritated [[Kösem Sultan|Kösem]], ordered by the sultan, in 1612, which may be identified to Mahfiruz.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} She may have been a rival of Kösem, who made efforts to keep [[Mustafa I|Mustafa]] safe from execution, and saw an obstacle in Mahfiruz.{{why|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}} She was buried in the large sanctuary of [[Eyüp]], [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=233}}

==In popular culture==
In the 2015 Turkish television series ''[[Muhteşem Yüzyıl: Kösem]]'', Mahfiruz was portrayed by actress [[Dilara Aksüyek]]. Historical advisors to the series noted that the Sultan was a Circassian by birth. In the fifth episode of the first series, she was introduced as "Çerkes güzeli Raşa" (Circassian beauty Rasha) before being renamed to Mahfiruz (Mahfiruze).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noluyo.tv/haber/2855/bolum-sonu-dedikodusu-muhtesem-yuzyil-kosem-5-bolum |title=Muhteşem Yüzyıl Kösem |last=Fındık |first=Nida |author= |author-link= |date=10 December 2015 |year= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor= |editor-link= |department= |website=Noluyo.tv |series= |publisher= |location=Istanbul |page= |pages= |at= |language=Turkish |script-title= |trans-title= |type= |format= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211102049/http://noluyo.tv/haber/2855/bolum-sonu-dedikodusu-muhtesem-yuzyil-kosem-5-bolum |archive-date=11 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |access-date=7 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitch Laurence''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[daytime television|daytime]] [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]''. He was portrayed by [[Roscoe Born]] from 1985 to 1987&lt;ref name="1997 Encyc"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waggett|first=Gerard  J.|title=[[The Soap Opera Encyclopedia (Waggett book)|The Soap Opera Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Harper Paperbacks]]|date=November  1997|pages=163–188|chapter=''One Life to Live''|isbn=0-06-101157-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again from 2002 to 2003.

Arriving in 1985 and soon wreaking havoc in fictional [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]], villain Mitch's storyline climaxes in 1986 with his apparent murder, during a season in which the series rose from #4 to #3 in the  [[Nielsen ratings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waggett|first=Gerard  J.|title=The Soap Opera  Encyclopedia|publisher=HarperPaperbacks|date=November  1997|pages=637–639|chapter=Part  VI: Soap Opera Nielsen Ratings|isbn=0-06-101157-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He reappears alive in 2002 seeking to exact his revenge on long running ''One Life to Live''  heroine [[Victoria Lord|Viki Lord Buchanan]]; seemingly killed again in 2003, he is resurrected a second time in 2009.&lt;ref name="Soaps.com 2009-11-09"/&gt;

==Storylines==

===1985–87===
Charismatic Mitch Laurence arrives in [[Llanview, Pennsylvania|Llanview]] in 1985 and sets his sights on ex-girlfriend [[Tina Lord|Tina Clayton]], who has just discovered that she is the daughter of deceased millionaire [[Victor Lord]].&lt;ref name="ABC 1985d"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/soaps/onelifetolive/history/yearly/oltl_1985d.html   |title=''One  Life to Live'' recap (1985, Part  4) |publisher=ABC.com ([[Internet Archive]])  |accessdate=December 8, 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041208085029/http://abc.go.com/daytime/soaps/onelifetolive/history/yearly/oltl_1985d.html |archivedate = December 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding out that Victor's estate will revert to Tina if Victor's other daughter [[Victoria Lord|Viki Lord Buchanan]] has a relapse of her [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], Mitch convinces Tina to assist him in his plan to do just that.&lt;ref name="ABC 1985d"/&gt; But when Tina realizes that Mitch actually intends to murder Viki's husband [[Clint Buchanan]] and frame Viki, she tries to stop him.&lt;ref name="ABC 1985d"/&gt; Mitch kills [[Harry O'Neill (One Life to Live)|Harry O'Neill]] instead, and Tina is arrested.&lt;ref name="ABC 1985d"/&gt; Tina is later exonerated, and Mitch is sent to prison;&lt;ref name="ABC 1985d"/&gt; he "finds God" and manages to be freed, soon becoming the leader of a religious cult and preying upon his young female disciples.&lt;ref name="ABC 1986c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/soaps/onelifetolive/history/yearly/oltl_1986c.html  |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1986, Part 3) |publisher=ABC.com (Internet  Archive) |accessdate=February 9, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209024111/http://abc.go.com/daytime/soaps/onelifetolive/history/yearly/oltl_1986c.html |archivedate = February 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then orchestrates the kidnapping of Clint and Viki Buchanan's newborn daughter [[Jessica Buchanan|Jessica]] by his follower [[Allison Perkins]] (daughter of Statesville Prison's warden).&lt;ref name="ABC 1986d"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/soaps/onelifetolive/history/yearly/oltl_1986d.html |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1986, Part 4) |publisher=ABC.com |accessdate=December 8, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208011146/http://abc.go.com/daytime/soaps/onelifetolive/history/yearly/oltl_1986d.html |archivedate=December 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica is eventually returned, and Mitch is killed on July 18, 1986, by a blow to the back of the head from [[Dorian Lord]] as he attempts to rape her daughter, [[Cassie Callison]].&lt;ref name="ABC 1986d"/&gt;

On April 1, 1987, Mitch is seen again—this time as a voyager on the “Star Ascension", during Viki’s out-of-body experience as she suffered from a brain aneurysm. During the high-stakes dream, which dictates whether she would live or die, Viki is able to ultimately destroy his power over her.

===2002–03===
[[Natalie Buchanan|Natalie Balsom]] arrives in Llanview in 2001, revealing that she is the biological daughter of Viki and Clint Buchanan. At first it is believed that when Allison Perkins had kidnapped the Buchanan baby in 1987, another child was returned and grew up to be Jessica. But when a [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA test]] on Jessica proves that she is also Viki's daughter, the real story comes out. Mitch Laurence had secretly raped a drugged Viki around the same time she conceived a child with Clint. Viki unknowingly became pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint (Natalie) and the other fathered by Mitch (Jessica). Dr. Walter Balsom, who had been one of Mitch's disciples, took Mitch's daughter during delivery, and Viki never knew she'd had more than one child. Mitch, however, wanted his daughter to grow up loved by Viki in the lap of luxury, and he sent Allison to kidnap Clint's child. After replacing her with Mitch's daughter (who would become Jessica), they gave Clint's daughter (who would become Natalie) to Dr. Balsom and his wife [[Roxy Balsom|Roxy]].

In 2002, Mitch returns from the dead; he had not actually died at Dorian's hands, but Dr. Balsom had helped him make it look that way. As "Michael Lazarus", Mitch woos Natalie into marriage. The union is soon annulled when his true identity is revealed, but in 2003 Mitch marries a newly-returned-to-town Dorian, who wants in on Mitch's true plan: to take control of Victor Lord's estate. A very-much-alive Victor has been living in seclusion but is now in need of a heart transplant; Mitch promises him a perfect match in exchange for his fortune, and Victor agrees. Mitch's own daughter Jessica has the matching organ, but he offers up Natalie instead; Viki's arrival stops the operation, and Victor soon dies in front of his shocked daughter. Later, Jessica accidentally pushes Mitch into the Llantano River. Mitch regains his sight (after an accident had blinded him) and is rescued by Viki's half-brother [[Victor Lord Jr.]] (who is impersonating Mitch's brother Walker). Mitch kidnaps Jessica; Viki and Antonio rescue her and Mitch is arrested. He is later released from jail by Victor, who leads him to the docks to make an escape. Mitch tries to kill Victor. Jessica appears and knocks Mitch over the head with a lead pipe, killing him instantly. Not wanting Jessica to take the blame, Victor plants false evidence to point suspicion at others. The body is discovered by Tina's daughter [[Sarah Roberts]], and though Victor and Jessica each confess to killing Mitch, Police Commissioner [[Bo Buchanan]] is inclined to look the other way and abandon the case.

===2009–10===
In 2009, Jessica is unnerved when someone makes it appear as though her deceased husband [[Nash Brennan]] is alive and stalking her. Natalie's husband [[Jared Banks]] appears responsible until Mitch reappears to a stunned Jessica, Natalie, and Jared in California on November 9, 2009.&lt;ref name="Soaps.com 2009-11-09"/&gt; Meanwhile, in Michigan, Roxy's son [[Rex Balsom]]'s long search for the truth reveals that his biological father is Mitch. Mitch shoots Jared to death and is jailed; on December 3, 2009, he pops out of Jared's coffin during the funeral service, having been released after a mix-up with the evidence against him. On December 8, 2009, a distraught Natalie stabs Mitch, who survives. In January 2010, new mayor [[Dorian Lord]] gives in to Mitch's threats against her family and effects Mitch's release from jail. He soon kidnaps Jessica as part of his plan to kidnap Rex's soon-to-be-born baby with [[Stacy Morasco]] and have Jessica raise the child in captivity. His plan foiled, Mitch is furious when Dorian betrays him and vows revenge.&lt;ref name="Soaps.com 2010-02-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/id/8119/Doomed_In_Paris/|title=''One Life to Live'' recap   (2/12/10)|publisher=Soaps.com|accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorian's sister, Melinda, turns up dead. It is then later revealed that [[Schuyler Joplin]] is Mitch's biological son with Roxy and therefore Rex is not, as the two babies where switched on the night they were born by Allison years before. After this, it is briefly mentioned Mitch is still alive and has been taken to Statesville Prison.

===2012===

On January 3, 2012, Mitch, along the other inmates, escapes from Statesville prison and goes directly to Llanfair to see Jessica again. There, he meets Natalie and brags about killing her former husband, Jared. Natalie shoves Mitch down onto the sofa and starts strangling him. She turns to run, but Mitch puts her in a headlock. He grabs her by the hair and starts to head upstairs. They hear Liam's cry through the baby monitor. Mitch thinks it is his grandson, Ryder. From the staircase, Clint calls out that Viki is taking care of the baby. When he enters the living room, Mitch pulls a gun on him. Clint makes a move for the gun, and Mitch slams it down hard on Clint's back.

With Clint unconscious, he takes Natalie, now a hostage, to a church where he believes his followers will celebrate his escape from Statesville. Meanwhile, John discovers a hurt Clint, and he tells John what had happened. At the same time, Viki comes down stairs to find out Natalie has been kidnapped by Mitch. Mitch soon calls Llanfair and demands a trade: He will give Natalie back for his daughter, Jessica. Jessica arrives and agrees to help save her sister. However, Viki and Clint want John to devise a plan where Jessica is not involved. John and Jessica eventually go to the church where Mitch and Natalie were, finding Mitch preparing to rape Natalie.  John and Mitch soon reached an impasse on how the trade should be executed. After a lot of arguing and gun pointing, Jessica is handed over to Mitch, letting Natalie free. Jessica responds to Mitch's happiness by spitting in his face, quickly angering Mitch. Ford shows up and fights with Mitch until he is hit by a falling chandelier after Mitch's gun goes off. Ford is sent to the hospital. Mitch grabs Natalie and puts his gun to her head, again. John tells Mitch it is over, while he believes everything has just begun. Natalie indicates to John to take a shot at Mitch, which he does. Mitch falls to the ground after taking a bullet to the chest, seemingly finishing him off for good.

John asks Natalie if she would like him to make certain Mitch is dead. Natalie replies, "Well, it is Mitch," alluding to his several previous "deaths". Mitch is, in fact, not dead and, after quickly reviving, he begins to fight John for control of a handgun. Several shots ring out and Mitch falls dead, courtesy of Natalie. She finds some closure in being the one to have finally killed Mitch Laurence. When last seen, Mitch's spirit is forcibly escorted to hell by the spirits of [[Stacy Morasco]] and [[Eddie Ford (One Life to Live)|Eddie Ford]], and Stacy tells Mitch that Allison lied to him about Jessica being his biological child.

Mori Sosen is famous for his many paintings depicting [[Japanese macaque|monkeys]]. He also painted other animals, such as deer, boars, and peafowl. [[Robert van Gulik]] called him "an undisputed master" of the painting of the Japanese macaque. When a [[gibbon]] was brought in Japan by the Dutch in 1809, creating somewhat of a sensation (gibbons had long been depicted by Japanese artists, based on Chinese paintings of the animal, but no one in Japan had seen a live gibbon for centuries), it was Mori who had created a graphic record of this event as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert van Gulik]], ''The gibbon in China. An essay in Chinese animal lore''. E.J.&amp;nbsp;Brill, Leiden, Holland. (1967). Pages 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown whether he was born in [[Osaka]], [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], or [[Nishinomiya]], but he lived in Osaka for most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A3%AE%E7%8B%99%E4%BB%99#.E7.94.9F.E6.B6.AF|title=Japanese Wikipedia|website=ja.wikipedia.org|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19042">'''Moseley Baker''' (September 20, 1802 – November 8, 1848) was the Speaker of the House of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]] and served two terms in the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]], where he led impeachment proceedings against President [[Sam Houston]].  During the [[Texas Revolution]], he led a company of men fighting in the [[Texian Army]] and was wounded at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].  He was named a brigadier general of the Republic of Texas militia.

==Early years==
Moseley Baker was born September 20, 1802 in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], to Horace Baker and Rebecca Moseley.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;Cutrer, ''Handbook of Texas''.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Montgomery, Alabama]] as a young man.  There he became a lawyer, and was also the founder and first editor of the ''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]''.&lt;ref name=moore31&gt;Moore (2004), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected to the Alabama State Legislature in 1829 and was elected Speaker of the House.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

Baker lived above his means and soon found himself deeply in debt. In 1832 he was arrested for defrauding the Bank of Alabama.  He soon escaped and made his way to [[Mexican Texas]].&lt;ref name=moore31/&gt;  He arrived in [[San Felipe, Texas|San Felipe de Austin]] with only $1 in his pocket.  After borrowing $10 from another resident, he opened his own law practice.&lt;ref name=moore31/&gt;

Baker, his wife, and their daughter moved to [[Liberty, Texas|Liberty]] in March 1835.  In October he was granted land in [[Lorenzo de Zavala]]'s colony on [[Galveston Bay]].&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

==Texas Revolution==
{{History of Texas}}

===1835===
As relations soured between Texas colonists and the Mexican government, Baker began to advocate for independence from Mexico.  In July 1835, Mexican general [[Martin Perfecto de Cos]] issued warrants for the arrest of Baker and five other men, all accused of land speculation or being part of the [[Anahuac Disturbances]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The other men were [[Robert M. Williamson]], [[William Barret Travis]], [[Samuel May Williams]], [[Frank W. Johnson]], and [[Lorenzo de Zavala]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Local officials refused to enforce the warrants, and the men were never arrested.  All of the men were well respected in their communities, and the warrants greatly angered other colonists.  This, combined with news that Cos was leading a large military force to Texas, convinced many colonists to embrace the idea of revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=July 1986|volume=90|journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|last=Henson|first=Margaret Swett|title=Tory Sentiment in Anglo-Texan Public Opinion, 1832&amp;ndash;1836|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August, Baker began recruiting men willing to fight for independence.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

War broke out in October 1835.  Baker was a private at the first battle, [[Battle of Gonzales|in Gonzales]].  When that battle ended, Baker accompanied the bulk of the army to [[San Antonio de Béxar]], where they commenced a [[siege of Bexar|siege of Cos's troops]], garrisoned in the [[Alamo Mission]].&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;  There were several small skirmishes during the siege. Baker fought in the [[Grass Fight]] and participated in the final assault on the city in early December.  Cos's troops were defeated and marched out of Texas.&lt;ref name=moore31/&gt;

With no Mexican troops remaining in Texas, many Texans believed the war was over.  Men, including Baker, left the army to return to their families.  In February 1836, however, Mexican President [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] led a large contingent of Mexican troops into Texas.  Santa Anna brought the bulk of his army to Béxar, where they besieged the small Texan force garrisoned at the Alamo.  Texan commander [[William B. Travis]] sent dispatches around the region, begging for reinforcements.

===1836===
On February 29, 1836 Baker joined the militia newly organized at San Felipe.  He was elected captain of the company, which had about 30 members.&lt;ref name=moore31/&gt;  The company arrived in Gonzales on March 6 to join the other forces that were gathering to reinforce the Alamo.&lt;ref name=moore33&gt;Moore (2004), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  As no central commander was present, the men elected Baker to take charge of all of the recruits in Gonzales.  He marched them to the east bank of the Guadalupe River, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} below the town, and made camp.&lt;ref name=moore34&gt;Moore (2004), p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Houston]] arrived in Gonzales about 4 pm on March 11.  He announced that the [[Convention of 1836]] had declared Texas an independent nation and read the men the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]].  The new interim government had placed Houston in charge of the recruits gathered in Gonzales.  That evening, two men arrived from Béxar with news that the Mexican army had retaken the Alamo, and the Texian defenders were dead; Houston promptly arrested the men as spies.&lt;ref name=moore43&gt;Moore (2004), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, Houston organized the army.  All of the companies gathered, including Baker's, were placed into the First Regiment of Infantry, with [[Edward Burleson]] in charge.&lt;ref name=moore48&gt;Moore (2004), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Houston sent scouts to determine what had actually happened in Béxar.  They returned on March 13 with [[Susanna Dickinson]], who had been inside the Alamo during the battle.  Dickinson warned that more than 2,000 Mexican troops were on their way to Gonzales.  Local citizens panicked; Houston ordered an immediate retreat, promising that his new army would protect the citizens as they fled.&lt;ref name=moorescrape&gt;Moore (2004), pp. 55&amp;ndash;60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker and the rest of the army marched for 26 of the next 38 hours.&lt;ref name=moore71&gt;Moore (2004), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next week, the Texian army continued to head east and north, away from the Mexican soldiers.  Texian volunteers flocked to Houston's force.  Baker helped with the recruitment; on March 22 he wrote a letter to the ''[[Telegraph and Texas Register]]'', calling for volunteers and asking the women of Texas to convince their husbands and sons to join.&lt;ref name=moore107&gt;Moore (2004), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, news reached Houston's army that General [[James Fannin]] had been defeated at the [[Battle of Coleto]].&lt;ref name=moore109&gt;Moore (2004), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  Houston ordered another retreat, so Baker and his men headed east toward the [[Brazos River]].&lt;ref name=moore115&gt;Moore (2004), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a brief rest in [[San Felipe, Texas|San Felipe]], Houston ordered the army to march to [[Groce's Landing]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} away.  Baker and Captain [[Wyly Martin]] absolutely refused to retreat further.&lt;ref name=moore136&gt;Moore (2004), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  Houston chose not to directly challenge the men, fearing he would lose control of his army if Baker or Martin were able to gather enough troops to their perspective.  Instead, he gave each of them orders to remain behind and protect key crossings along the Brazos.&lt;ref name=moore137and134&gt;Moore (2004), pp. 134, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, Baker had about 40 men with him.  His company built fortifications along the east bank of the Brazos, directly across the river from San Felipe.  By March 31, they had dug an L-shaped ditch, {{convert|124|yd|m}} long, and piled tree branches in front.&lt;ref name=moore140&gt;Moore (2004), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, Baker's men found four survivors from Fannin's regiment wandering the prairie.  The men had escaped after the [[Battle of Refugio]] and were searching for the remainder of the Texian army.&lt;ref name=moore157&gt;Moore (2004), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the survivors, [[Samuel G. Hardaway]], joined Baker's company.&lt;ref name=moore158&gt;Moore (2004), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baker requested reinforcements to hold the San Felipe crossing, and within days had about 120 men under his command.  He informed Houston this ought to be a large enough number to hold the crossing against the Mexican army.&lt;ref name=moore158/&gt;

On March 29, scouts [[Deaf Smith]] and John York mistook a cattle drive for a cavalry troop and informed Baker that the Mexican army was only a few miles from his position.  Baker ordered that the town be burned, saying Houston had ordered it so.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Houston flatly denied giving this order.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moore140/&gt;  [[Moses Austin Bryan]], nephew of the founder of San Felipe, refused to start the fires, so Baker personally set a torch to the first home.&lt;ref name=moore141&gt;Moore (2004), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baker and his men remained camped on the east bank.

Santa Anna's troops marched into San Felipe at dawn on April 7.  Knowing that the Mexican army was close, on April 6 Baker had ordered his men to hide all the boats and rafts along the river.  He then sent three men as [[Picket (military)|pickets]] on the west bank.  Private Bill Simpson took the third watch, and promptly fell asleep.  The Mexican advance guard captured him; the other two escaped and made it to safety with the rest of Baker's troops.  Simpson told Santa Anna everything he knew - that Houston was at Groce's Landing with an army numbering approximately 800 men, and that the Texian army meant to retreat all the way to the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] if the Mexican army crossed the Brazos.&lt;ref name=mooresimpson&gt;Moore (2004), pp. 176&amp;ndash;178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout that day and the next, Baker's troops were under near-constant fire from Mexican snipers and artillery.  Private John Bricker was hit with grapeshot from the cannon, becoming the first Texian casualty of the San Jacinto campaign.&lt;ref name=moore181&gt;Moore (2004), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moore182/&gt;  Mexican troops built several rafts, but Baker's men fired enough that Santa Anna decided it was unwise to try to cross at that point.&lt;ref name=moore182&gt;Moore (2004), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 9, the Mexican artillery maneuvered close enough to strike Baker's makeshift fortifications.  Heavy rains caused the river to rise, and the Texian camp was soon surrounded by floodwaters.  Their only way out was the main road.  Baker called for a vote, and the men voted to retreat.  Soon after they left, Mexican forces withdrew from San Felipe, and none of the scouts were able to discern where they had gone.&lt;ref name=moore188&gt;Moore (2004), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker's men and those of Wyly Martin rejoined the main body of Houston's army in the middle of the night of April 14.&lt;ref name=moore214&gt;Moore (2004), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;  Houston ordered an early march on April 15.  Martin told Houston that his men deserved a chance to rest and eat breakfast, and they would not be marching until after they had done so.  Angry, Houston ordered Martin to eat and then escort the Texian families fleeing the area to the Trinity River.  Worried he would be ordered to take care of women and children instead of fighting the Mexican army, Baker ordered his men to be ready to march - without their breakfast.&lt;ref name=moore216-7&gt;Moore (2004), pp. 216&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texian army made camp at [[Lynchburg, Texas|Lynchburg]], on the banks of [[Buffalo Bayou]], on April 19.  The following day, Santa Anna his portion of the Mexican army to a campsite less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} away.  Eager to test the strength of the Texians, Santa Anna sent his artillery, a 9- or 12-pounder cannon known as the Golden Standard, to a spot about {{convert|150|yd|m}} from where the Texians had concealed themselves in a grove of timber.&lt;ref name=moore265&gt;Moore (2004), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  Houston ordered Captain [[James C. Neill]] to take the two Texian cannon to the edge of the trees and return fire.&lt;ref name=moore266&gt;Moore (2004), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cannons traded shots for approximately 30 minutes.  Both Neill and Mexican Captain Fernando Urriza, who commanded the Golden Standard's crew, were injured.  The infantry were eager to join the fight; Baker later recounted that "it was with the utmost difficulty that I could prevent my company from rushing on the enemy".&lt;ref name=moore267&gt;Moore (2004), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

The skirmish lasted for three and one-half hours, with a small number of cavalry and infantry on each side engaging.  Mexican forces finally withdrew to their camp.&lt;ref name=moore269&gt;Moore (2004), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that afternoon, Houston allowed Colonel [[Sidney Sherman]] to take the Texian cavalry and skirmish again.  Part of the Mexican infantry joined the battle, and Sherman was forced to withdraw when Houston refused to send in a larger part of his force.&lt;ref name=moore274&gt;Moore (2004), pp. 274&amp;ndash;282.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Texian soldiers, including Baker, were angry that Houston had not allowed the rest of the infantry to join the fight.  Baker began composing a letter on behalf of the army, complaining that Houston had no intention of engaging in battle, and would instead delay until Santa Anna's troops had been reinforced and grossly outnumbered the Texian army.&lt;ref name=moore284&gt;Moore (2004), p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Anna received approximately 400 reinforcements at 8 a.m. the following morning, bringing his army to 1,250 men.  Texian troops were convinced that a Mexican attack was imminent.&lt;ref name=moore291&gt;Moore (2004), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moore298&gt;Moore (2004), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;  Santa Anna's men had spent much of the night preparing for a Texian attack, building makeshift breastworks around their exposed camp.  The newly arrived troops were no better rested - they had marched continuously for 24 hours with no sleep or food.&lt;ref name=moore292&gt;Moore (2004), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the morning faded away with no sign that the Texians were preparing an attack, Santa Anna relaxed his guard. His troops, including those who had been standing guard, were given permission to rest.

At noon, Houston held a council of war with his senior officers.  They voted to fight at some point that day.&lt;ref name=moore302&gt;Moore (2004), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edward Burleson]], commander of the First Regiment of Texian Volunteers, called the officers under his command together.  They were asked to vote on whether to attack at 4 pm that day or 4 am the following morning.  Baker was one of only two officers to vote for the pre-dawn hour.&lt;ref name=moore311&gt;Moore (2004), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Second Regiment held a similar vote.&lt;ref name=moore311/&gt;

At 3:30 pm, the Texian army lined up.&lt;ref name=moore312&gt;Moore (2004), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baker's men, as Burleson's First Regiment, were in the center of the line.&lt;ref name=moore313&gt;Moore (2004), p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baker addressed the men, giving a "rousing, inspirational" speech that referenced the sacrifices both civilians and members of the Texan military had endured.&lt;ref name=cushman171&gt;Cushman (2010), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;  The speech ended with "Remember Goliad!  Remember the Alamo!".&lt;ref name=cushman173&gt;Cushman (2010), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baker's men reportedly hoisted a red handkerchief to serve as their flag, and as a warning to the Mexican troops that they would offer no quarter.&lt;ref name=moore314&gt;Moore (2004), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4 pm, the Texian army advanced, commencing the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].  They crept forward in silence, hidden by the tall grass.&lt;ref name=moore316&gt;Moore (2004), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;  Houston ordered them to charge when they were about {{convert|200|yd|m}} from the Mexican camp.  Baker was one of the first wounded; First Lieutenant John Borden stepped forward to lead his company.&lt;ref name=moore325&gt;Moore (2004), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
From October 1836 through June 1837, Baker served in the First [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]], representing [[Austin County, Texas|Austin County]].  He attempted to impeach Houston, who had been elected President of the new country; the impeachment proceedings failed.  After his term expired, Baker moved to [[Galveston County, Texas|Galveston County]].  There he earned a second term in Congress, serving from November 1838 through January 1839.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

The next Congress named Baker a brigadier general in the militia.  He led a campaign against Indians along the [[Brazos River]].  Baker ran for a third term, to serve in the Sixth Congress, in 1841, but lost to [[Archibald Wynns]] by one vote. He was reappointed a brigadier general in 1842, following Mexican General [[Adrian Woll]]'s invasion of Béxar.  Baker raised a company of men but fell ill and was forced to hand command to Gardiner Smith.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

Baker continued his feud with Houston, culminating in an 1844 open letter that named Houston "the greatest curse that Providence in its wrath could have sent upon the country."&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;  Following the death of his wife, Baker became a [[Methodist]] preacher.  He promoted his version of the religion through his own newspaper, ''True Evangelist''.  Although Methodist leaders, who disagreed with some of Baker's teachings, asked him to discontinue publishing the paper, Baker refused.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

Baker died of [[yellow fever]] on November 4, 1848 in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].  His body was first laid to rest at Jefferson Davis Cemetery before being moved to the Episcopal Cemetery.  In 1929, his remains were exhumed and reinterred at the [[Texas State Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

'''Neil Diamond''' is a [[Cree]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] filmmaker based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], born and raised in [[Waskaganish, Quebec]]. Working with [[Rezolution Pictures]], Diamond has directed the documentary films ''[[Reel Injun]]'', ''The Last Explorer'', ''One More River'', ''Heavy Metal: A Mining Disaster in Northern Quebec'' and ''Cree Spoken Here'', along with three seasons of ''DAB IYIYUU'', a series for the [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]] about Cree [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]].&lt;ref name="Skenderis"&gt;{{cite news |last=Skenderis |first=Stephanie |title=A reel shame |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2010/02/17/f-neil-diamond-reel-injun.html |accessdate=3 December 2010|work=[[CBC News]]|date=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koepke "&gt;{{cite news|last=Koepke |first=Melora |title=The real Neil Diamond |url=http://www.hour.ca/film/film.aspx?iIDArticle=19478|accessdate=3 December 2010|newspaper=[[Hour (magazine)|Hour magazine]]|date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 [[docudrama]] ''The Last Explorer'', Diamond explored the story of his great-uncle George Elson, a Cree [[guide]] who helped to map [[Labrador]] as part of an ill-fated 1903 expedition with [[Leonidas Hubbard]] and [[Dillon Wallace]], and a return voyage in 1905 with Hubbard's widow [[Mina Benson Hubbard|Mina Hubbard]].&lt;ref name="imagine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program and schedule|url=http://www.imaginenative.org/filmpreview.php?id=194|work=[[imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114608/http://www.imaginenative.org/filmpreview.php?id=194|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2011, Diamond is developing a project with Inuit filmmaker [[Zacharias Kunuk]] about the 18th-century conflict between Cree and Inuit, which lasted almost a century.&lt;ref name=Dunlevy&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunlevy|first=T'Cha|title=Reel Injun continues making waves|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Reel+Injun+continues+making+waves/4586752/story.html|accessdate=15 April 2011|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Reel Injun''==
{{main|Reel Injun}}
''Reel Injun'' was inspired by Diamond's own experiences as a child in Waskaganish, where he and other Native children would play cowboys and Indians after local screenings of [[Westerns]] in their remote community. Diamond remembers that although the children were in fact "Indians," they all wanted to be the [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref name="Koepke "/&gt; Afterwards, when he was old enough to move south to study, he would be questioned by non-Native people about whether his people lived in [[teepee]]s and rode horses, causing Diamond to realize that their preconceptions about Native people were also derived from movies. These stereotypes motivated him to help America see the true identity of what a Native American was.&lt;ref name="Skenderis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pevere"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pevere|first=Geoff|title=Cree director Neil Diamond's real look at reel Indians|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/767792--cree-director-neil-diamond-s-real-look-at-reel-indians|accessdate=3 December 2010|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palazzo Grazioli''' is a building situated at Via del Plebiscito 102 between the [[Palazzo Doria Pamphili]] and [[Palazzo Altieri]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], in an area rich in archaeological remains of ancient Rome, the result of numerous modifications and restoration work carried out by several noble Roman families who lived there over the centuries.

The oldest sources connects the palace to the Ercolani family and was initially built by [[Giacomo della Porta]]. The family of [[Luigi Gottifredi]], a priest of the Society of Jesus, who settled there,  made a radical renovation employing [[Camillo Arcucci]], an architect of the Roman Baroque, in the years 1645 to 1650. In the early 19th century,  the palace was the residence of the Ambassador of Austria and then the Infanta of Spain and [[Duchess of Lucca]], [[Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Spain]] who died there in 1824. It was later acquired by Commander Grazioli, then Baron of  Castelporziano and Duke of Santa Croce di Magliano, who in 1863 entrusted the restoration which ended in 1874.

The facade of the building on Via del Plebiscito is decorated with pilasters with capitals. At the center of it opens the door flanked by two Doric columns of gray granite and topped by a balcony.

The palace is known for being a home of [[Silvio Berlusconi]], who rented a floor of the palace. He announced his [[Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi|resignation]] there on 12 November 2011.&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/11/12/silvio-berlusconi-resigns-after-italian-parliament-approves-austerity-measures_n_1090149.html|title=Silvio Berlusconi Resigns After Italian Parliament Approves Austerity Measures |publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Poles''' ({{lang-pl|Polacy}}, {{IPA-pl|pɔˈlat͡sɨ|pron}}; singular masculine: ''Polak'', singular feminine: ''Polka''), commonly referred to as the '''Polish people''', are a nation and [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[ethnic group]] native to [[Poland]] in Central Europe who share a common ancestry, [[Culture of Poland|culture]], [[History of Poland|history]], and are native speakers of the [[Polish language]]. The population of self-declared Poles in Poland is estimated at 37,394,000 out of an overall population of 38,538,000 (based on the 2011 census),&lt;ref name="stat"/&gt; of whom 36,522,000 declared Polish alone.&lt;ref name=gudaszewski&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://stat.gov.pl/files/gfx/portalinformacyjny/pl/defaultaktualnosci/5670/22/1/1/struktura_narodowo-etniczna.pdf|title=Struktura narodowo-etniczna, językowa i wyznaniowa ludności Polski.

A wide-ranging Polish diaspora (the ''[[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]'') exists throughout Europe, the Americas, and in [[Australasia]]. Today the largest urban concentrations of Poles are within the [[Warsaw]] and [[Silesian Metropolis|Silesian metropolitan area]]s.

Poland's history dates back over a thousand years, to c. 930–960 AD, when the [[Polans (western)|Polans]] – an influential [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribe in the [[Greater Poland]] region, now home to such cities as [[Poznań]], [[Gniezno]], [[Kalisz]], [[Konin]] and [[Września]] – united various [[Lechites|Lechitic]] tribes under what became the [[Piast dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerard Labuda]]. ''Fragmenty dziejów Słowiańszczyzny zachodniej'', t.1–2 p.72 2002; [[Henryk Łowmiański]]. ''Początki Polski: z dziejów Słowian w I tysiącleciu n.e.'', t. 5 p.472; Stanisław Henryk Badeni, 1923. p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating the Polish state. The subsequent [[Christianization of Poland]], in 966 CE, marked Poland's advent to the community of [[Western Christendom]].

Poles have made important contributions to the world in every major field of human endeavor.  Notable Polish émigrés – many of them forced from their homeland by historic vicissitudes – have included physicists [[Marie Skłodowska Curie]] and [[Joseph Rotblat]], mathematician [[Stanisław Ulam]], pianists [[Fryderyk Chopin]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]], actresses [[Helena Modjeska]] and [[Pola Negri]], novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], military leaders [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] and [[Casimir Pulaski]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|U.S. National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], politician [[Rosa Luxemburg]], filmmakers [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and the [[Warner Brothers]], cartoonist [[Max Fleischer]], and cosmeticians [[Helena Rubinstein]] and [[Max Factor Sr.|Max Factor]].

==Origins==
[[File:Gesta Hamburgensis trans oddara st polanos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Fragment of ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' (1073) by [[Adam of Bremen]], containing the name "[[Polans (western)|Polans]]":  "''trans [[Oder|Oddaram]] sunt Polanos''"]]
[[Slavs]] have been in the territory of modern Poland for over 1500 years. They organized into [[Tribe|tribal units]], of which the larger ones were later known as the [[Polish tribes]]; the names of many tribes are found on the list compiled by the anonymous [[Bavarian Geographer]] in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="playground I xxvii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|2005a|p=xxvii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th and 10th centuries the tribes gave rise to developed regions along the upper [[Vistula]] (the [[Vistulans]] within the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire sphere),&lt;ref name="playground I xxvii"/&gt; the [[Baltic Sea]] coast and in [[Greater Poland]]. The last tribal undertaking resulted in the 10th century in a lasting [[political system|political structure]] and [[State (polity)|state]], [[Poland]], one of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] nations.&lt;ref name="UzP 122-143"&gt;{{Harvnb|Derwich|Żurek|2002|pp=122–143}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept which has become known as the [[Piast Idea]], the chief proponent of which was [[Jan Ludwik Popławski]], is based on the statement that the [[Piast]] homeland was inhabited by so-called "native" aboriginal Slavs and Slavonic Poles since time immemorial and only later was "infiltrated" by "alien" [[Celts]], [[Germans]], Baltic peoples and others. After 1945 the so-called "autochthonous" or "aboriginal" school of Polish prehistory received official backing in Poland and a considerable degree of popular support. According to this view, the [[Lusatian Culture]] which archaeologists have identified between the [[Oder]] and the [[Vistula]] in the early [[Iron Age]], is said to be Slavonic; all non-Slavonic tribes and peoples recorded in the area at various points in ancient times are dismissed as "migrants" and "visitors". In contrast, the critics of this theory, such as [[Marija Gimbutas]], regard it as an unproved hypothesis and for them the date and origin of the westward migration of the Slavs is largely uncharted; the Slavonic connections of the Lusatian Culture are entirely imaginary; and the presence of an ethnically mixed and constantly changing collection of peoples on the [[North European Plain|Middle European Plain]] is taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/7953/1/KJ00000034106.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129052255/http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/7953/1/KJ00000034106.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Polish minorities in the surrounding countries including (Germany), and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] minorities in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], northern and eastern [[Lithuania]], western [[Ukraine]], and western [[Belarus]]. There are some smaller indigenous minorities in nearby countries such as [[Moldova]]. There is also a Polish minority in Russia which includes indigenous Poles as well as those forcibly deported during and after [[World War II]]; the total number of Poles in what was the former [[Soviet Union]] is estimated at up to 3 million.&lt;ref&gt;Gil Loescher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eR5oYvO1uFgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=3+million+ethnic+Poles+in+the+former+Soviet+Union&amp;sig=Kdm4ndGC7XbDsOS8qiXjPlxC5k8 Beyond Charity: International Cooperation and the Global Refugee Crisis], published by the [[University of Oxford]] Press US, 1993, 1996. {{ISBN|0-19-510294-0}}.

The term "[[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]" is usually used in Poland to refer to people of Polish origin who live outside Polish borders, officially estimated at around 10 to 20 million. There is a notable Polish [[diaspora]] in the [[Polish American|United States]], [[Polish Brazilian|Brazil]], and [[Polish Canadians|Canada]]. France has a historic relationship with Poland and has a relatively large Polish-descendant population. Poles have lived in France since the 18th century. In the early 20th century, over a million Polish people settled in France, mostly during world wars, among them Polish émigrés fleeing either Nazi occupation or later Soviet rule.

In the United States, a significant number of Polish immigrants settled in Chicago, Ohio, Detroit, [[New Jersey]], New York City, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], and [[New England]]. The highest concentration of [[Polish Americans]] in a single New England municipality is in [[New Britain, Connecticut]]. The majority of Polish Canadians have arrived in Canada since World War II. The number of Polish immigrants increased between 1945 and 1970, and again after the [[End of Communism in Poland (1989)|end of Communism in Poland in 1989]]. In Brazil the majority of Polish immigrants settled in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] State. Smaller, but significant numbers settled in the states of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Espírito Santo and [[São Paulo (state)]]. The city of [[Curitiba]] has the second largest Polish diaspora in the world (after Chicago) and [[Polish music]], [[Polish cuisine|dishes]] and [[Polish culture|culture]] are quite common in the region.

[[21st century economic migration of Poles|A recent large migration]] of Poles took place following Poland's accession to the [[European Union]] and opening of the EU's labor market; with an approximate number of 2 million, primarily young, Poles taking up jobs abroad.&lt;ref name=onet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/swiat/sueddeutsche-zeitung-polska-przezywa-najwieksza-fale-emigracji-od-100-lat/yrtt0|title="Sueddeutsche Zeitung": Polska przeżywa największą falę emigracji od 100 lat|date=26 September 2014|website=Wiadomosci.onet.pl|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that over half a million Polish people have come to work in the United Kingdom from Poland. Since 2011, Poles have been able to [[Freedom of movement for workers|work freely]] throughout the EU and not just in the United Kingdom, Ireland and [[Sweden]] where they have had full working rights since Poland's [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|EU accession in 2004]]. The Polish community in [[Norway]] has increased substantially and has grown to a total number of 120,000, making Poles the largest immigrant group in Norway.

[[File:Pillati A highlander with bagpipes.jpg|thumb|right|An ethnic highlander (''[[Góral]]'') with [[bagpipes]] in [[Lesser Poland]]]]
{{main article|Culture of Poland}}
The [[culture of Poland]] has a [[History of Poland|history of 1000 years]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Zamoyski, [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Polish-Way-Thousand-History-Culture/dp/0781802008 The Polish Way: A Thousand Year History of the Poles and Their Culture]. Published 1993, Hippocrene Books, Poland, {{ISBN|0-7818-0200-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland, located in Central Europe, developed a character that was influenced by its geography at the confluence of fellow Central European cultures ([[Austrian culture|Austrian]], [[Czech culture|Czech]], [[German culture|German]], [[Hungarian culture|Hungarian]], and [[Slovak culture|Slovak]]) as well as from Western European cultures ([[French culture|French]], [[Spanish culture|Spanish]] and [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch]]), Southern European cultures ([[Italian culture|Italian]] and [[Greek culture|Greek]]), [[Northern Europe|Baltic/Northeastern]] cultures ([[Lithuanian culture|Lithuanian]], [[Estonian culture|Estonian]] and [[Latvian culture|Latvian]]), Eastern European cultures ([[Belarusian culture|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian]]) and Western Asian/[[Caucasus|Caucasian]] cultures ([[Turkish culture|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Armenian culture|Armenian]], and [[Georgian culture|Georgian]]).  Influences were also conveyed by immigrants (Hungarian, Slovak, Czech, Jewish, German and Dutch), political alliances (with [[Lithuania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Hungary]], Saxony, France and [[Sweden]]), conquests of the Polish-Lithuanian state (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Romania and Latvia) and conquerors of the Polish lands (the Russian Empire, Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg monarchy, later to be known as the Austrian Empire or Austria-Hungary).

Over time, Polish culture has been greatly influenced by its ties with the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Hungarians|Hungarian]],
and [[Latinate]] world and other ethnic groups and minorities living in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland]], 2002–2007, [http://www.poland.gov.pl/Culture,484.html AN OVERVIEW OF POLISH CULTURE.] Access date 13 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad (especially Italy) and open to cultural and artistic trends popular in other European countries. Owing to this central location, the Poles came very early into contact with both civilizations&amp;nbsp;– eastern and western, and as a result developed economically, culturally, and politically. A German general [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmut Carl von Moltke]], in his ''Poland. A historical sketch'' (1885), stated that "Poland of the fifteenth century was one of the most civilised states of Europe."

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity, experiencing severe crises, especially during World War II and in the following years. These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art, with all its complex nuances.&lt;ref name="MFA" /&gt;

Poland was for centuries a refuge to many [[Jews]] from all over Europe; in the twentieth century, a large number emigrated to [[Israel]]. Several prominent Israeli statesmen were born in Poland, including Israel's founder [[David Ben-Gurion]], former [[President of Israel]] [[Shimon Peres]], and [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Ministers]] [[Yitzhak Shamir]] and [[Menachem Begin]].

{{main article|Polish language}}
The [[Polish language]] ({{lang-pl|język polski}}) is a [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic language]] and the official language of Poland. Its written form uses the [[Polish alphabet]], which is the [[Latin alphabet]] with the addition of a few [[diacritic marks]].

Poland is the most linguistically homogeneous European country; nearly 97% of Poland's citizens declare [[Polish language|Polish]] as their mother tongue. Elsewhere, ethnic Poles constitute large minorities in (Germany), northern [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], northeast [[Lithuania]] and western [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. Polish is the most widely used minority language in Lithuania's [[Vilnius]] County (26% of the population, according to the 2001 census results) and is found elsewhere in northeastern and western Lithuania. In Ukraine it is most common in the western [[Lviv]] and Volyn oblast (provinces), while in western Belarus it is used by the significant Polish minority, especially in the [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] and [[Grodno]] regions and in areas along the Lithuanian border.

The geographical distribution of the [[Polish language]] was greatly affected by the border changes and population transfers that followed [[World War II]]. Poles resettled in the "[[Recovered Territories]]" in the west and north. Some Poles remained in the previously Polish-ruled territories in the east that were annexed by the [[USSR]], resulting in the present-day Polish-speaking minorities in [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]], although many Poles were expelled or emigrated from those areas to areas within Poland's new borders. Meanwhile, the flight and expulsion of Germans, as well as the expulsion of Ukrainians and resettlement of Ukrainians within Poland, contributed to the country's linguistic homogeneity.

Polish-speakers use the language in a uniform manner throughout most of Poland, though numerous languages and dialects coexist alongside the standard Polish language. The most common dialects in Poland are [[Silesian language|Silesian]], spoken in Upper Silesia, and [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], widely spoken in the north.

=== Science and technology ===
Education has been of prime interest to Poland since the early 12th century. The catalog of the library of the Cathedral Chapter in [[Kraków]] dating from 1110 shows that Polish scholars already then had access to literature from all over Europe. In 1364 King [[Casimir III the Great]] founded the [[Kraków Academy]], which would become Jagiellonian University, one of the great universities of Europe. The Polish people have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://uatacz.up.krakow.pl/~wwwchemia/pliki/ISBN_978_83_7271_768_9_From_alchemy_to_the_present_day|title=From alchemy to the present day – the choice of biographies of Polish scientists|last=Nodzyńska|first=Małgorzata|last2=Cieśla|first2=Paweł|publisher=Pedagogical University of Kraków|year=2012|isbn=978-83-7271-768-9|location=Cracow|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of early famous scientists in Poland begins with the 13th-century [[Vitello]] and includes the [[polymath]] and astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who formulated a [[Mathematical model|model]] of [[Celestial spheres#Renaissance|the universe]] that placed [[Heliocentrism|the Sun]] rather than the Earth at its center; the publication of Copernicus' book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) just before his death in 1543 is considered a major event in the history of science, triggering the [[Copernican Revolution]] and making an important contribution to the [[Scientific Revolution]]. In 1773 King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] established the [[Commission of National Education]], the world's first ministry of education.

After the 1795 [[Partitions of Poland|third partition of Poland]], no free Polish state existed. The 19th and 20th centuries saw many Polish scientists working abroad. The greatest was [[Maria Skłodowska Curie]] (1867–1934), a [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] who conducted pioneering research on [[radioactivity]] and was the [[List of female Nobel laureates|first woman to win a Nobel Prize]], the first person and only woman to [[Nobel Prize#Multiple laureates|win twice]], the only person to win twice in multiple sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of [[Nobel Prize#Family laureates|five Nobel Prizes]].  Another notable Polish expatriate scientist was [[Ignacy Domeyko]] (1802–89), a geologist and mineralogist who lived and worked in South America, in [[Chile]].

[[Kazimierz Funk]] (1884–1967), whose name is commonly [[English language|anglicized]] as "Casimir Funk", was a Polish [[Biochemistry|biochemist]], generally credited with being among the first to formulate (in 1912) the concept of [[vitamin]]s, which he called "vital amines" or "vitamines".

According to [[NASA]], Polish scientists were among the pioneers of [[rocket]]ry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/A_Pictorial_History_of_Rockets.html|title=A Pictorial History of Rockets|last=|first=|publisher=NASA|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, Poland was a world center of mathematics. Outstanding Polish mathematicians formed the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] (including [[Stefan Banach]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Stanisław Ulam]]) and [[Warsaw School of Mathematics]] (including [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]]). [[World War II]] pushed many of them into exile; [[Benoit Mandelbrot]]'s family left Poland when he was still a child.  An alumnus of the Warsaw School of Mathematics was [[Antoni Zygmund]], a shaper of 20th-century [[mathematical analysis]].

[[Marian Rejewski]] (1905–80), a Polish mathematician, in December 1932 solved the plugboard-equipped [[Enigma machine]], the main [[cipher]] device used by [[Nazi Germany]]. The cryptologic successes of Rejewski and his mathematician colleagues [[Jerzy Różycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]], over six and a half years later, jump-started British reading of Enigma in the Second World War; the intelligence so gained, code-named ''[[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]'', contributed, perhaps decisively, to the [[End of World War II in Europe|defeat of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Allied Commander [[Dwight D.

Today Poland has over 100 institutions of post-secondary education – technical, medical, economic, as well as [[List of universities in Poland|500 universities]] – located in major cities such as [[Gdańsk]], [[Kraków]], [[Wrocław]], [[Lublin]], [[Łódź]], [[Poznań]], [[Rzeszów]] and [[Warsaw]].  They employ over 61,000 scientists and scholars.  Another 300 research-and-development institutes are home to some 10,000 researchers. There are also a number of smaller laboratories.  Altogether, these institutions support some 91,000 scientists and scholars.

The origin of Polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century, from which manuscripts have been found in [[Stary Sącz]], containing [[polyphony|polyphonic]] compositions related to the Parisian [[Notre Dame School]]. Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'', may also date back to this period. The first known notable composer, however, [[Mikołaj z Radomia]], lived in the 15th century.

During the 16th century, mostly two musical groups—both based in [[Kraków]] and belonging to the King and Archbishop of Wawel—led the rapid innovation of Polish music. Composers writing during this period include [[Wacław of Szamotuły]], [[Mikołaj Zieleński]], and [[Mikołaj Gomółka]]. [[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Kraków from about the age of five, became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf|title=The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas|work=semper.pl|page=244|accessdate=13 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h7rxPZrB?url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf|archivedate=29 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====17th–18th centuries====
{{Listen|filename=Polonezz.ogg|title=''Pożegnanie Ojczyzny'' (Farewell to Country)|plain=Polonaise by Ogiński (1794)|description=Polonaise by [[Michał Kleofas Ogiński|Ogiński]]|format=[[Ogg]]}}
In the last years of the 16th century and the first part of the 17th century, a number of Italian musicians were guests at the royal courts of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and his son [[Ladislaus IV of Poland|Władysław IV]]. These included [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Giovanni Francesco Anerio]], and [[Marco Scacchi]]. Polish composers from this period focused on [[baroque]] religious music, concertos for voices, instruments, and [[basso continuo]], a tradition that continued into the 18th century. The best-remembered composer of this period is [[Adam Jarzębski]], known for his instrumental works such as ''Chromatica'', ''Tamburetta'', ''Sentinella'', ''Bentrovata'', and ''Nova Casa''.  Other composers include [[Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki]], [[Franciszek Lilius]], [[Bartłomiej Pękiel]], [[Stanisław Sylwester Szarzyński]] and [[Marcin Mielczewski]].

In addition, a tradition of operatic production began in Warsaw in 1628, with a performance of ''Galatea'' (composer uncertain), the first Italian opera produced outside Italy.  Shortly after this performance, the court produced [[Francesca Caccini]]'s opera ''[[La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d’Alcina]]'', which she had written for Prince [[Władysław IV|Władysław]] three years earlier when he was in Italy.  Another first, this is the earliest surviving opera written by a woman. When Władysław became king (as Władysław IV) he oversaw the production of at least ten operas during the late 1630s and 1640s, making Warsaw a center of the art. The composers of these operas are not known:  they may have been Poles working under Marco Scacchi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Marco_Scacchi|title=Marco Scacchi|website=''Cpdl.org''|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the royal chapel, or they may have been among the Italians imported by Władysław.

The late 17th century and the 18th century saw Poland in sociopolitical decline, which hindered the development of music. Some composers (such as Jan Stefani and [[Maciej Kamieński]]) attempted to create a Polish opera; others imitated foreign composers such as [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].

The most important development in this time, however, was the [[polonaise]], perhaps the first distinctively Polish [[art music]]. Polonaises for piano were and remain popular, such as those by [[Michał Kleofas Ogiński]], [[Karol Kurpiński]], [[Juliusz Zarębski]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]], [[Mieczysław Karłowicz]], [[Józef Elsner]], and, most famously, [[Fryderyk Chopin]]. Chopin remains very well known, and is regarded for composing a wide variety of works, including [[mazurka]]s, [[nocturne]]s, [[waltz]]es and concertos, and using traditional Polish elements in his pieces.  The same period saw [[Stanislaw Moniuszko|Stanisław Moniuszko]], the leading individual in the successful development of [[Polish opera]], still renowned for operas like ''[[Halka]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Manor]]''.

Polish [[folk music]] was collected in the 19th century by [[Oskar Kolberg]], as part of a wave of Polish [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]].&lt;ref&gt;Broughton 2000, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the world wars and then the [[Communist state]], folk traditions were oppressed or subsumed into state-approved folk ensembles.&lt;ref name="Ibidem, p. 219"&gt;''Ibidem'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of the state ensembles are [[Mazowsze (folk group)|Mazowsze]] and [[Śląsk Song and Dance Ensemble|Śląsk]], both of which still perform. Though these bands had a regional touch to their output, the overall sound was a homogenized mixture of Polish styles.  There were more authentic state-supported groups, such as [[Slowianki|Słowianki]], but the Communist sanitized image of folk music made the whole field seem unhip to young audiences, and many traditions dwindled rapidly.

Polish dance music, especially the [[mazurka]] and [[polonaise]], were popularized by Frédéric Chopin, and they soon spread across Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Ibidem, p. 219"/&gt; These are triple time dances, while five-beat forms are more common in the northeast and duple-time dances like the [[krakowiak]] come from the south. The polonaise comes from the French word for ''Polish'' to identify its origin among the Polish aristocracy and nobility, who had adapted the dance from a slower walking dance called ''chodzony''.&lt;ref name="Ibidem, p. 219"/&gt; The polonaise then re-entered the lower-class musical life, and became an integral part of Polish music.

=== Literature ===
{{main article|Polish literature}}
Polish literature is the literary tradition of Poland. Most Polish literature has been written in the Polish language, though other languages, used in Poland over the centuries, have also contributed to Polish literary traditions, including [[Latin]], German, [[Yiddish]], [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], and [[Esperanto]].

==== Middle Ages ====
[[File:Jan Długosz.PNG|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Jan Długosz]]]]
Almost nothing remains of Polish literature prior to the [[Baptism of Poland|country's Christianization]] in 966. Poland's [[pagan]] inhabitants certainly possessed an oral literature extending to Slavic songs, legends and beliefs, but early Christian writers did not deem it worthy of mention in the obligatory Latin, and so it has perished.&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1"&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MkT9vavwIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''The History of Polish Literature.''] Google Books preview. ''[[University of California Press]]'', [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], 1983. {{ISBN|0-520-04477-0}}. {{nowrap|Retrieved 18 October 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded sentence in the [[Polish language]] reads: "''Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai''" ("Let me grind, and you take a rest") – a [[paraphrase]] of the Latin "''Sine, ut ego etiam molam.''" The work, in which this phrase appeared, reflects the culture of early Poland. The sentence was written within the Latin language chronicle ''[[Liber fundationis]]'' from between 1269 and 1273, a history of the [[Cistercian]] monastery in [[Henryków, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Henryków]], [[Silesia]]. It was recorded by an abbot known simply as Piotr (Peter), referring to an event almost a hundred years earlier. The sentence was supposedly uttered by a Bohemian settler, Bogwal ("Bogwalus Boemus"), a subject of [[Bolesław the Tall]], expressing compassion for his own wife who "very often stood grinding by the [[quern-stone]]."&lt;ref name="Mikos"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://staropolska.gimnazjum.com.pl/ang/middleages/Mikos_middle/Literary_m.html | title=MIDDLE AGES LITERARY BACKGROUND | last=Mikoś | first=Michael J. | year=1999 | website=Staropolska.gimnazjum.pl|accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable early [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Polish works in Latin and the [[Old Polish language]] include the oldest extant manuscript of fine prose in the [[Polish language]] entitled the ''[[Holy Cross Sermons]]'', as well as the earliest Polish-language ''Bible of Queen Zofia'' and the ''Chronicle of [[Janko of Czarnków]]'' from the 14th century, not to mention the ''Puławy Psalter''.&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

In the early 1470s, one of the first printing houses in Poland was set up by [[Kasper Straube]] in [[Kraków]] (see: [[Global spread of the printing press#Poland|spread of the printing press]]). In 1475 Kasper Elyan of [[Głogów|Glogau (Głogów)]] set up a printing shop in [[Wrocław|Breslau (Wrocław)]], [[Silesia]]. Twenty years later, the first [[Cyrillic]] printing house was founded at Kraków by [[Schweipolt Fiol]] for [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] hierarchs. The most notable texts produced in that period include ''Saint Florian's Breviary,'' printed partially in Polish in the late 14th century; ''Statua synodalia Wratislaviensia'' (1475): a printed collection of Polish and Latin prayers; as well as [[Jan Długosz]]'s ''Chronicle'' from the 15th century and his ''Catalogus archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium''.&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

==== Renaissance ====
[[File:Jan Kochanowski.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Jan Kochanowski]]]]
With the advent of the [[Renaissance]], the Polish language was finally accepted in Poland on an equal footing with [[Latin]]. Polish art and culture flourished under the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], and many foreign poets and writers settled in Poland, bringing new literary trends with them. These writers included [[Kallimach]] ([[Filippo Buonaccorsi]]) and [[Conrad Celtis]]. [[Mikołaj Rej]] and [[Jan Kochanowski]] laid the foundations for the Polish literary language and modern Polish grammar. The first book written entirely in the [[Polish language]] appeared in this period:  a [[Breviary|prayer-book]] by [[Biernat of Lublin]] (ca. 1465 – after 1529), ''Raj duszny'' (''[[Hortulus Animae]]'', Eden of the Soul), printed in [[Kraków]] in 1513 at one of Poland's first printing establishments, operated by [[Florian Ungler]] (originally from [[Bavaria]]).

Many Polish writers studied abroad and at the [[Kraków Academy]] (now [[Jagiellonian University]]), which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents.  In this period (as she had had earlier, and would also have in the future), Poland had notable philosophers, including [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Sebastian Petrycy]], [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]], [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki]], [[Jan Jonston]] (a Briton), [[Jan Amos Komensky]] (a Czech), and [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] (a Polish king).

Another notable literary figure from this period is [[Piotr Skarga]] (1536–1612), a Polish [[Jesuit]], preacher, [[hagiography|hagiographer]], [[polemicist]], and leading figure of the [[Counter-Reformation]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. His greatest works include ''[[The Lives of the Saints]]'' (''Żywoty świętych'', 1579), which was for several centuries one of the most popular books in the Polish language and the ''[[Sejm Sermons]]'' (''Kazania Sejmowe'', 1597), a political [[treatise]], which became popular in the second half of the 19th century, when Skarga was seen as the "patriotic seer" who predicted the [[partitions of Poland]].

In 1488 the world's first literary society, the ''[[Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana]]'' (the Vistula Literary Society) was founded in Kraków. Notable members included [[Conrad Celtes]], [[Albert Brudzewski]], [[Filip Callimachus]], and [[Laurentius Corvinus]].&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

The study of poetry required practical skill in writing both Latin and Polish poems, and radically increased the numbers of poets and versifiers countrywide.  Some exceptional writers grew up as well in the soil of [[humanism|humanistic]] education:  Piotr Kochanowski (1566–1620) produced a translation of [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]''; [[poet laureate]] [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] became known throughout Europe, for his Latin writings, as ''Horatius christianus'' ("the Christian [[Horace]]"); [[Jan Andrzej Morsztyn]] (1621–1693), epicurean courtier and diplomat, extolled in his sophisticated poems the value of earthly delights; and [[Wacław Potocki]] (1621–96), the most productive writer of the [[Polish Baroque]], united typical Polish ''[[szlachta]]'' (nobility) views with deeper reflections and existential experiences.  

Other notable Polish poets and prose writers of the period included:

==== Enlightenment ====
[[File:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.55|[[Ignacy Krasicki]]]]
The period of [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]] began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century during the reign of [[Polish kings|Poland's last king]], [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]].&lt;ref name="bookinstitute.pl-2"&gt;Jacek Adamczyk, book review: [http://www.bookinstitute.pl/en,ik,site,40,79,2480.php  ''Regina Libertas: Liberty in Polish Eighteenth-Century Political Thought'', by Anna Grześkowiak-Krwawicz.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222224354/http://www.bookinstitute.pl/en,ik,site,40,79,2480.php |date=22 February 2014 }} ''Instytut Książki'', Poland. Retrieved 17 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It went into sharp decline with the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third and final Partition]] of Poland (1795), followed by political, cultural and economic destruction of the country, and leading to the [[Great Emigration]] of Polish elites. The Enlightenment ended around 1822, and was replaced by [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] at home and abroad.&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt; The crowning achievements of [[Polish Enlightenment]] include the adoption of the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], Europe's oldest written constitution as well as the creation of the [[Commission of National Education]], the world's first ministry of education.

One of the leading Polish Enlightenment poets was [[Ignacy Krasicki]] (1735–1801), known as "the Prince of Poets" and Poland's [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], author of ''[[Fables and Parables]]'' as well as the first Polish novel called ''[[The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom]]'' (''Mikołaja Doświadczyńskiego przypadki''); he was also a playwright, journalist, [[encyclopedist]] and [[Translation#History of theory|translator]] from French and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Another prominent writer of the period was [[Jan Potocki]] (1761–1815), a Polish nobleman, [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], [[linguistics|linguist]], and adventurer, whose travel memoirs made him legendary in his homeland. Outside Poland he is known chiefly for his novel, ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]],'' which has drawn comparisons to such celebrated works as the ''[[Decameron]]'' and ''the [[Arabian Nights]]''.

==== Romanticism ====
Due to the three successive [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]] carried out by three adjacent empires—ending the existence of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|sovereign Polish state]] in 1795—[[Polish Romanticism]], unlike [[Romanticism]] elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence from foreign occupation, and expressed the ideals and traditional way of life of the Polish people. The period of Romanticism in Poland ended with the Russian Empire's suppression of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]], culminating in public executions and deportations to Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/russiangovernmen00daywuoft|last=Day|first=William Ansell|title=The Russian government in Poland: with a narrative of the Polish Insurrection of 1863|publisher=London : Longmans, Green, Reader &amp; Dyer|date=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literature of Polish [[Romanticism]] falls into two distinct sub-periods, each ended by an [[insurgency]]: the first, circa 1820–30, ending with the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]]; and the second, 1830–64, giving rise to [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]]. In the first Romantic sub-period, Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics:  their work featured [[emotion]]alism and imagination, [[folklore]], and country life, in addition to the aspiration for independence. The sub-period's most famous writers were [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Seweryn Goszczyński]], [[Tomasz Zan]], and [[Maurycy Mochnacki]].

In the second Romantic sub-period, after the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]], many Polish Romantics worked abroad, driven from Poland by the occupying powers. Their work became dominated by the aspiration to regain their country's lost [[sovereignty]]. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. Also, the concept of [[Three Bards|the Three Bards]] (''trzej wieszcze'') developed. The ''wieszcz'' functioned as spiritual leader to the suppressed people. The most notable poet of the Three Bards, so recognized in both Polish Romantic sub-periods, was [[Adam Mickiewicz]].  The other two national bards were [[Juliusz Słowacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Positivism ====
[[File:Prus 002.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Bolesław Prus]]]]
In the wake of the failed [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] occupation, a new period of thought and literature, [[Positivism in Poland|Polish "Positivism"]], proceeded to advocate level-headedness, skepticism, the exercise of reason, and "organic work".  "Positivist" writers argued for the establishment of [[civil rights|equal rights]] for all members of society; for the [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of Poland's [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish minority]]; and for defense of western Poland's population, in the German-occupied part of Poland, against the German ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' and the [[Prussian deportations|displacement of the Polish populace by German colonization]].  Writers such as [[Bolesław Prus]] sought to educate the public about a constructive patriotism that would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated ''social organism,'' regardless of external circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential Polish novelist active in that period was [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1905. The Positivist period lasted until the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the [[Young Poland]] movement.

==== Young Poland (1890–1918) ====
[[File:Wladyslaw Reymont 1924.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Władysław Reymont]]]]
[[File:Joseph Conrad.PNG|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Joseph Conrad]]]]
The [[modernist]] period known as the [[Young Poland]] movement in visual arts, literature and [[Polish music|music]], came into being around 1890, and concluded with the [[Second Polish Republic|Poland's return to independence]] (1918). The period was based on two concepts. Its early stage was characterized by a strong [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] opposition to the ideals of [[Positivism in Poland|its own predecessor]] (promoting ''organic work'' in the face of foreign occupation). Artists following this early philosophy of Young Poland believed in [[Decadent movement|decadence]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], conflict between human values and civilization, and the existence of [[art for art's sake]]. Prominent authors who followed this trend included [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer]], [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]].

====Restored independence (1918–39)====
Literature of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918–1939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. In large part, derivative of these changes was the collective and unobstructed development of programs for artists and writers. New [[avant-garde]] trends had emerged. The period, spanning just twenty years, was full of notable individualities who saw themselves as exponents of changing European civilization, including [[Julian Tuwim|Tuwim]], [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Witkacy]], [[Witold Gombrowicz|Gombrowicz]], [[Czesław Miłosz|Miłosz]], [[Maria Dąbrowska|Dąbrowska]] and [[Zofia Nałkowska|Nałkowska]] ([[Polish Academy of Literature|PAL]]).

==== After 1945 ====
[[File:Stanisław Lem.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Stanisław Lem]]]]
Much of Polish literature written during the [[occupation of Poland]] appeared in print only after the end of World War II, including books by [[Zofia Nałkowska|Nałkowska]], [[Adolf Rudnicki|Rudnicki]], [[Tadeusz Borowski|Borowski]] and others.&lt;ref name="JB-WE" /&gt; The Soviet takeover of the country did not discourage [[émigré]]s and exiles from returning, especially before the advent of [[Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism]]. Indeed, many writers attempted to recreate the Polish literary scene, often with a touch of nostalgia for the prewar reality, including [[Jerzy Andrzejewski]], author of ''[[Ashes and Diamonds]]'', describing the political and moral dilemmas associated with the [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–1946)|anti-communist resistance in Poland]]. His novel was adapted into film a decade later by [[Andrzej Wajda|Wajda]]. The new emerging prose writers such as [[Stanisław Dygat]] and [[Stefan Kisielewski]] approached the catastrophe of war from their own perspective. [[Kazimierz Wyka]] coined a term "borderline novel" for documentary fiction.&lt;ref name="JB-WE"&gt;Jean Albert Bédé, William Benbow Edgerton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2_JLL32RzrkC&amp;lpg=PA634&amp;dq=%22Jerzy%20Andrzejewski%22&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jerzy%20Andrzejewski%22&amp;f=false  ''Columbia dictionary of modern European literature.''] Page 632. ''[[Columbia University Press]]'', 1980. {{nowrap| {{ISBN|0-231-03717-1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 20th century a number of Polish writers and poets achieved international recognition including [[Stanisław Lem]], [[Czesław Miłosz]] ([[Nobel Prize in Literature]], 1980), [[Zbigniew Herbert]], [[Sławomir Mrożek]], [[Wisława Szymborska]] ([[Nobel Prize in Literature]], 1996), [[Jerzy Kosiński]], [[Adam Zagajewski]], [[Andrzej Sapkowski]], and [[Olga Tokarczuk]].

==Theatre and cinema==
At present, the Polish theatre actor possibly best-known outside the country is [[Andrzej Seweryn]], who in the years 1984–1988 was a member of the international group formed by [[Peter Brook]] to work on the staging of the Mahabharata, and since 1993 has been linked with the Comédie Française. The most revered actor of the second half of the twentieth century in Poland is generally considered to be [[Tadeusz Łomnicki]], who died in 1992 of a heart attack while rehearsing King Lear.

During the second half of the nineties, there appeared in Polish dramatic theatre a new generation of young directors, who have attempted to create productions relevant to the experience and problems of a thirty-something generation brought up surrounded by mass culture, habituated to a fast-moving lifestyle, but at the same time ever more lost in the world of consumer capitalism. There is no strict division in Poland between theatre and film directors and actors, therefore many stage artists are known to theatre goers from films of [[Andrzej Wajda]], for example: Wojciech Pszoniak, [[Daniel Olbrychski]], [[Krystyna Janda]], Jerzy Radziwiłowicz, and from films of [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]]. Notable actors from [[Poland]] include [[Jerzy Stuhr]], [[Janusz Gajos]], [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] and [[Michał Żebrowski]]. Polish actors and actresses that achieved great success overseas, mostly in Hollywood, include [[Bella Darvi]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Ross Martin]], [[Ingrid Pitt]], [[Ned Glass]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Izabella Scorupco]], [[Paul Wesley]] and [[John Bluthal]].

Notable Hollywood American actors and actresses of Polish descent include [[David Arquette]], [[Caroll Baker]] (born Karolina Piekarski), [[Christine Baranski]], [[Kristen Bell]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Mayim Bialik]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Alex Borstein]], [[David Burtka]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Anna Chlumsky]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Estelle Getty]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Harvey Keitel]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Carole Landis]], [[Téa Leoni]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Eli Wallach]], [[Jared Padalecki]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Robert Prosky]], [[Maggie Q]], [[William Shatner]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Leelee Sobieski]], [[Loretta Swit]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls006177676/|title=IMDb: Actors and Actresses of Polish Descent – a list by comicman117|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholics live all over the country, while Orthodox Christians can be found mostly in north-east, in the area of [[Białystok]], and Protestants (mainly Lutherans) in [[Cieszyn Silesia]] and [[Warmia-Masuria]]. A growing Jewish population exists in major cities, especially in [[Warsaw]], [[Kraków]] and [[Wrocław]]. Over two million Jews of Polish origin reside in the United States, Brazil, and Israel. 

According to [[Constitution of the Republic of Poland|Poland's Constitution]] freedom of religion is ensured to everyone. It also allows for national and ethnic minorities to have the right to establish educational and cultural institutions, institutions designed to protect religious identity, as well as to participate in the resolution of matters connected with their cultural identity.

Religious organizations in the Republic of Poland can register their institution with the [[Ministry of Interior and Administration of the Republic of Poland|Ministry of Interior and Administration]] creating a record of churches and other religious organizations who operate under separate Polish laws. This registration is not necessary; however, it is beneficial when it comes to serving the freedom of religious practice laws.

[[Slavic Native Faith]] (''Rodzimowiercy'') groups, registered with the Polish authorities in 1995, are the [[Native Polish Church]] (''Rodzimy Kościół Polski''), which represents a pagan tradition going back to [[Władysław Kołodziej]]'s 1921 Holy Circle of Worshippers of [[Svetovid|Światowid]] (''Święte Koło Czcicieli Światowida''), and the Polish Slavic Church (''Polski Kościół Słowiański'').

== Ethnography ==
{{Main|Dialects of Polish|Polish historical regions|Culture of Poland|Ethnic minorities in Poland}}

=== Central Poles ===
{{Main|Sieradz Land|Łęczyca Land|Wieluń Land|Łódź Voivodeship}}[[Łęczyca]]nie live between Greater Poland and [[Mazovia]], and are an intermediate group, originally closer to Greater Poles but with significant [[Masurians|Mazur]] influences. [[Sieradz]]anie on the other hand, are surrounded by Greater Poland, [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Upper Silesia|Silesia]], and have been under strong influences of all three provinces. They lost much of their original distinctness. The main city in this region is [[Łódź]], but it originated during the [[Industrial Revolution]], being just a small town before that.

=== Greater Poles ===
{{Main|Greater Poland|Pałuki|Polans (western)|Grand Duchy of Posen}}Greater Poles (Wielkopolanie) inhabit more or less the original territory of the tribe of [[Polans (western)|Polans]] (from which the names Poland and Poles are derived), as well as other areas where Wielkopolanie and their dialect expanded throughout history. Greater Poland is where [[Poland in the Early Middle Ages|the Polish statehood emerged during the 9th and 10th centuries]]. With places such as [[Gniezno]], [[Giecz]] and [[Ostrów Lednicki]], it is the oldest province of Poland. [[Poznań]] is its main city. We can distinguish smaller ethnographic subdivisions among Greater Poles, for example the [[Pałuki|Pałuczanie]], Biskupianie (near [[Krobia]]), [[Bambrzy]] and Hanobrzy (descended from Polonized German settlers from the areas of [[Bamberg]] and [[Hanover]]), [[Kalisz]]acy, [[Wieleń]] Mazurs, [[Szamotuły|Szamotulanie]], [[Gostyń|Gostynianie]], and others. Due to past migrations and shifting borders of historical regions, also two Silesian ethnographic groups live in the territory of Wielkopolska – Hazacy, who inhabit the area of [[Rawicz]]; and Chwalimiacy, who live around [[Chwalim]], [[Nowe Kramsko]] and [[Stare Kramsko]]. 

=== Kuyavians ===
{{Main|Kujawy|Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Goplans|Duchy of Inowrocław}}Some linguists and ethnographers counted Cuiavians as a subdivision of Greater Poles, but most recognize their distinct culture and identity. They inhabit the areas from [[Gopło|Lake Gopło]] in the south to [[Noteć]] River in the north-west, and to [[Vistula]] River in the north-east. [[Toruń]], listed on the UNESCO list of [[World Heritage Sites]] since 1997, is located on the border between [[Kuyavia|Kujawy]], [[Chełmno Land]] and [[Dobrzyń Land]]. Other important cities include [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Włocławek]] and [[Inowrocław]].

[[File:Lednica Górna Siuda Baba 2015-04-06 160a.jpg|thumb|right|Men dressed as [[Krakowiacy]] from [[Kraków]] region]]
{{Main|Lesser Poland|Krakowiacy|Gorals|Galicia (Eastern Europe)}}[[Lesser Poland|Małopolanie]] (Southern Poles) can be divided into several major subgroups – [[Krakowiacy]] (in the historical Land of [[Kraków]]), Lasowiacy, [[Sandomierz|Sandomirians]], [[Gorals|Górale]] (Gorals, Polish Highlanders), [[Lachy Sądeckie|Lachy]], Posaniacy, [[Wymysorys language|Vilamovians]], Halcnovians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/11|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage: Hałcnovian|website=Poland's Linguistic Heritage|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lubliniacy]] and inhabitants of [[Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Podkarpacie]] ([[Subcarpathia]]), such as Dolinianie, [[Rzeszów|Rzeszowiacy]], [[Polish Uplanders]] or [[Walddeutsche|Deaf Germans]]. Krakowiacy live to the north of Gorals, to the east of Silesians, to the west of Sandomirians, in the north they extend as far as [[Częstochowa]] and [[Kielce]]. This group can be further subdivided into smaller ethnographic regions. 

Among Lesser Poles, especially strongly differentiated are the Gorals, who can be further divided into [[Beskids|Beskid]] Gorals, Podhalanie, Kliszczacy, [[Spiš|Spiszacy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/15|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage: Spiš dialects|website=Poland's Linguistic Heritage|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orava (region)|Oravians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/18|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage: Oravian dialect|website=Poland's Linguistic Heritage|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several smaller groups. In the east, Lesser Polish Gorals have [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian-speaking]] Gorals ([[Boykos]], [[Lemkos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/23|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage: Lemko Rusyn|website=Poland's Linguistic Heritage|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hutsuls]]) and [[Rusyns]] as their neighbours. There is overlap with [[Slovak language|Slovak-speaking]] Gorals in the south. Sandomirians extend in the north as far as [[Skaryszew]] and [[Iłża]], in the west beyond [[Chęciny]]. Lubliniacy live to the east of Sandomirians, around [[Lublin]], [[Chełm]], [[Zamość]], [[Tomaszów Lubelski]], [[Janów Lubelski]] and [[Biłgoraj]].

=== Masovians ===
[[File:Kurps in Warsaw-17-Kapela-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kurpie]] from [[Masovia]]]]
{{Main|Mazovia|Masurians|Kurpie|Warmiak}}Mazurs (Masovians) consist of [[Masovians|proper Mazurs]], known also as Central Mazurs, who live from the area between [[Sierpc]] and [[Płock]], up to the lower [[Wieprz]] River. Between Central Mazurs and [[Podlachia|Podlasie]] is the homeland of Eastern Mazurs, and in southern parts of [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Warmia-Masuria]] – the homeland of [[Masurians|Lutheran, Prussian Mazurs]], descended from Central Mazurs who settled there in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, and assimilated remnants of [[Old Prussians|Baltic-speaking Old Prussian population]]. Another Medieval expansion of Mazurs, to the east, into former [[Yotvingians|Yotvingian]] (ethnically [[Baltic languages|West Baltic]]) territories, led to the emergence of [[Suwałki Region|Sudovian Poles]] and of [[Podlachian language|Podlasie Mazurs]] (in the areas around [[Węgrów]], [[Siedlce]], [[Puławy]], [[Łuków]], [[Sokołów Podlaski]], [[Włodawa]], as far as [[Biebrza]] River). Another group descended from a mix of Poles (mostly Mazurs) and West Balts are the [[Kurpie]], who live primarily in [[Puszcza Zielona]] and [[Puszcza Biała]] (the Green Forest and the White Forest). Yet another subdivision of Mazurs, which developed a very rich folk culture thanks to having special privileges and prosperity, are Łowiczanie (around [[Łowicz]]). Another group are Poborzanie in the areas of [[Mława]] and [[Zawkrze]]. 

The capital of Poland, [[Warsaw]], is located in the land of Central Mazurs. However, as any large city it has always been a melting pot of people from all regions of Poland and foreigners from abroad. It is home to the largest [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish]] community in Poland, as well as the cultural centre of [[Polish Karaims]]. Citizens of Warsaw are called Varsovians. In the Early Middle Ages, Płock was the main city in Mazovia. Along the eastern border of Poland, between [[Podlachia|Podlasie]] and [[Lublin Voivodeship|Lubelszczyzna]], we can find some people who identify as [[Poleshuks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/21|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage: Podlachian and West Polesian|website=Poland's Linguistic Heritage|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Suwałki Region|Suwalszczyzna]] and [[Podlaskie Voivodeship|Podlasie]], we can find dispersed communities of [[Lipka Tatars|Polish Tatars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/12|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage: Tatar|website=Poland's Linguistic Heritage|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Old Believers|Starovers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/22|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage: Russian of Starovers|website=Poland's Linguistic Heritage|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as settlements of [[Lithuanian minority in Poland|Lithuanian]] and [[Belarusian minority in Poland|Belarusian]] minorities.

=== Northern Poles ===
{{Main|Chełmno Land|Dobrzyń Land|Krajna|Royal Prussia}}Groups intermediate between Greater Poles and [[Masovians|Mazurs]] (but closer to Greater Poles), are Chełmniacy and Dobrzyniacy (who live in the lands of [[Chełmno]] and [[Dobrzyń nad Wisłą|Dobrzyń]]), as well as Lubawiacy (in the land of [[Lubawa]]). Another intermediate group, but closer to Mazurs, are Catholic [[Warmiak]]s in the East Prussian region of [[Warmia]]. From the Early Middle Ages onwards, Pomerania was under strong Polish (especially Greater Polish and Cuiavian) influences. From the mixture of Kashubians and Greater Poles, emerged an ethnographic group called Borowiacy Tucholscy, who live in the [[Tuchola Forest]] region, between [[Tuchola]], [[Koronowo]], [[Świecie]] and [[Starogard Gdański|Starogard]]. Borowiacy are intermediary, whereas another mixed group – Krajniacy – have a mostly Greater Polish character, with relatively minor Kashubian influences. They live in the region of [[Krajna]]. Two other ethnographic group in Northern Poland are Powiślanie (whose homelands are the areas around [[Sztum]], [[Kwidzyn|Kwidzyń]] and [[Malbork]]) and [[:File:Koschneiderei 1926.gif|Kosznajdrzy]].

[[Żuławy Wiślane]] in North Poland used to be the homeland of [[Vistula delta Mennonites|Mennonites]], who are considered to be either Dutch, German, or a group on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/16|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage. Mennonites and Plautdietsch.|website=inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pomeranians ===

{{Main|Pomerelia|Kashubians|Kociewie|Lauenburg and Bütow Land}}
[[File:Kashubians 2005.png|left|thumb|Population of Kashubians in [[Kashubia]] and in the [[Tricity, Poland|Tri-City]], 2005]]
Early Medieval [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]] used to inhabit the entire land located to the north of [[Polans (western)|Polans]], between [[Noteć]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. In the west, Pomeranians extended perhaps up to [[Usedom]]. In the east, they extended as far as the [[Vistula Lagoon]], and their eastern neighbours were [[Old Prussians|Baltic-speaking Prussians]]. [[Krynica Morska]] was the easternmost Slavic-speaking village on the Baltic coast, but the area of [[Truso]] (today [[Elbląg]]) to the south was ethnically Old Prussian. Most of Pomeranians became [[Germanisation|Germanized]] throughout history. Only Eastern Pomeranians preserved their Slavic ethnicity, and are commonly known as [[Kashubians]] today. Kashubians who were [[Royal Prussia|under Polish rule during the 16th–18th centuries]] remained [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], while those who lived in [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] in the 1700s, became [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] following the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]]. 

Kashubians can be divided into many subdivisions, such as the [[Slovincian language|Slovincians]]. From the Early Middle Ages onwards, Pomerania was under strong Polish (especially Greater Polish and Cuiavian) influences, which led to the emergence of several intermediary ethnographic groups. Descended mainly from Greater Polish and Cuiavian settlers who mixed with Kashubians, are Kociewiacy in the region of [[Kociewie]], located between [[Starogard Gdański|Starogard Pomorski]], [[Tczew]], [[Gniew]], [[Świecie]] and up to the outskirts of [[Gdańsk]] in the north. The main city in Eastern Pomerania has always been [[History of Gdańsk|Gdańsk]], located on the border between three regions: Kashubia to the west, Kociewie to the south, [[East Prussia|Prussia]] to the east.

=== Silesians ===

 ([[Żywiec Beskids|Żywiec]]) in [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesia]]]]
{{Main|Silesians|History of Silesia|Silesia|Cieszyn Silesia}}In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Silesia was inhabited by several [[Lechites|Lechitic]] tribes, known from [[Primary source|written sources]] under their [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] names. The most significant tribe (which ultimately gave its name to the region) were the [[Silesians (tribe)|Sleenzane (Slenzans; Ślężanie)]] who lived in areas near modern [[Wrocław]] and along the [[Ślęza]] river, as well as near [[Ślęża|mount Ślęża]].&lt;ref name="Krzywicki1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Społeczeństwo pierwotne, jego rozmiary i wzrost (Primitive society and its vital statistics)|last1=Krzywicki|first1=Ludwik|publisher=Wydawnictwo PTPN|year=2004|isbn=978-83-7063-417-9|pages=132–134|chapter=Chapter: Rozmiary liczebne plemienia (Size of the tribe)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krzywicki2"&gt;{{cite document|title=Primitive society and its vital statistics /|first=Ludwik|last=Krzywicki|date=21 March 2018|publisher=London :|hdl = 2027/uc1.b4381154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Opolans|Opolini (Opolans; Opolanie)]] lived in lands near modern [[Opole]].&lt;ref name="Krzywicki1" /&gt; The Dadodesani or Dedosize (Dyadosans; Dziadoszanie) lived in areas near modern [[Głogów]].&lt;ref name="Krzywicki1" /&gt; The [[Golensizi]] (Golensizians; Golęszyce) dwelled near modern [[Racibórz]], [[Cieszyn]] and [[Opawa]]. The Lupiglaa (Głubczyce) probably lived on the Głubczyce Plateau, near [[Głubczyce]]. The Trebouane (Tryebovians; Trzebowianie), mentioned by the ''Prague Document'' (which describes the situation as of year 973 or earlier),&lt;ref name="On the Prague Document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jassa.org/?p=4101|title=On the Prague Document – In Nomine Jassa|website=''jassa.org''|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; occupied areas near modern [[Legnica]].&lt;ref name="Krzywicki1" /&gt; The Poborane (Bobrans; Bobrzanie) – mentioned by the same document – lived along the lower and middle course of the [[Bóbr]] river. The Psyovians (Psouane; Pszowianie) lived near [[Pszów]], to the east of the Opolans and to the west of [[Kraków]]. Along the borderland between Lower Silesia and [[Lusatia]], lived tribes related to modern [[Sorbs]]. 

At the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries ({{circa|AD 1000|lk=no}}), the total population of Silesia is estimated as around 250,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Krajobraz, osadnictwo, stosunki etniczne i językowe (pp. 145–161); in: Historia Śląska|last1=Maleczyński|first1=Karol|publisher=Ossolineum|year=1960|volume=Vol. I. do roku 1763|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001016/01/17.pdf|title=The Dynamics of the Policies of Ethnic Cleansing in Silesia in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|last1=Kamusella|first1=Tomasz|publisher=Open Society Institute|year=1999|page=109|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224234905/http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001016/01/17.pdf|archivedate=24 February 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2nd half of the 12th century (c. AD 1150–1200) the population increased to 330,000, still in vast majority [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speakers]]. Following the [[Ostsiedlung|German Ostsiedlung]] (c. AD 1350–1400), the population of Lower Silesia was around 2/3 [[Slavs|Slavic]] and 1/3 German (according to estimates by Kokot, Karol Maleczynski and [[Tomasz Kamusella]]) while Upper Silesia remained 80% ethnically Polish, with the remaining 20% split mainly between Germans and Czechs. During the following centuries cultural [[Germanisation|Germanization]] gradually shifted the ethnic structure of Silesia, so that by the 20th century nearly all of Lower Silesia had a German-speaking majority. But Upper Silesia remained majority [[Silesian Polish|Polish-speaking]]. There have also been [[Moravians|Moravian]] and [[Czechs|Czech]] communities. 

[[Silesian Polish|Polish Silesians]] can be divided into many smaller groups, such as [[Cieszyn Vlachs]], [[Lach dialects|Lachians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/14|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage: Lachian|website=Poland's Linguistic Heritage|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silesian Gorals]], [[Opolans]] and others.

They speak the [[Texas Silesian]] dialect of Polish.

=== Eastern Kresy ===
{{Main|Poles in Lithuania|Poles in Belarus|Poles in Ukraine|Poles in Latvia}}Poles from the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|former eastern territories of Poland]] and other areas of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. From the 14th century onwards, the expansion of Polish (mostly Mazur from Masovia, but also Greater Polish and other) settlers towards the north-east, as well as [[Polonization]] of local inhabitants, led to the emergence of [[Republic of Central Lithuania|Wilniuki]] (North-East Kresowiacy) in the [[Grodno Region]] and [[Vilnius|Vilno]] Region ([[Vilnius Region|Wileńszczyzna]]), which encompasses the borderlands of northern [[Belarus]], southern [[Lithuania]] and southern [[Latvia]] (former [[Inflanty Voivodeship]], including [[Daugavpils|Dyneburg]] and [[Ilūkste]]). At the same time, the expansion of Polish settlers (mostly Lesser Poles and Mazurs) towards the south-east, as well as Polonization of local inhabitants, led to the emergence of South-East Kresowiacy in [[Bolesław-Jerzy II|Halychna]], Red Ruthenia (with its main city – [[Lviv|Lvov]]), [[Volhynia]] and [[Podolia]].

Prior to [[World War II]], a third of Poland's population was composed of [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]]. Following the war, however, Poland's minorities were mostly gone, due to the 1945 [[revision of borders of Poland (1945)|revision of borders]], and the [[Holocaust]]. Most notably, the population of [[Jew]]s in Poland, which formed the largest Jewish community in pre-war Europe at about 3 million people, was almost completely annihilated by 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=82ncGA4GuN4C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;vq=Pilsudski&amp;dq=Pilsudski,+re-establishment|title=Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland, 1919–1939|first=Joseph|last=Marcus|date=21 March 1983|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|accessdate=21 March 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9789027932396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint '''Porphyrios (Bairaktaris) the Kapsokalyvite''' (7 February 1906 – 2 December 1991) was an [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] [[hieromonk]] known for his gifts of [[spiritual discernment]], a type of [[clairvoyance]] which he sometimes called "spiritual television."

He was born February 7 in the little village of St. John Karystia, in the province of [[Euboea|Evia]]. His parents, Leonidas and Eleni Bairaktaris (daughter of Antonios Lambrou), baptized him Evangelos. He was fourth out of five siblings.

He was tonsured a monk at the age of fourteen or fifteen with the monastic name Nikitas. He served in the Athonite [[skete]] of Kafsokalyvia, in the Cell of St. George, under two spiritual fathers: Fr. Panteimon and Fr. Ionnakios. Forced by [[pleurisy]] to depart the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]], he returned to his birthplace, where he was unexpectedly elevated to the priesthood at the age of 21 by Porphyrios III, [[Archbishop of Mount Sinai and Raithu]].

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] he became a hospital [[chaplain]] in [[Athens]], in which post he continued for three decades (1940–1970). His later years were devoted to the construction of the Holy Convent of the Transfiguration of the Savior.

After 1984 he returned to Mount Athos, occupying the same cell which he had earlier in life been forced to abandon. Through his role as spiritual father, Elder Porphyrios became known to an ever-wider circle of Orthodox followers. Several compilations of stories and sayings attributed to him have been published.

His sainthood was declared by the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate on November 27, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.patriarchate.org/news/releases/announcement-holy-and-sacred-synod Announcement by the Holy and Sacred Synod] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201013324/http://www.patriarchate.org/news/releases/announcement-holy-and-sacred-synod |date=2013-12-01 }}.''

* Somebody who is Christ's must love Christ, and when he loves Christ he is delivered from the Devil, from hell and from death.
* The life of the parents is the only thing that makes good children. Parents should be very patient and ‘saintlike’ to their children. They should truly love their children. And the children will share this love! For the bad attitude of the children, says father Porphyrios, the ones who are usually responsible for it are their parents themselves. The parents don’t help their children by lecturing them and repeating to them ‘advices’, or by making them obeying strict rules in order to impose discipline. If the parents do not become ‘saints’ and truly love their children and if they don’t struggle for it, then they make a huge mistake. With their wrong and/or negative attitude the parents convey to their children their negative feelings. Then their children become reactive and insecure not only to their home, but to the society as well.

[[File:Major Robert Pike, 1616-1706.jpg|thumb|Memorial for Pike (1616&amp;ndash;1706) in the [[Old Colonial Burying Grounds]] in [[Salisbury, Massachusetts]].]]
'''Robert Pike''' (1616{{mdash}}1706) was an opponent of the [[Salem witch trials|Salem witchcraft prosecutions of 1692]].  He was also involved in two other notable, public controversies prior to 1692.  The first was his open criticism of the persecution of the [[Quakers]], for which he was arraigned by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1653.  Years later, he became embroiled in a long feud with the pastor of [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]], the Reverend [[John Wheelwright]], who excommunicated him in 1675 and was later obliged to reinstate him.

==Early life and education==
Robert Pike was probably born in [[Landford]], Wiltshire, England about 1616. He came to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1635 with his father, John Pike (1572&amp;ndash;1654) and four siblings.  His mother Dorothy Day had died several years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early New England Families Study Project, v1|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/databases/early-families-of-new-england/image/?pageName=1&amp;volumeId=20025|website=americanancestors.org|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They first settled in [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]].  Within a few years Robert Pike moved to the east side of the [[Merrimack River]] and became one of the founders and first land owners of [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]] (originally called Colchester), where he remained the rest of his life.

Pike married Sarah Sanders, of Salisbury, on 3 April 1641.  They raised eight children before her death in 1679.  While nothing is known about his formal education in England, it is clear that he was well-educated, for he wrote with a flowing hand and could formulate well-reasoned arguments in his own defence and the defence of others.  His brother, [[John Pike (settler)|John Pike]] (1613&amp;ndash;1689), also appears to have been well-educated prior to their arrival in 1635.

==Civic life==
As one of the leading men of the new settlement that became Salisbury, Pike took on numerous civic and military duties and held several offices.  In 1641, his first appointment was as a [[Fence Viewer]], which involved the settling of disputes about property boundaries, "livestock proof" fences, and resolving disputes about fence repairs.  In May 1644, he was appointed by the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]], along with two others, with the power "to end small causes in Salisbury".  In modern terms, this is roughly equivalent to a [[justice of the peace]].  By 1646, Pike was the leader of the local [[militia]] and known as Lieutenant Pike, then Major Pike.  Thomas Bradbury, husband of [[Mary Bradbury]], was second in command, as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].  In 1648, Salisbury elected Pike to the post of Deputy to the General Court, based in [[Boston]].  He was re-elected 10 times and later served one term as magistrate. At the time of King Philip's War (1675–78) Pike served as Sergeant-Major, and was responsible for much of the area North of Boston (Maine was then a part of Massachusetts). Captain Benjamin Church reported to Sergeant-Major Pike.

==In defence of Quakers==
Small numbers of Quakers started arriving in [[New England]] by 1656.  The [[Puritan]]-dominated General Court immediately enacted laws to discourage their activities.  The new laws provided for harsh punishment to anyone who professed the "heretical opinions" of Quakers.  They even punished ship captains who knowingly carried Quakers as passengers.  However, these new measures brought heated debate within the General Court, as their passage was far from unanimous.  The Deputies of the General Court, including Robert Pike, who represented the outlying areas, were much more likely to be sensitive to the issue of [[religious freedom]] and probably voted against the new laws.  Nonetheless, numerous Quaker [[missionary|missionaries]] were punished by public [[Flagellation|whippings]], banishment, and the threat of death if they returned to Massachusetts Bay Colony.  Between 1659 and 1661, five Quakers, all of whom had returned to Boston to continue preaching publicly, were [[hanged]].

In the winter of 1662, three Quaker women arrived in [[Dover, New Hampshire]], to preach and soon after were arrested and ordered whipped.  [[Richard Waldron]], the [[magistrate]] at Dover, even went to the extreme of issuing a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] declaring that the [[constable]]s of 11 surrounding towns, including Salisbury, were to carry out public whippings of the three women.  After they were transported in a cart to Salisbury, the third town of the 11, they were set free by the local authorities, which included Thomas Bradbury, [[Walter Barefoote]], and Pike.  While historians are uncertain as to some of the details, it is believed that Pike was the local constable and he deputised an eager Barefoote, who then "misused" his authority to free the women.  In any case, over 200 years later, the Quaker poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] immortalised this cruel episode in his poem, "How the Women Went from Dover".  One of the verses is engraved upon a stone memorial to Robert Pike in Salisbury Common.

&lt;center&gt;
"Cut loose these poor ones and let them go;

Come what will of it, all men shall know

No warrant is good, though backed by the Crown,

For whipping women in Salisbury town!"
&lt;/center&gt;

==Role in Salem witchcraft crisis==
By 1692, Robert Pike had risen to the office of Assistant to the General Court.  In that role, he was directed to take depositions of both the accused and the accuser, for the immediate region around Salisbury, during the witchcraft crisis of 1692.  In May, he took notes regarding the stories and accusations against [[Susannah Martin]] of neighbouring [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]].  More depositions against her followed in June.  She was tried and convicted in Boston in late June, then executed by hanging on 19 July, along with [[Sarah Good]], [[Rebecca Nurse]], [[Elizabeth Howe]] and [[Sarah Wildes]].

On 26 May 1692, [[George Herrick]] brought charges, on behalf of [[Ann Putnam]] and [[Mary Walcott]], against [[Mary Bradbury]] of Salisbury.  The wife of Thomas Bradbury, she was well known and respected by Robert Pike and many others.  She was convicted in her final trial of 9 September, despite several witnesses supporting her and a petition on her behalf signed by 115 townspeople.  Pike prepared her sworn statement on her behalf, defending her character and good works.

Prior to Mary Bradbury's conviction, Pike wrote a remarkable letter to [[Jonathan Corwin]], one of the trial judges, in which he composed a tightly reasoned attack upon the use of [[spectral evidence]] and the testimony of the "afflicted girls" in general.  While Pike, like all Puritans, believed witches and witchcraft existed and were the work of [[Satan]], he was questioning the current methods of the court in determining credibility and guilt.  In his letter of 9 August, Pike makes several points:
:* Citing [[1 Samuel|1st Samuel]] xxviii 13, 14: Any person, virtuous or not, may be in truth a witch.
:* A poor reputation does not suggest or substantiate guilt (as with [[Sarah Good]]).
:* Satan is capable of presenting ''anyone's'' spectre to a tormented person (not only a witch's spectre).
:* How can it be known if Satan acts with or without the permission of any specific (accused) person.
:* It is completely contrary to a witch's well-being for them to practice witchcraft within a courtroom.
:* It is likewise contrary for witches to accuse others of witchcraft (as was the case), as "they are all part of Satan's kingdom, which would fall, if divided against itself".

It is not known just how Pike's letter was received, since there is no written response, but with it he became one of the first of several prominent men to question the handling of the witchcraft crisis.  Within a few weeks, [[Thomas Brattle]] and [[Samuel Willard]] of Boston wrote their own manuscripts, using some of the same arguments Pike had documented.  By October 1692, the activity of the courts was greatly diminished, the executions had ended, and the witchcraft crisis was effectively over.

'''Robison Wells''' (born April 1978) is an American [[novelist]].

==Personal life==
Robison Wells, the brother of author [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]], was a reluctant reader as a child. He did not become interested in writing until he was in college.  He graduated from the [[University of Utah]] in 2003 with a degree in [[political science]], emphasizing in [[international relations]], with a minor in [[history]], and earned an [[MBA]] in [[marketing]] at [[Brigham Young University]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="PW Interview"&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/49908-fall-2011-flying-starts-robison-wells.html Fall 2011 Flying Starts: Robison Wells] Publishers Weekly&lt;/ref&gt; Wells lives in [[North Ogden, Utah|North Ogden]], [[Utah]], with his wife and three children. He previously lived in [[New Mexico]], which has been the setting for four of his novels.  Wells is a practicing member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment/53116930-81/adult-book-brother-brothers.html.csp?page=1 "Brothers By The Book", Salt Lake Tribune] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021204558/http://m.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment/53116930-81/adult-book-brother-brothers.html.csp?page=1 |date=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Robison Wells first began writing as part of a writing group with [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]] and [[Brandon Sanderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/62746-ya-anthology-to-benefit-author-robison-wells.html|publisher=Publisher's Weekly|title=YA Anthology to Benefit Author Robison Wells|author=Lodge, Sally|date=June 5, 2014|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells's first three books were written for the [[LDS fiction]] market. The first, ''On Second Thought'' is a romantic comedy set in New Mexico, and the second two, ''Wake Me When It's Over'' and ''The Counterfeit'' are political thrillers.

In April 2010 it was announced that Wells had signed a 3-book [[young adult fiction|young adult]] deal with [[HarperCollins|HarperTeen]]. The first novel ''[[Variant (novel)|Variant]]'' is a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] [[science fiction]] novel set in a [[boarding school]] in New Mexico. It has one sequel, ''Feedback''; it is not a trilogy.&lt;ref name="PW Interview"/&gt;

Wells's third book with HarperTeen, ''Blackout'' was announced in Publisher's Marketplace as being the first of a series, including two novels and a [[novella]], and was released in Fall 2013. The sequel, "Dead Zone" was released a year later. Wells's latest book with HarperTeen is titled ''Dark Energy''.

Wells also indie-published a novel, ''Airships of Camelot''. It was the product of a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign. It is described as "alternate-history, steampunk, old West, King Arthur."

==Critical reception==
''Variant'' was released to much critical acclaim, receiving starred reviews from ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and [[Voice of Youth Advocates|VOYA]]. It also received favorable reviews from Booklist and Kirkus. ''Publishers Weekly'' also named ''Variant'' as one of their Best Books of 2011, and featured Wells as one of their "Flying Starts".&lt;ref name="PW Interview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/best-books/2011/childrens-fiction#book/book-21 Publisher Weekly's Best Books of 2011] Publishers Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;

''Feedback'' has received mixed reviews. Kirkus referred to it as "An absorbing read that won't let fans of the first down",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robison-wells/feedback/#review "Kirkus Review of Feedback"] Kirkus Reviews&lt;/ref&gt; while Booklist said "the claustrophobic tightness of the first book is replaced here by a loose series of threats that never solidify into something worth rooting against."

==The Whitney Awards==
In the spring of 2007, Robison Wells began work on the [[Whitney Awards]], an awards program for [[LDS fiction]].  He has stated that this idea came from a conversation with friend and fellow author Brandon Sanderson.  The Whitney Awards are sponsored by LDStorymakers, an author's guild for LDS writers.  Robison Wells served as president of the Whitney Awards Committee for three years, ending in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridianmagazine.com/arts/080328whitney.html "First Annual Whitney Awards Highlights Books, Authors", Meridian Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202052745/http://meridianmagazine.com/arts/080328whitney.html |date=2010-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Robison received the Outstanding Achievement Award from the Whitney Academy.

==Mental Health==
Wells has a handful of mental illnesses, and is an outspoken advocate for those with [[mental illness]]. In 2014, Wells, joined by [[Brandon Sanderson]] and [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]], edited, ''Altered Perceptions'', an anthology of essays from popular YA writers about their struggles with mental illness. He also contributed to the mental illness anthology ''Life Inside My Mind'', with an essay called "Twenty Pills." He writes and speaks extensively about these topics.&lt;ref name="How Mental Illness Tried and Failed to Ruin my Life"&gt;[http://www.teenlibrariantoolbox.com/2012/08/how-mental-illness-tried-and-failed-to.html "How Mental Illness Tried and Failed to Ruin My Life"] Teen Librarian's Toolbox&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mormon Author Talks About His Mental Illness and Faith"&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765622942/Mormon-author-talks-about-his-mental-illness-and-faith.html "Mormon Author Talks About His Mental Illness and Faith"] Deseret News&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15069">'''Seven fires prophecy''' is an [[Anishinaabe]] prophecy that marks phases, or epochs, in the life of the people on [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]], a Native American name for the [[North America]]n continent. The seven fires of the prophecy represent key spiritual teachings for North America, and suggest that the different colors and traditions of the human beings can come together on a basis of respect. It predates the arrival of the Europeans, and contains information for the future lives of the Anishinaabe which are still in the process of being fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Nicole. ''Journey from the Heart: Sharing the Anishnaabe (Ojibway) Culture With the Public School System.'' April 2000, Queen's University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Originally, the prophecy and the [[Ojibwa]] migration story were closely linked.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} However, the last half the prophecy appears to apply to all peoples in contact with the [[Anishinaabeg]]. Consequently, with the growth of the [[Pan-Indian Movement]] in the 1960s and the 1970s, concepts of the Seven fires prophecy merged with other similar prophetical teaching found among [[Indigenous peoples of North America]] forming a unified environmental, political, and socio-economic voice towards [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The Seven fires prophecy was originally taught among the practitioners of [[Midewiwin]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[William Commanda]], an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] elder and former chief of the [[Kitigan Zibi, Quebec|Kitigàn-zìbì Anishinàbeg First Nation]], was the  [[wampum]] belt keeper for the seven fires prophecy.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Legend of the Rainbow Warriors|author=McFadden, S.|date=2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781469785851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGqmyBnzphYC|page=85|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on August 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Toensing, Gale Courey.

== Seven fires ==

Originally, the prophecies were given by eight prophets in seven different time periods. According to oral tradition, the Mi'kmaq Nation heard the first Prophet.&lt;ref name="ikanawtiket"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikanawtiket.ca/pdf/Winter-Spring10-11.pdf|date=5 May 2011|title=MAWQATMUTI’KW (We all live together)|publisher=IKANAWTIKET Environmental Incorporated|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining seven prophets appeared before and were recorded by the [[Anishinaabe]]g. A prophecy of each of these seven periods were then called a "fire". The teachings of the Seven fires prophecy also state that when the world has been befouled and the waters turned bitter by disrespect, human beings will have two options to choose from, [[materialism]] or [[spirituality]]. If they chose spirituality, they will survive, but if they chose materialism, it will be the end of it.

=== First ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
{{cquote|''In the time of the First Fire, the Anishinabe nation will rise up and follow the sacred shell of the Midewiwin Lodge. The Midewiwin Lodge will serve as a rallying point for the people and its traditional ways will be the source of much strength. The Sacred Megis will lead the way to the chosen ground of the Anishinabe. You are to look for a turtle shaped island that is linked to the purification of the earth. You will find such an island at the beginning and end of your journey. There will be seven stopping places along the way. You will know the chosen ground has been reached when you come to a land where food grows on water. If you do not move you will be destroyed.&lt;ref name="EBB"&gt;Benton-Banai&lt;/ref&gt;''|17px|17px}}

In heeding this prophecy, the [[Anishinaabe]] peoples, after receiving guarantees of the safety of their "Fathers" (the [[Abenaki people]]s) and their "allied brothers" ([[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]) of having the Anishinaabeg move inland, away from the Atlantic coast, mass migration of the Anishinaabeg took place, proceeding to the "First Stopping Place" known as ''Mooniyaang'', known today as [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. There, the Nation found a "turtle-shaped island" marked by ''miigis'' ([[cowrie]]) shells.

The Nation grew to a large number and spread up both [[Ottawa River]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]]. The second of the "turtle-shaped island" marked by ''miigis'' shells was at [[Niagara Falls]].

=== Second ===
{{cquote|''You will know the Second Fire because at this time the nation will be camped by a large body of water. In this time the direction of the Sacred Shell will be lost. The Midewiwin will diminish in strength. A boy will be born to point the way back to the traditional ways. He will show the direction to the stepping stones to the future of the Anishinabe people.&lt;ref name="EBB"/&gt;''|17px|17px}}

The oral traditions of the members of [[Council of Three Fires]] say that the realization of the Second fire came about the "Third Stopping Place" located somewhere near what now is [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The Anishinaabeg had divided between those who went up [[Ottawa River]] and those that went up the [[St. Lawrence River]]. After leaving the area about Niagara Falls, this group proceeded to the "Round Lake" ([[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]]) and found the third "turtle-shaped island" marked by ''miigis'' shells. They continued westward until arriving along the southern shores of [[Lake Michigan]] but by this time, the evidence of the ''miigis'' shells were lost, and the southern Anishinaabeg became "lost" both physically in their journey as well as spiritually in their journey. The southern group of Anishinaabeg disintegrated into what today are the [[Ojibwa]], [[Odawa people|Odawa]] and the [[Potawatomi]]. The northern group along the Ottawa River divided into [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], [[Nipissing First Nation|Nipissing]] and the [[Mississaugas]], but they maintained cohesion that was not maintained by the southern group.

Eventually, a [[Potawatomi]] boy had a dream and pointed the southern group back towards and past the "Round Lake". The southern group rejoined not as a single Anishinaabe peoplehood but rather as a unified alliance called [[Council of Three Fires]]. Travelling east and north, and then west, the Council crossed a series of small islands known as "the stepping stones" until they arrived onto [[Manitoulin island]], described as the "Fourth Stopping Place" of the "turtle-shaped island" marked by ''miigis'' shell. There on the island, the Council met up with the [[Mississaugas]], who then spiritually fully re-aligned the formerly lost southern group with the northern group who were never lost. The [[Odawa people|Odawa]] facilitated the "healing" and the island became synonymous as the "Odawa's Island" in the Anishinaabe language.

=== Third ===
{{cquote|''In the Third Fire the Anishinabe will find the path to their chosen ground, a land in the west to which they must move their families. This will be the land where food grows upon the waters.&lt;ref name="EBB"/&gt;''|17px|17px}}

From the cultural center on Manitoulin Island, the [[Ojibwe]] moved to the area about [[Sault Ste. Marie (disambiguation)|Sault Ste. Marie]], where there was the next "turtle-shaped island" marked by ''miigis'' shell. ''Baawating'' or "The Rapids" of the [[St. Marys River (Michigan–Ontario)|Saint Marys River]] became the "Fifth Stopping Place" of the Ojibwe. From this spot, the Ojibwe and the rapids became synonymous with each other, with the Ojibwe known by the Dakota peoples as ''Iyo-ḣaḣatoŋwaŋ'' ("cascading-waterfalls people") and later by the French as ''Saulteurs'' ("cascaders") and [[Saulteaux]] ("cascades"). From here, the Ojibwe moved west, dividing into two groups, each travelling along the shores of [[Lake Superior]], searching for the "land where food grows upon the waters".

=== Fourth ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The Fourth fire prophecy was delivered by a pair of prophets. The first prophets said,

{{cquote|''You will know the future of our people by the face the light skinned race wears. If they come wearing the face of brotherhood then there will come a time of wonderful change for generations to come. They will bring new knowledge and articles that can be joined with the knowledge of this country. In this way, two nations will join to make a mighty nation. This new nation will be joined by two more so that four will form the mightiest nation of all. You will know the face of the brotherhood if the light skinned race comes carrying no weapons, if they come bearing only their knowledge and a hand shake.&lt;ref name="EBB"/&gt;''|17px|17px}}

The other prophet said,

{{cquote|''Beware if the light skinned race comes wearing the face of death. You must be careful because the face of brotherhood and the face of death look very much alike. If they come carrying a weapon ... beware. If they come in suffering ... They could fool you. Their hearts may be filled with greed for the riches of this land. If they are indeed your brothers, let them prove it. Do not accept them in total trust. You shall know that the face they wear is one of death if the rivers run with poison and fish become unfit to eat. You shall know them by these many things.&lt;ref name="EBB"/&gt;''|17px|17px}}

While at the "Fifth Stopping Place", the light-skinned people in big wooden boats, known as the [[French people|French]] arrived. Consequently, the French were called ''Wemitigoozhii'' ("wooden-boat people"). Though the French Crown was interested in colonialism, as far as the Anishinaabeg were concerned, the French appeared only interested in commerce and trade through [[mercantilism]]. Together with the French, the Anishinaabeg formed trade alliances, which not only extended French colonial powers into the heart of North America, but strengthened the political and military might of the Anishinaabeg.

After the French came the ''Zhaaganaash'' ("Off-shore ones") of [[Great Britain]]. But out of the ''Zhaaganaash'' came the ''Gichi-mookomaan'' ("Big-knives")—the [[Virginia]]ns (i.e. [[United States|Americans]]).

=== Fifth ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
{{cquote|''In the time of the Fifth Fire there will come a time of great struggle that will grip the lives of all native people. At the waning of this Fire there will come among the people one who holds a promise of great joy and salvation. If the people accept this promise of a new way and abandon the old teachings, then the struggle of the Fifth Fire will be with the people for many generations. The promise that comes will prove to be a false promise. All those who accept this promise will cause the near destruction of the people.&lt;ref name="EBB"/&gt;''|17px|17px}}

=== Sixth ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
{{cquote|''In the time of the Sixth Fire it will be evident that the promise of the Fifth Fire came in a false way. Those deceived by this promise will take their children aways from the teachings of the Elders. Grandsons and granddaughters will turn against the Elders. In this way the Elders will lose their reason for living ... they will lose their purpose in life. At this time a new sickness will come among the people. The balance of many people will be disturbed. The cup of life will almost become the cup of grief.&lt;ref name="EBB"/&gt;''|17px|17px}}

=== Seventh ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The Seventh Prophet that came to the people long ago was said to be different from the other prophets. This prophet was described as "young and had a strange light in his eyes" and said:
{{cquote|''In the time of the Seventh Fire New People will emerge. They will retrace their steps to find what was left by the trail. Their steps will take them to the Elders who they will ask to guide them on their journey. But many of the Elders will have fallen asleep. They will awaken to this new time with nothing to offer. Some of the Elders will be silent because no one will ask anything of them. The New People will have to be careful in how they approach the Elders. The task of the New People will not be easy.''

''If the New People will remain strong in their quest the Water Drum of the Midewiwin Lodge will again sound its voice. There will be a rebirth of the Anishinabe Nation and a rekindling of old flames. The Sacred Fire will again be lit.''

''It is this time that the light skinned race will be given a choice between two roads. One road will be green and lush, and very inviting. The other road will be black and charred, and walking it will cut their feet. In the prophecy, the people decide to take neither road, but instead to turn back, to remember and reclaim the wisdom of those who came before them. If they choose the right road, then the Seventh Fire will light the Eighth and final Fire, an eternal fire of peace, love brotherhood and sisterhood. If the light skinned race makes the wrong choice of the roads, then the destruction which they brought with them in coming to this country will come back at them and cause much suffering and death to all the Earth's people.&lt;ref name="EBB"/&gt;''|17px|17px}}

'''William B. Derrick''' (July 27, 1843 – April 15, 1913) was an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) bishop and missionary. He worked as a seaman early in his life and served in the [[Union Navy]] during the [[US Civil War]]. After the war, he joined the AME church and became involved in church leadership and missionary activities. He became a bishop of the church in 1896. He was also involved in Republican politics and civil rights.

== Early life and naval service ==
William B. Derrick was born on the Island of Antigua in the British West Indies July 27, 1843. His father, Thomas J. Derrick was from a large planter family on the island. He attended a public school at Gracefield run by [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] from 1848 to 1856. He then went to a select private high school for three years.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. ''Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising''. No. 247. GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p88–96&lt;/ref&gt; He trained to become a [[blacksmith]].&lt;ref name="Washington1909"&gt;Washington, T. Booker, ''The Story of the Negro: The Rise of the Race from Slavery''. New York: Doubleday 1 (1909) p 324-325&lt;/ref&gt; After this, he went to sea. He enlisted as a sailor from 1861 to 1864. and served on the [[USS Minnesota (1855)|Minnesota]], the flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron, during the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|battle of the Merrimac and the Monitor]].&lt;ref name="Simmons1887" /&gt; In his naval records he was described as being five feet five inches and having a tattoo of "W. B. D." on his right forearm.&lt;ref&gt;Weekly Returns of Enlistments at Naval Rendezvous ("Enlistment Rendezvous") Jan. 6, 1855 – Aug. 8, 1891, The National Archives, Publication Number: M1953, Record Group: 24, National Archives Catalog ID: 2363711, Roll: 0025 accessed at Fold3 August 19, 2016 at https://www.footnotelibrary.com/image/290416266&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his service, he married Mary E. White, daughter of Edwin White.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887" /&gt; Mary died after a short marriage and he remarried Lillian M. Lillian around 1882 died in 1907. He remarried again in 1909 to Clara E. Henderson Jones.&lt;ref name="Wright1916"&gt;Wright, Richard Robert, and John Russell Hawkins. Centennial Encyclopaedia of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Helped Make the AME Church what it is: Also Short Historical Sketches. Book Concern of the AME Church, Philadelphia, PA, 1916. p 83&lt;/ref&gt;

== AME church ==
[[File:WBDerrick.jpg|thumb|Bishop William B. Derrick (1843–1913) of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, photographed in 1906.]]
In 1866, he joined the AME church under [[John M. Brown]] who licensed him to preach and act as missionary agent, offices which he held until 1867. Bishop [[Daniel A. Payne]] appointed Derrick to Mt. Pisgah Chapel in Washington DC in 1867. In 1868, he was ordained deacon. He was then elected elder and ordained and made presiding elder of the Staunton church and district. He was elected presiding elder, pastor, and conference secretary at every Virginia Conference in the 1870s, and took part in general AME conferences in Nashville in 1872, Atlanta in 1876 and Baltimore in 1884. He was involved in a controversy in Virginia state politics in 1879 when he supported paying the state debt against others who favored readjusting the debts. He found himself on the losing end and resigned his charge in Virginia, touring the West Indies with his wife to return to ministry, then in New York State. He became presiding elder over a large district including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New England.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887" /&gt; In 1888 he was elected missionary secretary.&lt;ref name="Wright1916" /&gt;

In 1889, AME district bishop [[Benjamin Tucker Tanner]] was focused on missionary work in Haiti. In August, it was found that the mission treasury was empty. Derrick, as mission secretary was responsible and Payne demanded of Derrick what had happened to the funds. Derrick had been giving money to the Haitian mission in cash, which was not in itself a cause of trouble, but may have led to misuse of the funds. Tanner was hesitant to settle the dispute, but Derrick improved his place in the view of the AME leaders over the next few years and the pair reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;Seraile, William. ''Fire in His Heart: Bishop Benjamin Tucker Tanner and the AME Church''. Univ. of Tennessee Press, 1998. page 120–128&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 he was elected bishop, and served as bishop in the eighth, first, third, and fifteenth Episcopal districts.&lt;ref name="Wright1916" /&gt; As bishop, Derrick played an important role in missionary activities in the church. In the 1900s, Derrick traveled to widely, and worked to expand the AME church in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Reception to Bishop Derrick, ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'' (Brooklyn, New York) January 15, 1908, page 10 accessed August 18, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6283195//&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political and civil rights activism ==
Outside of the church, Derrick was very active in politics. In June 1884 he was nominated a presidential elector-at-large for the Republican State Committees with the support of [[Cornelius Van Cott]], but he declined after questions arose to his citizenship, although he had taken an oath and became a citizen when he enlisted in the navy 23 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887" /&gt; Derrick purchased interest in the New York Globe from [[George Parker (publisher)|George Parker]] in November 1884 with a goal of making it a more thoroughly Republican paper. Derrick and co-editor [[T. Thomas Fortune]] disagreed over the direction of the paper and the paper entered default and was later resurrected by Fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Herb. "The Black Pres: A Long History of Service and Advocacy," ''Crisis'', March 1991, Vol 98, No 3, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the century, Derrick was especially active in civil rights. Derrick was a member of the Afro-American Council a part of its organization by Fortune in 1897 in Chicago. Derrick in New York and [[Benjamin W. Arnett]] in Ohio were leaders of the AME Republicans in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Derrick supported licensed female preachers but not female ordained ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Little, Lawrence S. ''Disciples of Liberty: The African Methodist Episcopal Church in the Age of Imperialism, 1884–1916''. Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2000. page 23, 26, 96&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1892, Derrick gave a speech at a meeting of [[Wong Chin Foo]]'s Chinese Equal Rights League opposing the [[Geary Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Scott D. ''The First Chinese American: The Remarkable Life of Wong Chin Foo''. Vol. 1. Hong Kong University Press, 2013. p 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrick was proud of his military service and supported numerous military and patriot causes. He was prominent among those who urged retaliation for the [[sinking of the Maine]] in 1898 which in part led to the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;Shellum, Brian. ''Black Officer in a Buffalo Soldier Regiment: The Military Career of Charles Young''. U of Nebraska Press, 2010. p 73&lt;/ref&gt; Derrick was selected to deliver a sermon and prayer prior to the dedicatory address at the 1893 [[Grand Army of the Republic]] reunion at the dedication of the statue of Victory at the New York State monument at the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]].&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Caroline E. ''Remembering the Civil War: Reunion and the Limits of Reconciliatio''n. UNC Press Books, 2013. p205&lt;/ref&gt;

His sermons were reported in various newspapers. He was given a D. D. from [[Wilberforce University]] in 1885. He was friends with Bishop [[Richard H. Cain]] and served as executor of his will.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887" /&gt; He worked closely with [[James G. Blaine]], [[Benjamin Harrison]], and [[William McKinley]]. Derrick frequently traveled to England and was a popular speaker there.&lt;ref&gt;Men of the Month, The Crisis, June 1913, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the Globe, at one point Derrick owned the journal, the West Indian Abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Jeffrey Babcock. ''Hubert Harrison: The Voice of Harlem Radicalism, 1883–1918''. Columbia University Press, 2013. p 90&lt;/ref&gt; Derrick was affiliated with the Odd Fellows, Masons, Good Samaritans, and a trustee of Wilberforce University. He was a confidant and supporter of [[Booker T. Washington]]. He remained close to Antiguans in New York and in the West Indies throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Veeser, Cyrus, "Caribbean Immigrants and Politics", in eds Kazin, Michael, Rebecca Edwards, and Adam Rothman, eds.

Derrick died April 15, 1913 in Flushing, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Bichop Derrick Dies, ''The New York Times'' (New York, New York), April 16, 1913, page 11 accessed August 18, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6283232/bichop_derrick_dies_the_new_york_times/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustaf Richard ''Yngve'' Larsson''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈʏŋːvɛ ˈlɑːʂɔn|lang}}; born December 13, 1881 in [[Sundsvall]], died December 16, 1977 in [[Stockholm]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Ph.D.]], [[Municipal commissioner]] (''Borgarråd''), [[Member of Parliament]] and [[politician|statesman]].

He was a marked [[modernist]] and was for 22 years a leading vice Mayor of Stockholm, in charge of [[urban development]], and politically leading behind several of the city's largest urban development projects of the 20th century, including [[Slussen]], [[Stockholm Metro]] and the major [[redevelopment of Norrmalm]] borough in central Stockholm. Larsson's role in the post-war planning of Stockholm and its new suburbs was internationally recognized. The American city planner [[Clarence Stein]] wrote that:
{{Cquote|They have developed an organization for city building that is second only to that of the [[London County Council]]. But it differs from that in having a broader, more complete goal and ideal. This has been due I think largely to Yngve Larsson's statesmanship; also to his sympathetic understanding with [[Sven Markelius|Markelius]] and [[Göran Sidenbladh|Sidenbladh]] as architect-planners, and with [[Holger Blom]] (an architect, too), who makes the parks throughout Stockholm rich with blooming color.|author=[[Clarence Stein]],1960|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1998|p=600}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the [[Second World War]], Larsson was also a leading [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] anti-[[nazi]], and a board member of [[Samfundet Nordens Frihet]] and chairman of [[Svensk-Norska föreningen]]. He was awarded several Swedish and foreign [[Order (honour)|state orders]]. In 1946, [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] appointed Larsson as a Commander with Star of the Norwegian [[Order of St. Olav]] "for particularly outstanding merits of the Norwegian Resistance during the war."  He also received the French [[Legion of Honour]], Swedish [[Order of the Polar Star]] and [[Order of Vasa]] and the [[Order of the White Rose of Finland]].

Larsson came to be called his century's foremost Swedish ''[[Urban planner|city builder]]'' and Stockholm [[politician]].

Yngve Larsson was married to Elin (1884-1980), née [[Bonnier family|Bonnier]], and they had six children, including later professor [[Yngve A. A. Larsson]].
