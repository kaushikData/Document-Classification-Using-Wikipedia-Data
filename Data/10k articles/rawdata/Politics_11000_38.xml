The '''Abalone Alliance''' (1977–1985) was a [[nonviolent]] [[civil disobedience]] group formed to shut down the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]]'s [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] near [[San Luis Obispo]] on the central [[California]] coast in the United States.  They modeled their [[affinity group]]-based organizational structure after the [[Clamshell Alliance]] which was then protesting the [[Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant]] in coastal New Hampshire.  The group of activists took the name "Abalone Alliance" referring to the tens of thousands of wild California Red [[Abalone]] that were killed in 1974 in Diablo Cove when the unit's plumbing had its first hot flush.

The Abalone Alliance staged blockades and occupations at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant site between 1977 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy-net.org/01NUKE/DIABLO2.HTM Diablo Canyon Timeline Part II]&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly two thousand people were arrested during a two-week blockade in 1981, exceeding Seabrook as the largest number arrested at an anti-nuclear protest in the United States.&lt;ref name=dp&gt;Daniel Pope. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=13515 Conservation Fallout (book review)], ''H-Net Reviews'', August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Diablo Canyon controversy started in 1963 when PG&amp;E scrapped its attempt to build the [[Bodega Bay Nuclear Power Plant]] at [[Bodega Head]], 71 miles north of San Francisco. The Bodega struggle started in 1958, but was opposed by a group led by a [[University of California]] professor and young [[Sierra Club]] activist named David Pessonen. This was the first anti-nuclear power campaign in the US.  The main reason that the facility wasn't built was due its location less than 1,000 feet from the fault zone that [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|struck]] San Francisco in 1906.

Rather than face public opposition at Diablo Canyon, PG&amp;E approached the Sierra Club's president and cut a deal with certain board members where Diablo would be chosen rather than the [[Nipomo Dunes]] area. The wife of the Sierra Club president, who worked out the deal, would then be elected to PG&amp;E's board of directors. As part of the plan, the decision was made when Sierra Club board member Martin Litton was out of the country, the only member who knew of Diablo's history and importance.&lt;ref name="tl_part1"&gt;[http://www.energy-net.org/01NUKE/DIABLO2.HTM Diablo Canyon Timeline Part I]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nVR_vLOPfioC&amp;ots=kQCbFQgS6R&amp;pg=PR9 Conservation Fallout: Nuclear Protest at Diablo Canyon, John Wills], pIX&lt;/ref&gt;  The board was flown down to see the site in [[Frank Sinatra]]'s Lear Jet with [[Danny Kaye]] on board providing entertainment. Kaye would later become opposed to nuclear power.

The Sierra Club president forbade any chapter from opposing Diablo Canyon, so The San Luis Obispo Chapter formed the Shoreline Preservation Conference to oppose the construction on the grounds that the area had been proposed as a state park, was a sacred Chumash Indian site, had some of the largest oak trees on the West Coast, was located on the second-to-last coastal wilderness area in California, and could be sitting on the fault that lightly shook [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in a 1927 earthquake.  The internal dispute over Diablo Canyon was a primary reason for the split-up of the Sierra Club, that led to the formation of [[Friends of the Earth]] by [[David Brower]].&lt;ref name="tl_part1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpaulbishop.com/GPB%20History/GPB%20Archive/Section%20-%203/D.%20Brower/Image%202/image_2.htm DAVID BROWER by Montgomery Brower PEOPLE WEEKLY April 30, 1990] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183757/http://www.gpaulbishop.com/GPB%20History/GPB%20Archive/Section%20-%203/D.%20Brower/Image%202/image_2.htm |date=July 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Shoreline Preservation Conference demanded that regulators investigate the danger of faults near the proposed site, but was ignored. In 1972 a Los Angeles reporter discovered a report by [[Shell Oil Company]] geologists completed prior to construction of [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] of the existence of the [[Hosgri Fault]] 2½ miles offshore from the facility.  As a result of the discovery, regulators forced PG&amp;E to redesign and reinforce the facility.

==Diablo Canyon protests==
During the late 1970s, the Abalone Alliance organized protests in San Luis County and regularly picketed PG&amp;E offices across the state. The Alliance published a newspaper, ''It's About Times'', which provided a forum for activist debate. Separate groups within the Abalone coalition "developed their own foci and protest styles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVR_vLOPfioC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=conservation+fallout+review&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kQv9zMgV2R&amp;sig=JWVFkUZLXFrPlxLdr6EAGbouAvo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0iGuTYS8GYrcvQO_1tWPDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=protests&amp;f=false |title=Conservation fallout: nuclear protest at Diablo Canyon |author=John Wills |year=2006  |page=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 1977, 1,500 people demonstrated at the gate of Diablo Canyon, resulting in 47 arrests.  The next year, 5,000 people rallied and 487 were arrested. On September 10, 1981, the Abalone Alliance occupied the site, leading to 1,960 arrests. Nearly 30,000 people showed up in support. At the end of the ten-day action, a 25-year-old engineer discovered a mirror image reversal in the seismic blueprints. PG&amp;E was forced spend $3 billion and three additional years of repairs before reopening.&lt;ref name="part1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desertvortex.com/2012/01/01/wake-me-when-doomsday-arrives/ |title=Wake Me When Doomsday Arrives| first=Dean M | last=Gray |publisher=''Desert Vortex News'' |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-War Activists [[Daniel Ellsberg]] and [[Tom Hayden]], activist stars like [[Ed Asner]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Martin Landau]], [[Blythe Danner]], [[Patti Davis]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Marsha Mason]], [[John Belushi]], [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] and  performers such as [[Jackson Browne]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], [[The Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Peter Yarrow]], [[Holly Near]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]], [[James Taylor]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Jesse Colin Young]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Poco]], [[Wavy Gravy]], [[Warren Zevon]] and others joined the anti-nuclear concerts, protests and larger movement – which included a series of concerts at Madison Square Garden through [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]], as well as 'Peace Sunday' at the Rose Bowl (with over 100,000 in attendance) and multiple 'Survival Sundays' held at the Hollywood Bowl both through the Alliance for Survival, a Los Angeles-based Abalone Alliance affiliate. A number of the high-profile participants were included in the arrests at Diablo and the mass jailings were described  as a "tornado of talent".  Jackson Browne defending his civil disobedience at a San Luis Obispo courthouse after his arrest for trespassing at the blockade (“I consider my actions to be patriotic”). In 1984, the Alliance organized the Peoples Emergency Response Plan, where affinity groups blockaded at the Diablo Gates over a four-month period.

In late 1981, Alliance activists primarily from [[Davis, California|Davis]] and [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], along with local opposition held an eight-day sit-in at the State Capitol, encouraging then-Governor [[Jerry Brown]] to use emergency powers to shut down the [[Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station]]. The plant was closed by a public vote in 1989, a decade before its operating license was to expire. Other Alliance activists went on to form the Livermore Action Group, the Vandenberg Action Coalition, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110725231130/http://www.edcnet.org/learn/Case_History.html Environmental Defense Center], the Lenten Desert Experience at the [[Nevada Test Site]] and [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]]. At its peak, there were over 60 groups who were affiliated with the Alliance, including [[Greenpeace]] and Alliance for Survival. The group was hit with one of the first known [[SLAPP suit]]s in U.S. history, where the [[Pacific Legal Foundation]] and [[San Luis Obispo County]] attempted to legally obtain the names of all members and supporters, demanding that they pay for the costs of the 1981 blockade. The suit lasted nearly five years, before being withdrawn just before going before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].

The Mothers for Peace filed a legal challenge with the D.C. Circuit Court in an attempt to stop the operation of Diablo Canyon but was denied in November 1984. In January 1985, NRC Commissioner Asselstine leaked a copy of the NRC's secret transcripts to [[KRON-TV]] in San Francisco, documenting how the NRC had illegally licensed Diablo Canyon without properly reviewing evacuation plans as previously required. The Mothers then reopened their challenge based on the leaked NRC transcripts. Judge [[Robert Bork]] of the DC Court took the lead in denying the appeal April 25, 1986. Bork claimed that to look at the leaked transcripts would be [[judicial activism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Diablo Canyon opens==
The Diablo Canyon reactors were originally estimated to cost just over $300 million when PG&amp;E was first given permission to construct the facility.  When finally opened in 1985, construction costs were $5.8 billion and financing costs nearly an additional $7 billion.  After the 1981 blueprint mirror image mistake was discovered, the reactor's construction costs stood at $2.1 billion. PG&amp;E permission to go ahead with operation was reversed by the NRC and the company was required to go through a major review and rebuild. PG&amp;E was unable to find further financing from any source to continue construction, until president [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to give the company nearly $2.5 billion in loans.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The controversy did not come to a close until December 1988 when the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] gave PG&amp;E a $54 billion 30-year, cost plus rate contract to operate Diablo Canyon Power Plant. It has been considered{{By whom|date=January 2011}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPBtwfYcy-M the most controversial nuclear power plant in U.S. history because of its location 2½ miles offshore from the Hosgri Fault.&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

{{main|Political poetry|Proletarian literature}}

'''Proletarian poetry''' is a [[political poetry]] movement that developed in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s that expresses the class-conscious perspectives of the [[working-class]].&lt;ref name="repression1"/&gt; Such poems are either explicitly [[Marxist]] or at least [[socialist]], though they are often aesthetically disparate.&lt;ref name="repression2"/&gt; As [[Proletarian literature|a literature that emphasized working-class voices]], the poetic form of works range from those emulating [[Spiritual (music)|African-American slave work songs]] to [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poetry]]. Major poets of the movement include [[Langston Hughes]], [[Kenneth Fearing]], [[Edwin Rolfe]], [[Horace Gregory]], and [[Mike Gold]].&lt;ref name="dispatches"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="illinois1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation3"/&gt;

==Background==
While mainly originating in the [[proletarian literature|proletarian literary]] movement that arose out of the [[Proletkult|avantgardist]] [[Russian Revolution|post-revolutionary era]] of the [[Soviet Union]], proletarian poetry also had many antecedents in the United States before it rose to prominence in the 1920s. Coal miners in Pennsylvania wrote and sang militant labor songs, a form the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] embraced throughout the years before [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="proletarian"/&gt; Elements of proletarian literature and poetry could also be seen in the works of [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Upton Sinclair]], and [[Jack London]].&lt;ref name="proletarian4"/&gt; During the 1910s, the reporter and poet John Reed, along with other professional writers and leftists in the labor movement, also assisted in strikes and formed plans for workers' theaters.&lt;ref name="proletarian5"/&gt;

In 1926, the leftist magazine ''[[The New Masses]]'' was established and quickly took the forefront in defining and promoting proletarian poetry. Members of their staff went on in 1929 to organize [[John Reed Clubs]] in numerous cities around the country. Marxist in their ideology, although not officially affiliated with the Communist Party, these clubs sought to develop the writing skills of white and blue-collar workers to publish proletarian poetry and literature.&lt;ref name="proletarian6"/&gt; Other American communist organs publishing proletarian poetry and literature during the 1920s and 30s included [[Max Eastman]]'s magazine ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]]'', the Communist Party newspaper ''[[The Daily Worker]]'',''The Anvil'' edited by [[Jack Conroy]], ''Blast,'' and ''[[Partisan Review]].''

Limited career opportunities of the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]] also contributed in bringing the movement to the forefront of American life. The disenfranchisement and unemployment caused by the economic depression was an influential inspiration for working class artists because it directly exhibited the grievances experienced by many working-class people, and revealed imbalances within the U.S. economy despite the financial success and richness of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="illinois"/&gt; This realization of the imbalances of capitalism allowed for the growth of new leftist political and social discourses. Artists such as Langston Hughes, Edwin Rolfe, and Kenneth Fearing, in attempts to find solutions to the Great Depression, looked to socialism, communism, and anarchism, which resulted in these themes and ideas appearing in their literature and poetry. According to literary scholar Cary Nelson, "[d]espite considerable suffering, the mid-1930s were thus a heady time on the Left. Much of the poetry of the period combines sharp social critique with a sense of revolutionary expectation. More than simply reflecting the times, however, the "proletarian" poetry of revolution sought to define a new politics, to suggest subject positions within it, and to help bring about the changes it evoked." &lt;ref name="illinois1999"/&gt;

==Major works==

Kenneth Fearing's 'Dirge'&lt;ref name="democraticvistas"/&gt; is a mock-elegy printed in the working class magazine ''New Masses.'' &lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; According to critic Nathaniel Mills, Fearing examines the pitfalls of capitalism, describing a well-off executive committing suicide after financial failure. Fearing's proletarian style of "sensory shock" also allows readers to critically examine capitalism and its shortcomings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==Description and critical reception==
Many of the poets from the genre have recently surged in popularity as they are "rediscovered" after being suppressed during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]].&lt;ref name="beleaguered"/&gt; Even the term of proletarian poetry and which poets or poems belong to the genre has been subject to much debate in literary criticism then and now. However, the critic Milton Cohen collated a synthesis of aesthetic, stylistic, and political concerns from numerous articles debating the issue during the 30s:&lt;ref name="beleaguered7"/&gt; The "would-be proletarian writer" should:
 {{quote|
# View human conflict from a social perspective (as opposed to personal, psychological, or universal) and see society in terms of [[Social class|economic classes]].
# Portray these classes in [[Class conflict|conflict]] (as [[Marx]] described them): workers versus bosses, sharecroppers versus landowners, tenants versus landlords, have-nots versus haves.
# Develop a "[[Class consciousness|working-class consciousness]]," that is, identify with the oppressed class in these conflicts, rather than maintaining objective detachment.
# Present a hopeful outcome to encourage working-class readers. Other outcomes are defeatist, pessimistic, or "confused."
# Write simply and straightforwardly, without the aesthetic complexities of [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]].
# Above all, politicize the reader. Revolutionary literature is a weapon in the class struggle and should consciously incite its readers if not to direct action then to a new attitude toward life, "to recognize his role in the class struggle."
 |sign= Cohen, Milton. ''Beleaguered Poets and Leftist Critics,'' University of Alabama Press, (Tuscaloosa, 2010), p.24
 }}

At the time, proletarian poetry was also criticized in the 1930s by some critics for being "raucous", "stilted", and "over-sentimental", despite its attempts at representing the working class in the literature world.&lt;ref name="proletarian8"/&gt; Many poems and songs were published in specific labor movement's magazines, like the Wobblies' ''Can Opener,'' ''Industrial Worker,'' and so on.&lt;ref name="proletarian9"/&gt; Because of its shift from traditional verse and means of publication, proletarian poetry was not readily accepted, and it was received vaguely. Some saw proletarian poetry as not representative of the working class, that instead the white-collars were the writers because of their money and education, and not laborers themselves.&lt;ref name="proletarian10"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The populist proletariat movement of the 1930s has had a lasting effect on artists and voices to this day. Proletarian literature continues to be published, most notably by "Partisan Press" via the [http://Partisanpress.org Blue Collar Review]. Icons of the 1960s and 1970s progressive movements like [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], and [[John Lennon]] all carried on the message of the masses through a new form of poetry and expression in [[rock music]] and [[pop music]], which was just beginning to sprout into popular culture. Songs about the state of culture and the world like Springsteen's "[[Born in the U.S.A.]]" expressed both the hardship of the times and the herculean effort it would take to make a change in the life of the working man.&lt;ref name="Project MUSE - Reviews in American History - The Intellectual as Fan"/&gt; In fact, both Dylan and Springsteen would make tributes to [[Woody Guthrie]]'s influence on their lives and musical careers, with Dylan once saying of Guthrie, "He’s the greatest holiest godliest one in the world. Genius genius genius genius,",&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;  and Springsteen, "If Woody Guthrie were alive today, he'd have a lot to write about...high times on Wall Street and hard times on main street." &lt;ref name="Songs for Labor Day: Union tunes &amp; working man blues"/&gt;

[[File:Woody Guthrie 2.jpg|thumb|Woody Guthrie 2]]

Musicians like [[Woody Guthrie]] became the voice of the proletariat movement after the 1930s. Guthrie's "[[This Land Is Your Land]]" was written in response to what he thought was an unrealistic and complacent view of American culture in "[[God Bless America]]", and the song is considered one of the great American [[folk music]] songs.&lt;ref name="university"/&gt; Springsteen would use the song repeatedly in his set lists throughout the years, calling it "about the most beautiful song ever written, and the greatest song ever written about America." &lt;ref name="fretbase"/&gt;

The [[punk rock]] movement can also trace its roots back to the messaging of the proletariat, with bands like [[The Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], and [[Dead Kennedys]] planting the seeds of anti-establishment and disillusionment thought in many youths of the time, which like Guthrie's generation, felt they had no opportunity in the world through nihilistic worldviews.&lt;ref name="robertchristgau"/&gt; The band [[Anti-Flag]] would name one of their songs on their 2001 release [[Underground Network]] "This Machine Kills Fascists" in tribute to Guthrie's guitar, on which, he had written "This machine kills fascists." The band would also put music to Guthrie's lyrics "Post-War Breakout" on their 2003 release [[The Terror State]].&lt;ref name="woodyguthrie"/&gt; [[Joe Strummer]], one of the guitarists and the main vocalist in The Clash, once called himself "Woody" in tribute Woody Guthrie to whom he considered his hero.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

The proletariat message would also find itself in the songs of [[Bad Religion]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]], which sought to counter-act the [[moral majority]] and conservative movements taking root in American politics at the time, with [[Greg Graffin]], the vocalist of Bad Religion, stating, "When we hit on Bad Religion, it seemed perfect...religion was a hot topic, and those TV preachers seemed like a good target to us...",&lt;ref name="harpercollins"/&gt;  and even fuel the fire of [[Rage Against The Machine]]'s quest for economic equality in the 1990s, with Rage Against The Machine guitarist [[Tom Morello]] once stating, "America touts itself as the land of the free, but the number one freedom that you and I have is the freedom to enter into a subservient role in the workplace." &lt;ref name="musicfanclubs"/&gt;

More modern takes on a changing world through the voices of the proletariat and middle classes can be found in [[Flogging Molly]]'s and [[Dropkick Murphys]]' post-2000 releases which take on the war they say is being waged on the working man in America.&lt;ref name="Dropkick Murphys"/&gt;  Dropkick Murphys have recorded many covers of Guthrie songs included their 2005 release of [[I'm Shipping Up to Boston]] saying of the song, "Obviously, there were a lot of deep songs about World War II and labor stuff, but randomly in the middle of all these serious lyrics was this silly song, which seemed kind of cool. When other people do Woody's stuff, you normally don't see that lighthearted side of his work." &lt;ref name="The Woody Guthrie Store: Warrior's Code CD - Dropkick Murphys"/&gt; The band also has recorded a cover of Guthrie's "Gonna Be A Blackout Tonight."

Since August 2011, the U.S. poet laureate, [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]], is also part of this legacy.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; His poetry often focuses on labor in Detroit.&lt;ref name="Philip Levine- Poets.org - Poetry, Poems, Bios &amp; More"/&gt;

'''Asylum shopping''' is the practice by [[Refugee|asylum seekers]] of applying for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in several states or seeking to apply in a particular state after transiting other states. The phrase is used mostly{{dubious|date=July 2017}} in the context of the [[European Union]] and the [[Schengen Area]], but has been used by the [[Federal Court of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/AsylumShopping.aspx|title=Asylum Shopping Definition|work=duhaime.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the objectives of [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]] is to prevent asylum shopping.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldselect/ldeucom/84/8407.htm#n35 Select Committee on European Union Tenth Report]'', House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dublin Convention]] stipulates that asylum seekers are returned to the country where their entry into the union was first recorded and where they were first fingerprinted. Another objective of this policy is to prevent ''asylum seekers in orbit'', i.e., to prevent the continual transfer of asylum seekers between countries trying to get others to accept them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/factsheets/dublinconvention4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 February 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319010056/http://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/factsheets/dublinconvention4.html |archivedate=19 March 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid abuses, [[European law]], the [[Dublin Regulation]], requires that asylum seekers register their asylum claim in the first country they arrive in,{{fact|date=March 2018}} and that the decision of the first EU country they apply in, is the final decision in all EU countries. However, among some asylum seekers, the fingerprinting and registration is vehemently resisted in countries that are not considered asylum-seeker friendly, as they often wish to apply for [[asylum in Germany]] and Sweden where benefits are more generous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Out of Syria, Into a European Maze|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/world/middleeast/out-of-syria-into-a-european-maze.html?_r=0|work=NYTimes.com|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some asylum seekers report burning their fingers so they can evade the fingerprint record control in Italy and apply for asylum in a country of their choice.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite news|title=Dublin regulation leaves asylum seekers with their fingers burnt|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/dublin-regulation-european-asylum-seekers|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=7 October 2011|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fingerprint record, known as the [[Eurodac]] system, is used to intercept false or multiple asylum claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Migrants and asylum in the EU|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24583286|work=BBC News|date=3 March 2016|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, two-thirds of failed asylum seekers were found to be already known to the British border authorities, a third of the time under a different nationality, such as Tanzanians claiming to be fleeing persecution in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two-thirds of failed asylum seekers had used false identities|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/twothirds-of-failed-asylum-seekers-had-used-false-identities-26855916.html|author=Brady, Tom|work=Independent.ie|date=21 May 2012|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum''' ({{lang-pl|Państwowe Muzeum Auschwitz-Birkenau w Oświęcimiu}} (Teren Niemiecki zabrany Polsce) is a memorial and museum in [[Oświęcim]] (German: ''Auschwitz''), [[Poland]], which includes the Nazi concentration camps [[Auschwitz]] I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau. It is devoted to the memory of the victims who died at both camps during [[World War II]]. The museum performs several tasks, including [[Holocaust]] research.

== Overview ==
{{further|Auschwitz concentration camp|Monowitz concentration camp|List of subcamps of Auschwitz}}
The museum was founded by the act of the [[Sejm]] on July 2, 1947; the act determines:

''The site of the former [[Nazi]] concentration camp in Auschwitz together with all the buildings and installations standing there is to be kept forever as a 'Monument to the Martyrology of the Polish Nation and other Nations'.''&lt;ref&gt;''KL Auschwitz. Documentary photographs'', Warsaw 1980, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

The area covers {{convert|191|ha}}, twenty of them in camp Auschwitz I and 171 hectares in camp Auschwitz II. Since 1979, the former concentration camp has belonged to the [[World Cultural Heritage]] and more than 25 million people have visited the museum. From 1955 to 1990, the museum was directed by one of its founders and former inmates, [[Kazimierz Smoleń]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewish-guide.pl/ www.jewish-guide.pl Bio note on Kazimierz Smoleń]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''areas of remembrance'' are [[Auschwitz I]], Auschwitz II-[[Auschwitz concentration camp|Birkenau]], the train ramp between Auschwitz and Birkenau, which was used as a "debarkation-stop" between 1942–1944. The three kilometres between Auschwitz and Birkenau are within walking distance. The museum is situated in several original buildings.

In 2017, 2.1 million persons visited the site. &lt;ref&gt;[[List of most visited museums|2017 TEA-AECOM Museum Index]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, more than one million people from 94 countries visited: from Poland (341,000), U.S. (96,000), UK (57,200), Italy (51,000), Germany (50,200), France (39,100), Israel (37,200), South Korea (35,400), Norway (30,600), and Spain (23,300).

There were 1.3 million visitors in 2009 and 1.38 million in 2010. In 2011, more than 1.4 million people from 111 countries visited: from Poland (610,000), [[United Kingdom]] (82,000), [[Italy]] (78,000), [[Israel]] (62,000), [[Germany]] (58,000), [[France]] (56,000), [[United States]] (52,000), [[Spain]] (46,000), [[South Korea]], and [[Czech Republic]] (43,000 each).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1,4 miliona osób odwiedziło obóz Auschwitz |trans-title=1.4 million people visited the Auschwitz camp |language=pl |publisher=[[Gazeta Krakowska]] |date=January 6, 2012 |url=http://www.gazetakrakowska.pl/artykul/490957,oficjalnie-1-4-miliona-osob-odwiedzilo-oboz-auschwitz,id,t.html?cookie=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615124455/http://www.gazetakrakowska.pl/artykul/490957%2Coficjalnie-1-4-miliona-osob-odwiedzilo-oboz-auschwitz%2Cid%2Ct.html?cookie=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Birkenau Walk of Death.jpg|left|thumb|Gate in Auschwitz-Birkenau leading to crematoria IV and V.|300px]]

After the [[Soviet Union]] handed over the camp to Poland in 1947, the parliament declared the area to be a museum on July 2, 1947. Simultaneously the first exhibition in the barracks was opened. In [[Stalinist Poland]], on the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the first deportation of Polish captives to camp Auschwitz, the exhibition was revised under assistance of former inmates. However, this exhibition was influenced by the [[Cold War]] and next to pictures of Jewish ghettos, photos of [[slum]]s in the US were presented.

After [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] death, a new exhibition was planned in 1955, which is basically still valid today. In 1959, every nation who had victims in Auschwitz received the right to present its own exhibition. However, victims like homosexuals, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Sinti and Roma]], and [[Yeniche people]] did not receive these rights. The state of [[Israel]] was also refused the allowance for its own exhibition as the murdered Jews in Auschwitz were not citizens of Israel. In April 1968, the Jewish exhibition, designed by [[Andrzej Szczypiorski]], was opened. A scandal occurred in 1979 when [[Pope John Paul II]] held a mass in Birkenau and called the camp a "[[Golgotha]] of our times".

In 1962, a prevention zone around the museum in Birkenau (and in 1977, one around the museum in Auschwitz) was established in order to maintain the historical condition of the camp. These zones were confirmed by the Polish parliament in 1999. In 1967, the first big memorial monument was inaugurated and in the 1990s the first information boards were set up.

=== The national exhibitions ===
[[File:Auschwitz Death wall 1.5.jpg|right|thumb|Auschwitz death wall located near block 11.|350px]]

Since 1960, the so-called "national exhibitions" have been located in the former concentration camp Auschwitz I. Most of them were renewed from time to time; for example, those of Belgium, France, Hungary, Netherlands, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and the former Soviet Union. The German exhibition, which was made by the former [[East Germany|GDR]], has not been renewed since.

The first national exhibition of the Soviet Union was opened in 1961 and renewed in 1977 and 1985. In 2003, the Russian organizing committee suggested to present a completely new exhibition. The Soviet part of the museum was closed, but the reopening was delayed as there were differences in the questions of the territorial situation of the Soviet Union between 1939 and 1941. The question of the territories annexed by the USSR during the war, i.e. the  Baltic countries, eastern Poland, and Moldova could not be solved.

In 1978, Austria opened its own exhibition, presenting itself as a victim of [[National Socialism]]. This one-sided view motivated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andreas|last=Maislinger|author-link=Andreas Maislinger|url=http://www.auslandsdienst.at/press/archive/juedischerundschauengl_13.2.1992.htm|title=Commemorative Service|publisher=[[Jewish Review]]|date=February 13, 1992|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030308063351/http://www.auslandsdienst.at/press/archive/juedischerundschauengl_13.2.1992.htm|archivedate=March 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Austrian political scientist [[Andreas Maislinger]] to work in the museum within the [[Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (ARSP)]] in 1980/81. Later he founded the [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service]]. The Austrian federal president [[Rudolf Kirchschläger]] had advised Maislinger that as a young Austrian he did not need to atone for anything in Auschwitz. Due to this disapproving attitude of the official Austrian representation, the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service could not be launched before September 1992.

===Filming===
The museum has allowed scenes for four films to be filmed on the site: ''[[Passenger (1963 film)|Pasażerka]]'' (1963) by Polish director [[Andrzej Munk]], ''[[Landscape After the Battle]]'' (1970) by Polish director [[Andrzej Wajda]], and a television miniseries, ''[[War and Remembrance]]'' (1988), and "[[Denial (2016 film)|Denial]]" (2016).  Permission was denied to [[Steven Spielberg]] for the construction of film sets on the grounds of the museum, for shooting scenes for ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) onsite. A "replica" camp entrance was constructed outside the infamous archway for the scene in which the train arrives carrying the women who were saved by [[Oskar Schindler]].&lt;ref name="Palowski1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palowski|first=Franciszek|title=The Making of Schindler's List: Behind the Scenes of an Epic Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IagqAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=October 22, 2016|year=1998|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-55972-445-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious disputes===
{{further|Auschwitz cross}}
In 1979, the newly elected Polish Pope John Paul II celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] on the grounds of Auschwitz II to some 500,000 people, and announced that [[Edith Stein]] would be [[beatification|beatified]]. Some Catholics erected a cross near Bunker 2 of Auschwitz II where she had been gassed. A short while later, a [[Star of David]] appeared at the site, leading to a proliferation of religious symbols, which were eventually removed.

[[Carmelites|Carmelite nuns]] opened a convent near Auschwitz I in 1984. After some Jewish groups called for the removal of the convent, representatives of the Catholic Church agreed in 1987. One year later, the Carmelites erected an 8&amp;nbsp;m (26&amp;nbsp;ft) tall cross from the 1979 mass near their site, just outside [[Block 11]] and barely visible from within the camp. This led to protests by Jewish groups, who said that mostly Jews were killed at Auschwitz and demanded that religious symbols be kept away from the site. The Catholic Church told the Carmelites to move by 1989, but they stayed on until 1993, leaving the cross behind. In 1998, after further calls to remove the cross, some 300 smaller crosses were erected by local activists near the large one, leading to further protests and heated exchanges. Following an agreement between the Polish Catholic Church and the Polish government, the smaller crosses were removed in 1999, but a large papal one remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewish-guide.pl/sites/auschwitz-birkenau-museum Article on Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberation day anniversaries===
The 50th anniversary of the liberation ceremony was held in Auschwitz I in 1995. About a thousand ex-prisoners attended it. In 1996, Germany made January 27, the day of the liberation of Auschwitz, the official day for the commemoration of the victims of National Socialism. Countries who have also adopted similar memorial days include [[Denmark]] (Auschwitz Day), [[Italy]] (Memorial Day), and [[Poland]] (Memorial Day for the Victims of Nazism).
A commemoration was held for the 70th anniversary of the liberation in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Raziye|last1=Akkoc|author2=Andrew Marszal|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11371241/Holocaust-Memorial-Day-commemorations-across-Europe-mark-70th-anniversary-of-Auschwitz-liberation-latest.html|title=Holocaust Memorial Day: commemorations mark 70th anniversary of Auschwitz liberation|work=The Telegraph|date=January 27, 2015|accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Samantha|last=Early|title=Auschwitz-Birkenau commemorations|url=http://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-birkenau-commemorations/a-18217446|publisher=DW|date=January 27, 2015|accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNESCO name change==
The Polish Foreign Ministry has voiced objections to the use of the expression "[[Polish death camp controversy|Polish death camp]]" in relation to Auschwitz, in case the phrase suggested that Poland rather than Germany had perpetrated the Holocaust. In June 2007, the [[United Nations]] [[World Heritage Committee]] announced that their new name for the site was "Auschwitz Birkenau," with the subtitle "German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp (1940-1945)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/363|title=World Heritage Committee approves Auschwitz name change|work=[[UNESCO]]|date=June 28, 2007|accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art purchases===
Czechoslovakian Jew [[Dina Babbitt]] imprisoned at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] in 1943-45 painted a dozen portraits of Romani inmates for the war criminal Dr. [[Josef Mengele]] during his medical experiments. Seven of the original 12 studies were discovered after the Holocaust and purchased by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in 1963 from an Auschwitz survivor. The Museum asked Babbitt to return to Poland in 1973 to identify her work. She did so, but also requested that the Museum allow her to take her paintings home with her. Officials from the Museum led by [[Rabbi]] Andrew Baker stated that the portraits belonged to the SS and Mengele, who died in Brazil in 1979. There was an initiative to have the Museum return the portraits in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;Referred to Senate committee (8/5/1999), [https://web.archive.org/web/20120205063703/http://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106%3ASC00054%3A S.CON.RES.54.

[[Image:Balaclava 3 hole black.jpg|thumb|A [[Ribbing (knitting)|rib-knit]] three-hole balaclava]]

A '''balaclava''', also known as a '''balaclava helmet''', is a form of cloth headgear designed to expose only part of the face. Depending on style and how it is worn, only the eyes, mouth and nose, or just the front of the face are unprotected. Versions with a full face opening may be rolled into a hat to cover the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown of the head]] or folded down as a collar around the neck.

The name comes from their use at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] during the [[Crimean War]], referring to [[Balaklava|the town]] near [[Sevastopol]] in the [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name="Games2007"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Games | first =  Alex| year = 2007| title = Balderdash &amp; piffle : one sandwich short of a dog's dinner
 | isbn = 978-1-84607-235-2| publisher = BBC| location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; British troops there wore knitted headgear, to keep warm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/top10facts/467286/Top-10-facts-about-the-Crimean-War|title=Top 10 facts about the Crimean War|last1=Hartston|first1=William|website=[[Daily Express]] |publisher=Express Newspaper|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditional balaclavas were [[knitting|knitted]] from [[wool]]. Modern versions are also made from [[silk]], [[cotton]], [[polypropylene]], [[neoprene]], [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]], or [[polar fleece]].

This type of headgear was  known in the 19th century as an [[Uhlan]] cap or a [[Templar]] cap.&lt;ref name="Rutt" /&gt;

During the [[Crimean War]] in 1854, handmade balaclavas were sent over to the [[British Army|British troops]] to help protect them from the bitter cold weather. British troops required this aid, as their own supplies (warm clothing, weatherproof quarters, and food) never arrived in time.&lt;ref name="Shepherd"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Shepherd |title=The Crimean Doctors: A History of the British Medical Services in the Crimean War |volume= 1 |publisher= Liverpool University Press |year=1991 |pages= 296–306 |url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=HpCgkcvNiLcC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;lpg=PA296}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Rutt in his ''History of Handknitting'', the name "balaclava helmet" was not used during the war but appears much later, in 1881.&lt;ref name="Rutt"&gt;Richard Rutt, ''A History of Handknitting'', London 1987, pages 134–5.  (Note that there is a misprint in the date of the Battle of Balaclava, which took place 1854, in the original edition cited here)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Warmth===
[[File:Colin Skinner in 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Colin Skinner]] during a [[snowstorm]] in [[North Dakota]] in 2009]]

Modern balaclavas are used in outdoor winter sports such as [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], and [[snowmobiling]] to protect the face from wind and maintain warmth.  They are also popular among motorcyclists and bicyclists. It is especially useful for balaclavas to have breathability when used in outdoor sports to prevent fogging of glasses and goggles. Breathable balaclavas are ideal for outdoor sports.

===Safety===
{{see also|Anti-flash gear}}
[[Firefighter]]s wear a [[Fireproofing|fire-resistant]] version made of [[Nomex]] with a face opening that is covered by their [[self-contained breathing apparatus]]&amp;nbsp;(SCBA).

Electrical workers often wear an arc-flash rated version in conjunction with a face shield and other [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) while working on energized equipment.

[[Race driver]]s In [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] sanctioned events must wear balaclavas made of fire-retardant material underneath their crash helmets. In racing events, hill-climbs, special stages of rallies and selective sections of cross-country events entered on the International Sporting Calendar, all drivers and co-drivers must wear overalls as well as gloves (optional for co-drivers), long underwear, a balaclava, socks, and shoes homologated to the FIA 8856-2000 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/4C1C7A762BC27980C12575B700525253/$FILE/Annexe%20L_2009_15.05.09.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002355/http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/4C1C7A762BC27980C12575B700525253/%24FILE/Annexe%20L_2009_15.05.09.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military and police===
[[File:Task Force Police officer in Sweden.jpg|thumb|left| A Swedish police officer wearing a balaclava which masks his identity]]

British [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) troopers wore balaclavas during the storming of the [[Iranian Embassy siege|Iranian Embassy in London]] (Operation Nimrod) in 1980. The balaclavas were worn to conceal the identity of the SAS men because some had been working as undercover "plain clothes" men in [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland]], and might need to resume their duties in the province after the Embassy operation.

In the [[Indian subcontinent]], balaclavas are commonly referred to as '''monkey caps''' because of their typical earth tone colours, and the fact that they blot out most human facial features. Monkey caps sometimes have a small, decorative, woollen [[pom-pom]] on top. They are commonly worn by troops on [[Himalaya]]n duty for protection from the cold.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Subir (2005) "Thanda lege jabey" Article in 19 Nov Hindusthan Times&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Marine Corps]] has recently begun issuing balaclavas with hinged face guards as part of the [[Flame Resistant Organizational Gear]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pmice/News/Clothing/Fire-safe%20fabrics_Sep%202006.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029084623/http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pmice/News/Clothing/Fire-safe%20fabrics_Sep%202006.pdf |date=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pmice/InfoPapers/Clothing/FROG.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916065851/http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pmice/InfoPapers/Clothing/FROG.pdf |date=September 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Soviet Union]], the balaclava became a part of standard [[OMON]] (special police task force) uniform as early as the [[Perestroyka]] years of the late 1980s. The original intent was to protect the identity of the officers to avoid intimidation from organized crime. Because of increased problems with organized crime of the 90s, TV shots of armed men in black balaclavas became common. As organized crime decreased, however, balaclavas became as much an instrument of intimidation as identity protection, as they conceal facial expressions of the wearer and make positive identification difficult. Armed Russian police commonly conduct raids and searches of white-collar premises (typically in Moscow) while wearing balaclavas.  Such raids have therefore come to be known in Russia as "maski shows", an allusion to a popular comic TV show of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/business/global/bp-russia.html?nl=afternoonupdate&amp;emc=aua22 | work=The New York Times | first=Andrew E. | last=Kramer | title=Memo to Exxon: Business With Russia May Involve Guns and Balaclavas | date=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concealment===
A balaclava may be used occupationally by [[SWAT]], [[special forces]] personnel, or by criminals to conceal their identities. In [[Ireland]], the balaclava has a long history of use by paramilitary groups dating back to the Irish War of Independence. Notably, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] used balaclavas to conceal their identity.

[[British Police]] in [[Kent]] confiscated the ''[[War on Terror (game)|War on Terror]]'' board game partly because of the inclusion of a balaclava. Police said it "could be used to conceal someone's identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cn_news_home/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=338658 |title=Latest news from Cambridge &amp; Cambridgeshire.

{{Slavery}}

The '''Blockade of Africa''' began in 1808 after the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] outlawed the [[Atlantic slave trade]], making it illegal for British ships to transport slaves. The [[Royal Navy]] immediately established a presence off Africa to enforce the ban, called the [[West Africa Squadron]]. Although the ban initially applied only to British ships, the UK negotiated treaties with other countries to give the Royal Navy the right to intercept and search their ships for slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falola|first1=Toyin|last2=Warnock|first2=Amanda|title=Encyclopedia of the middle passage|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313334801|pages=xxi, xxxiii-xxxiv|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UjRYKePKrB8C&amp;lpg=PR34&amp;pg=PR21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable exception was the United States, which refused such permission. The 1807 [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] technically abolished the intercontinental slave trade in the United States but the ban was not widely enforced and many of the slave ships which escaped the blockade were destined for the southern United States.

From 1819, some effort was made by the [[United States Navy]] to prevent the slave trade. This mostly consisted of patrols of the shores of the Americas and in the mid-Atlantic, the latter being largely unsuccessful due to the difficulty of intercepting ships in mid-ocean. As part of the [[Webster–Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842 it was agreed that both countries would work together on the abolition of the slave trade, which was deemed [[piracy]], and to continue the blockade of Africa. US Navy involvement continued until the beginning of the [[American Civil War|US Civil War]] in 1861; the following year the Lincoln administration gave the UK full authority to intercept US ships. The Royal Navy squadron remained in operation until 1870.

==United Kingdom involvement==
[[File:African woman slave trade.jpg|thumb|"The Abolition of the Slave Trade or the inhumanity of dealers in human flesh exemplified in Captn. Kimber's treatment of a young Negro girl of 15 for her virjen (sic) modesty." by Isaac Cruikshank, 1792. Shows an incident of an enslaved African girl whipped to death for refusing to dance naked on the deck of the slave ship; Briton [[Captain John Kimber]] was denounced before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by [[William Wilberforce]] over the alleged incident.]] 
The [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The African Slave Trade, and all manner of dealing and trading in the Purchase, Sale, Barter, or Transfer of Slaves, or of Persons intended to be sold, transferred, used, or dealt with as Slaves, practised or carried on, in, at, to or from any Part of the Coast or Countries of Africa, shall be, and the same is hereby utterly abolished, prohibited, and declared to be unlawful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under this Act if a ship was caught with slaves there was a fine of £100 per enslaved person. This fine was usually paid by the ship's captain. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=April 1996|title=Notes on contributors|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01440399608575180|journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition|volume=17|issue=1|pages=155–156|doi=10.1080/01440399608575180|issn=0144-039X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to enforce this, two ships were dispatched to the African coast, their primary mission was to prevent British subjects from slave trading, and also to disrupt the slave trades of the UK's enemies during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

=== Diplomacy ===
{{further|Abolition of slavery timeline#1800–1849}}
The original 1807 Act only allowed for British ships to be searched. Unfortunately, many ships were able to find loopholes around this act. This caused more acts to be passed in the late 1800's. Almost 30,000 Africans were still illegally imported. However, in 1810, under considerable diplomatic pressure, a convention with Portugal was signed widening the mandate of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Christoper Lloyd, The Navy and the Slave Trade p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TNA ADM 2/1327 Standing Orders to Commanders-in-Chief 1815-1818&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815 Portugal strengthened their anti-slavery legislation by abolishing all trade north of the equator, allowing the Royal Navy a much freer hand. With the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, Britain obtained treaties with several other powers including France, which abolished its trade entirely in 1815 (but did not commit to right of search), and Spain, which agreed to cease trade north of the equator in 1818, and south of the equator by 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, L. "The Mixed Commissions for the Suppression of the Transatlantic Slave Trade in the Nineteenth Century". ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 7, No. 1 (1966) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Coupland The British Anti-Slavery Movement pp. 151–60&lt;/ref&gt; A clause was also inserted into the [[Congress of Vienna]] which called for the eventual abolition of the trade by all signatories. In 1826, Brazil signed an agreement similar to that of Portugal, and ceased trade north of the equator.

The UK's slave trade suppression efforts attempted to remain within the primitive international laws of the time: slavers had to be tried in courts. British vessels were taken to [[Vice admiralty court]]s, and those of foreign states which had treaties with the UK were taken to Courts of Mixed Commission. [[Mixed Commission Court]]s had representation from both the UK and the other nation in question, to ensure a fair trial. Many were established at key points along the coast of Africa and its islands. However the reluctance of other powers greatly curtailed the ability of the courts to operate; sometimes the foreign representation would never arrive, or arrive exceptionally late. The Brazilian ambassador, in spite of the court opening in 1826, did not arrive until 1828, and he reversed all judgements carried out in his absence upon his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Shaikh, F ‘Judicial Diplomacy: British Officials and the Mixed Commission Courts’ in Slavery Diplomacy and Empire p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the issues with Mixed Commission Courts, the Navy's mandate to police the trade was also found to be lacking and built on a series of complicated and often weak diplomatic treaties between other states. The agreements were signed reluctantly and therefore very weak in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, H. H, ‘Some Principal Aspects of British Efforts to Crush the African Slave Trade, 1807-1929’ The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 44, No. 3 (1950) p. 509-510&lt;/ref&gt; When policing foreign vessels, there had to be slaves on board at the time of seizure for the accused slaver to be convicted. Unlike in Britain's 1807 act, there was no equipment clause, meaning that slave ships carrying what was obviously equipment for transporting slaves, but without slaves on board at the time of search, could not be seized. This major flaw, which greatly curtailed the Navy's efforts, and caused some naval officers to fall foul of the law, was not rectified until the 1830s. Frustrated with the lack of progress, in 1839 the British government subjected Portuguese vessels to British jurisdiction, and did the same to Brazilian vessels in 1845. This was an unprecedented step which subjected foreign vessels to the much more stringent British law, and much stricter penalties for slave trading.

However, some nations, such as the United States, resisted British coercion. The US believed strongly in freedom of the seas and, on several occasions, refused to allow the Royal Navy right of search. Knowing that many slavers would fly false US flags to avoid being boarded, some slavers were even registered in southern US states. This caused several diplomatic incidents as frustrated officers would often board ships with US flags, directly contravening their orders, to capture slavers. In the US Congress there was fierce opposition to this, with [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]] stating in 1841 that “the persistence” of British cruisers was “unwarranted,” “destructive to private interests” and “[would] inevitably destroy the harmony of the two countries.”&lt;ref&gt;Seizure of American Vessels- Slave Trade in Eltis, D. Abolition of the Slave Trade: Suppression &lt;url: http://abolition.nypl.org/content/docs/text/seizure_american_vessels.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842 there was a thaw in diplomatic relations and the US allowed visitation to US vessels, but only if a US officer was also present.&lt;ref&gt;''Parliamentary Papers'', 1844, Vol. L [577] "Instructions for the guidance of Her Majesty's naval officers employed in the suppression of the slave trade", pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

With the beginning of the 1850s Portugal had completely ceased slave trading (1836) and Spain had all but ceased, but Cuba was still an active slave port. Brazil continued to defy British intervention, and the Brazilian trade was not extinguished until 1852 when [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] began using force under the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' doctrine.

===West Africa Squadron===
[[File:HMS Black Joke (1827) and prizes.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Black Joke (1827)|HMS ''Black Joke]]'' and the prizes she captured during the blockade.]]
{{main|West Africa Squadron}}

Following the 1807 Act, two ships had been dispatched to the African Coast for anti-Slavery patrol.

By 1818 the squadron had grown to six ships with a naval station established in 1819 at what is now [[Freetown]] and a supply base at [[Ascension Island]], later moved to [[Cape Town]] in 1832.

The resources were further increased; in the middle of the 19th century there were around 25 vessels and 2,000 personnel with a further 1,000 local sailors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/abolition/royal_navy_article_01.shtml The Royal Navy and the Battle to End Slavery] Huw Lewis-Jones, BBC History&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1808 and 1860 the West Africa Squadron captured 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans.&lt;ref name="Naval Museum - Chasing Freedom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chasing Freedom Information Sheet |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |accessdate=2007-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=10 December 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately this did not exactly reduce the number of deaths of African Slaves. Thousands of Africans lost their lives if the captain of a slave ship knew they were being approached by a squadron vessel. The captain would order for the slaves to be thrown overboard still shackled. Very few would make it to shore. 

===The end of the trade===
In spite of the Britain's best efforts to pursue suppression through diplomatic means the trade persisted. Public opinion was beginning to turn against the anti-slavery efforts due to their huge costs, the diplomatic repercussions they caused and the damage caused to other trade.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Huzzey, Freedom Burning p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]] emerged from anti-coercionists, who were opposed to the use of British coercion of other nations and prolonged military action against slavers. The anti-coercionists were a mixed group of free trade activists and anti-slavery advocates who saw the only way to end the trade was to establish a legitimate commerce with Africa. Their leader, [[Sir Fowell Buxton, 1st Baronet|Thomas Fowell Buxton]], advocated a renewed naval effort until legitimate commerce could be established. In 1839 he published ''The African Slave Trade and its Remedy'' which contained a top-to-bottom critique of the British efforts thus far. The work was highly influential and gave Buxton a leading role in the planning of the [[Niger expedition of 1841]], to attempt to establish trading posts along the Niger River to create an alternative to slave trading. Although the plan had offered a long term solution to the slave trade, unfortunately the expedition ended in abject failure with many of the Europeans falling ill. In 1845 Buxton died with his ambitions unfulfilled.

From 1845 the anti-coercionist cause became much more radical and much less concerned with the plight of Africans, this "new generation" of anti-coercionists did not include the abolitionists. Free trade advocates such as [[William Hutt (MP)|William Hutt]] were vehemently opposed to naval actions and argued the trade would eventually die naturally and the UK's interference was unwarranted. Such was their influence there was even a motion in the Commons to end all naval activity, which came dangerously close to ending the West Africa Squadron and also the career of the prime minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|John Russell]] who threatened resignation should the motion be carried.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Coupland, Anti-Slavery Movement p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent a repeat of this, swift action was taken. [[Slavery in Brazil|Brazil]] was still one of the largest slave trading nations and continued to defy British diplomatic calls to cease trading. In 1846 Palmerston returned as foreign secretary and in 1850 permitted Royal Naval vessels to enter Brazilian waters in order to blockade slavers on both sides of the Atlantic. By 1852 the Brazilian trade could be said to be extinct.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, H. H, ‘Some Principal Aspects of British Efforts to Crush the African Slave Trade, 1807-1929’ The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 44, No. 3 (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; “For Palmerston … the naval campaign on the coast of Brazil had brought the long drawn-out saga of the Brazilian slave trade to a resolution within twelve months.”&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, A. ‘Slavery, Free Trade, and Naval Strategy, 1840-1860’ in Slavery Diplomacy and Empire, ed. Hamilton K. &amp; Salmon, P. (Eastbourne, Sussex Academic Press 2009)p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The many years of British pressure on the United States to join vigorously in fighting the Atlantic slave trade had been neutralised by the southern states. However with the onset of the [[American Civil War|US Civil War]], the [[Lincoln administration]] became eager to sign up, humanitarian and military objectives combined. To the North, Anti-Slavery was an important military tool with which to harm the [[Economy of the Confederate States of America|Confederate economy]]. It also won praise, sympathy and support on the international stage, and dampened international support for the Southern States who vehemently defended their right to keep slaves. In the [[Lyons–Seward Treaty of 1862]], the United States gave the UK full authority to crack down on the trans-Atlantic slave trade when carried on by US ships.&lt;ref&gt;Conway W. Henderson, "The Anglo-American Treaty of 1862 in Civil War Diplomacy." ''Civil War History'' 15.4 (1969): 308–319. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/summary/v015/15.4.henderson.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of hostilities the UK and the US would continue cooperating, and in 1867 Cuba under much pressure from the two nations gave up its trade.

==United States involvement==
{{main|African Slave Trade Patrol}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

The [[United States Constitution]] of 1787 had protected the importation of [[slave]]s for twenty years. The Pennsylvania Abolition Society held its first meeting at the temporary Capital, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in 1794. On 7 April 1798, the fifth Congress passed an Act that imposed a three-hundred dollars per slave penalty on persons convicted of performing the illegal ''importation of slaves''. It was an indication of the type of behaviour and course of events soon to become commonplace in the Congress.

On Thursday, 12 December 1805, in the ninth Congress, Senator Stephen Roe Bradley of the State of [[Vermont]] gave notice that he should, on Monday next, move for leave to bring in a bill to prohibit the importation of ''certain persons'' therein described "into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, from and after the first day of January," which will be "in the year of our Lord 1808."  His words would be repeated many times by the legislators in the ninth Congress. The ''certain persons'' were described as being [[slaves]] on Monday, 16 December 1805.

Wary of offending the slaveholders to the least degree, the Senate amended the proposed Senatorial Act, then passed it to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] whereat it became meticulously scrutinised and, figuratively, poked and prodded. Cautiously, ever mindful of not inciting the wrath of slaveholders, members of the House produced a bill which would explain the Senatorial Act. The two measures were bound together, with the House bill being called ''H R 77'' and the Senate Act being called ''An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, from and after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord, 1808.''  The bond measure also regulated the [[coastwise slave trade]]. The bond measure was placed before President [[Thomas Jefferson]] on 2 March 1807 for his approbation.

The 1807 Act of Congress was modified and supplemented by the Fifteenth Congress. The importation of slaves into the United States was called "piracy" by an Act of Congress that punctuated the [[era of good feeling]] in 1819. Any citizen of the United States found guilty of such "piracy" might be given the death penalty. The role of the Navy was expanded to include patrols off the coasts of Cuba and South America. The naval activities in the western Atlantic bore the name of ''The African Slave Trade Patrol of 1820–61''. The ''blockade of Africa'' was still being performed in the eastern Atlantic at the same time.

===Africa Squadron operations===
{{main|Africa Squadron}}

American naval officer [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Calbraith Perry]] was the executive officer aboard {{HMS|Cyane|1806|2}} in 1819, which had escorted the ''Elizabeth'', whose passengers included former slaves moving from the United States to Africa. President James Monroe had the Secretary of the Navy order the American vessel to convoy the ''Elizabeth'' to Africa with the first contingent of freed slaves that the [[American Colonization Society]] was resettling there. Of the 86 black emigrants sailing on the Elizabeth, only about one-third were men; the rest were women and children. In 1821, Perry commanded [[USS Shark (1821)|''Shark'']] in the Africa Squadron. [[USS Alligator (1820)|''Alligator'']] under the command of Lieutenant [[Robert F. Stockton]] was also in the African Squadron in 1821 and captured several slavers. Lieutenant Stockton also convinced the local African chief to relinquish land around [[Cape Mesurado]] about which [[Liberia]] grew. Stockton became the commander of the US Navy's first screw-propelled steamer, the [[USS Princeton (1843)|''Princeton'']], in 1843.

On 26 and 27 November 1842, aboard the [[USS Somers (1842)|''Somers'']] in the African Squadron, commander [[Alexander Slidell Mackenzie]] ordered the arrest of three crewmen who were plotting to take control of the ship. The three crewmen were convicted; they were hanged on 1 December. This is the only occurrence of Maritime Mutiny at Law in the history of the United States Navy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Commodore Perry was placed in command of the African Squadron in 1843. Ships which captured slavers while deployed with the African Squadron include [[USS Yorktown (1839)|''Yorktown'']], [[USS Constellation (1797)|''Constellation'']], and the second [[USS Constellation (1854)|''Constellation'']], which captured ''Cora'' on 26 September 1860, with 705 Africans on board. The first [[USS San Jacinto (1850)|''San Jacinto'']] captured the brig ''Storm King'' on 8 August 1860, off the mouth of the [[Congo River]], with 616 Africans on board. In her final act, [[USS Constitution|''Constitution'']] captured H.N. ''Gambrill'' in 1853.

The Navy attempted to intercept slave ships from 1808 (or 1809) to 1866. A small number of ships were intercepted; some of those ships were carrying Africans destined to be sold into [[slavery]], while other suspected ships which had none on board were captured and escorted away from the coast of Africa. 

===Black Ivory===

The [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 created a great demand for more slaves to work in the vast new area. [[Jean Lafitte]] was a pirate who brought many slaves to the United States and sold them through an organised system established at [[New Orleans]] that included many very respectable merchants from the vicinity. After he helped [[Andrew Jackson]] during the [[War of 1812]], President [[James Madison]] issued a proclamation early in 1815 granting him and his men pardons for their misdeeds.

The United States Navy Africa Squadron, [[Brazil Squadron]] and the [[Home Squadron]] was assigned the task of intercepting the ships which were bringing Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the slave markets where ''black ivory'' found numerous customers. Since the War for Independence had been costly, no American warships were constructed between 1783 and 1795. The Navy Department was created on 30 April 1798, four years after President [[George Washington]] had communicated with Congress and expressed his alarm at the outrageous behaviour of Algeria. On 27 March 1794, following communication with President Washington, Congress authorised the purchase or construction of six frigates. These ships included the first [[USS Constellation (1797)|''Constellation'']], launched 7 September 1797 and [[USS Constitution|''Constitution'']], a ship that would be briefly employed in the African Squadron. Few new ships were built in the United States after 1801 until [[USS Guerriere (1814)|''Guerriere'']] was launched on 20 June 1814. It proved to be an effective warship in the War with the [[Barbary Pirates]] in 1815.

In its early efforts to enforce the law, the Navy used the ports of Charleston, SC and Savannah, GA from 1808 or 1809 to 1812 as home ports for several ships patrolling the Atlantic ocean in that area; however, USS ''Chesapeake'' sailed off the west coast of Africa early in 1813. The Navy created the African Squadron for the purpose of intercepting ships with "black ivory" on board; however, very few ships were operating together at any one time, which meant that the "blockade of Africa" was ineffective. More important tasks such as the War of 1812, the ongoing troubles with the [[Barbary Pirates]], the extermination of the pirates in the [[West Indies]] from 1819 to 1827, the protection of American shipping in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of [[Peru]] in the 1830s, the War with [[Mexico]] in the 1840s, the voyages to Japan in the 1850s, and transporting of diplomats to other nations left little capability available for use in the African Squadron. Nevertheless, some noteworthy events involving ships while they were assigned to the African Squadron did occur.

'''Bright green environmentalism''' is an ideology based on the belief that the convergence of [[technological change]] and [[social innovation]] provides the most successful path to [[sustainable development]].

The term ''bright green'', coined in 2003 by writer [[Alex Steffen]], refers to the fast-growing new wing of [[environmentalism]], distinct from traditional forms.&lt;ref name="ref_Newman"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=l7e9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = Green Ethics and Philosophy: An A-to-Z Guide |isbn=9781412996877 | page=39 | editor-last = Newman | editor-first = Julie | publisher=SAGE Publications | date = 3 May 2011 | access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steffen |first=Alex |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//001000.html |title=Tools, Models and Ideas for Building a Bright Green Future: Reports from the Team |publisher=Worldchanging |date=August 6, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101224127/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/001000.html |archive-date=2015-01-01 |accessdate=3 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bright green environmentalism aims to provide prosperity in an ecologically sustainable way through the use of new technologies and improved design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=4834 Green schools show New Haven students the light] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015193415/http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=4834 |date=October 15, 2006 }}{{spaced ndash}}[[The Yale Herald]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark greens, light greens and bright greens==
[[Alex Steffen]] describes contemporary [[environmentalist]]s as being split into three groups, ''dark'', ''light'', and ''bright'' greens.&lt;ref name=Steffen,2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Steffen |first=Alex |title=Bright Green, Light Green, Dark Green, Gray: The New Environmental Spectrum |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009499.html |work=Worldchanging |accessdate=3 October 2016 |date=27 Feb 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112194947/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009499.html |archive-date=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Colors of green.png|thumbnail|Colors of the Greens]]

''Light greens'' see protecting the environment first and foremost as a personal responsibility. They fall in on the [[Activism#Transformational activism|transformational activist]] end of the spectrum, but light greens do not emphasize environmentalism as a distinct political ideology, or even seek fundamental [[reformism|political reform]]. Instead they often focus on environmentalism as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] choice.&lt;ref name=Steffen,2009 /&gt; The motto "Green is the new black" sums up this way of thinking, for many.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/17/style/feco.php Eco-friendly: Why green is the new black – International Herald Tribune&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from the term ''lite green'', which some environmentalists use to describe products or practices they believe are [[greenwash]]ing.

In contrast, ''dark greens'' believe that environmental problems are an inherent part of industrialized civilization, and seek [[Political radicalism|radical political change]]. Dark greens believe that currently and historically dominant political ideologies (sometimes referred to as [[industrialism]]) inevitably lead to [[consumerism]], [[overconsumption]], [[waste]], [[Social alienation|alienation]] from nature and [[resource depletion]]. Dark greens claim this is caused by the emphasis on [[economic growth]] that exists within all existing ideologies, a tendency referred to as ''growth mania''. The dark green brand of environmentalism is associated with ideas of [[ecocentrism]], [[deep ecology]], [[degrowth]], [[anti-consumerism]], [[post-materialism]], [[holism]], the [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]], as well as support for a [[Human population control|reduction in human numbers]] and/or a [[anarcho-primitivism|relinquishment of technology]] to reduce humanity's effect on the [[biosphere]].

More recently, ''bright greens'' emerged as a group of environmentalists who believe that radical changes are needed in the economic and political operation of society in order to make it sustainable, but that better designs, new technologies and more widely distributed social innovations are the means to make those changes—and that society can neither stop nor protest its way to [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007073.html |title=Don't Just Be the Change, Mass-Produce It |publisher=World Changing |date=September 12, 2007 |accessdate=3 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907215325/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007073.html |archive-date=2015-09-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Ross Robertson writes, {{quote|[B]right green environmentalism is less about the problems and limitations we need to overcome than the "tools, models, and ideas" that already exist for overcoming them. It forgoes the bleakness of protest and dissent for the energizing confidence of constructive solutions.&lt;ref name="ref_Robertson"/&gt;}}

==International perspective==
While bright green environmentalism is an intellectual current among North American environmentalists (with a number of businesses, [[blog]]s, [[NGO]]s and even governments now explicitly calling themselves ''bright green''—for instance, the City of Vancouver's strategic planning document is called "Vancouver 2020: A Bright Green Future"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010647.html |title=Vancouver Makes a Bright Green Future its Official Goal |publisher=Worldchanging |date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=3 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218195802/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010647.html |archive-date=2014-02-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), it is in Northern Europe, especially Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, that the idea of bright green environmentalism has become most widespread and most widely discussed. For instance, the official technology showcase and business expo for the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] in [[Copenhagen]] is called ''Bright Green'' in reference to this idea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brightgreen.dk/ |title=Technologies for Sustainable Growth – Bright Green – DI |publisher=Brightgreen.dk |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Danish youth [[climate activism]] movement is called ''Bright Green Youth''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3724">'''CONVIVIR''' (an acronym for ''Servicios Especiales de Vigilancia y Seguridad Privada'' ("Special vigilance and private security services") that means "Vivir en armonía" in Spanish) was a national program of cooperative [[neighbourhood watch]] groups created by a February 11, 1994 decree of Colombia's [[Ministry of National Defense (Colombia)|Ministry of National Defense]] and a law passed in the Colombian Congress, in response to growing guerrilla activity. Authorized during the government of [[César Gaviria]] but mainly developed during the administration of [[Ernesto Samper Pizano]] (1994-1998), the CONVIVIR groups quickly became controversial as it was considered to represent something of a revival of the [[Law 48 of 1968]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} 

Members of some former paramilitary groups transitioned into CONVIVIR, where they were joined by newer recruits and victims of guerrilla aggression, while others, such as the [[Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Córdoba and Urabá|ACCU]], remained operating independently. The then governor of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Álvaro Uribe|Álvaro Uribe Velez]] (who later became President of Colombia), whose father had been killed by the FARC during a kidnapping attempt in 1983, gained notoriety for his open support and promotion of the CONVIVIR at the time.

Reports argued that some CONVIVIR groups achieved results in providing security to communities and intelligence coordination to [[Military of Colombia|military forces]], but apparently numerous members committed abuses against civilians, without a serious oversight over their operations and organization. In 1998, [[HRW]] stated that "we have received credible information that indicated that the CONVIVIR groups of the Middle Magdalena and of the [[Cesar Department|southern Cesar]] regions were directed by known paramilitaries and had threatened to assassinate Colombians that were considered as guerrilla sympathizers or which rejected joining the cooperative groups".&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/spanish/inf_anual/1998/colombia.html Colombia 1997 Events], par.1&lt;/ref&gt; 

After much political debate, a November 1997 decision of Colombia's Constitutional Court stated that CONVIVIR members could not gather intelligence information and could not employ military grade weapons. Other restrictions included increasing legal supervision, and in early 1998 dozens of former CONVIVIR groups had their licenses revoked, because they did not turn in their weapons and withheld information about their personnel. Due to these measures, some gradually turned in their weapons and phased themselves out. 237 of the restricted weapons were returned to authorities by the end of 1997. Other members did not comply and later joined existing [[paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitary]] groups.
&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch (1998), [https://www.hrw.org/spanish/informes/1998/guerra3C.html Guerra sin cuartel], par.8&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2007 U.S. indictment against the [[Chiquita Brands International]] fruit company, a number of payments to the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]] passed through an "intermediary" Convivir group which operated in the Urabá region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB217/index.htm |title=DOCUMENTS IMPLICATE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN CHIQUITA TERROR SCANDAL|author= [[National Security Archive]] |work=Electronic Briefing Book No. 217|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">The '''Communications Data Bill''' was intended to create powers to collect data concerning people's phone, e-mail and web-browsing habits for [[mass surveillance]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[government database]] would have included telephone numbers dialed, the websites visited and addresses to which e-mails are sent but not the text of e-mails or recorded telephone conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Concern over giant database idea  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7671046.stm |quote=The government's terror watchdog has expressed concern about proposals for a giant database to store details of all phone calls, e-mails and internet use. |work=[[BBC]] |date=October 15, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since October 2007 [[telecommunication companies]] have been required to keep records of phone calls and text messages for twelve months. The bill would have extended the coverage to Internet website visited, email messages, and [[VOIP]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Storm over Big Brother database |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/exclusive-storm-over-big-brother-database-961388.html |quote=The controversial measure will be included as a way of combating terrorism in the Data Communications Bill, which is to be introduced in the Queen's Speech in December.

[[Chris Huhne]], Liberal Democrat Home affairs spokesman said at the time: "The government's [[Orwellian]] plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Giant database plan 'Orwellian'  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7671046.stm |quote=Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said: "The government's Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying."

The plans were not completed during the Labour administration, but intentions to gain access to more communications data lived on under the coalition elected in 2010 as the [[Communications Capabilities Development Programme]] run by the [[Home Office]]'s [[Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism]]. In 2012, a new [[Draft Communications Data Bill]] was published.

'''Coronelism''', from the term ''Coronelismo'' ({{IPA-pt|koɾoneˈlismu}}) was the Brazilian [[political machine]] during the [[History of Brazil (1889&amp;ndash;1930)|Old Republic]] (1889&amp;ndash;1930), also known as the "rule of the coronels", responsible for the centralization of the political power in the hands of a locally dominant [[oligarchy|oligarch]], known as a ''coronel'', who would dispense favors in return for loyalty.

The patron-client political machines of the countryside enabled agrarian oligarchs, especially [[coffee]] planters in the dominant state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] to dominate state structures to their advantage, particularly the weak central state structures that effectively devolved power to local agrarian oligarchies.

In time, growing trade, commerce, and industry in São Paulo state would serve to undermine the domination of the republic's politics by the São Paulo landed gentry (dominated by the coffee industry) and [[Minas Gerais]] (dominated by dairy interests)&amp;mdash;known then by observers as the politics of ''[[Café com leite politics|café com leite]]'' ("coffee with milk"). Under [[Getúlio Vargas]], Brazil moved toward a more centralized state structure that has served to regularize and modernize state governments, moving toward [[universal suffrage]] and [[secret ballot]]s, gradually freeing Brazilian politics from the grips of ''coronelismo''. However, the legacy of the oligarchies is still strongly visible in what is described as Neo-Coronelism or electronic coronelism. Brazilian politics is still known for being highly patrimonial, oligarchic, and personalistic.

In the administration of [[Government of Australia|government in Australia]], a '''departmental secretary''' (or just '''Secretary''') is the most senior [[public servant]] of a [[Commonwealth of Australia|Commonwealth]] or [[States and territories of Australia|state]] [[government department]], charged with leading the department on a day-to-day basis.

==Role==
A departmental secretary is the non-political non-elected public servant heads (and "responsible officers") of government departments, who generally hold their position for a number of years.&lt;ref name=dpmcRudd20090813/&gt; A departmental secretary works closely with the elected [[Minister (government)|government minister]] that oversees the Commonwealth [[List of Australian Commonwealth Government entities|department]] or state government department in order to bring about policy and program initiatives that the government of day was elected to achieve. A departmental secretary works with other departments and agencies to ensure the delivery of services and programs within the nominated area of responsibility.

The secretary is also known as the chief executive of the department; the position is equivalent to the [[Permanent Secretary]] of a government department in the [[United Kingdom]], and similar to [[director general]] in some non-Commonwealth countries, or (very roughly) [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) in a private company.

In the Australian government, Secretaries are the responsible officers for departments, meaning that they are answerable to the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] for ensuring that the department performs the functions assigned to it and spends money appropriately, as granted by the Parliament. Secretaries are frequently called for questioning by the [[Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit]], the [[Australian House of Representatives committees|House of Representatives committees]] and the [[Australian Senate committees|Senate committees]].

===Appointment and termination===
The {{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|psa1999152|Public Service Act, 1999}} requires the [[Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Secretary]] of the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] to provide a report to the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the day about the suitability of potential candidates as departmental secretary.

Since the removal of [[tenure]] under Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]], departmental secretaries are generally aware that while dismissals are not common, following a change of government, failure to re-appoint a secretary is certainly a frequent occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theconversation.com/abbott-and-the-public-service-where-now-on-department-heads-18465 |author=Podger, Andrew |work=The Conversation |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=10 November 2013 |publisher=The Conversation Media Group |title=Abbott and the public service: where now on department heads? }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|first Rudd government]], secretaries were appointed for a five-year term; prior to this a term of three years was common.&lt;ref name=dpmcHoward20020118&gt;{{cite press release|author=Howard, John |authorlink=John Howard |title=Senior appointments: Departmental secretaries |date=18 January 2002 |accessdate=10 November 2013 |work=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] |publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]] |url=http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=12178 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110115014/http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=12178 |archivedate=10 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[Howard Government#Second term: 1998–2001|Howard government]] sought to remove [[Paul Barratt]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} as Secretary of the Department of Defence after Barratt fell out of favour with his [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Waterford, Jack|authorlink=Jack Waterford|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/uploads/File/pdf/EurekaStreetClassic/Vol9No7.pdf|format=PDF|volume=9|number=7|page=7|journal=[[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]]|date=September 1999|title=Defence losing its moorings|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being offered a [[diplomat|diplomatic post]], Barratt refused to vacate the role and commenced legal action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s42153.htm|format=transcript|work=[[PM (ABC Radio)]]|location=Australia|author1=Colvin, Mark|authorlink1=Mark Colvin|author2=Epstein, Rafael|date=6 August 1999|accessdate=10 November 2013|title=Defence dismissal goes to court}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming [[unfair dismissal]] and that the government had failed to follow [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Barratt |first=Paul |interviewer=[[Kerry O'Brien (journalist)|Kerry O'Brien]] |title=Paul Barratt returns to work |publisher =[[ABC1|ABC TV]] |date=19 August 1999 |work=730 |accessdate=10 November 2013|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s45176.htm|type=Interview: transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barratt had a temporary [[stay of execution|stay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s39406.htm|format=transcript|work=[[AM (ABC Radio)]]|location=Australia|author=Reynolds, Fiona|date=28 July 1999|accessdate=10 November 2013|title=Defence head gains injunction}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was dismissed within 14 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s48205.htm|format=transcript|work=[[PM (ABC Radio)]]|location=Australia|author1=Colvin, Mark|authorlink1=Mark Colvin|author2=Reynolds, Fiona|date=31 August 1999|accessdate=10 November 2013|title=Barratt sacked}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently lost, on appeal in the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s109519.htm|format=transcript|work=[[PM (ABC Radio)]]|location=Australia|author1=Colvin, Mark|authorlink1=Mark Colvin|author2=Reynolds, Fiona|date=10 March 2000|accessdate=10 November 2013|title=Barrett loses appeal against dismissal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[E-governance]]''' can be understood as the application of [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) with the purpose of providing [[Public service|government services]] online, as well as exchange information between the government and a variety of recipients, citizens, business’, and also other government. It is meant to be an easier and more contemporary alternative to the ways that people have always done it.

==Transactional governance==
E-Governance has many aspects, and "branches". One branch of e-gov. is transactional governance. The purpose of this part is to carry out or conduct business, negotiations, activities, and many other things and reach a conclusion or settlement with the other party. According to the academic journal Government Information Quarterly, it has been loosely defined as anything that the citizens, in pursuit of its governance, that is conducted over a computer-mediated network. E-gov systems are intertwined with traditional public management information systems, which have been found to be quite different from anything in the private sector due to differences in design, purpose, use, organizational role, and assessment criteria. "Transactional Governance encompasses all forms of managerial governance, including selective incentives and monitoring capacity", according to the academic journal Effects of Transactional and Transformational Governance on Academic Teaching.

==Performance==
In this growing era of technology we have moved to more electronic ways of performing government tasks or what we would call e-governance. In this transition to e-governance the main focus is to make sure that responsiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness is sustained at a high level.

In order to sustain a high level of output (responsiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness) we are tuning our focus to developing a  performance management system for efficient and effective service delivery, which continuously measures and monitors service response performance.
The development of these management systems will improve public institutions and their service responses a great deal as well as making it much more accessible for the public to use to their advantage.

Tony Bovair states "[c]learly, there are a number of difficult choices facing governments in deciding their priorities in e-government and e-governance. For example, increased efficiency might be gained if more communications could be made available only through telephone and internet connections. However, this could disadvantage those people without telephone or internet access. Again, e-governance mechanisms such as e-referenda Could improve the interactive participation of citizens and other stakeholders in government decision-making but it could also slow down decision making processes and could give rise to unrepresentative pressures being placed on governments and parliaments if security systems are not sufficiently watertight to eliminate bogus or multiple voting. In order to deal with this potential problem, governments will need to consider ways of setting priorities between the goals of e-government and e-governance. However, this will be problematic, both because the explicit setting of priorities is always difficult in a political setting and also because the goals of e-government and e-governance are so closely interrelated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|citeseerx = 10.1.1.107.9861|title=SEMINAR-VISION, RESPONSIVENESS AND MEASUREMENT OECD, PARIS, MARCH 11-12, 2002. Session 2: E-government Measurement and Evaluation|work=OECD E-GOVERNMENT PROJECT| first = Tony | last = Bovaird | location = Diss | publisher = [[University of the West of England]] | date = 2002 | pages = 1–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizen involvement==
Understanding the involvement and interaction between government and its citizens through the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is crucial when discussing E-governance in the United States. Holden defines e-government as “the delivery of government services and information electronically 24 hours per day, seven days per week.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holden | first1 = S. J. | first2 = D. D. | last2 = Norris | first3 = P. E. | last3 = Fletcher | date = 2003 | title = Electronic government at the local level: Progress to date and future issues | journal = Public Performance and Management Review | issue = 36 | pages = 325–344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Internet boom and the implementation of governmental portals and websites during the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, people in the United States now have the ability to access any number of programs online from e-voting and health care to tax returns and even accessing governmental data that was not previously available creating a more transparent and accountable face to the government.

===Three models of interaction in e-government===
According to Andrew Chadwick and Christopher May in their article, ''Interaction between States and Citizens in the Age of the Internet: “e-Government” in the United States, Britain, and the European Union'', there are three major models of interaction associated with e-government, the managerial, the consultative and the participatory.&lt;ref name=Chadwick&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chadwick | first1 = Andrew | first2 = Christopher | last2 = May | title = Interaction between States and Citizens in the Age of the Internet: 'e-Government' in the United States, Britain, and the European Union | journal = Governance | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | date = April 2003 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0491.00216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although at any given time these models of interaction can stand alone as the ideal form of involvement between the parties, more often than not, they overlap and provide multiple forms of interaction. To begin, the managerial model stresses a vertical flow of information from the government to its citizens. This model is concerned with efficiency, especially with the increase in speed when delivering information and services, as well as a reduction of the costs.&lt;ref name=Chadwick/&gt; This model establishes a client type relationship between the government and its citizens. Second, the consultative model also stresses vertical information flow but is more concerned with responding to needs of societal interest as expressed electronically by the citizens. This includes online elections, and other input from voters and requires an enormous amount of citizen involvement.&lt;ref name=Chadwick/&gt; The participatory model is the final and most interactive of the three major models of involvement between government and citizens. Unlike the other two, the participatory model strives for horizontal and multi directional flow of information that creates a cyber society that can be more effective for the general public. This model becomes relevant when universal access and widespread usage of the technology have become part of the norm in terms of government-citizen interaction.&lt;ref name=Chadwick/&gt; Although these models show some potential ways for citizen and government interaction, there are many benefits and flaws with the actual implementation of e-government and how it can affect people involved in the political process in the United States.

==Benefits to citizen involvement==
There are many benefits associated with e-governance in the United States and the involvement of citizens in the process. To begin, due to e-governance relevant information is more readily available to the public, while governmental programs become less expensive and more efficient. This allows most citizens to become part of the political process without leaving the comfort of their home. This increases the number of people willing to be involved in democracy and voice their opinions due to the instant access to the government. Another benefit in citizen involvement in e-government is building trust between the citizens and the state. Over the past decades there has been a decline in citizens overall trust in the government. With such easy access to information, government programs and officials, e-government provides the perfect platform to start building the trust between these two parties.

==Potential issues with citizen involvement==
There are also a few potential issues with citizen involvement associated with e-government. The first and most difficult is a concept known as the [[digital divide]], as discussed by Baird, Zellin and Booker, the authors of ''Is There A "Digital Divide" In The Provision Of E-Government Services at The County Level In the United States''.&lt;ref name=Baird&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baird | first1 = Jane | first2 = Robert C., II | last2 = Zellin | first3 = Queen Esther | last3 = Booker | title = Is There A ‘Digital Divide’ In The Provision Of E-Government Services At The County Level In The United States? | journal = Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | date = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the idea that some Americans are not involved in the political process and e-government due to lack of access to technology, lack of technical skills, or due to some financial constraint.&lt;ref name=Baird/&gt; This is extremely problematic due to the necessity of e-government to have input from all voters and citizens, not just specific groups, for it to be fully effective. It is of critical importance for everyone to be able to voice his or her opinions equally in order to maintain democratic integrity.
Another major issue having to do with citizen involvement stems from problems with the actual technology used for e-governance and the potential that it will not always function as it is supposed to. A good example of this was the problems with the healthcare.gov website that was established to help citizens with healthcare information and enrollment during the Obama Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Goldstein | first1 = Amy | first2 = Juliet | last2 = Eilperin | first3 = Lena H. | last3 = Sun | title = Troubled HealthCare.gov Unlikely to Work Fully by End of November | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | origyear = 13 November 2013 | date = 18 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the technology initially did not consistently work, this limited the initial effectiveness of the program and ultimately made it more difficult instead of more efficient. The website has since been modified in the attempt to continue providing this healthcare e-governance service.

==Information dispersal and public engagement==
Information dispersal and public engagement are key to the success of e-governance. However, the process of successfully engaging the public is quite complex. Due to the wide range of internet advancements in recent years, the coordination of public engagement is difficult. Yet, the common desire to stay informed and find accessible methods to govern remains crucial.

For example, the current Obama administration has been working to develop a more democratically engaged society. There has been much controversy over the administration's [[Affordable Care Act]]. With this piece of legislation, Healthcare.gov was created to provide a source for Americans to buy health insurance. Although this website has been unsuccessful thus far, it is a prime example of how the United States government can relay information as well as provide its services via the internet. Healthcare.gov is made to be a marketplace for healthcare insurance providers. The website offers groundwork for Americans to shop for coverage at lower costs or possibly find undeniable coverage. Depending on the success of the website, it may be one of the most effective, or at least most historic, government technological establishments in American history.

==EGov prospective future==
The focus of technological implementation during each generation has faced a new and difficult sets of challenges. Previously Size and cost and function caused there to be a small focused use of computers. As computers became cost efficient and versatile there was difficulty dealing with the management of the new technology. Increasingly, privacy and security are becoming important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dawes | first = S. S. | date = 2008 | title = The Evolution and Continuing Challenges of E-Governance | journal = [[Public Administration Review]] | volume = 68 | pages = S86–S102 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00981.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since technology permeates our society and all of our lives are within the digital spectrum a whole new dimension of vulnerabilities is now needing to be addressed.

Currently the focus majority of the government application has been the increase in efficiency and information and communication technologies. In the future this trend will continue. Recently increased emphasis has been placed in democratic engagement.

As new technology is developed new rules and policies have to be crafted, and old policies adapted, each time adding another layer of complexity to integration and potentially mitigating benefits from embracing new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chadwick | first = A. | date = 2003 | title = Bringing e-democracy back in: Why it matters for future research on e-governance | journal = [[Social Science Computer Review]] | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–455 | doi=10.1177/0894439303256372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many government agencies have struggled to adjust to the adoption of digital data. Other agencies struggle to control the flow of information such as security and police organizations not sharing information, and the controversial gathering of too much information. If e-governance in the United States is to advance the demand more sophisticated technological solutions for encryption, information sharing, and interactive communication will need to be addressed. Eventually E- government will just be government as the use of technology is the norm.

==Controversies==
===Pro-death penalty campaign===
[[File:Green ad for death penalty in Mexico.jpg|right|thumb|A Green Party billboard promoting the restoration of the death penalty&lt;ref name=VoA&gt;{{Citation

}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2008, the PVEM initiated an advertising campaign in favor of reintroducing the [[Capital punishment in Mexico|death penalty in Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2008/12/death-penalty-a.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=La Plaza | date=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the [[European Green Party]]'s withdrawal of recognition of the PVEM as a legitimate green party.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Johnson, [http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article24731080.html For Mexico's Ecologist Green Party, 'green' mostly means money, not environment], McClatchy Newspapers (June 18, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-LGBT rights factions===
During an interview, PVE candidate [[Gamaliel Ramirez]] verbally attacked an openly gay candidate for Guadalajara mayor and called for criminal laws against homosexuality to be established. In the following days, Ramirez issued a written apology after the party expressed disappointment at his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |newspaper=Guadalajara Reporter |title=Green Party rival crossed the line, says gay candidate |date=May 16, 2009 |url=http://guadalajarareporter.com/news-mainmenu-82/guadalajara/24457-jalisco-elections-partido-social-democratica-gay-candidate.html |accessdate=November 27, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222124246/http://guadalajarareporter.com/news-mainmenu-82/guadalajara/24457-jalisco-elections-partido-social-democratica-gay-candidate.html |archivedate=22 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the party has pledged to support LGBT rights issues, 3 representatives abstained from a vote on [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City granting legal recognition to same-sex couples]].

===Accusations of corruption and nepotism===

The PVEM is also widely criticized because its current leader, [[Jorge Emilio González Martínez]], was appointed for being the son of former leader [[Jorge González Torres]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Barnard|title=Corruption inferences and the Green Party of Mexico|url=http://mexidata.info/id143.html|website=MexiData.info|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for supporting the political and business agenda of Mexican businessman [[Víctor González Torres]], owner of the ''Farmacias Similares'' drugstore franchise and González Martínez's uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/03/02/la-ley-simi-y-las-farmaceuticas|title=Miguel Ángel Toscano, dos años de escándalos sanitarios en la Cofepris|language=es-MX|access-date=2016-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110243/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/03/02/la-ley-simi-y-las-farmaceuticas|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unlawful political advertising in movie theaters===
In January 2015, the [[National Electoral Institute]] (INE) ordered the PVEM and theater chains [[Cinemex]] and [[Cinépolis]] to cease airing PVEM advertisements, on the grounds of fairness in electoral contests. When the PVEM and the theaters did not comply, the INE imposed a fine of $35 million on the PVEM and $7 million on both theater chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com.mx/cuanto-pagara-pvem-al-ine-por-spot-cien-minutos/|title=Partido Verde, Cinemex y Cinépolis: crónica de una multa anunciada • Forbes México|first=Forbes|last=Staff|date=3 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Falsifiers of History''''' was a book published by the [[Soviet Information Bureau]], edited and partially re-written by [[Joseph Stalin]], in response to documents made public in January 1948 regarding German–Soviet relations before and after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]].

==Background on ''Nazi–Soviet Relations'' documents==
In 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi–Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="henig67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection included documents from, and about conversations with, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] officials [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|during negotiations regarding the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], a 1939 agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, along with the related [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement]].&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also included publication of the "Secret Additional Protocol" of that Pact,&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; which divided eastern Europe into "[[spheres of influence]]" between Germany and the Soviet Union,&lt;ref name="mrtext"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html ''Text of the Nazi–Soviet Non-Aggression Pact'']&lt;/ref&gt; executed weeks before each country's subsequent [[invasion of Poland]].  The collection further contained "Secret Supplementary Protocols" to agreements between the countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=101–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussions regarding the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|1940 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=131–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming an Axis Power]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=226–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other German–Soviet negotiations and discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=80–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''Falsifiers'' was published in response to the documents made public in ''Nazi–Soviet Relations''.&lt;ref name="henig67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts 2002 96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Stalin]] became personally involved in editing the work after receiving a translation of the ''Nazi–Soviet Relations'' document collection.  On February 3, 1948, Stalin was presented with a typescript titled ''Reply to Slanderers''.  Stalin changed the title to ''Falsifiers of History (Historical Reports)''.  Stalin personally edited the book, including striking and re-writing whole sections by handwritten modification.&lt;ref name="roberts98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Falsifiers'' originally appeared as a series of articles in ''[[Pravda]]'' in February 1948.&lt;ref name="Roberts 2002 96"/&gt;  It was subsequently published in numerous languages and distributed worldwide.&lt;ref name="roberts97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p= 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Separately, the Soviet Union later published a collection of documents it captured from German archives titled ''Documents and Materials Relating to the Eve of the Second World War''.&lt;ref name="roberts100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and issues==
''Falsifiers'' pointedly ignored [[Soviet–German relations before 1941|Soviet relations with Germany]], making no attempt to directly counter or deal with the documents published in ''Nazi–Soviet Relations''.&lt;ref name="roberts100"/&gt; Rather, the main theme of the booklet is Western culpability for the outbreak of war in 1939.&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt; It argues that "Western powers" aided Nazi rearmament and aggression, including that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward.&lt;ref name="henig67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;  It depicted the Soviet Union as striving to negotiate a collective security against Hitler, while being thwarted by double-dealing Anglo–French appeasers who, despite appearances, had no intention of a Soviet alliance and were secretly negotiating with Berlin.&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;

''Falsifiers'' casts the [[Munich agreement]], not just as Anglo–French short-sightedness or cowardice, but as a "secret" agreement that was "a highly important phase in their policy aimed at goading the Hitlerite aggressors against the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taubert|2003|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Falsifiers'' also included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's offer to divide the world,&lt;ref name="nekrich202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[German–Soviet Axis talks|without mentioning the Soviet counteroffer to Germany's offer to the Soviets to join the Axis]].&lt;ref name="nekrich203"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parties never reached agreement on Axis entry.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Roberts "Stalin's wars: from World War to Cold War, 1939-1953" Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-300-11204-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-11204-7}}, p. 57-59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stalin's account in ''Falsifiers'' was repeated in Soviet historical texts [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|until the Soviet Union's dissolution]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202"/&gt; Regarding Soviet–German relations after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, ''Falsifiers'' main theme frames Soviet actions as a legitimate attempt to build up an "Eastern front" to defend against inevitable Nazi aggression.&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;

''Falisifiers'' characterization of Western policy as anti-Communist, anti-Soviet, and pro-Nazi had been a prominent theme of Soviet propaganda before the Second World War, and such rhetoric more vigorously reemerged during the Cold War.&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;

==Importance==
Soviet publications before the revelation of documents in ''Nazi–Soviet Relations'' had avoided discussing the Soviet–German pact.&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;  Accordingly, ''Falsifiers'' is novel because it is a first frank Soviet discussion of the German–Soviet pact in a publication.&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;  In addition, because ''Falsifiers'' was personally and extensively edited by Stalin, at the very least, it provides unique insight into the view of events that he was keen to publicize.&lt;ref name="roberts98"/&gt;

The book provides insight into Stalin's thinking and calculations in the autumn of 1940.&lt;ref name="roberts100"/&gt;  In analyzing the text of ''Falsifiers'' surrounding Soviet–German talks regarding the potential entry as the Soviet Union as an [[Axis Power]], historian Geoffrey Roberts argues that there is no reason that Stalin would not have signed a four-power pact if Germany accepted his November offer.&lt;ref name="roberts99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not done for the purpose of giving an objective exposition of historical events, but in order to present a distorted picture of events, to heap lies on the Soviet Union, to slander it and to undermine the  international influence of the Soviet Union as a truly democratic and staunch fighter against aggressive, anti-democratic forces.''

The '''Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969''', U.S. Public Law 91-173, generally referred to as the '''Coal Act''', was passed by the 91st United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|37th President of the United States]] [[Richard Nixon]] on December 30, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2389 |title= Richard Nixon: "Statement on Signing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.," December 30, 1969 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The S. 2917 [[legislation]] created the Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration (MESA), later renamed the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA), as well as a [[National Mine Map Repository]], within the [[Department of the Interior]].

MSHAs responsibilities paralleled those of [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) but addressed underground and [[surface mining]] of [[coal]]. The legislation was more comprehensive and stringent than previous federal laws governing the mining industry. 

The Coal Act required two annual inspections of every surface coal mine and four at every underground coal mine, and dramatically increased federal enforcement powers in [[coal mining|coal mines]]. The Coal Act also required monetary penalties for all violations, and established criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations. The safety standards for all coal mines were strengthened, and health standards were adopted. 

The Coal Act also included specific procedures for the development of improved mandatory health and [[safety standards]], and provided compensation for miners who were totally and permanently disabled by the progressive respiratory disease caused by the inhalation of fine coal dust [[pneumoconiosis]] or "[[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung]]".

In regard to the mine map repository, the Coal Act required that:

"Whenever an operator permanently closes or abandons a coal mine, or temporarily closes a coal mine for a period of more than ninety days, he shall promptly notify the Secretary of such closure. Within sixty days of the permanent closure or abandonment of the mine, or, when the mine is temporarily closed, upon the expiration of a period of ninety days from the date of closure, the operator shall file with the Secretary a copy of the mine map revised and supplemented to the date of the closure." 

Initial enforcement of the law was slow due to understaffed enforcement agencies, a situation which was criticized when the [[Hurricane Creek mine disaster]] occurred a year to the day after passage of the act, killing 38 men in a mine with a long history of violations.&lt;ref name="nyt0101a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Re-check Was Overdue; Mine Where 38 Died Had Record of Safety Risks |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1971-01-01|author=Franklin, Ben A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was updated by the [[Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977|Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977]], Public Law 95-164.

The '''Food Corporation of India''' is an organization created and run by the Government of India.

==Mandate==
The Food Corporation of India (FCI) was set up on 14 January 1965 having its first District Office at [[Thanjavur]] – rice bowl of [[Tamil Nadu]] – and headquarters at [[Chennai]] (The Headquarters later shifted to [[Delhi]]) under the [[List of Indian Federal Legislation|Food Corporations Act 1964]] to implement the following objectives of the National Food Policy :

# Effective price support operations for safeguarding the interests of the poor farmers 
# Distribution of foodgrains throughout the country for [[Public Distribution System]]
# Maintaining satisfactory level of operational and buffer stocks of foodgrains to ensure National Food Security
# Regulate market price to provide foodgrains to consumers at a reliable price

==Statistics==
It is one of the largest corporations in India and probably the largest supply chain management in Asia (Second in world ) .{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It operates through 05 Zonal offices and 24 Regional offices. Each year, the Food Corporation of India purchases roughly 15 to 20 per cent of India's wheat output and 12 to 15 per cent of its rice output. The purchases are made from the farmers at the rates declared by the Govt. of India. This rate is called as MSP (Minimum Support Price). There is no limit for procurement in terms of volume, any quantity can be procured by FCI(Food Corporation of India) provided the stock satisfies FAQ (Fair Average Quality) specifications with respect to FCI.

==Organizational structure==
Food Corporation of India operates through its Depot headed by Manager(Depot). Every district has few depots to cater to the requirement of the district's rural population. The depot reports to District Office, headed by an Assistant General Manager, designated as Area Manager. Assistant General Manager (Quality Control) is also posted who is looking after the QC work. Under Area Manager control, there are Managers to deal with each and every section viz., Depot, Sales, Contracts, Procurement, SL-TL, Movement, Establishment, Quality Control (QC), Operational accounts etc., who consolidate the field level operations and through the area managers' authorization, they transmit the necessary information and periodical statements to Regional Offices of their respective regions. Under Managers are Assistant Grades Level -1, Level -2 and Level - 3 who help managers in day-to-day operations of the organization.

The district office reports to regional offices which are headed by a General Manager, who is in most of the cases from [[Indian Revenue Service]], [[Indian Administrative Service]] /All India Services under deputation. Under his control Deputy General Managers (DGM) who are FCI's officers co-ordinate with daily operations through the Assistant General Managers who were posted in various sections to oversee the functions of district offices units of their particular section. All these officers appraise the general manager periodically on various issues pertaining to district offices of that particular region.

FCI has been divided into 5 zones viz. North, South, East, West &amp; North-East with a Zonal Office in each zone. Each zone is further divided into regions with a regional office in one region. All the Regional Offices are under the control of Zonal Offices which are headed by an Executive Director, who in most of the cases is from [[Indian Administrative Service]] or [[Indian Revenue Service]] under deputation. Under his control three or more than three General Managers co-ordinate with all Regional Offices of their particular zone through subordinate officers like Deputy General Managers and Assistant General Managers dealing with their allotted operational sections in their zone.

All the Zonal Offices are under the control of Headquarters, located at New Delhi, which is headed by Chairman and Managing Director, who is an [[Indian Administrative Service]] of [[Secretary to Government of India|Secretary]] rank on Central Deputation. Headquarters instruct, communicate, consolidate and refine the voluminous information required for the streamlined execution of day-to-day operations and coordinates with [[Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution]] and Food Secretary and various sister corporations like [[Central Warehousing Corporation]], [[Indian Railways]] in formulating food policy or amending the existing policy to suit the emerging challenges in managing Food Security scenario of the nation.

The CMD is a member of the Board of Directors along with Director Finance, Director HR, Director Operations and Director Sales.

==Operations==
The Food Corporation of India procures rice and wheat from farmers through many routes like paddy purchase centres/mill levy/custom milling and stores them in depots. FCI maintains many types of depots like food storage depots and buffer storage complexes and private equity godowns and also implemented latest storage methods of silo storage facilities which are located at Hapur in Uttar Pradesh and Elavur in Tamil Nadu. The stocks are transported throughout India and issued to the state government nominees at the rates declared by the Government of India for further distribution under the Public Distribution System (PDS) for the consumption of the ration card holders. (FCI itself does not directly distribute any stock under PDS, and its operations end at the exit of the stock from its depots).  The difference between the purchase price and sale price, along with internal costs, are reimbursed by the Union Government in the form of food subsidy. At present the annual subsidy is around $10&amp;nbsp;billion. FCI by itself is not a decision-making authority; it does not decide anything about the MSP, imports or exports. It just implements the decisions made by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Ministry of Agriculture.

Food Corporation of India recently ventured into procurement of pulses in various regions from the crop year 2015–16, and pulses are procured at market rate, which is a sharp deviation from its traditional minimum support price-based procurement system.

In 2014, Government of India set up a high-level committee under the chairmanship of Hon'ble Member of Parliament and former Minister of Food and Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution Shri Shanthakumar to recommend viable solutions regarding restructuring and reorienting the role of Food Corporation of India, and the committee submitted its report to the government, and many of the committee recommendations are under various stages of implementation.

'''''Franquin's Last Laugh''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Idées noires''': Dark thoughts}}) is a collection of [[black comedy]] comic strips drawn by [[André Franquin]], written by Franquin and [[Yvan Delporte]]. The one-page stories first appeared frequently in 1977, in the brief run of the ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine supplement, ''Le Trombone illustré''. After this initiative was cancelled, ''Idées noires'' resumed publication in the magazine ''[[Fluide Glacial]]'', upon [[Gotlib]]'s suggestion, where it remained a fixture until 1983.&lt;ref name="Franquin.com-1977"&gt;{{cite web | last =franquin.com | title =Franquin-une vie-1977 | url =http://www.franquin.com/bio/1977.php  }}{{fr_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first album was published in 1981, and a sequel in half-page format was published in 1984.

As the title ''Idées noires'' might suggest, these stories explore depressive and horrific fantasies, all drawn with dramatic use of black on white. Suicide, execution, industrial recklessness, ecological disaster and hunting accidents are some of the themes darkly illustrated in this body of work. It's also notable for its stances against [[anti-nuclear movement|nuclear energy]], the [[death penalty]], game [[hunting]] and [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/franquin_andre.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The series contrasts sharply with Franquin's other comic strips such as ''[[Gaston Lagaffe]]'', ''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'' and the ''[[Marsupilami]]'', although a dark touch occasionally surfaced in other later work such as the ''Gaston Lagaffe'' strip for [[Amnesty International]] (published in ''Cauchemarrants'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cauchemarrants'' is a play on the French terms for "nightmare" (cauchemar) and "funny" (marrants)&lt;/ref&gt; 1979).&lt;ref name=world&gt;{{Cite web|last= The World of Franquin |title=The anarchist as poet|url= http://www.cite-sciences.fr/english/ala_cite/expo/tempo/franquin/pages/anarchist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gaston-amnesty&gt;{{Cite web|last= André Franquin |first=lagaffemegate.free.fr |title=Les Combats de Gaston |url=http://lagaffemegate.free.fr/identite/combatamn.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few pages were translated in [[Kitchen Sink Press|Kitchen Sink]]'s short-lived comics magazine "French Ticklers" under the title "Dark Designs".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lofficier.com/othertransla.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The whole collection was set to be published by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in an English translation by [[Kim Thompson]] in 2013, but publication has been delayed, possibly because of Thompson's death to cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Franquin’s Last Laugh delayed |url=http://spiroureporter.net/2013/04/16/franquins-last-laugh-delayed/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally published in 2018 under the title "Die Laughing".

==In popular culture==

In the [[Belgian Comic Strip Center]] in [[Brussels]] the permanent exhibition brings homage to the pioneers of [[Belgian comics]], among them André Franquin. One of the rooms dedicated to his work is a black, dark tunnel where pages from "Idéés Noires" are exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tento.be/sites/default/files/tijdschrift/pdf/OKV1992/Belgisch%20Centrum%20van%20het%20Beeldverhaal%20Brussel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''German Alexandrovich Lopatin''' ({{lang-ru|Ге́рман Алекса́ндрович Лопа́тин}}; 13 January 1845, in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] &amp;ndash; 26 December 1918, in [[Petrograd]]) was a [[Russia]]n [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolutionary]], journalist and writer. 

[[File:German Lopatin 3.jpg|thumb|G.A. Lopatin]]

==Biography==
Lopatin came from an aristocratic family. He studied physics and mathematics at the [[University of St. Petersburg]], where he graduated in 1866 with a thesis ''On Spontaneous Formation''. This thesis reflected the materialist ideas of the philosophers [[Karl Vogt|Vogt]], [[Ludwig Büchner|Büchner]] and [[Jacob Moleschott|Moleschott]], which were then extremely popular among Russian radicals. 

==Career==
In the course of his studies, Lopatin had become involved in radical student politics. In 1867 he travelled to Italy, hoping to join the revolutionary army of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. Nothing much came of this. On his return to Russia, Lopatin became involved in the populist ('[[narodnik]]') movement. He belonged to the [[Nikolai Ishutin|Ishutin]] Circle. Together with [[Feliks Volkhovsky|F.V. Volkhovsky]], he organised the "One Ruble Society", a group dedicated to educational work and revolutionary propaganda among the common people. 

Lopatin was soon arrested. Exiled to [[Stavropol]] in 1868, he began to study the writings of [[Karl Marx]]. He became one of the first Russian revolutionaries to be strongly influenced by Marxism. Marx and Engels thought highly of him. Under their influence he came to see revolution not so much as a coup to be carried out at will by a minority, but rather as a mass uprising requiring certain 'material preconditions'.

In 1870 Lopatin secretly returned to St. Petersburg and there helped organise the escape of [[Peter Lavrov|P.L. Lavrov]] from banishment. Lopatin escaped to Western Europe soon after. In France he joined the [[First International]] and became a member of its General Council. In the summer of 1870 he visited London, England, where he struck up a friendship with Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] and began work on a translation of volume 1 of Marx' book 'Capital'. This translation was later completed by [[Nikolai Danielson|N.F. Danielson]]. In the winter of the busy and eventful year of 1870, Lopatin returned to Russia, intending to free the respected revolutionary writer [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky|N.G. Chernyshevsky]] from Siberia. However, Lopatin was himself arrested. He escaped from Siberia in 1873 and returned to Western Europe. Lopatin sided with Marx during the latter's conflict with [[Michael Bakunin|Bakunin]], which eventually destroyed the First International. He especially opposed the 'nihilistic' ideology of [[Sergey Nechayev|S.G. Nechaev]], who was then an associate of Bakunin's.

In 1879 Lopatin returned clandestinely to Russia to work with '[[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]]'. When that organisation split the same year, Lopatin sided with '[[The People's Will]]'. However, he was arrested again. In 1883 he escaped from Siberia once more and returned to the West. In Paris he collaborated with Lavrov and other exiles in reviving 'The People's Will', trying to convert it from a [[Blanquist]] conspiratorial organisation into a mass party and arguing that the party should seek to organise the emerging industrial proletariat. Lopatin became a member of the party's Administrative Committee and served as its ''de facto'' leader. He was instrumental in unmasking the secret police agent [[Sergey Degayev|S.P. Degaev]].

However, in October 1884, in the course of yet another daring secret mission to Russia, he was arrested. A large number of addresses were found on him, leading to mass arrests and to the [[Trial of the 21]] in 1887. Lopatin was sentenced to life imprisonment in the notorious [[Shlisselburg Fortress]]. During this incarceration Lopatin's health was seriously compromised. Lopatin was freed during the abortive [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. He sympathised with the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]], but was also respected by the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Social-Democrats]]. Due to his broken health he did not become politically active but settled in Vilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania). He returned to St. Petersburg in 1913 and live in the '[[House of Literati]]'. Lopatin welcomed the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 enthusiastically but opposed the [[October Revolution]].

==Literary works==
Lopatin was also a respected literary figure. In addition to his journalism, he wrote extensive poetry, short stories and an autobiography. Russian writers who praised him included [[Ivan Turgenev|I.S. Turgenev]], [[Gleb Uspensky|G.I. Uspensky]], [[Leo Tolstoy|L.N. Tolstoy]] and [[Maxim Gorky|Maksim Gorky]]. 

German Lopatin died of cancer in 1918.

The '''Green Climate Fund''' ('''GCF''') is a fund established within the framework of the [[UNFCCC]] as an operating entity of the Financial Mechanism to assist developing countries in [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] practices to counter [[climate change]]. The GCF is based in the [[Incheon]], [[South Korea]]. It is governed by a Board of 24 members and supported by a Secretariat.

The objective of the Green Climate Fund is to "support projects, programmes, policies and other activities in developing country Parties using thematic funding windows".&lt;ref name="UNFCCCTrans"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=Transitional Committee for the design of the Green Climate Fund|url=http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/green_climate_fund/items/5869.php|accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended that the Green Climate Fund be the centrepiece of efforts to raise [[Climate Finance]] under the [[UNFCCC]].

According to the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], at the third meeting of the Board in [[Berlin]] in March 2013, members agreed on how to move forward with the fund's Business Model Framework (BMF). They identified the need to assess various options for how nations could access the fund, approaches for involving the private sector, plus ways to measure results and ensure requests for monies are country-driven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/2013/03/news-board-members-sketch-out-an-operational-framework-for-the-green-climate-fund/ NEWS: Board members sketch out an operational framework for the Green Climate Fund], Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network, 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; At the fourth Board meeting in June 2013, [[Hela Cheikhrouhou]], a Tunisian national, was selected to become the Fund's first Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;Green Climate Fund (press release) (2013), [http://www.gcfund.net/fileadmin/00_customer/documents/pdf/Press_release_ED_selection_final.pdf Green Climate Fund Board selects Hela Cheikhrouhou as Executive Director] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705090233/http://www.gcfund.net/fileadmin/00_customer/documents/pdf/Press_release_ED_selection_final.pdf |date=5 July 2013 }}. Retrieved 31 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Cheikhrouhou left the fund in September 2016.{{Citation needed|reason=Missing|date=May 2017}} Ms. Cheikhrouhou was succeeded by Australian national Howard Bamsey, who took office on 10 January 2017. Mr. Bamsey resigned from his position as Executive Director on 4 July 2018, at the completion of the 20th meeting of the Board which was dominated by "challenging and difficult discussions between Board members"[https://www.greenclimate.fund/-/green-climate-fund-b-20-meeting-press-release] without any climate finance being approved. The position of Executive Director is temporarily observed by Javier Manzanares until a replacement is appointed by the Board.

==History==
The [[Copenhagen Accord]], established during the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] ([[COP-15]]) in Copenhagen mentioned the "Copenhagen Green Climate Fund". The fund was formally established during the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Cancun as a fund within the UNFCCC framework.&lt;ref name="Cancunagreement"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=Report of the Conference of the Parties on its sixteenth session, held in Cancun from 29 November to 10 December 2010|url=http://unfccc.int/files/na/application/pdf/07a01-1.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128184032/http://unfccc.int/files/na/application/pdf/07a01-1.pdf|archivedate=28 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its governing instrument was adopted at the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP 17) in [[Durban, South Africa]].&lt;ref name="GCFdurban"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=Green Climate Fund - report of the Transitional Committee |url=http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/durban_nov_2011/decisions/application/pdf/cop17_gcf.pdf|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
During COP-16 in Cancun, the matter of governing the GCF was entrusted to the newly founded Green Climate Fund Board, and the [[World Bank]] was chosen as the temporary trustee.&lt;ref name="Cancunagreement" /&gt; To develop a design for the functioning of the GCF, the "Transitional Committee for the Green Climate Fund" was established in Cancun too. The committee met four times throughout the year 2011, and submitted a report to the 17th COP in Durban, South Africa. Based on this report, the COP decided that the "GCF would become an operating entity of the financial mechanism" of the UNFCCC,&lt;ref name="ENBDurban"&gt;{{cite journal|last=IISD|title=Summary of the Durban Climate Change Conference: 28 November - 11 December 2011|journal=Earth Negotiations Bulletin|date=13 December 2011|volume=12|issue=534|url=http://www.iisd.ca/download/pdf/enb12534e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that on COP-18 in 2012, the necessary rules should be adopted to ensure that the GCF "is accountable to and functions under the guidance of the COP".&lt;ref name="ENBDurban" /&gt; Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] state that without this last minute agreement on a governing instrument for the GCF, the "African COP" would have been considered a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Schalatek, L., Stiftung, H., Nakhooda, S. and Bird, N., February 2011, [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=6149&amp;title=design-green-climate-fund The design of the Green Climate Fund], ''Overseas Development Institute''. Retrieved 7 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the GCF Board was tasked with developing rules and procedures for the disbursement of funds, ensuring that these should be consistent with the national objectives of the countries where projects and programmes will be taking place. The GCF Board was also charged with establishing an independent secretariat and the permanent trustee of the GCF.&lt;ref name="ENBDurban" /&gt;

==Sources of finance==
The Fund has set itself a goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020, which is not an official figure for the size of the Fund itself. Uncertainty over where this money would come from led to the creation of a [[High Level Advisory Group on Climate Financing]] (AGF) by UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] in February 2010. There is no formal connection between AGF and GCF, although its report is one source for debates on "resource mobilisation" for the GCF, an item that will be discussed at the GCF's October 2013 Board meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UN|title=UN Secretary-General's High-level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing (AGF) |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/financeadvisorygroup|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes also remain as to whether the funding target will be based on public sources, or whether "leveraged" private finance will be counted towards the total.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Policy Studies (2013), [http://climatemarkets.org/glossary/green-climate-fund.html Green Climate Fund], ''A Glossary of Climate Finance Terms''. Retrieved 23 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Paris climate agreement chart.png|right|500x500px]]
As at 17 May 2017, a total of US$10.3 billion has been pledged, which is mostly meant to cover start-up costs.&lt;ref name="Green Climate Fund"&gt;[https://www.greenclimate.fund/documents/20182/24868/Status_of_Pledges.pdf/eef538d3-2987-4659-8c7c-5566ed6afd19 Green Climate Fund], ''Status of Pledges''. Retrieved 17 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission does not provide funding to the fund. EU member states contribute directly, and by 2016 they have jointly pledged US$4.7 billion, nearly half of the fund's resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/finance/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of pledged funds and potential reliance on the private sector is controversial and has been criticized by developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sethi|first=Nitin|title=A green climate fund but no money at Durban|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/developmental-issues/A-green-climate-fund-but-no-money-at-Durban/articleshow/11009614.cms|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=The [[Times of India]] |date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Green Climate Fund is an important institution for ensuring the implementation of the Paris Agreement, its future financial viability is by no means guaranteed. The USA had pledged $ 3 billion, of which $ 2 billion are outstanding. Since US President Donald Trump has announced his nation’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June, this money is unlikely to flow in the next few years. Some observers worry that other major donor countries – including Japan, Britain and Germany – will not make up for the shortfall.&lt;ref name=D+C&gt;{{cite news |title=Signalling effect for global climate finance|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/green-climate-fund-important-implementing-paris-agreement|author=Liane Schalatek|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=21 September 2017 |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President Obama committed the US to contributing US$3 billion to the fund. In January 2017, in his final 3 days in office, Obama initiated the transfer of a second $500m installment to the fund, leaving $2 billion owing. U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] in his [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|announcement of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement]] on June 1, 2017, also criticized the Green Climate Fund, calling it a scheme to redistribute wealth from rich to poor countries.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/world/europe/climate-paris-agreement-trump-china.html|title=As Trump Exits Paris Agreement, Other Nations Are Defiant|last=Eddy|first=Somini Sengupta, Melissa|date=June 1, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 1, 2017|last2=Buckley|first2=Chris|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The EU does not provide direct funding to the GCF, this figure is an aggregate of all EU members' contributions.

==Issues==
The process of designing the GCF has raised several issues. These include ongoing questions on how funds will be raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brandon |last=Wu |year=2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brandon-wu/wheres-the-money_b_3499523.html |title=Where's the Money?

Razzouk |year=2013 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/why-we-should-kill-the-green-climate-fund-8929564.html |title=Why We Should Kill The Green Climate Fund |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund is also pledged to offer "balanced" support to adaptation and mitigation, although there is some concern amongst developing countries that inadequate adaptation financing will be offered, in particular if the fund is reliant on "leveraging" private sector finance.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abbott, K.W., Gartner, D.|title=The Green Climate Fund and the Future of Environmental Governance|journal=Earth System Governance Working Paper No. 16|year=2011|ssrn=1931066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund's initial investments have met with mixed responses. The Fund's former director Héla Cheikhrouhou has complained that the Fund is backing too many "business-as-usual types of investment proposals", a view echoed by a number of civil society organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Pilita|title=Green fund investing in the wrong projects, says former chief|url=http://on.ft.com/2cqOix6|accessdate=23 September 2016|newspaper=[[Financial times]] |date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in at least one case it also drew praise for involving local communities in the formulation of an adaptation project, and for incorporating consumer protection into a plan for off-grid solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Oscar |last=Reyes |year=2016 |url=http://fpif.org/little-known-fund-heart-paris-climate-agreement// |title=The Little-Known Fund at the Heart of the Paris Climate Agreement |publisher=Foreign Policy in Focus |accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fulfilling the Green Climate Fund’s requirements when developing a funding proposal===

While it is relatively easy to tell what a mitigation project or programme is (i.e. its contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and/or whether it increases the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb them), the blurred line between a general development project and an adaptation project has been a contentious issue in the international climate finance debate, including at Green Climate Fund Board meetings, according to a report by the [[Climate and Development Knowledge Network]].&lt;ref name="cdkn.org"&gt;[https://cdkn.org/resource/toolkit-develop-project-proposal-gcf/?loclang=en_gb Green Climate Fund proposal toolkit 2017], Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network, 31 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant question is not whether a project is (also) a development project, but whether the project contributes to adaptation (i.e. what the adaptation/additionality argument is). Cross- cutting projects that deliver co-benefits in terms of both mitigation and adaptation are also eligible for funding.&lt;ref name="cdkn.org"/&gt;

===Role of the private sector===
One of the most controversial aspects of the GCF concerns the creation of the Fund's Private Sector Facility (PSF). Many of the developed countries represented on the GCF board advocate a PSF that appeals to capital markets, in particular the pension funds and other institutional investors that control trillions of dollars that pass through Wall Street and other financial centers. They hope that the Fund will ultimately use a broad range of financial instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Reyes (2013), [http://fpif.org/songdo-fallout-is-green-finance-a-red-herring/ Songdo Fallout: is green finance a red herring?], ''Foreign Policy in Focus''. Retrieved 23 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

However, several developing countries and non-governmental organizations have suggested that the PSF should focus on "pro-poor climate finance" that addresses the difficulties faced by micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries. This emphasis on encouraging the domestic private sector is also written into the GCF's Governing Instrument, its founding document.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth USA (2013), [http://www.foe.org/news/archives/2013-04-pro-poor-climate-finance-is-there-a-role-for-private Pro-poor Climate Finance: Is There a Role for Private Finance in the Green Climate Fund?], ''Friends of the Earth USA''. Retrieved 24 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additionality of funds===
The Cancun agreements clearly specify that the funds provided to the developing countries as climate finance, including through the GCF, should be "new" and "additional" to existing development aid.&lt;ref name="Cancunagreement" /&gt; The condition of funds having to be new means that pledges should come on top of those made in previous years. As far as additionality is concerned, there is no strict definition of this term, which has already led to serious problems in evaluating the additionality of emission reductions through [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM-projects]], leading to counter-productivity, and even [[Clean Development Mechanism#The risk of fraud|fraud]].&lt;ref name="Wara"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wara|first=M. W.|author2=Victor, D. G.|title=A Realistic Policy on International Carbon Offsets|journal=PESD Working Paper|date=April 2008|issue=74|url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/22157/WP74_final_final.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018223320/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/22157/WP74_final_final.pdf|archivedate=18 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Rivers|title=Failed Mechanism: Hundreds of Hydros Expose Serious Flaws in the CDM|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/node/2326|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While climate finance usually only counts pledges from developed countries, the US$10.3 billion pledged to the GCF also includes some (relatively small) contributions from developing countries.&lt;ref name="Green Climate Fund"/&gt;

===A lack of stakeholder involvement===
Using the money in the right way in order to enforce actual change on the ground is one of the biggest challenges ahead. Many academics argue that, in order to do this in an efficient way, all [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] should be [[Stakeholder engagement|involved in the process]], instead of using a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down approach]]. They point to that fact that, without their input, it is harder to achieve targets set. Moreover, projects often even miss out on their actual purpose.&lt;ref name="Abbott" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Easterly|first=William|title=Institutions: Top down or Bottom up?|journal=[[The American Economic Review]] |date=May 2008|volume=98|issue=2|pages=95–99|doi=10.1257/aer.98.2.95|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/39137/1/MPRA_paper_39137.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=Patrick|title=Global Governance Campaigning and mdgs: from top-down to bottom-up anti-poverty work|journal=[[Third World Quarterly]] |year=2006|volume=27|issue=2|pages=339–354|doi=10.1080/01436590500432622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Altieri|first=Miguel A.|author2=Masera, O.|title=Sustainable rural development in Latin America: building from the bottom-up|journal=Ecological Economics|date=April 1993|volume=7|issue=2|pages=93–121|doi=10.1016/0921-8009(93)90049-c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson, K., Steffen, W. &amp; Liverman, D.|title=Global Risks, Challenges and Decisions|year=2011|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|pages=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of researchers associated with the [[Australian National University]],&lt;ref name="vankerkhoff"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=van Kerkhoff, Lorrae |author2=Ahmad I.H., Pittock J. |author3=Steffen W. |title=Designing the Green Climate Fund: How to Spend $100 Billion Sensibly|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|year=2011|volume=53|issue=3|pages=18–31|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2011/May-June%202011/green-climate-fund-full.html|doi=10.1080/00139157.2011.570644}}&lt;/ref&gt; call for the foundation of so-called "National Implementing Entities" (NIE) in each country, that would become responsible for "the implementation of sub-national projects".&lt;ref name="vankerkhoff" /&gt; This would avoid national governments getting too involved, because in the past, they "often hindered the flow of international support to subnational scale reform for sustainable development".&lt;ref name="vankerkhoff" /&gt;
Overall, this view on the need for more stakeholder involvement can be framed within the movement in environmental governance calling for a shift from traditional ways of [[government]] to [[Environmental governance|governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James P.|title=Environmental Governance|year=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] is funding a research project that aims to help the GCF Board, by analysing how best to allocate resources among countries. The project will research and present four case studies of how federal or central government money is presently distributed to sub-national entities. Chosen for the diversity in their underlying political systems, these are: China, India, Switzerland, and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/2012/12/news-guiding-allocation-of-resources-from-the-green-climate-fund/?loclang=en_gb NEWS: Guiding allocation of resources from the Green Climate Fund], Climate &amp; development Knowledge Network, 17 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure to ban fossil fuel funding under climate finance===
At its board meeting in South Korea held in March 2015, the GCF refused an explicit ban on fossil fuel projects. Japan, China, and Saudi Arabia opposed the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UN green climate fund can be spent on coal-fired power generation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/29/un-green-climate-fund-can-be-spent-on-coal-fired-power-generation |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cleantechnica|title=Green Climate Fund Can Be Spent To Subsidise Dirty Coal|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/07/green-climate-fund-can-spent-subsidise-dirty-coal/|publisher=Cleantechnica|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human rights in Cyprus''' are protected by the constitution of the Republic of Cyprus.&lt;ref name=const&gt;[http://www.kypros.org/Constitution/English/appendix_a.html Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus], Article 5&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been reports of violations of the human rights of minorities, democratic freedom, rights of detainees, freedom of religion, rights of women, freedom of press and the freedom of speech.

In a number of cases, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has found [[Turkey]] responsible for continuous violations of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in the Republic of Cyprus as a result of the [[Turkish Invasion]] in 1974 and continuous [[military occupation|occupation]] of 37% of its territory. Regarding human rights in the areas under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus, according to the 2010 [[US Department of State]] human rights report, there were reports of police abuse and degrading treatment of persons in custody and asylum seekers, as well as instances of discrimination and violence against members of minority ethnic and national groups. Trafficking of women to the island, particularly for sexual exploitation was reportedly a problem. Several instances of violence against women and children were also reported.&lt;ref name=2010report/&gt;

== Democratic freedom ==
[[File:Court House of JUSTICE in Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|left|Cyprus Court of Justice in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]]]
[[Freedom House]] classified the perceived level of democratic and political freedom in Cyprus as "free" in 2011 in its ''[[Freedom in the World (report)|Freedom in the World]]'' report.&lt;ref name=freeh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2011/cyprus |title=Freedom in the World 2011 – Cyprus|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of State reported in 2010 that the recent elections were free and fair.&lt;ref name=2010report/&gt;

== Rights of minorities ==
US Department of State reported in 2010 that there were instances of discrimination and violence against members of minority ethnic and national groups.&lt;ref name=2010report/&gt; Minority Rights Group International reported in 2011 that minorities in Cyprus faced serious discrimination and they were excluded from policital activity.&lt;ref name=mng11&gt;[http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=10670 Cyprus conflict resolution strongly questioned if minorities continue to be excluded – new MRG report] (Minority Rights Grup International) Date: 22 March 2011, Retrieved on 13 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of State report in 2005 stated that discrimination against Turkish Cypriots and Roma were problems.&lt;ref name=2005report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61643.htm International Human Rights Report 2005 - Cyprus], US Department of State, Retrieved 2011-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some mistreatments to the Turkish Cypriots visiting the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook of the United Nations 2005'', United Nations, p.491&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Department of State report about human rights in Cyprus in 2002 said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some of the approximately 300 Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area faced difficulties in obtaining identification cards and other government documents, especially if they were born after 1974.

Although the prisons generally meet international standards, there has been reports that often state that the prisons are overcrowded.&lt;ref name=2010report/&gt; There has been reports that the police had phsiycally abused detainees and had discriminated them.&lt;ref name=2010report/&gt; Some [[non-governmental organization]]s reported that foreign detainees complained that they had been subjected to physical violence.&lt;ref name=2010report/&gt;

In 2008, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Cyprus decided that the police had restricted Andreas Constantinou's access to legal aid.&lt;ref name=detineu&gt;Symfiliosi, national report written for Becoming Vulnerable in Detention (p.154), [http://www.detention-in-europe.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=298&amp;Itemid=212], Retrieved 2011-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 2008, the [[ECHR]] said that "a question arises as to the conformity of such legislation with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention [...] there is a priori no reason why it should not be made available in spheres other than criminal law."&lt;ref name=detineu/&gt;

In the case of Panovits v. Cyprus in 2009, the ECHR ruled that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the Assize Court’s handling of the confrontation with the applicant’s defence counsel rendered the trial unfair. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 in this respect."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=16&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;action=html&amp;highlight=Cyprus&amp;sessionid=74021387&amp;skin=hudoc-en CASE OF PANOVITS v.

In 2005, 25 cases by Turkish Cypriots were filed in the courts of the Republic of Cyprus, stating that they did not have access to their properties in the Republic of Cyprus-controlled areas.&lt;ref name=2005report/&gt;

== Freedom of religion ==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Cyprus}}
The US Department of State reported in 2010 that freedom of religion was generally respected by the government. The government conserves the mosques. Although there are 17 mosques in the Republic of Cyprus-controlled area, only five of them are in public use.&lt;ref name=2010reportrel&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148926.htm 2010 Religious Freedom Report: Cyprus], US Department of State, Retrieved 2011-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005 the Ombudsman's Office issued a report on a complaint from Jehovah's Witnesses whose child was excused from religious instruction but who was subsequently harassed by fellow students and pressured by a religious instructor. The report concluded that the student's complaint was valid and that the instructor's remarks during a lesson on religious sects violated the student's religious freedom.&lt;ref name=2006reportrel&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71375.htm 2006 Religious Freedom Report: Cyprus], US Department of State, Retrieved 2011-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in November 2005 press reports said that the police and the municipality had harassed the Buddhist temple in [[Strovolos]].&lt;ref name=2006reportrel/&gt;

Nicos Trimikliniotis and Corina Demetriou noted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"‘Religious’ discrimination is not exhausted there, however, as the treatment of Jehovah Witness conscientious objectors refusing to serve in the military illustrate."&lt;ref name="trimikl"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Right to education ==
There is currently no school for Turkish Cypriots living in the Republic of Cyprus-controlled areas.&lt;ref name=mra2010&gt;[http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=1873 Cyprus Overview], Minority Rights Group International, Retrieved 2011-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Maronites have an elementary school, but no secondary school, and Antonis Hadjiroussos underlines the danger of assimilation of Maronites to the Greek Cypriot community because of this.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cyprus review, Volumes 18-19'' (2006), Intercollege, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nm8sAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22The+Maronites+have+their+own+elementary+school,%22&amp;dq=%22The+Maronites+have+their+own+elementary+school,%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1VEdTu32MYKr8QPCnfGYCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA p.62]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights of women ==
{{main|Women in Cyprus}}
Laws prohibit rape and spousal rape in the Republic of Cyprus. There has been a sharp increase in the number of these crimes in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=2010report/&gt; Although sexual harassment in the workplace is prohibited, it is a widespread problem, but only few cases are reported to the authorities.&lt;ref name=2010report/&gt;

In 1996, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Concluding Observations noted that women were not represented in political life much, they were absent from higher levels of the government, the trafficking of women and their sexual exploitation was against human rights, there was sexual harassment in the workplace, and women were not paid equal money for work of equal value.&lt;ref name=Unwom96&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/cedaw/cedaw-cyprus.htm Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Concluding Observations: Cyprus, U.N. Doc. A/51/38, paras. 37-66 (1996).], University of Minnesota, Retrieved 2011-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee also said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Committee exhorts the Government to extend full social security coverage to self-employed rural women and to abolish existing discrimination in this respect between married and unmarried women. The Committee urges the Government to implement special sensitization and training programmes in gender issues for all law enforcement officials and judges, particularly judges in family courts. The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted, under article 4 of the Convention, with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life, as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service. The Committee urges the Government to explore the proposal of non-governmental organizations to establish an equal opportunities commission to deal with complaints by women and to serve in a mediatory capacity."&lt;ref name=Unwom96/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, the same committee expressed their concern about discrimination against women migrants, including domestic helpers and agricultural workers, lower number of women which have the PhD degree when compared with men, and "the lack of a comprehensive and systematic approach to gender equality policies".&lt;ref name=Unwom2006&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/cedaw/cedaw-cyprus2006.html Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Cyprus, U.N.

A US Department of State report in 2010 stated that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"On January 7, the ECHR ruled in Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia that Cyprus failed to protect 20-year-old Russian cabaret artist Oxana Rantseva from human trafficking and failed to conduct an effective investigation into the circumstances of her death in 2001."&lt;ref name=2010report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154419.htm 2010 Human Rights Report: Cyprus], US Department of State, Retrieved 2011-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Freedom of press and speech ==
{{see also|Media of Cyprus}}

In 2010, the US Department of State reported that the law provided for freedom of speech and of the press, and the government generally respected these rights in practice.&lt;ref name=2010report/&gt; The UNHCR also reported in 2006 that the freedom of press was generally respected, and independent press often criticized the authorities.&lt;ref name=unhcrpress06&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,FREEHOU,ANNUALREPORT,CYP,,473451b44e,0.html Freedom of the Press - Cyprus (2006)], UNHCR, Retrieved 2011-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2005, the police used excessive force against demonstrators and journalists at a picket by striking lorry drivers.&lt;ref name=amn2006&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur01/007/2006/en/#6.CYPRUS|outline CYPRUS - Document - Europe and Central Asia: Concerns in Europe &amp; Central Asia bulletin July-December 2005], Amnesty International, Retrieved 2011-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the media was stifled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus to broadcast programmes against the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus]]. European Commissioner [[Günter Verheugen]] was refused to air-time on any Greek Cypriot TV channel because if he was not refused, he would present arguments supporting the plan.&lt;ref name=aej&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:7INGejyIV1EJ:www.aej-uk.org/AEJ-mediasurvey.doc+Freedom+of+press+in+Cyprus&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgkGuepU3lMn-YDkcTngCDss9__HtM7n4S8Z1e-tHvCxs6qWbQdC1rHBwuAjVZvRhPDucJSSt6eXfvRO1EpD7yMZlx2Wre_hxbes-9i2wkOQHzGV0GUr7EpE_Le7sSvTT87Ow62&amp;sig=AHIEtbT5eCHlfIM32pCkgEavtYWgCCKXPQ Goodbye to Freedom?], Association of European Journalists, Retrieved 2011-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, then President [[Tassos Papadopoulos]] "personally intervened" to force the dismissal of the press attaché at the Cyprus High Commission in London, Soteris Georgallis, because he had attended to a book presentation which was addressed by a critic of Papadopoulos, Takis Hadjidemetriou.&lt;ref name=aej/&gt; Kyriakos Pierides reported in 2007 that the "pro-government political and commercial pressures are a constant factor inhibiting the work of the media there".&lt;ref name=aej/&gt;

In 2008, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, in a report written by the Turkish Cypriot Human Rights Foundation and the Turkish Cypriot Journalists’ Union reported that the government of the Republic of Cyprus were violating the rights of Turkish Cypriots on the freedom of press. It added that the change in [[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]]'s broadcasting frequency prevented many Turkish Cypriot TV channels broadcasting in Northern Cyprus, thus violating the freedom of the speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/odihr/33712 Freedom of Expression, Media and Information in Cyprus] Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Retrieved 2011-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1998 after the case of ''[[Modinos v.

=== Violations in Northern Cyprus ===
{{main|Human rights in Northern Cyprus}}
In a number of cases, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has found [[Turkey]] responsible for continuous violations of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in the Republic of Cyprus as a result of the [[Turkish Invasion]] in 1974 and continuous [[military occupation|occupation]] of 37% of its territory. In particular, in the 2011 landmark case of [[Cyprus v. Turkey]] the court ruled that there had been 14 violations of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by Turkey:

*Violations of Articles 2, 3 and 5 concerning Greek-Cypriot missing persons and their relatives;
*Violations of Articles 8, 13 and P1-1 concerning home and property of displaced Greek-Cypriots;
*Violations of Articles 3, 8, 9, 10, 13, P1-1 and P1-2 concerning living conditions of Greek Cypriots in [[Karpass Peninsula|Karpas region]] of northern Cyprus;
*Violation of Article 6, concerning rights of Turkish Cypriots living in northern Cyprus;

In 2011, in its annual report, the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] has reiterated is calls for the full restoration of all human rights to the population of Cyprus, in particular to refugees,  called for the tracing of and accounting for missing persons in Cyprus without any further delay,  and called for the restoration and respect of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots, including freedom of movement, the freedom of settlement and the right to property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[OHCHR]]|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the question of human rights in Cyprus|url=https://undocs.org/A/HRC/16/21|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=18 March 2017|language=en|date=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISPD Group is an organisation born out of the need for an academic institution that prepares and certifies professionals in the fields of International Procedures, Corporate &amp; Soft Diplomacy, Business Protocol, Security and Cross Cultural Intelligence. Since 2008, ISPD has grown into a company which currently owns 6 brands: Innovation in Diplomacy, Protocol and Diplomacy, Security &amp; Governance, Impact, Certification &amp; Licenses and Skills.

==Accomplishments==

*According to the ''Journal of International Diplomatic Higher Education'', “the ISPD is the first international institution of diplomatic and protocolar higher education to offer an executive master degree in protocol, business and foreign relations thus giving it an enviable and exclusively unique niche in diplomacy’s intimate sister statecraft, protocol. The ISPD’s masters degree in protocol programme is only the more elevated on the scale of exclusivity, prestige and privilege by its access to the Brussels, EU and larger euro-continental diplomatic communities at The Hague and in Paris, London and Geneva.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intldiplomatichighereducation.webs.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304073550/http://intldiplomatichighereducation.webs.com/ |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">While many [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Jihadism|jihadists]] view [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] negatively, due to its Western origins, there have also been examples of [[Middle Eastern hip hop|hip-hop songs]] [[Political hip hop|with]] pro-jihadist lyrics, and of jihadists embracing hip-hop and [[gangsta rap|gangsta]] culture as a way of attracting Westerners to join their organizations. The phenomenon is sometimes known as "[[Jihad Cool]]" and includes music, clothing, magazine, videos and other media.

==Notable examples==
German rapper [[Deso Dogg]] later took the names Abu Talha al-Almani&lt;ref name="tahroor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/25/the-strange-role-of-rappers-in-the-islamic-states-jihad/|title=The strange role of rappers in the Islamic State’s jihad|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Ishaan |last=Tharoor|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Abou Maleeq, and joined ISIL in 2014.

British-born [[Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary]] rapped under the name L Jinny, is the son of Egyptian militant [[Adel Abdel Bari]], and was reportedly videotaped beheading journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]]. Jinny once [[Twitter|Tweeted]] a photo of himself holding a man's severed head, with the words "Chillin' with my [[homie]] or what's left of him."&lt;ref name="dickey" /&gt; These rappers, in turn, have inspired other jihadist activities; one young Kosovar was reportedly inspired by Deso Dogg's lyrics to fire at an American military bus in [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[Douglas McCain]] was an aspiring rapper and basketball player who was killed while fighting for ISIL in 2014. His classmates described him as a "goofball" who "got along with most", while a coworker referred to him as a "normal guy".&lt;ref name="McCain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2014/08/27/douglas-mcauthur-mccain-basketball-player-rapper-islamic-state-fighter|title=American Killed Fighting for Islamic State|first=Andrew |last=Soergel|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL, in particular, has used social media in attempts to reach young people, many of whom do not necessarily have any Muslim background at all. Two young British jihadists who travelled to Syria to join ISIL reportedly learned everything they knew about Islam from reading the book ''Islam for Dummies''. As a result, many of recruits are believed not to be motivated by Islam as such, but rather by a combination of anger (either feeling oppressed themselves, or wanting to fight on behalf of the oppressed) and the desire for fame and glory. They end up turning to ISIL and jihadism as an outlet for these feelings.&lt;ref name="dickey" /&gt;

==Analysis==
Anthropologist [[Scott Atran]] argues that the phenomenon results from a search for "sacred values" and what [[Edmund Burke]] called "the sublime"; a "quest for greatness, glory, eternal meaning in an inherently chaotic world".&lt;ref name="dickey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/25/isis-hip-hop-jihadists-and-the-man-who-killed-james-foley.html|title=ISIS, Hip-Hop Jihadists and the Man Who Killed James Foley|first=Christopher|last=Dickey|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Khan has cited Douglas McCain as yet another example of this phenomenon, and said that both Islamism and gangsta rap foster a "sense of grievance towards wider society" and "focus on vengeance and fetishize violence as a way of redressing the balance". Khan says that while researching young Islamists in London, he found that they looked to the works of [[50 Cent]] and [[Tupac Shakur]] for inspiration. Khan argues that what sets ISIL apart from other jihadist groups, and makes it far more dangerous as a result, is its ability to harness hip-hop to "bestow on its struggle a counter-culture sense of subversive 'cool' that mainstream political parties and even commercial brands might envy." ISIL's marketing methods and overall strategies are also reminiscent of those used by street gangs.&lt;ref name="khan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/al-qaedas-new-front-jihadi-rap-110481_Page2.html#.VAZjoJUg-Uk|title=Al Qaeda’s New Front: Jihadi Rap|first=Amil|last=Kahn|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hisham Aidi has written a book, ''Rebel Music: Race, Empire, and the New Muslim Youth Culture'' describing the phenomenon of Islamist hip-hop, but Aidi also mentions that the United States and other Western governments have attempted to use hip-hop and [[Sufi music]] to ''fight'' terrorism by deradicalizing young Muslims.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} One American rapper, [[Abu Mansoor Al-Amriki|Omar Hamaami]], who later joined [[al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], released a song with the lyrics "Bomb by bomb, blast by blast, only going to bring back the glorious past."&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/9_disturbingly_good_jihadi_raps|title=9 Disturbingly Good Jihadi Raps|first=J. Dana|last=Stuster|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of jihadi rap has been around since at least 2004, when the song "[[Dirty Kuffar]]" was released. In 2006, [[Aki Nawaz]] of the group [[Fun-Da-Mental]] released an album with lyrics comparing [[Osama bin Laden]] to [[Che Guevara]] and depicting the [[Statue of Liberty]] as an [[abu Ghraib prison]]er.&lt;ref name="cicero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciceromagazine.com/features/is-extremist-hip-hop-helping-isis/|title=Is Extremist Hip Hop Helping ISIS?|first=Hisham |last=Aidi|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[Cicero (magazine)|Cicero]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann George II''' (31 May 1613 – 22 August 1680) was the [[Elector of Saxony]] from 1656 to 1680. He belonged to the Albertine line of the [[House of Wettin]].

==Biography==
[[File:John George II, Elector of Saxony (1613–1680) - Order of the Garter stall plate - St George's Chapel.png|thumb|left|17th century Order of the Garter stall plate for John George II, Elector of Saxony.  Located in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, Berkshire, England]]
He was the third (fourth in order of birth){{citation needed|date=November 2012}} but eldest surviving son of the Elector [[John George I, Elector of Saxony|Johann George I, Elector of Saxony]]{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}} and [[Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia|Magdalene Sybille of Prussia]], his second spouse.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} He succeeded his father as Elector of Saxony when John George I died on 8 October 1656.&lt;ref&gt;See the Encyclopædia Britannica article on John George I for his date of death—immediately before the article on John George II {{harv|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1657 John George made an arrangement with his three brothers with the object of preventing disputes over their separate territories, and in 1664 he entered into friendly relations with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. He received money from the French king, but the existence of a strong anti-French party in Saxony induced him occasionally to respond to the overtures of the emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

[[Image:Johann Georg II.jpg|thumb|right|240px|John George II, picture from 1658.]]
The elector's primary interests were not in politics, but in music and art. He adorned [[Dresden]], which under him became the musical centre of Germany; welcoming foreign musicians and others he gathered around him a large and splendid court, and his capital was the constant scene of musical and other festivals.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}} He commissioned the building of the first opera house, the [[Opernhaus am Taschenberg]].

In 1658 John George was accepted into the [[Fruitbearing Society]], through the patronage of Duke [[Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|William of Saxe-Weimar]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;!--for the whole paragraph--&gt;

His enormous expenditure on the arts compelled John George in 1661 to grant greater control over monetary matters to the estates, a step which laid the foundation of the later system of finance in Saxony. Also, his government was less effective in establishing [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] rule and a [[standing army]] than were [[Bohemia]] or [[Prussia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

John George's reign saw the slow [[economic reconstruction]] of Saxony after the [[Thirty Years' War]]. New trades and [[manufacture]]s developed, such as textiles, hard coal and glass. Locally mined silver filled the Electorate's empty treasury, and the [[Leipzig Trade Fair]] and the Bohemian ''Exulanten'' of 1654 also stimulated economic activity.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;!--for the whole paragraph--&gt;

John George died in [[Freiberg]] on 22 August 1680.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

==Family==
In [[Dresden]] on 13 November 1638 John George married [[Magdalene Sybille of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Magdalene Sibylle of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]]. They had three children:{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

#Sibylle Marie (16 September 1642 – 27 February 1643)
#Erdmuthe Sophie (25 February 1644 – 22 June 1670), married on 29 October 1662 to [[Christian Ernst, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]]
#[[John George III, Elector of Saxony|John George III]] (20 June 1647 –  12 September 1691), his successor as Elector.

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in the '''Republic of the Congo''' may face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is legal in the [[Republic of the Congo]], but same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples.

==Laws regarding same-sex sexual activity==
Same-sex sexual acts are legal. These acts never have been criminalised. The age of consent is unequal.&lt;ref name="ILGA 2012"/&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
There is no legal recognition of same-sex unions.

==Discrimination protections==
There is no legal protection against [[discrimination]] based on [[sexual orientation]].
They have been reported discrimination of small local groups fighting for human right and freedom.
LGBT people have been abused but the local people, arrested by police mostly in the east part of the country,
have been reported to be running for their life in nearby countries.

==Living conditions==
The [[U.S. Department of State]]'s 2010 Human Rights Report found that "there was not a large openly gay or lesbian community due to the social stigma associated with homosexuality" and that "there were no known cases of violence or discrimination against gays, lesbians, or transgendered individuals during the year. While discrimination may exist due to the social stigma surrounding homosexuality, no such cases were reported to the NGOs or covered by the media."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/160117.pdf REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lippeverband''' is a public German [[water board]] (“Wasserwirtschaftsverband”) located in [[Dortmund]] ([[North Rhine-Westphalia]]/[[Germany]]) and responsible for 3.280&amp;nbsp;km² of the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe]] catchment from Lippborg down to the river [[Rhine]] with 1.4 Mio. citizens. The main tasks are wastewater discharge and treatment, flood protection, groundwater management, settlement of claims caused by hard coal mining, river restoration and protection of ecosystems.

== History ==

=== Origins and early development ===

The river Lippe appears as a two-tier water course: Upstream, eastward of the city of [[Hamm]]/Lippborg, the catchment is more rural. Downstream of Hamm settlements and industrial impacts characterize the situation. Preconditions for the industrialization started with the construction of the [[Cologne-Minden trunk line]] in the 1840s that connected the river [[Rhine]] settlements like Cologne with harbours and trade at the river Weser and on this route with Lippe towns, too. Moreover, this railway supported the coal and steel industry development in the whole northern [[Ruhr]] region. The hard coal mining that started in the middle of the 19th century in the [[Emscher]] catchment area developed in the following decades direction north. In the Lippe catchment area from the 1860s on first problems from mining subsidence and drainage of polluted water appeared. Villages and towns located at the Lippe and its tributary Seseke (Werl, Unna, Hamm, Bönen, Kamen, Bergkamen, Lünen and Dortmund) expanded quickly with the establishing of hard coal mines between 1856 and [[World War I]]. The industrialization caused huge water quality problems in the Lippe, its tributaries and the settlements; therefore first in 1913 the Sesekegenossenschaft and later in 1926 the Lippeverband as public water boards (“Wasserwirtschaftsverbände”) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Lippeverband(editor): „50 Jahre Lippeverband“, Dortmund/Essen 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sesekegenossenschaft was from 1913 on responsible for the water management and the precursor of the Lippeverband from 1926 on. The Lippe tributary [[Seseke]] has a catchment area of 319,45&amp;nbsp;km² and drains the towns of [[Werl]], [[Unna]], [[Bönen]], [[Kamen]], [[Bergkamen]], Lünen and the east of [[Dortmund]]. The Seseke catchment area suffered from “subsidence funnels” where waste water, surface run-off and water from the creeks gathered and digested; so interdisciplinary solutions were needed, comparable to the [[Emschergenossenschaft]] in the neighboring catchment area which hosted the Sesekegenossenschaft in the first years. The municipalities were responsible for the inner city drainage systems and interconnection points were jointly defined where the Sesekegenossenschaft took over responsibility. Those were normally the subcatchment parts where underground sewer systems were impossible as the mining subsidence would have caused damages continuously and waste water would have infiltrated in groundwater and soil. The Sesekegenossenschaft (and later the Lippeverband) then worked on the drainage capacity by cutting the meanders of the water courses, deepening the runways and lining them with concrete, constructing dykes and pumping stations and establishing waste water treatment plants. All discharge from industry, mines and households as well as rain, surface water and natural discharge were collected and drained in these new “concrete streams”. All costs were divided between the “users” of the Seseke system, depending on the volume and load of waste water or drainage capacity or causer (for example the mining companies).

Governmental investigations showed that the measures that were taken in the Seseke system were expected to solve problems in the rest of the Lippe catchment area, too. Formally, the „Lippegesetz“ (Lippe act) was legislated on Januar 19th 1926 and the Sesekegenossenschaft merged into the new water board.&lt;ref name="act"&gt;[https://recht.nrw.de/lmi/owa/br_text_anzeigen?v_id=2220100122085632182 Lippeverband act ]&lt;/ref&gt;

More and more measures had to be taken to compensate negative impacts of the mining that went in northern direction and caused damages in the Lippe catchment area between Hamm and the Lippe mouth at the river Rhine near Wesel. Dykes were built for flood prevention, waste water treatment facilities and pumping stations kept the systems running.&lt;ref&gt;Lippeverband: „Ansichten eines Flusses – die Lippe“, Peter Pomp Verlag Bottrop/Essen 2001, {{ISBN|3-89355-226-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later development ===
Until the 1970s water pollution played no important role in the public debate but environmental policy changed over the decades. Environmental standards on national level and especially from the EU have been leading to enormous efforts to improve the nature standards and today a couple of positive developments can be stated, like new FFH (Flora Fauna Habitat) sites &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamm.de/en/lifeplus-projekt.html EU LIFE project Lippeauen]&lt;/ref&gt; and governmental initiatives around the WFD (Water Framework Directive).&lt;ref name="ministry"&gt;[https://www.umwelt.nrw.de/mediathek/broschueren/detailseite-broschueren/?broschueren_id=5204&amp;cHash=f731af031db45a83a275ee58e613fa08 Environment Ministry report on Lippe quality development ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lippe.nrw.de/index.php/Lippe Water Framework Directive in the Lippe catchment area]&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially the sub catchment of the Seseke has experienced enormous efforts to restore the system. Since the 1960s, the coal crisis was leading to the shutdown of more and more mines and the Lippeverband with its administrative, political and industrial members decided to re-develop the Seseke system towards „second hand nature“ – a real restoration compared to the times before industrialization is impossible. Between the 1980s and 2012 four waste water treatment plants were constructed in Bönen, Kamen, Dortmund-Scharnhorst and Lünen. A new 75&amp;nbsp;km underground sewer system was constructed and 73&amp;nbsp;km of former “concrete water courses” were restored to work as ecological green belts in the landscape now.

Challenges for the Lippeverband are still the water quality demands. Though the Lippeverband is not a drinking water provider there are water bodies in the catchment area that are used by [[Gelsenwasser]] for drinking water supply and where Lippeverband waste water treatment plants are discharging to. The Lippeverband started operating first treatment facilities voluntarily with advanced technologies and initiated European network projects on the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products and how to eliminate them from hospitals or domestic waste water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.no-pills.eu EU cooperation on pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klaerwerk.info/Allgemeine-Meldungen-und-Berichte/Bad-Sassendorf--LIPPEVERBAND-setzt-erstmals-Ozon-zur-Abwasserreinigung-ein Waste water treatment info]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further initiatives deal with the impacts of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future-cities.eu Urban networks to face climate change]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, artists and landscape architects are involved in projects to capitalize the newly developed ecological and leisure qualities, for example in the frame of the cultural events of Ruhr.2010 or “Über Wasser gehen” (“walking on water”), a joint initiative of the cities Lünen, Bergkamen, Kamen, Bönen, Unna, Dortmund, the district Unna, the regional planning assembly Ruhr and the “Urbane Künste Ruhr”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ueberwassergehen.de/ Environment Ministry North Rhine Westphalia / Water Framework Directive 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
The Lippeverband is not “owner” of the river Lippe which is in the German hierarchy a “water course first level”. These are historically often the rivers that (once) have been used for shipping and therefore are state-owned asset, in this case under protection of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The environment ministry is financing all nature related activities the Lippeverband is carrying out at the river Lippe directly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flussgebiete.nrw.de/img_auth.php/e/e7/PE-Stb_Lippe_Entwurf_20141222.pdf Seseke arts project ]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work related to tributaries, waste water management and man-made impact has to be financed by the municipalities, businesses, industry and mining companies etc., operationally carried out by the Lippeverband.

Responsibilities and tasks of the Lippeverband are defined in the act „Lippegesetz“, enacted January 16, 1926 and adapted later as „Gesetz über den Lippeverband“ (LippeVG):&lt;ref name="act"/&gt;

* Management of runoff, flood prevention at open water courses and in the sub catchments;
* Maintenance of open water courses and related facilities;
* Ecological restoration of technically altered water courses;
* Groundwater management;
* Compensation of mining impacts on ecological or water management related changes;
* Waste water disposal;
* Disposal of waste from water management services;
* Water quality management;
* Scientific work related to water management challenges;
* Support of drinking water supply, water for industrial use and use of hydropower

Drinking water supply and Lippe river management is carried out in cooperation with the [[Wasserverband Westdeutsche Kanäle]]. The Lippeverband is working in an administrative collectivity with the Emschergenossenschaft, the water board established in 1899 in a neighbouring river catchment area. Together, more than 1.500 employees work for both water boards,&lt;ref name="ministry"/&gt; around 600 of them belong to the Lippeverband. Both water boards together are the biggest water management and service provider in Germany.

== Governance ==
The North Rhine-Westphalian water boards are statutory bodies, working in public-private partnership as non-profit institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.umwelt.nrw.de/umweltschutz-umweltwirtschaft/wer-macht-was/wer-macht-was-wasserverbaende/ Environment Ministry North Rhine-Westphalia / water boards]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lippeverband, together with the Emschergenossenschaft, has an administration that is governed by a board of 3 managing directors, elected for 5 years each. The election happens on the level of associates that have representatives in an annual assembly,coming from

* the state of North Rhine-Westphalia,
* 45 municipalities,
* 107 commercial and infrastructure companies and
* 4 mining companies.

The number of representatives per member depends on the number of citizens in the 45 municipalities and on the volume of waste water “produced” by the companies and mines.

The supervisory authority is the Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKULNV). German water boards are not formal authorities but have to receive permissions and approvals for construction works etc. They are independent in financial and internal management but depend on regulatory decrees regarding water acts.

== Catchment Area ==
The river Lippe with a length of in total 220&amp;nbsp;km is only managed over a stretch of 147&amp;nbsp;km between Lippborg and Wesel (approx. 3.280&amp;nbsp;km² of 4.890&amp;nbsp;km² catchment area) by the Lippeverband.

With an amendment of the Lippeverband act (LippeVG) &lt;ref name="act"/&gt; in 1990 the responsibilities have been extended to smaller catchment areas of tributaries to the Rhine close to the Lippemouth (Mommbach, Stollbach, Langhorster Leitgraben, Lohberger Entwässerungsgraben, Bruckhauser Mühlenbach, Rotbach). Moreover, due to the migration of the hard coal mining to the north, responsibilities for potential impact and compensation were given to the Lippeverband in the mining reserve areas of the municipalities Ahlen, Ascheberg, Beckum, Drensteinfurt, Ennigerloh, Raesfeld and Sendenhorst.

== Data ==
* Members of the Lippeverband: 154
* Catchment area: 3.280&amp;nbsp;km²
* Population: ca. 1,39 Mio.
* Water courses: 395&amp;nbsp;km (Lippe: 148&amp;nbsp;km)
* Waste water sewers: 128&amp;nbsp;km
* Dykes 76,13&amp;nbsp;km (Lippe 32,61&amp;nbsp;km)
* Waste water treatment plants: 50 ( 2,3 Mio. People equivalents)
* Pumping stations: 148
* Part of catchment area drained by pumps (polder areas):: 15,7%
* Flood plains: 34 &lt;ref&gt;Lippeverband: Geschäftsbericht, Essen October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berghof Foundation argues that opaque delisting conditions reduce the incentive for the organization to abandon terrorism, while fuelling radicalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berghof-peacesupport.org/publications/RLM_Peace_Mediation_and_Listed_Terrorist_Organizations.pdf |title=Peace Mediation and Listed Terrorist Organizations: Challenges for Peacebuilding |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Outlawed terror organisations in Australia}}
Since 2002, the [[Australian Government]] maintains a list of terrorist organizations under the ''Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002''.&lt;ref name="australialistedterroristorgs"/&gt; Listing, de-listing and re-listing follows a protocol&lt;ref name="australialistedterroristorgs"/&gt; that mainly involves the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] and the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/Listedterroristorganisations/Pages/ProtocolForListingTerroristOrganisations.aspx|title=Protocol for listing terrorist organisations|work=Australian National Security|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Since December 18, 2001, section 83.05 of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] allows the [[Governor in Council]] to maintain a list of entities that are engaged in terrorism, facilitating it, or acting on behalf of such an entity.&lt;ref name="canada-law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-29.html#h-28 |title=Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 83.05 |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entities are reviewed by the Minister and the [[Chief Justice of Canada|Chief Justice of the Federal Court]], and finally published in the [[Canada Gazette]].&lt;ref name="canada-law"/&gt; The list is also published on the website of [[Public Safety Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Currently listed entities|url=http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/cntr-trrrsm/lstd-ntts/crrnt-lstd-ntts-eng.aspx|publisher=Public Safety Canada|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The European Union has two lists of designated terrorist organisations that provide for different sanctions for the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristina|last=Thorne|format=PDF|url=https://www.hdcentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TerroristdesignationintheEuropeanUnion-June-2006.pdf|title=Terrorist designation in the European Union (Background paper)|publisher=[[Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue]]|date=June 2006|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first list is copied from the United Nations, and the second is an autonomous list.&lt;ref name="berghof"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wählisch|first=Martin|format=PDF|url=http://www.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Other_Resources/RLM_EU_Terrorist_Listing.pdf|title=EU Terrorist Listing: An Overview about Listing and Delisting Procedures (Briefing Paper, June/November 2010)|publisher=Berghof Foundation|date=2010|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autonomous list====
All other designated organizations.
* the freezing of all funds, other financial assets and economic resources.
* a ban on directly or indirectly making funds, other financial assets and economic resources available.

It is important to note that sanctions are only applicable to EU-external groups regardless of designation. For example, 47 groups are listed as terrorist organizations in the EU but sanctions are only applied to 27 of these. Member States do have an obligation to assist each other in preventing and combating terrorist acts but this is the only action that follows from the designation of an EU-internal organization. 
*European Union list of terrorist groups and individuals, 25 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:165:0072:01:EN:HTML|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130213132209/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:165:0072:01:EN:HTML|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 February 2013|title=EUR-Lex – 32012D0333|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|date=|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Listing process====
New organizations are added to the autonomous list following this process:&lt;ref name="berghof"/&gt;
# "Designation": Member states and third party states tips about an organization. This state must have solid evidence and must the tip must be sent by the national authority.
# Scrutinity: The Presidency, or a delegation, gathers basic information, and might require more information from the tipping state.
# Consultations: Information is shared with other member states for discussion. Everything is still confidential. 15 days after, delegates of the states meet as the CP 931 Working Party, [[Europol]] is sometimes invited too.
# Recommendation: The CP 931 Working Party prepares the listing decision.
# Decision by EU Council: The council adopts the list. The decision must be unanimous, which means that every state has a veto right.
# Official Publishing: In the EU Official Journal
# Notification and Statement of Reason: The council secretariat notifies each designated organization via mail, together with instructions on how to get the decision to be reconsidered.

====Delisting process====
The EU has similar process to review the list, and to remove organizations for the list.&lt;ref name="berghof"/&gt;

===India===
Under the [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]], the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] maintains a list of banned organizations: [[List of organisations banned by the Government of India]].&lt;ref name="india"/&gt;

===Korea===
{{main|National Security Act (South Korea)}}
*{{cn span|date=April 2017|The [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] outlawed the [[Aum Shinrikyo]] as a terrorist group.}}
*The [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], however, has not yet listed a number of designated terrorist groups. Such groups banned under the National Security Act include, for example, the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (the ruling party of [[North Korea]]) and [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="Korea2007" /&gt;

===Myanmar===
In [[Myanmar]] (formerly ''Burma''), the ''Anti-Terrorism Central Committee'' is responsible for designating terrorist organisations in accordance with the country's counter-terrorism law. Designations must be approved by the [[Assembly of the Union|union government]] before being official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Republic of the Union of Myanmar Anti-terrorism Central Committee Statement|url=http://www.statecounsellor.gov.mm/nrpcen/node/124|publisher=National Reconciliation and Peace Centre|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only group on Myanmar's terror list is the [[Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army]], declared on 25 August 2017 in accordance with the counter-terrorism law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/world/south-asia/2017/08/27/final-confrontation-rohingyas/|title=Exclusive: Is this the final confrontation for the Rohingya?|work=[[Dhaka Tribune]]|date=27 August 2017|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The&amp;nbsp;[[New Zealand Police]]&amp;nbsp;are responsible for coordinating any requests to the Prime Minister for designation as a terrorist entity. The designation of terrorist organizations is also guided by the [[Terrorism Suppression Act 2002]]. New Zealand also abides by several United Nations resolutions dealing with counter-terrorism including [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267|UN Resolutions 1267]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1989|1989]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2253|2253]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1988|1988]], and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373|1373]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designated terrorist entities|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal-community/counterterrorism/designated-entities|publisher=[[New Zealand Police]]|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 |trans_title= |type=Public Act |number=No 34|language= |date=17 October 2002 |article= |articletype= |page= |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0034/latest/DLM151491.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_terrorism+suppression+act_resel_25_a&amp;p=1 |accessdate=22 April 2018|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
The [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]] maintains a list of terrorist organizations on its website [https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105604/http://www.mps.gov.cn/n16/n983040/n1988498/1988553.html mps.gov.cn]. This list has been translated to English by the [[Embassy of People's Republic of China in Washington, D.C.|Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/xw/t56257.htm|title=China seeks int'l support in counter-terrorism|work=[[Embassy of People's Republic of China in Washington, D.C.|Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the USA]]|date=15 December 2003|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
The first group to be officially listed as a terrorist organization under the [[Human Security Act]] of 2007 is the [[Abu Sayyaf]] on September 10, 2015 by the [[Basilan province|Basilan]] provincial court.&lt;ref name=ph_asg&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippine court designates Abu Sayyaf a terrorist group|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/network/local-news/2015/09/11/philippine-court-designates-abu-sayyaf-terrorist-group-429679|accessdate=12 September 2015|publisher=Sun Star|date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte reportedly issued a proclamation declaring the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) and its armed wing, the [[New People's Army]] (NPA), as terrorist organizations. The proclamation was made in accordance with the Human Security Act and the Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act.&lt;ref name=du30npa/&gt;

Historically the CPP-NPA has been considered as an "organized conspiracy" by the Philippines Government. The label was placed on the CPP's predecessor, the [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930]] and its armed group the [[Hukbalahap]] in 20 June 1957 through the Anti Subversion Act or Republic Act No. 1700. The law covered any succeeding organizations of the PKP-1930 and the Hukbalahap which includes the CPP-NPA. Being a member of groups covered by the law is considered illegal.&lt;ref name="phantisubvert"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Subversion Act|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno1700.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19570620010101/http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno1700.htm|website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|accessdate=12 September 2015|dead-url=yes|archivedate=20 June 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1992, [[Fidel Ramos]] signed a law repealing the Anti-Subversion law.&lt;ref name=ramoslegalises&gt;{{cite news|title=Ramos legalises Communist Party, frees 48 rebels|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YWNPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KZADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2802%2C1087118|accessdate=12 September 2015|agency=Reuter|publisher=New Straits Times|date=23 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="repealofphantisubvert"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Act Repealing Republic Act Numbered One Thousand Seven Hundred, as Amended, Otherwise Known as the Anti-Subversion Act.|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno7636.htm#.VfQneNKqqkq|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19920922010101/http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno7636.htm#.VfQneNKqqkq|accessdate=12 September 2015|dead-url=yes|archivedate=22 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
A single federal list of organizations recognized as terrorist is used by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. The National Anti-Terrorism Committee maintains a list of terrorist organizations on its website nac.gov.ru, named "Federal United list of Terrorist Organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nac.gov.ru/page/4570.html|script-title=ru:Единый федеральный список организаций, признанных террористическими Верховным Судом Российской Федерации|trans-title=Single federal list of organizations recognized as terrorist by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation|work=Russian Federation National Anti-Terrorism Committee|accessdate=20 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502021516/http://nac.gov.ru/page/4570.html|archivedate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, the [[Donetsk People's Republic|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic]]s are designated as terrorist organizations.

==Early life==
Cheney was born in Madison, Wisconsin. She attended [[McLean High School]] in [[McLean, Virginia]], graduating in the class of 1987.

She earned a graduate business degree from the [[University of Denver]] in 2002.

==Career==
In 1993, she became one of the first employees of the [[Colorado Rockies]] baseball team, working in promotions when the team began playing in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;USA Today.

She has been one of her father's top campaign aides and closest confidantes. In July 2003, she became the Director of Vice Presidential Operations for the [[George W. Bush|Bush]]-Cheney 2004 Presidential re-election campaign.

Cheney is a vice president for consumer advocacy at [[AOL]].&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;Perry, Simon. (April 5, 2007) [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20033753,00.html Mary Cheney Expecting a Boy, Her Dad Reveals] People.com. Accessed May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mary Cheney has been with her wife, Heather Poe, since 1992.

Cheney is openly gay, has voiced support for [[same-sex marriage]], and has been credited with encouraging her father's approval of same-sex marriage,&lt;ref name=nytimes-bush&gt;{{cite news|last=Barbaro|first=Michael|title=Bush's Daughter, in a Break, Endorses Gay Marriage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/us/politics/01bush.html?_r=1|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he has publicly supported since leaving the vice presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 12, 2014 |date=July 30, 2012 |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/79119.html |title=Dick Cheney defends his silence on gay marriage in 2000 |publisher=Politico |work=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801214130/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/79119.html |archivedate=August 1, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2006, Cheney was reported to be pregnant; circumstances surrounding the conception were not reported.&lt;ref name="Argetsinger"&gt;Argetsinger, Amy; Roberts, Roxanne. (December 6, 2006) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/05/AR2006120501712_pf.html Mary Cheney and Partner Are About to Be Moms] ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Accessed May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Cheney and Poe were said to be "ecstatic" about the baby. "The vice president and Mrs. Cheney are looking forward with eager anticipation to the arrival of their sixth grandchild," spokesperson Lea Anne McBride said on December 5.

On January 31, 2007, in a forum by ''[[Glamour Magazine]]'' at [[Barnard College]] of [[Columbia University]], Mary Cheney stated that: "This is a baby... This is a blessing from [[God]]. It is not a political statement. It is not a prop to be used in a debate by people on either side of an issue. It is my child."&lt;ref name="Mooney"&gt;Mooney, Alexander. (February 1, 2007) [http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/02/cheneys-daughter-my-baby-is-not-prop.html Cheney's daughter: My baby 'is not a prop'] CNN.com. Accessed September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Cheney gave birth to their first child, a son, in May 2007.

[[Cynthia Leive]], the editor in chief of ''[[Glamour magazine|Glamour]]'', asked Cheney if she had anything to say to critics like [[James Dobson]]. Cheney accused Dobson of distorting the research he cited and added: "Every piece of remotely responsible research that has been done in the last 20 years has shown there is no difference between children raised by same-sex parents and children raised by opposite-sex parents; what matters is being raised in a stable, loving environment." She also said that Dobson was entitled to his opinion, "but he's not someone whose endorsement I have ever drastically sought."&lt;ref name="Mooney"/&gt;

==Politics==

===2000 presidential campaign===
In 2000, the Bush-Cheney presidential campaign freely discussed [[Liz Cheney]]'s marriage and children, but were silent about Mary Cheney's private life.&lt;ref name="Cloud"/&gt; Nevertheless, Cheney's [[sexual orientation]] was publicly known,&lt;ref name="Cloud" /&gt; and some considered her presence during the campaign as bolstering, providing the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] ticket with a "[[compassionate conservative]]" image.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Mark; Rosenberg, Debra. (February 23, 2004) [http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2004/02/22/something-about-mary.html Something About Mary] ''[[Newsweek]]''. Accessed July 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview with Lynne Cheney, [[Cokie Roberts]] brought up the topic of Mary Cheney's having declared herself gay. Mrs. Cheney responded by stating that "Mary has never declared such a thing,"&lt;ref name="Cullen"&gt;Dave Cullen and Daryl Lindsey. (August 1, 2000) [http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2000/08/01/mary/index.html Gays blast Lynn Cheney's denial about her daughter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016185418/http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2000/08/01/mary/index.html |date=2007-10-16 }} Salon.com. Accessed September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized Roberts and the media for their interest in the story.&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt;

In 2002, Mary Cheney joined the Republican gay-[[heterosexual|straight]] alliance [[Republican Unity Coalition]] and said that sexual orientation should be "a non-issue for the Republican Party," with a goal of "equality for all gay and lesbian Americans."&lt;ref&gt;Morman, Todd. (May 22, 2002) [http://www.republicanunity.com/artcl/spec.htm Gay Baiting with the N.C. GOP] republicanunity.com. Accessed September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Cheney resigned from the RUC's board and in July 2003 became the director of vice presidential operations for the Bush-Cheney 2004 re-election campaign.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

===Federal Marriage Amendment===
In 2004, public attention focused again on Cheney's sexuality, when the Bush administration supported the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], a proposed amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] that would limit marriage to [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] couples and ban [[civil unions]] and [[domestic partnership]] benefits. Cheney did not publicly express her opinion of the amendment at the time. In her 2006 autobiography ''[[Now It's My Turn]]'', Cheney stated her opposition to the amendment. However, at the time, she remained silent to support Bush's re-election bid. In August 2004, Dick Cheney reiterated the position he took in the 2000 Presidential campaign: that the issue should be handled by individual state governments. He added, though, that President Bush determined his administration's policies, and his policy supported the Federal Marriage Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;CNN. (August 25, 2004) [http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/24/cheney.samesex/ Cheney describes same-sex marriage as state issue] CNN.com. Accessed May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 presidential re-election campaign===
During the 2004 Presidential re-election campaign for the Bush-Cheney administration, during which Cheney served as her father's director of vice presidential operations, the subject of her sexual orientation arose again.

The [[U.S. presidential election debates, 2004|2004 presidential election debates]] included mentions of the [[same-sex marriage]] debate and referred, initially indirectly, to Cheney. Both Democratic presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] and vice-presidential candidate [[John Edwards]] mentioned and praised Cheney's openness with regard to her sexual orientation when questioned regarding gay issues. Some commentators viewed these remarks as a gratuitous, cynical appeal to residual [[homophobia]] among [[blue-collar]] voters in key [[swing state]]s.&lt;ref name="Taranto"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110005721 | title=Best of the Web Today | work=Wall Street Journal | date=October 6, 2004 | accessdate=July 19, 2012|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041012083852/http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110005721 | archivedate = October 12, 2004 | author=Taranto, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cheney-Edwards vice-presidential debate, moderator [[Gwen Ifill]] directed a question to the Vice President in which his daughter was indirectly mentioned:&lt;ref name="Ifill"&gt;Ifill, Gwen. (October 5, 2004) [http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-5-2004-transcript The Cheney-Edwards Vice Presidential Debate transcript] [[Case Western Reserve University]]. [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. Accessed July 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I want to read something you said four years ago at this very setting: 'Freedom means freedom for everybody.' You said it again recently when you were asked about legalizing same-sex unions. And you used your family's experience as a context for your remarks. Can you describe then your administration's support for a constitutional ban on same-sex unions?|Gwen Ifill}}

Dick Cheney reiterated his position of four years prior, stating the issue should be left to the states but that he supports the Bush administration. He did not mention his family nor his daughter in his immediate response to the question. In his response, Edwards said:

{{quote|I think the vice president and his wife love their daughter. I think they love her very much. And you can't have anything but respect for the fact that they're willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter, the fact that they embrace her. It's a wonderful thing. And there are millions of parents like that who love their children, who want their children to be happy.|John Edwards}}

Although he was given 90 seconds to respond to Edwards' comments, Dick Cheney responded succinctly, "Well, Gwen, let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter. I appreciate that very much."  
Ms. Ifill followed up: "That's it?"  The vice president replied, "That's it," effectively ending the discussion of his daughter's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Ifill"/&gt; At the end of the debate, Mary Cheney appeared on the podium with her partner and the rest of the family.

During the third and final Bush-Kerry presidential debate, moderator [[Bob Schieffer]] asked, "Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?"  John Kerry replied, "If you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as."&lt;ref&gt;Schieffer, Bob. (October 13, 2004) [http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-13-2004-debate-transcript The Third Bush-Kerry Presidential Debate transcript] [[Arizona State University]]. [[Tempe, Arizona]]. Accessed July 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted an angry response from Dick Cheney, who stated, "You saw a man who will say and do anything in order to get elected. And I am not just speaking as a father here, though I am a pretty angry father."&lt;ref&gt;CNN.com. (October 15, 2004) [http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/10/15/spinning.semantics/index.html Spinning Semantics] Accessed September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 political work ===
In 2010, Mary Cheney became involved in a network of politically active nonprofit organizations. The network is illustrated in this reference:&lt;ref name="opensecrets"/&gt; According to tax forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service, Cheney is a member of the BKM Strategies consulting firm.&lt;ref name="sunlight"&gt;Watzman, Nancy. (March 12, 2014) [http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/03/12/influence-analytics-mary-cheneys-firm-organizes-pro-keystone-xl-blitz/ Influence Analytics: Mary Cheney's firm organizes pro-Keystone XL blitz] Accessed July 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Cheney and two other Republican consultants, Barry Bennett and Kara Ahern, started two nonprofits in the office of BKM Strategies: The Alliance for Freedom and the Alliance for America's Future.  In the same year, Cheney and Kara Ahern established a super PAC, Partnership for America's Future, which is not currently active.&lt;ref name="sunlight"/&gt;

=== 2014 political work ===
In 2014, Cheney's consulting firm BKM Strategies was apparently responsible for a writing campaign in support of the controversial [[Keystone pipeline|Keystone XL pipeline]]. Of the nearly 125,000 comments filed with the State Department, at least 98,000 contained similar pro-pipeline language and came from individuals listing BKM Strategies as the originating organization, according to the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation.&lt;ref name="sunlight"/&gt;

==2006 autobiography==
{{main|Now It's My Turn}}
Mary Cheney left the public spotlight after the 2004 election until May 4, 2006, when she was interviewed by [[Diane Sawyer]] for [[ABC News]]' ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime]]'' program to promote her autobiography, ''[[Now It's My Turn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Diane. (May 3, 2006) [http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=1918918&amp;page=1 Mary Cheney Considered Quitting 2004 Campaign Over Gay Marriage Issue] [[ABC News]]. Accessed May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, published in 2006, Cheney discusses how she came out to her parents, recounting her father's initial reaction: "You know, look, you're my daughter and I love you and I just want you to be happy." She also discusses her relationship with her partner, Heather Poe.

[[Gay rights]] advocates criticized her for waiting until after the 2004 election to voice her disapproval of the Bush administration's positions on gay rights. During another appearance by Cheney on May 19, 2006, on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', Letterman brought up some of the issues raised by the gay community. He asked Cheney why she had waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and rights, and asked whether she had any input with the Bush administration regarding gay issues. Cheney responded that she did not, and that it had not been her job to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McIntee, Michael Z. (May 19, 2006) [http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/wahoo/index/php/20060519.phtml Late Show with David Letterman: The Wahoo Gazette, Show Recap: #2559] CBS.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2892">'''Mordecai Marcus Meisel''' (Mordechaj Marek or '''Miška Marek Meisel (Majzel)''' in [[Czech language|Czech]])  (1528, Prague&amp;ndash;March 13, 1601, Prague) was a [[philanthropist]] and communal leader in [[Prague]]; his father was '''Samuel Meisel'''.

[[File:Grab Mordechai Maisel.JPG|thumb|Grave of Mordechai Meisel at the [[Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague]] (1601).]]

The persecution of the [[Jews]] of Prague by the fanatical [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] occurred while Mordecai was a youth. In 1542 and 1561 his family, with the other Jewish inhabitants, was forced to leave the city, though only for a time. The source of the great wealth which subsequently enabled him to become the benefactor of his coreligionists and to aid the [[Austria]]n imperial house, especially during the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] wars, is unknown. He is mentioned in documents for the first time in 1569, as having business relations with the communal director Isaac Rofe (Lékarz), subsequently his father-in-law. His first wife, Eva, who died before 1580, built with him the [[Jewish Town Hall (Prague)|Jewish Town Hall]] in Prague, which is still standing and serves toda as the headquarters of the [[History of the Jews in the Czech Republic|Czech Jewish Community]], as well as the neighboring [[High Synagogue (Prague)|High Synagogue]], where the Jewish court sat. With his second wife, Frummet, he built (1590–92) the [[Maisel Synagogue]], which was much admired by the Jews of the time, being, next to the [[Altneusynagoge]], the metropolitan synagogue of the city; it still bears his name. The costly golden and silver vessels with which he and his wife furnished this building either were lost during the lawsuit over his estate or were burned during the conflagrations in the [[ghetto]] in 1689 (June 21) and 1754 (May 16). The only gifts dedicated by Meisel and his wife to this synagogue that have been preserved are a curtain (''paroket'') embroidered with hundreds of pearls, a similarly adorned wrapper for the [[Torah|scroll of the Law]], and a magnificent bronze ornament for the ''almemar''. [[Jacob Segre]], rabbi of [[Casale Monferrato]], celebrated the dedication of the synagogue in a poem which is still extant, and his contemporary [[David Gans]], the chronicler of Prague, has described in his ''Tzemach Dawid'' the enthusiasm with which the Jewish population received the gift.

Meisel went on to build quarters and provide housing for Jews who migrated from what is now modern-day [[Belarus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6489">'''Occidentalism''' refers to and identifies [[Representation (arts)|representations]] of [[the Western world]] (the Occident) in two ways: (i) as dehumanizing  [[stereotype]]s of the Western world, [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and [[Israel]], usually from the [[Muslim world]]; and (ii) as ideological representations of the West, as applied in ''Occidentalism: A Theory of Counter-Discourse in Post-Mao China'' (1995), by Chen Xiaomei; ''Occidentalism: Images of the West'' (1995), by James G. Carrier; and ''Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of its Enemies'' (2004), [[Ian Buruma]] and [[Avishai Margalit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jalees-rehman/occidentophobia-the-elephant-in-the-room_b_2460380.html |title=Jalees Rehman, M.D.: 'Occidentophobia': The Elephant in the Room |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occidentalism is often counterpart to the term [[orientalism]] as used by [[Edward Said]] in his [[Orientalism (book)|book]] of that title, which refers to and identifies Western stereotypes of the [[Eastern world]], the Orient.

==Occidental representations==
In China "Traditions Regarding Western Countries" became a regular part of the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' from the 5th century CE, when  commentary about The West concentrated upon on an area that did not extend farther than [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;(Bonnett, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The extension of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries established, represented, and defined the existence of an "Eastern world" and of a "Western world". Western stereotypes appear in works of [[Indian art|Indian]], [[Chinese art|Chinese]] and [[Japanese art|Japanese]] art of those times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hilton |first=Isabel |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/chinese-adaptations-western-classics-shakespeare-pinter-ibsen-edinburgh-international-festival/ |title=Occidentalism |publisher=Prospectmagazine.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Western influence in politics, culture, economics and science came to be constructed through an imaginative geography of West and East.

==Occidentalism debated==
In ''Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of its Enemies'' (2004), Buruma and Margalit said that nationalist and nativist resistance to the West replicates Eastern-world responses against the socio-economic forces of [[modernization]], which originated in Western culture, among [[utopian]] radicals and conservative nationalists who viewed [[capitalism]], [[liberalism]], and [[secularism]] as forces destructive of their societies and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hari |first=Johann |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/preformoccidentalism-by-ian-buruma--avishai-margalitpreform-6163816.html |title=Occidentalism by Ian Buruma &amp; Avishai Margalit - Reviews - Books |publisher=The Independent |date=2004-08-15 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; That the early responses to the West were a genuine encounter between alien cultures, many of the later manifestations of ''Occidentalism'' betray the influence of Western ideas upon Eastern [[intellectual]]s, such as the supremacy of the [[nation-state]], the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejection of rationality, and the spiritual impoverishment of the citizenry of liberal democracies.

Buruma and Margalit trace that resistance to [[German Romanticism]] and to the debates, between the Westernisers and the [[Slavophiles]] in 19th-century [[Russia]], and that like arguments appear in the ideologies of [[Zionism]], [[Maoism]], [[Islamism]], and Imperial [[Japanese nationalism]]. Nonetheless, Alastair Bonnett rejects the analyses of Buruma and Margalit as Eurocentric, and said that the field of Occidentalism emerged from the interconnection of Eastern and Western intellectual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jul 2, 2005 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GG02Ak01.html |title=Asia Times Online :: Middle East News, Iraq, Iran current affairs |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2005-07-02 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Jacques |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/04/society |title=Review: Occidentalism by Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date=2004-09-04 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/jan/17/occidentalism/?pagination=false |title=Occidentalism by Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit &amp;#124; The New York Review of Books |publisher=Nybooks.com |date=2002-01-17 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organoleptic properties''' are the aspects of food, water or other substances that an individual experiences via the [[sense]]s—including [[taste]], [[Visual perception|sight]], smell, and touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/food.200390018/abstract;jsessionid=DB3C74CDDB757A47A2BF4CF25FD8ABE3.f04t03 | title=Studies on organoleptic properties of food products from fresh egg and egg powder through principal component analysis | doi=10.1002/food.200390018 | volume=47 | journal=Nahrung/Food | pages=102–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Influence of pre-drying treatments on physicochemical and organoleptic properties of explosion puff dried jackfruit chips | pmid=27162392 | doi=10.1007/s13197-015-2127-2 | volume=53 | pmc=4837745 | journal=J Food Sci Technol | pages=1120–9 | last1 = Yi | first1 = J | last2 = Zhou | first2 = L | last3 = Bi | first3 = J | last4 = Chen | first4 = Q | last5 = Liu | first5 = X | last6 = Wu | first6 = X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==USDA uses==
In traditional [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[Food Safety and Inspection Service|meat and poultry inspections]], inspectors perform various organoleptic procedures to detect disease or contamination. Such techniques are part of the effort to detect invisible foodborne [[pathogen]]s that cause [[food poisoning]].

Organoleptic tests are sometimes conducted to determine if food or pharmaceutical products can transfer tastes or odors to the materials and components they are packaged in.  [[Shelf life]] studies often use taste, sight, and smell (in addition to food chemistry and toxicology tests) to determine whether a food product is safe to consume.

Organoleptic analyses are, occasionally, still used when the protocol for a certain sample does not have a high enough sample throughput to meet the demand. In this case, organoleptic analyses serves as a primary screen to determine which samples must be analyzed according to the original method protocol, and which samples need no further [[sensory analysis]].

==Other examples==
Measurements of pepper spiciness on the [[Scoville scale]] depend upon an organoleptic test.  The quality of extracts used in [[phytotherapy]] is assessed in part using organoleptic tests.  Organoleptic qualities are considered part of [[Hurdle technology]]. Indicators identified organoleptically as part of [[European Union wine regulations]] are assessed when qualifying for a [[Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions|Quality Wine indicator]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">The '''provincial organization of volunteers and civil defence''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: '''''organização provincial de voluntários e defesa civil''''') or '''OPVDC''' was a former [[militia]] type force in each of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Overseas provinces]]. There were three such organizations raised by the [[Portuguese Government]] in their overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Timor]].

The OPVDC had the tasks of auxiliary [[internal security]] force and [[civil defense]] organization, under the authority of the governor of the province. The OPVDC of Angola and Mozambique were engaged in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] as auxiliary forces of the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]].

In the Portuguese Overseas, the OPVDC were the correspondent of the [[Portuguese Legion (Estado Novo)|Portuguese Legion]] in the European Portugal.

==Angola==
Provincial Organization of Volunteers of Civil Defence of Angola (OPVDCA) - mainly urban militia, consisting mainly of white settlers.

The OPVDCA was formed by officers of the asset or the reserve of the Armed Forces, but was dependent on the Civil Administration, and its maximum in the [[Governor-General]] of the province. The function of OPVDCA was essentially in defence of people, lines of communications and sensitive installations.

Members of OPVDCA volunteers were civilians who had their professions, serving in the organization part-time. Initially the OPVDCA was constituted only by white settlers, but later it became increasingly multi-racial.  At its peak the OPVDCA reached more than 40,000 staff.

The "Queen Louise League" or '''Königin-Luise-Bund''', often shortened to '''Luisenbund''', was a [[Germany|German]] pro-[[monarchic]] women's organization. It was established in 1923 during the time of the [[Weimar Republic]] and lasted until the first years of the [[Third Reich]]. This organization was inspired on the figure of [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], Queen of [[Prussia]], held in reverence by many Germans of the time. The Bund Königin Luise had also a children branch known as '''Kinderkreis''' (Children Circle).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2CNPsURFjWkC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Kinderkreis+nationalsozialisten&amp;source=web&amp;ots=GeSIrhU-GW&amp;sig=yJxPRa3Up6XP6cZLXSZgBvEVxp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Liederbuch für den Kinderkreis: Das Kornblümchen Hg. von der Bundesleitung des Bundes Königin Luise, Halle a.d.S. 1933]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen Louise League as an organization had [[cult]]ic overtones&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Demandt, ''Luisenkult'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt; built around the veneration of the former Prussian queen as a role model for all German women. She became idealized for her feminine virtues, her determination and her love for her country, as well as for her beauty and the fact that [[Napoleon]], portrayed as an "enemy of everything German", hated her.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Thiele, ''Geliebte Luise. Königin von Preußen. Ihr Leben in Bildern.'' Nicolaische Verlagsbuchhandlung Berlin 2003, {{ISBN|3-89479-094-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league's ideals were distilled into a booklet named ''ABC für unsere Arbeit'' (ABC for our Work) which every member had to know by heart.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Demandt, ''Luisenkult'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of the emergent nationalistic movements of the time, this organization was highly structured, with local branches all over Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.gaponline.de/alois.schwarzmueller/ns_zeit_1933_quellen/02_patriotische_vereine.htm Der Königin-Luise-Bund - Ortsgruppe Garmisch-Partenkirchen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Queen Louise League was politically very close to far-right German parties of the time, like the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) and also the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] paramilitary organization from its establishment. Many wives of Stahlhelm members belonged to the Queen Louise League and they were, like their husbands, strongly opposed to democracy&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B2RiYX6aC68C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=Bund+K%C3%B6nigin-Luise&amp;source=web&amp;ots=C83illAKuk&amp;sig=hO8p305TjuUtUZ65t_WaSH0P4Fw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result Conan Fisher, ''The Rise of National Socialism and the Working Classes in Weimar'', Berghahn Books, Providence/Oxford 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; and in favor of [[German re-armament]].  

After the [[Machtergreifung]], or takeover of the government by [[Adolf Hitler]], the Queen Louise League was initially welcomed by the [[Nazi party]] as an ally. There were strong bonds between both movements owing to their common extremely conservative ideology and solid German nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qordZfHIL5wC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Bund+K%C3%B6nigin-Luise&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Eg8ea-JM_&amp;sig=LaieNWhy7MaBcAGD2KC1kZbB4ws&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result Geraldine Horan, ''Mothers, Warriors, Guardians of the Soul'' - 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;
Campaigning along with the brownshirts for a [[Greater Germanic Reich|"Greater Germany"]] with expanded borders and "freedom from [[World War I reparations|weight of the reparations]]", the League's members had taken active part in parades and events organized by the Nazis even before their accession to power. The Queen Louise League shared as well with the [[Reichskolonialbund]] the demand for the return of the former German colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.gaponline.de/alois.schwarzmueller/ns_zeit_1933_quellen/02_patriotische_vereine.htm 1933 - Der Beginn der nationalsozialistischen Diktatur/ Vaterländische Ziele des Bundes Königin Luise]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its ideological affinity with most of the Third Reich's nationalistic ideals, the Queen Louise League was disbanded all the same by the Nazi government in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B2RiYX6aC68C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=Bund+K%C3%B6nigin-Luise&amp;source=web&amp;ots=C83illAKuk&amp;sig=hO8p305TjuUtUZ65t_WaSH0P4Fw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result Conan Fisher, ''The Rise of National Socialism and the Working Classes in Weimar'', Berghahn Books, Providence/Oxford 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason was the difference in local practices, be it at the [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]] or national level, which didn't match those wished by the Nazi leadership of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Stephenson, The Nazi Organisation of Women, London 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Following its dissolution the members and departments of the Königin-Luise-Bund were [[Gleichschaltung|integrated]] into the corresponding branches for women and children of the Nazi Party, like the [[NS-Frauenschaft]] (Nazi Women's League), [[Bund Deutscher Mädel]] (League of German Girls) and its children section into the [[National Socialist Schoolchildren's League]] (NSS) or the ''Kinderschar'' of the Nazi Women's League.

[[Image:Recruiting sergeant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A recruiting sergeant outside an inn, c1813]]

A '''recruiting sergeant''' is a British or American soldier of the rank of [[sergeant]] who is tasked to enlist recruits. The term originated in the British army of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The playwright [[George Farquhar]] served as an infantry officer, and the characters in his play ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]'' (1706) are drawn from life.

{{quote|If any gentlemen soldiers, or others, have a mind to serve Her Majesty, and pull down the French king; if any prentices have severe masters, any children have unnatural parents; if any servants have too little wages, or any husband too much wife; let them repair to the noble Sergeant Kite, at the Sign of the Raven, in this good town of Shrewsbury, and they shall receive present relief and entertainment.}}

The unscrupulous methods used by some to trick the innocent have been the subject of several traditional songs composed by their victims as a warning to others, popular examples being the [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional]] song ''[[Arthur McBride]]'' and the Scots ''Twa Recruiting Sergeants''.

A recruit would be given the [[Shilling#References_in_popular_culture|King's shilling]] as a mark of the contract made.

The term has passed into the English language to mean any set of  circumstances which recruits or fails to recruit volunteers to the army. See ''Daily Telegraph'' headline

The '''Save Romania Union''' ({{lang-ro|Uniunea Salvați România}}, USR) is a [[list of political parties in Romania|political party in Romania]]. The party was founded following the success of the [[Save Bucharest Union]] (USB) party in the [[Romanian local elections, 2016|2016 local elections]]. After being officially registered as a political party in 2016, it united with the local USB and Union for Codlea parties, thus gaining most of its initial membership base from the two latter parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-politic-21238686-usb-usr-uniunea-pentru-codlea-fuzioneaza-duminica-intr-eveniment-usile-inchise.htm|title=USB, USR si Uniunea pentru Codlea au fuzionat duminica intr-un eveniment cu usile inchise|language=ro-RO|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently the third largest political party in the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] after the [[Romanian legislative election, 2016|2016 legislative elections]] and runs on an anti-corruption platform.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/interview/dan-barna-save-romania-union-similar-to-macrons-en-marche/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and issues==
[[Dan Barna]], the leader of USR, characterized the party as "generally centre-right",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; leaning centre-right on economic policy and centrist in terms of social policy. However, USR has a substantial amount of both progressive and conservative members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/politic/nicusor-dan-usr-are-doua-probleme-conflictul-dintre-progresisti-si-conservatori-si-lipsa-de-colegialitate-si-de-incredere.html|title=Nicusor Dan: USR are doua probleme: conflictul dintre progresisti si conservatori si lipsa de colegialitate si de incredere|work=Stirileprotv.ro|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared the party with [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s [[La République En Marche!]], while mentioning that the key difference between the two is that USR predominantly consists of people who have not been involved in politics before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Anti-corruption campaign ===
Since its foundation USR has supported the [[Corruption in Romania#Anti-corruption measures|anti-corruption drive in Romania]] and the activity of the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]]. USR was against the modifications to the justice laws initiated by the government coalition [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]]-[[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (Romania)|ALDE]] and requested the rejection of OUG 13 (''see also the [[2017–2018 Romanian protests]]'').

In 2018 USR helped and supported the initiators of ''Fără Penali în Funcții Publice'' ("No Convicts in Public Office") civic campaign, whose objective is to bar the persons convicted to final imprisonment sentences for [[Mens rea|intentional offences]] from being elected to [[local government]], the [[Chamber of Deputies (Romania)|Chamber of Deputies]], the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] or the office of [[President of Romania]] by amending the Article 37 of the [[Constitution of Romania|Romanian Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://farapenaliinfunctiipublice.ro/|title=Fără Penali în Funcții Publice ("No Convicts in Public Office")|language=Romanian|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which regulates the [[nomination rules]]). USR and volunteers collected more than 1{{nbsp}}million signatures from eligible voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/politica/usr-initiativa-cetateneasca-fara-penali-in-functii-publice-a-strans-peste-1-000-000-de-semnaturi-984347|title=USR: Iniţiativa cetăţenească "Fără penali în funcţii publice" a strâns peste 1.000.000 de semnături ("USR: The Civic Initiative 'No Convicts in Public Office' Collected Over 1 Million Signatures")|date=21 August 2018|accessdate=5 October 2018|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LGBT rights ===
USR's position on [[LGBT rights in Romania|LGBT issues]] is not clearly defined. The party leader, [[Dan Barna]], declared: "Gay marriage is not yet a subject for the public agenda, there is no initiative promoting same-sex marriage. Maybe in 20, 30 years next generations will take care of this problem, but for now, this is not a priority."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, USR was the only parliamentary party in Romania that did not support the [[Romanian constitutional referendum, 2018|constitutional referendum]], proposed by [[Coaliția pentru Familie]] (CpF) and supported by the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. The constitutional amendment proposed to change the definition of family in order to prohibit the [[same-sex marriage]], however it failed, as the turnout was only 21.1%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://referendum2018.bec.ro/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/prezenta_16.01.pdf Referendumul naţional pentru revizuirea Constituţiei din 6 și 7 octombrie 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; below the required voter turnout threshold of 30%.&lt;ref name="BEC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Prezența vot |url=http://prezenta.bec.ro/ |website=Biroul Electoral Central |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-referendum/romanian-constitutional-ban-on-same-sex-marriage-fails-on-low-vote-turnout-idUSKCN1MH0XI?il=0|title=Romanian constitutional ban on same sex marriage fails on low vote turnout|work=Reuters|date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; USR considered the referendum a way to divide the Romanian people and to distract the attention from the real issues Romania currently faces, such as corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ziare.com/referendum-constitutie-familie/vot/usr-indeamna-oamenii-sa-boicoteze-referendumul-pentru-familie-1530170|title=USR indeamna alegatorii sa boicoteze referendumul pentru familie ("USR Urges the Voters to Boycott the Family Referendum")|date=18 September 2018|accessdate=5 October 2018|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roșia Montană ===
USR supported the inclusion of the [[Roșia Montană|Roşia Montană]] site in UNESCO World Heritage. At the 42nd session of the [[World Heritage site|UNESCO World Heritage]] Committee, held in [[Manama]], [[Bahrain]], the government's representative, Ştefan Răzvan Rab, state secretary of the Ministry of Culture, in [[Bahrain]], on June 24 to July 4, asked for postponement on behalf of Romania including the Rosia Montana Mining Cultural Landscape in the World Heritage List until the completion of the judicial dispute with [[Gabriel Resources]], an unprecedented fact in the history of [[UNESCO]].  USR Senator [[Vlad Alexandrescu]], under whose Ministry of Culture 2015-2016 Roşia Montană was included in the UNESCO indicative list, accused the PSD-ALDE government coalition of treason, writing in a post on 2 July 2018 on Facebook:

"It is Romania's most shameful moment since being a member of UNESCO. All the other states of the world carry a fierce negotiation these days so that their monuments are included in the UNESCO list, and each success is welcomed with cheers and cheers. In contrast to the civilized world is Romania. The only state that has campaigned for its monument not to be on this list. A state seized by a bunch of villains  who do not give a damn about the importance of heritage. All they want is to leave UNESCO in peace with their ideas, to make a crater over Roşia Montană so that they can fill their pockets. Of course, the rest of the states know this, not everyone is as "professional" as our government. And so we will be known from now on, those who sell their patrimony for the welfare of their politicians. What you have done here, members and representatives of the Government, is treason. You have acted so that our patrimony is reduced to a crater in the near future. And this will not be without consequences, I promise you! "

=== European affiliation ===
USR supports [[Romania]]'s membership of the [[European Union]] and is in favor of a joint European external policy and [[Common Security and Defence Policy|military]] and of Romania's accession to the [[Schengen Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usr.ro/programe/romania-in-lume/|title=Arhive România în lume - Uniunea Salvați România|website=Uniunea Salvați România|language=ro-RO|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not being part of a pan-European political party yet, USR has had negotiations with [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|ALDE]] and to a lesser extent with the [[European People's Party|EPP]] and the [[European Green Party|European Greens]]. USR's hesitation to join [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|ALDE]] is due to the fact that a Romanian party they vehemently oppose ([[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (Romania)|ALDE]]) is part of the European party and bears the exact same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.g4media.ro/ghinea-usr-are-discutii-active-cu-partidul-european-alde.html|title=Ghinea: USR are discuții active cu partidul european ALDE|date=2018-06-15|work=G4Media.ro|access-date=2018-10-11|language=ro-RO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9031">'''Sports Backers''' is a non-profit organization founded in 1991 and located in Richmond, Virginia at [[Sports Backers Stadium]]. The mission of the Sports Backers has expanded from its beginnings as a traditional sports commission for economic development to be focused on increasing physical activity to improve the health of area residents. The Sports Backers created [http://www.movementmakers.com Movement Makers], a national active living conference to encourage community health organizations that promote physical activity to have a place to gather and learn from each other.  The annual event takes place in Richmond, Virginia and occurs at the same time as Dominion Riverrock. 
The Sports Backers own Dominion Riverrock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dominion Riverrock Event Organizers|url=http://www.dominionriverrock.com/sponsors/|website=Dominion Riverrock|publisher=Dominion Riverrock|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest outdoor sports and music festival in the country,&lt;ref name=Richmond.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Dominion Riverrock Sees Record Attendance|url=http://www.richmond.com/events/article_4293843e-dee9-11e3-933c-001a4bcf6878.html|website=Richmond.com |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Monument Avenue 10K|Ukrop's Monument Avenue 10k]], the 8th largest running race in the United States,&lt;ref name="Running USA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest Running Races|url=http://www.runningusa.org/largest-races|website=Runningusa.org|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Richmond Marathon|Anthem Richmond Marathon]], the 18th largest marathon in the country.&lt;ref name="Running USA 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest Marathons in USA|url=http://www.runningusa.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=reports.statistics |website=Runningusa.org|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization owns and produces 15 events.  The organization also supports other organizations with more than 24 major sports tourism events in the Richmond region receiving annual support through marketing grants, operational assistance and loaning equipment.&lt;ref name="Sports Backers Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Events Sports Tourism|url=http://www.sportsbackers.org|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports Backers was named the Member of the Year by the [[National Association of Sports Commissions]] in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015.&lt;ref name="National Association of Sports Commissions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the Year Awards|url=http://sportscommissions.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/nasc-recognizes-outstanding-members-at-2011-nasc-sports-event-symposium/|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon Lugbill|Jon Lugbill]] is the organization's executive director and has been leading the organization since 1993.

==Active RVA==

The Sports Backers added a number of programs in 2012 under the shared moniker of Active RVA, a region-wide initiative to motivate area residents, businesses and local governments to make physical activity a personal and regional priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adding Physical Activity to the Work Place|url=http://www.timesdispatch.com/entertainment-life/health/fitness/fitness-adding-physical-activity-to-the-workplace/article_84454ceb-d1d1-5803-be04-ff624be2b324.html|work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization has started a program to certify schools and businesses that go above and beyond to increase physical activity for their students and employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active RVA Certification for Companies|url=http://www.activerva.org/work/active-rva-certification-fit-companies/|website=ActiveRVA.org|publisher=Active RVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another program encourages the use of stairs through a stairwell signage initiative.  A fitness oasis program exists to increase fitness opportunities in underserved parts of the region.  The success of the Active RVA program is being measured through a combination of community indicators that has resulted in the region receiving a "C" grade for its overall fitness programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riggan|first1=Phil|title=Sports Backers Grade Richmond's Fitness|url=http://www.richmond.com/recreation/article_5c49a112-9329-11e3-9105-001a4bcf6878.html|website=Richmond.com|publisher=Richmond.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bike Walk RVA==

The Active RVA effort includes Bike Walk RVA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Andy|title=Outdoors: New Program to Benefit Bike, Pedestrian Policies|url=http://www.timesdispatch.com/sports/columnists-blogs/andy-thompson/outdoors-new-program-to-benefit-bike-pedestrian-policies/article_e1866d5e-01ec-5750-b22a-b27d2ad06da5.html|website=timesdipsatch.com|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a program of the Sports Backers to support bike and pedestrian friendly policies, programs and infrastructure projects. The Sports Backers work with area leaders and public works staff to fund and install bike lanes, trails and sidewalks.  The strength of the program is based on 40,000 individuals from around the region that are part of the Bike Walk RVA advocacy database.  These advocates send e-mails, show up at public hearings, write letters and organize support for biking and pedestrian improvements in their neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="CBS 6 Richmond"&gt;{{cite web|title=Advocates Want to Make it Safer to Cycle|url=http://wtvr.com/2013/05/16/bike-enthusiasts-want-to-make-it-safer-to-cycle-river-city/|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sports Backers measure the success of the Bike Walk RVA program by measuring the total miles of bike lanes, paved trails and dirt trails added each year.  In 2012 the Sports Backers staff rode, ran or walked every mile of existing bike lanes and trails (paved and dirt) in the Richmond region.  The resulting baseline report provides the starting point for the region's bike infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Sports Backers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bicycle Baseline Infrastructure Report|url=http://www.richmond.com/recreation/article_5c49a112-9329-11e3-9105-001a4bcf6878.html|website=Richmond.com|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kids Run RVA==

Each year, thousands of area youth participate in the Sports Backers' Kids Run RVA program which includes a variety of ways to support and reward youth athletic achievement.  In 2014, there were 10,000 youth that took part in the Kids Challenge running and walking incentive program at elementary schools throughout the Richmond region.  Another program, the Healthy School Challenge rewarded middle and high school students for participating in the Ukrop's Monument Avenue 10k.  A particular emphasis is placed on outreach to underserved schools by offering grants and support to encourage participation in specific programs.

==Scholarship program==
{{third-party|date=March 2017}}
The Sports Backers have been providing scholarships to area student athletes since 1992.  Since the start of the scholarship program, Sports Backers have given over $660,000 to more than 395 student athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholarships|url=http://www.sportsbackers.org/scholarships/|website=Sports Backers|publisher=Sports Backers}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2014, the organization provided $65,000 in scholarship funds to area student athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholar-Athlete Awards Dinner|url=http://www.sportsbackers.org/other/richmond-times-dispatchsports-backers-scholar-athlete-finalists-announced/|website=Sports Backers|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization also provides recognition and financial awards for the top high school athletic teams and the "comeback athletes" of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholar Athletes of the Year|url=http://www.timesdispatch.com/sports/high-school/schools/james-river/roberts-and-thornhill-named-scholar-athletes-of-the-year/article_456c75a0-cc96-11e2-9d36-0019bb30f31a.html|work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation''' (or '''UN-REDD Programme''') is a collaborative programme of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), created in 2008 in response to the [[UNFCCC]] decisions on the [[Bali Action Plan]] and [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|REDD]] at [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP-13]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.un-redd.org UN-REDD Programme official website.]&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with "REDD+", a voluntary climate change mitigation approach that has been developed by Parties to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]] (see below "Difference between REDD+ and the UN-REDD Programme").

The overall development goal of the Programme is "to reduce forest emissions and enhance carbon stocks in forests while contributing to national sustainable development".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;view=document&amp;alias=14096-un-redd-pb14-2015-strategic-framework&amp;category_slug=session-3-strategic-and-policy-issues&amp;Itemid=134|title=UN-REDD Programme 2016-2020 Strategic Framework|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN-REDD Programme supports nationally led REDD+ processes and promotes the informed and meaningful involvement of all stakeholders, including indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities, in national and international REDD+ implementation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Programme has expanded steadily since its establishment and now has over 60 official Partner Countries spanning Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America-Caribbean.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unredd.net|title=UN-REDD Programme Online Collaborative Workspace|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the UN-REDD Programme, other initiatives assisting countries that are engaged in [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|REDD+]] include the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative, the Global Environment Facility, Australia’s International Forest Carbon Initiative, the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, and the Green Climate Fund.

The UN-REDD Programme publicly releases each year an Annual Programme Progress Report and a Semi-Annual Report.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Support to Partner Countries ==

The UN-REDD Programme supports its Partner Countries through:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Direct funding and technical support to the design and implementation of National REDD+ Programmes;
* Complementary tailored funding and technical support to national REDD+ actions; and
* Technical country capacity enhancing support through sharing of expertise, common approaches, analyses, methodologies, tools, data, best practices and facilitated South-South knowledge sharing.

== Governance ==
The UN-REDD Programme's 2016-2020 governance arrangements allow for the full and effective participation of all UN-REDD Programme stakeholders – partner countries, donors, indigenous peoples, civil society organizations, participating UN agencies – while ensuring streamlined decision-making processes and clear lines of accountability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The governance arrangements are built on and informed by five principles: inclusiveness, transparency, accountability, consensus-based decisions and participation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

UN-REDD Programme 2016-2020 governance arrangements include:

=== Executive Board  ===

The [http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2338&amp;Itemid=804 UN-REDD Programme Executive Board]  has general oversight for the Programme, taking decisions on the allocation of the UN-REDD Programme fund resources. It meets bi-annually, or more frequently as required to efficiently carry out its roles and responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Assembly ===

The [http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2337&amp;Itemid=803 UN-REDD Programme Assembly] is a broad multi-stakeholder forum with the role to foster consultation, dialogue and knowledge exchange among UN-REDD Programme stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== National Steering Committees ===

National Steering Committees facilitate strong country ownership and shared/common decision-making for National REDD+ Programmes, and include representatives of civil society and indigenous peoples. Each National Steering Committee provides oversight for National Programmes, addressing any delays, changes or reorientation of a programme and ensuring alignment with and delivery of results as expected and approved by the Executive Board.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Multi-Party Trust Fund Office ===

The [http://mptf.undp.org/factsheet/fund/CCF00 Multi-Party Trust Fund Office] provides real-time funding administration to the UN-REDD Programme.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== 2016-2020 Strategic Framework ==
The work of the UN-REDD Programme is guided by its [http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;view=document&amp;alias=14096-un-redd-pb14-2015-strategic-framework&amp;category_slug=session-3-strategic-and-policy-issues&amp;Itemid=134 2016-2020 Strategic Framework], with the goal to: Reduce forest emissions and enhance carbon stocks in forests while contributing to national sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In order to realize its goal and target impacts, the Programme has set three outcomes and supporting outputs for its 2016-2020 work programme:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Contributions of REDD+ to the mitigation of climate change as well as to the provision of additional benefits have been designed.
# Country contributions to the mitigation of climate change though REDD+ are measured, reported and verified and necessary institutional arrangements are in place.
# REDD+ contributions to the mitigation of climate change are implemented and safeguarded with policies and measures that constitute results-based actions, including the development of appropriate and effective institutional arrangements.
Additionally, the Programme has identified four important cross-cutting themes as being particularly significant in order to ensure that the outcomes and outputs of the Programme will achieve results as desired: Stakeholder Engagement, Forest Governance, Tenure Security and Gender Equality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Donors ==
The UN-REDD Programme depends entirely on voluntary funds. Donors to the UN-REDD Programme have included the European Commission and governments of  Denmark, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain and Switzerland—with Norway providing a significant portion of the funds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Transparency ==
The UN-REDD Programme adheres to the belief that information is fundamental to the effective participation of all stakeholders, including the public, in the advancement of REDD+ efforts around the world. Information sharing promotes transparency and accountability and enables public participation in REDD+ activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The collaborating UN agencies of the UN-REDD Programme –  FAO, UNEP and UNDP – are committed to making information about the Programme and its operations available to the public in the interest of transparency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As part of this commitment, the Programme publishes [http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;view=list&amp;slug=programme-progress-reports-785&amp;Itemid=134 annual and semi-annual programme progress reports] and provides [http://mptf.undp.org/factsheet/fund/CCF00 online public access to real-time funding administration].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Difference between REDD+ and the UN-REDD Programme ==
[[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|REDD+]] is a voluntary climate change mitigation approach that has been developed by Parties to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]]. It aims to incentivize developing countries to reduce emissions from deforestation and [[forest degradation]], conserve forest carbon stocks, sustainably manage forests and enhance forest carbon stocks. 

The United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries – or UN-REDD Programme – is a multilateral body. It partners with developing countries to support them in establishing the technical capacities needed to implement REDD+ and meet UNFCCC requirements for REDD+ results-based payments. It does so through a country-based approach that provides advisory and technical support services tailored to national circumstances and needs. The UN-REDD Programme is a collaborative programme of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and harnesses the technical expertise of these UN agencies. Other examples of REDD+ multilaterals include the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and Forest Investment Program, hosted by The World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;view=document&amp;alias=15279-fact-sheet-about-redd&amp;category_slug=fact-sheets&amp;Itemid=134|title=Fact Sheet: About REDD+|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=|publisher=UN-REDD Programme|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], the term '''universal powers''' referred to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[Pope]]. Both were struggling for the so-called ''[[Dominium mundi]]'', or world dominium, in terms of political and spiritual supremacy. The emperor and the pope maintained their respective authorities through diverse factors such as territorial dispersion, low level of technic{{clarify|date=September 2010|reason="technic" singular is not a word, certainly not a common word}} and productive development in feudal [[mode of production]], and social and political tendency of [[feudalism]] to [[decentralization]] of [[political power|power]].

The universal powers continued into the early 19th century until the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The reshaping of Europe meant the effective end of the Empire. Although the Papacy had its territorial limits confined to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], it retained its [[soft power]] in the contemporary world.

==Origins==
{{Main|Dominium mundi}}
Given the [[Caesaropapism]]{{Technical-statement|date=July 2011}} of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the situation in the [[Western World]] after the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] assumed an exceptionally powerful position of the [[Bishop of Rome]]. As the only [[patriarch]] in the Western World, his status was soon converted into that of a [[primate (bishop)]].  In addition to this spiritual power, the Bishop of Rome sought to gain [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]] over a territory held by various Germanic Kingdoms in order to make it a true [[theocracy]]. The Bishop of Rome tried to extend his territory from the city of [[Rome]] to the whole of [[Italy]] and further to the whole of the [[Western Roman Empire]] (in accordance with the [[Donation of Constantine]]).  The coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in the year 800, which began the [[Carolingian Empire]], marked the appearance of a secular authority with universal claims.  The two century long coexistence of the Pontiff and the Empire (regnum et sacerdocium) was difficult and yielded the [[Investiture Controversy]] and several different ideological formulations (the theory of the [[Divine Right of Kings|two swords]], Plenitutdo postestatis, ''[[Dictatus papae]]'', condemnations of [[simony]], and [[nicolaism]]).  In these the Pope tried to establish the supremacy of [[religious authority]] over [[civil authority]]. Meanwhile, the Emperor tried to enforce the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of his position, which claimed to come from the old Roman Empire (''[[Translatio imperii]]'').  In order to do this, he established his military capability to impose his territorial power and extend his power over religious life. This was done in a manner similar to that of his equivalent in the East.  Both efforts fell far short of their goals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julio Valdeón Baruque]] y [[José Ángel García de Cortázar]], in FERNÁNDEZ ÁLVAREZ, Manuel; AVILÉS FERNÁNDEZ, Miguel y ESPADAS BURGOS, Manuel (dirs.) (1986), Gran Historia Universal (volúmenes 11 y 12), Barcelona, Club Internacional del Libro. {{ISBN|84-7461-654-9}}. Especially Julio Valdeón: ''La época de las ideas universales. El pontificado y el imperio. Las criuzadas. Capetos y Angevinos'', pp. 131–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The division of the Carolingian Empire between the heirs of [[Louis the Pious]] and the claims of different dynasties, such as the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] and the [[House of Hohenstaufen]], to the imperial title, debilitated the power of the emperors and subjected them to a system of election. The system of election made them dependent on a delicate game of alliances between the nobles that held the title of [[Prince-Elector]], some laymen and others clergymen. Notwithstanding, he would periodically try to regain imperial power ([[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]]). At times this led to spectacular confrontations ([[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]], [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]).  The strengthening of the power of the papacy was very important from Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] on, and depended on the support of the monastic orders, above all the [[Cluny Abbey|Order of Cluny]]. The constitution of many of these new kingdoms made them feudally obligated to the Pope, which liberated them from the theoretical feudal subjugation of the emperor or another king (such was the case of [[Portugal]]). In the territory of the Sacred Empire, the rivalry between the [[Guelphs]], supporting the Papacy, and [[Ghibellines]], supporting the Emperor, dominated [[Germany|German]] and [[Italy|Italian]] political life from the 12th to the 15th century.

Eventually, the authority of the Emperor was converted into something purely theoretical, lacking a strong economic or military base. He was incapable of not only standing up to the [[feudal monarchies]] definitively free of all subordination ''Rex superiorem non recognoscens in regno suo est Imperator'' (Decretal Per Venerabilem by [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]], 1202),&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco Tomás y Valiente]] et al. (1996) [''Autonomía y soberanía. Una consideración histórica''], Madrid: Marcial Pons; cited in ''Revista de estudios histórico-jurídicos'' nº 21, Valparaíso 1999
{{ISSN|0716-5455}} [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FmOL-1KaGtsJ:www.scielo.cl/scielo.php%3Fpid%3DS0716-54551999002100056%26script%3Dsci_arttext+rex+est+imperator+in+regno+suo&amp;hl=es&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=es]&lt;/ref&gt; but to his own territorial princes or Italian city-states.  The papal authority also decayed.  The [[Crusades]], advocated by the pope, did not give him more control of the briefly conquered territories in the [[Holy Land]], the European kingdoms, or of the new [[religious orders]]. With the [[Avignon Papacy]] and the [[Western Schism]], the French Monarchy subjugated the Papacy to its control. This further weakened the Pope's power and undermined the intimidating power of [[excommunication]], which had been greatly feared.&lt;ref&gt;Julio Valdeón, ''op. cit.'', ''El siglo XIII. El fin de las construcciones universales. El auge de las monarquías nacionales'', vol. 12 pp. 161–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of theoretical arguments on the theme of universal power, on the other hand, continued and included contributions such as those of [[Marsilius of Padua]], ''Defensor Pacis'' or [[William of Ockham]], ''Eight Questions about the Authority of the Pope'' (1342) and ''De imperatorum et pontificum potestate'' (1347).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dykinson.com/book--Sobre_el_poder_de_los_emperadores_y_los_papas--21160.2.7..1.html Bibliographic review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710160611/http://www.dykinson.com/book--Sobre_el_poder_de_los_emperadores_y_los_papas--21160.2.7..1.html |date=2011-07-10 }} of this.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such works continued to undermine the universal ambitions of both authorities and were produced by the most important authors of the scholasticism crisis.  The scholasticism crisis debated the adoption and extension of new legal ideas taken from [[Roman Law]], with the ''[[jus commune]]'' of the School of Bologna on one side and [[conciliarism]] of the Counsel of Florence on the other.

Both universal powers entered the [[Modern Age]] very debilitated, although their power continued to be notable. They tried to recoup what was lost.

The reality that was imposed during the [[Ancien Régime]] was that of new authoritarian monarchies (such as the [[Catholic Monarchs|Catholic Monarchy]]) that evolved towards [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] (as in [[France]]) or towards the bourgeois revolutions (as in [[the Netherlands]] with the [[Dutch Revolt]] and in [[England]] with the [[English Civil War]]).  In 1648 the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] definitively supplanted the role of the universal powers and brought about modern, [[Secularization|secularized]] [[international relations]] based on [[pragmatism]] and the prominence of [[Sovereign state|states]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentina-rree.com/2/2-002.htm ''La evolución del sistema interestatal desde la Paz de Westfalia hasta la Revolución Francesa, vista desde una perspectiva analítica'' (The evolution of the interstatal system from the Peace of Westphalia until the French Revolution, view from an analytic perspective), that cites as a source Rosecrance, The Rise of the Trading State. Commerce and Conquest in the Modern World, New York, Basic Books, 1986.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Even within Catholic countries, the theory that only monarchs could grant [[royalties]] effectively limited the pontifical power.

The 19th century was the end of both universal powers as territorial entities: the Sacro Imperio was formally abolished by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who created his own empire, and although Napoleon's empire was defeated, the Holy Roman Empire was not restored in the redrawing of the European map following the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–1815). The territories recuperated by the [[Habsburg dynasty]] were transformed into a multinational state, first as the [[Austrian Empire]] and later as a dual monarchy, the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], which lasted until 1918. Additionally, the leadership of [[Prussia]] in the recently created [[German Confederation]] brought about the constitution of the [[Second German Empire]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, the relations of the Pope with the [[French Revolution]] and Napoleon, as with ideological [[liberalism]] itself, oscillated between direct opposition and forced coexistence.  In 1860, the new [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], formed by the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], conquered the [[Papal States|Papal States']] territorial base (called [[Marche]]) in the center of Italy. The Kingdom of Italy did not take Rome itself, however, until 1871 when the [[Second French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] withdrew its garrison in Rome which had served to protect the Papal States. The Pope's rejection of the situation and the voluntary confinement of the popes in the Vatican continued until the [[Lateran Pacts]] of 1929 with the Italian [[fascist]] [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the efforts of the Pope in the international scene and in the internal business of Catholic countries have transcended the territorial dimensions of the Vatican City, demonstrating that the religious dimension is very decisive.  It has also shown that what has come to be called [[soft power]], though subtle, can be effective because of its moral, ideological, and cultural weight.

==Perseverance of the term==
The name of "[[empire]]" has been applied to types of political entities that have not had a universal function (theocratic or Caesaropapist), but to those with a global, secularized one. This has been possible in [[Geostrategy|geostrategic]] terms for the first time since the coming about of a [[global economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Concepto de [[Fernand Braudel]] {{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the first empires to form (the [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] in the 16th century) in their day did not refer to themselves as empires, (the Spanish self defined, in [[Providentialism|providentialist]] terms, as the Catholic Monarchy), the name typically has been applied by [[historiography]] (which applies "empire" to any political form of the past with multinational dimensions: [[Göktürks|Turk Empire]], [[Mongol Empire]], [[Inca Empire]]).

Consequently, this is done to the [[Russian Empire]], which claimed to be a [[New Rome|third Rome]] after the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 (the title [[Czar]] is derived from [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]).

The term is also applied to the overseas territorial possessions of the European states:
*the [[British Empire]] – justified by the Hindu [[:wikt:raj|Raj]] who made [[Queen Victoria]] empress of India
*the [[France|French Empire]] – that of the first Napoleon and that of the Third, although the name continued to be used for the colonies of the Third Republic
*the [[Italian Empire]] – that Mussolini sought in Africa

Analogously, the name "empire" is also used to refer to non-European entities, such as the [[History of China|Chinese Empire]] and the [[Japanese Empire]], or give the title of emperor to those like the [[Negus]] of [[Ethiopia]], the [[Shah]] of [[Persia]], and the [[Sultan]] of [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} pp. 56–57
&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, this is a "diplomatic courtesy."  Since the [[Cold War]], it has also been common to refer to the two rival superpowers as the American Empire and the Soviet Empire.

The '''Vice President of the United States''' (informally referred to as '''VPOTUS, VP''', or '''Veep''') is the second-highest officer in the [[Executive branch of the United States government|executive branch]] of the [[federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], after the [[President of the United States]], and ranks first in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]]. The vice president is also an officer in the [[Legislative branch of the United States federal government|legislative branch]], as '''President of the Senate'''. In this capacity, the vice president presides over Senate deliberations (or delegates this task to a member of the Senate), but may only [[casting vote|vote to break a tie]]. The vice president also presides over [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint sessions of Congress]].&lt;ref name=USlegal-VP&gt;{{Cite web| title=Executive Branch: Vice President| work=The US Legal System| url=https://system.uslegal.com/executive-branch/vice-president/| publisher=U.S. Legal Support| accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vice president is [[indirect election|indirectly elected]] together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].&lt;ref name=USlegal-VP/&gt; Section 2 of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]], ratified in 1967, created a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession, establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress. Previously, whenever a vice president had succeeded to the presidency or had died or resigned from office, the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began.&lt;ref name=XXVHeritage/&gt;

The vice president is also a statutory member of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=USlegal-VP/&gt; The [[Office of the Vice President of the United States|Office of the Vice President]] assists and organizes the vice president's official functions. The role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|1787 constitutional Convention]]. Especially over the past 100 years, the vice presidency has evolved into a position of domestic and foreign policy political power, and is now widely seen as an integral part of a president's administration. As the vice president's role within the executive branch has expanded, their role within the legislative branch has contracted; for example, they preside over the Senate only infrequently.&lt;ref name=Garvey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garvey|first=Todd|title=A Constitutional Anomaly: Safeguarding Confidential National Security Information Within the Enigma That Is the American Vice Presidency|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&amp;context=wmborj|journal=William &amp; Mary Bill of Rights Journal|volume=17|issue=2|year=2008|pages=565–605|publisher=[[William &amp; Mary Law School]] Scholarship Repository|location=Williamsburg, Virginia|accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution does not expressly assign the vice presidency to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars about which branch of government the office belongs to: 1) the executive branch; 2) the legislative branch; 3) both; or 4) neither.&lt;ref name=Garvey/&gt;&lt;ref name=24KJLPP1&gt;{{cite web| last=Brownell II| first=Roy E.| title=A Constitutional Chameleon: The Vice President's Place within the American System of Separation of Powers Part I: Text, Structure, Views of the Framers and the Courts| url=https://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_journal/v24/Brownell.pdf| journal=Kansas Journal of Law and Public Policy| volume=24| issue=1| date=Fall 2014| pages=1–77| accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern view of the vice president as an officer of the executive branch (isolated almost totally from the legislative branch) is due in large part to the assignment of executive authority to the vice president by either the president or Congress.&lt;ref name=Garvey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Joel K. |title=The New Constitutional Vice Presidency|journal=Wake Forest Law Review|volume=30|page=505|publisher=Wake Forest Law Review Association, Inc.|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&amp;context=wmborj|location=Winston Salem, NC |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Pence]] of [[Indiana]] is the 48th and current vice president. He assumed office on January 20, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/mike-pence/|title=Michael R. Pence Vice President of the United States|website=whitehouse.gov|publisher=The [[White House]]|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
No mention of an office of vice president was made at the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] until near the end, when an 11-member committee on "Leftover Business" proposed a method of electing the chief executive (president).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Themes at the Constitutional Convention: 8. Establishing the Electoral College and the Presidency |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/static/convention/themes/8.html|website=TeachingAmericanHistory.org|publisher=Ashbrook Center at Ashland University| location=Ashland, Ohio| accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates had previously considered the selection of the Senate's presiding officer, deciding that, "The Senate shall choose its own President," and had agreed that this official would be designated the executive's immediate successor. They had also considered the mode of election of the executive but had not reached consensus. This all changed on September 4, when the committee recommended that the nation's chief executive be elected by an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], with each [[U.S. state|state]] having a number of presidential electors equal to the sum of that state's allocation of [[United States House of Representatives|representatives]] and [[United States Senate|senators]].&lt;ref name=Garvey/&gt;&lt;ref name=RA2005TLR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Albert|first=Richard|title=The Evolving Vice Presidency|journal=Temple Law Review|date=Winter 2005|volume=78|issue=4|url=https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1624&amp;context=lsfp|pages=811–896|publisher=Temple University of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=July 29, 2018|via=Digital Commons @ Boston College Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed presidential election process called for each state to choose members of the electoral college, who would use their discretion to select the candidates they individually viewed as best qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holcombe|first=Randall G.|title=Origins of the Electoral College|url=https://mises.org/library/origins-electoral-college|date=November 9, 2000|work=Mises Daily|publisher=[[Mises Institute]]|location=Auburn, Alabama|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that loyalty to one's individual state outweighed loyalty to the new federation, the Constitution's framers assumed that individual electors would be inclined to choose a candidate from their own state (a so-called "[[favorite son]]" candidate) over one from another. So they created the office of vice president and required that electors vote for two candidates, requiring that at least one of their votes must be for a candidate from outside the elector's state, believing that this second vote could be cast for a candidate of national character.&lt;ref name=RA2005TLR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=US Vice Presidents |url=http://www.historytoday.com/mark-rathbone/us-vice-presidents|last=Rathbone|first=Mark|magazine=History Review|issue=71 |date=December 2011|publisher=History Today|location=London|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, to guard against the possibility that some electors might strategically throw away their second vote in order to bolster their favorite son's chance of winning, it was specified that the first runner-up presidential candidate would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on strategically discarded electoral votes, incentivizing electors to make their choices for president without resort to electoral gamesmanship and to cast their second ballot accordingly.&lt;ref name=RA2005TLR/&gt;

The resultant method of electing the president and vice president, spelled out in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 3]], allocated to each [[U.S. state|state]] a number of electors equal to the combined total of its Senate and House of Representatives membership. Each elector was allowed to vote for two people for president (rather than for both president and vice president), but could not [[Ranked voting|differentiate]] between their first and second choice for the presidency. The person receiving the greatest number of votes (provided that it was an [[absolute majority]] of the whole number of electors) would be president, while the individual who received the next largest number of votes became vice president. If there were a tie for first or for second place, or if no one won a majority of votes, the president and vice president would be selected by means of [[contingent election]]s protocols stated in the clause.&lt;ref name=A2TKec&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuroda|first=Tadahisa|title=Essays on Article II: Electoral College|work=The Heritage Guide to The Constitution|url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/80/electoral-college|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRS2017THN&gt;{{cite web|last=Neale|first=Thomas H.|title=The Electoral College: How It Works in Contemporary Presidential Elections|date=May 15, 2017|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32611.pdf|work=CRS Report for Congress|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, D.C.|page=13|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The emergence of [[Political party|political parties]] and nationally coordinated election campaigns during the 1790s (which the Constitution's framers had not contemplated) soon frustrated this original plan. In the [[United States presidential election, 1796|election of 1796]], [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] [[John Adams]] won the presidency, but his bitter rival, [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] came second and became vice president. Thus, the president and vice president were from opposing parties; and Jefferson used the vice presidency to frustrate the president's policies. Then, four years later, in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]], Jefferson, and fellow Democratic-Republican [[Aaron Burr]] each received 73 electoral votes. In the contingent election that followed, Jefferson finally won on the 36th ballot, and Burr became vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] in time to be used in the [[United States presidential election, 1804|1804 election]].&lt;ref name=HF-XII&gt;{{cite web|last=Fried|first=Charles|title=Essays on Amendment XII: Electoral College|work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution|url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/12/essays/165/electoral-college|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of the vice president==
{{Politics of the United States}}

Although delegates approved establishing the office, with both its executive and senatorial functions, not many understood the office, and so they gave the vice president few duties and little power.&lt;ref name=VP-PS&gt;{{cite web| title=Vice President of the United States (President of the Senate)| website=senate.gov| url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Vice_President.htm| publisher=Secretary of the Senate| location=Washington, D.C.|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few states had an analogous position. Among those that did, [[New York Constitution|New York's constitution]] provided that, "The lieutenant-governor shall, by virtue of his office, be president of the Senate, and, upon an equal division, have a casting voice in their decisions, but not vote on any other occasion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Senate and the United States Constitution |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Constitution_Senate.htm#5| website=senate.gov |publisher=Secretary of the Senate| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the vice presidency originally had authority in only a few areas. The present day power of the office flows primarily from delegations from the President and Congress, as well as through constitutional amendments.&lt;ref name=24KJLPP1/&gt;

===Preside over the United States Senate===
[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 4: Vice President as President of Senate|Article I, Section 3, Clause 4]] confers upon the vice president the title President of the Senate and authorizes him to [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|preside over Senate meetings]]. In this capacity, the vice president is charged with maintaining order and decorum, recognizing members to speak, and interpreting the Senate's rules, practices, and precedent. The first two vice presidents, [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], both of whom gained the office by virtue of being runners-up in presidential contests, presided regularly over Senate proceedings, and did much to shape the role of Senate president.&lt;ref name=VP-PS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schramm| first=Peter W.| title=Essays on Article I: Vice President as Presiding Officer| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/15/vice-president-as-presiding-officer| work=Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several 19th century vice presidents—such as [[George M.

With this position comes the authority to cast a tie-breaking vote. In practice, the number of times vice presidents have exercised this right has varied greatly. [[John C. Calhoun]] holds the record at 31 votes, followed closely by [[John Adams]] with 29.&lt;ref name=VP-PS/&gt; During his first year in office (through January 24, 2018), Mike Pence cast eight tie breaking votes; his predecessor, [[Joe Biden]], did not cast any during his eight years in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Jordan|title=Mike Pence breaks into top 10 for vice presidential tiebreaking votes|date=January 24, 2018|website=theindychannel.com|url=https://www.theindychannel.com/news/politics/mike-pence-breaks-into-top-10-for-vice-presidential-tiebreaking-votes|publisher=WRTV, Scripps TV Station Group|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the framers of the Constitution anticipated that the vice president would not always be available to fulfil this responsibility, the Constitution provides that the Senate may elect a [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]] (or "[[Pro tempore|president for a time]]") in order to maintain the proper ordering of the legislative process. In practice, since the early 20th century, the President of the Senate rarely presides, nor does the President pro tempore. He regularly delegates the task to other Senate members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forte| first=David F.| title=Essays on Article I: President Pro Tempore| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/16/president-pro-tempore| work=Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standing Rules of the Senate Rule XIX|Rule XIX]], which governs debate, does not authorize the vice president to participate in debate, and grants only to members of the Senate (and, upon appropriate notice, former presidents of the United States) the privilege of addressing the Senate, without granting a similar privilege to the sitting vice president. Thus, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote in 1925, during the tenure of Vice President [[Charles G. Dawes]], "once in four years the Vice President can make a little speech, and then he is done. For four years he then has to sit in the seat of the silent, attending to speeches ponderous or otherwise, of deliberation or humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=President Dawes|department=The Congress|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786539,00.html|url-access=subscription|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=New York, New York|date=December 14, 1925|volume=6|issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preside over impeachment trials===
As President of the Senate he may also preside over most of the [[impeachment]] trials of federal officers. However, whenever the President of the United States is on trial, the Constitution requires that the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] must preside. This stipulation was designed to avoid the possible conflict of interest in having the vice president preside over the trial for the removal of the one official standing between him and the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerhardt| first=Michael J.| title=Essays on Article I: Trial of Impeachment| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment| work=Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curiously, the framers made no mention of who would preside in the instance where the vice president is the officer impeached; thus leaving a loophole whereby a vice president, as President of the Senate, could preside at their own impeachment trial.&lt;ref name=24KJLPP1/&gt;

===Supervise electoral vote count===
The Twelfth Amendment, like the superseded Article II clause, provides that the vice president, in his capacity as President of the Senate, also presides over counting and presentation of the votes of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].&lt;ref name=A2TKec/&gt; This process occurs during a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] held, as prescribed by federal statute, on January 6 of the year following the presidential election. It will next take place following the [[United States presidential election, 2020|2020 presidential election]], on January 6, 2021 (unless Congress sets a different date by law).&lt;ref name=CRS2017THN/&gt; In this capacity, four vice presidents have been able to announce their own election to the presidency: [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Martin Van Buren]], and [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=VP-PS/&gt; In January 1961, it fell to [[Richard Nixon]] to preside over this process, and to announce the election of his 1960 opponent, [[John F.

In 1969, Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] would have done so as well, following his 1968 loss to Richard Nixon; however, on the date of the Congressional joint session, Humphrey was in [[Norway]] attending the funeral of [[Trygve Lie]], the first elected [[Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]]. The president pro tempore presided in his absence.&lt;ref name=EV1969count/&gt;

===Succession to the presidency===

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II, Section 1, Clause 6]] stipulates that the vice president takes over the "powers and duties" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.&lt;ref name=FordhamLaw2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feerick |first=John D.|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=79|issue=3|date=2011|pages=907–949 |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4695&amp;context=flr |title=Presidential Succession and Inability: Before and After the Twenty-Fifth Amendment|publisher=[[Fordham University School of Law]]|location=New York City|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, it does not clearly state whether the vice president became President of the United States or simply [[Acting (law)|acted]] as president in a case of succession. Debate records from the 1787 Constitutional Convention, along with various participants' later writings on the subject, show that the framers of the Constitution intended that the vice president would temporarily exercise the powers and duties of the office in the event of a president's death, disability or removal, but not actually become President of the United States in their own right.&lt;ref name=PVPS2004OCL&gt;{{cite web|last=Neale|first=Thomas H.| title=Presidential and Vice Presidential Succession: Overview and Current Legislation| work=CRS Report for Congress|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31761.pdf|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|location=Washington, D.C.| date=September 27, 2004|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Failing Hands: the Story of Presidential Succession|last1=Feerick|first1=John D.|last2=Freund|first2=Paul A.|date=1965|url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=twentyfifth_amendment_books|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York City| page=56|lccn=65-14917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding was first tested in 1841, following the death of President [[William Henry Harrison]], only {{age in days|March 4, 1841|April 4, 1841}} days into his term. Harrison's vice president, [[John Tyler]], asserted that he had succeeded to the office of President, not just to its powers and duties. He took the [[Oath of office  of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]], and declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as "Acting President."&lt;ref name=JTDA&gt;{{cite web|title=John Tyler: Domestic Affairs|last=Freehling|first=William|url=https://millercenter.org/president/tyler/domestic-affairs|publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia|location=Charllotesville, Virginia|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some in Congress denounced Tyler's claim as a violation of the Constitution,&lt;ref name=FordhamLaw2011/&gt; he adhered to his position.

In addition to Tyler they are [[Millard Fillmore]], [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref name=PVPS2004OCL/&gt;

===Presidential disabilities===
Even after the precedent regarding presidential succession following a president's death was set, there remained ambiguity in the Article II succession clause regarding a disabled president. What constituted an "[[incapacity|inability]]"? Who determined the existence of an inability? Did a vice president become president for the rest of the presidential term in the case of an inability; or was the vice president merely "acting as President"? During the 19th and first half of the 20th century several presidents experienced periods of severe illness, physical disability or injury, some lasting for weeks or months. During these times, even though the nation needed effective presidential leadership, no vice president wanted to seem like a usurper, and so power was never transferred. After President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] openly addressed his health issues and made it a point to enter into an agreement with Vice President Richard Nixon that provided for Nixon to act on his behalf in the event that Eisenhower became unable to provide effective presidential leadership (Nixon did informally assume some of the president's duties for several weeks on each of three occasions when Eisenhower was ill), discussions began in Congress about clearing-up the Constitution's ambiguity on the subject.&lt;ref name=FordhamLaw2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCC25th&gt;{{cite web| title=The Twenty-fifth Amendment| last1=Kalt| first1=Brian C.| last2=Pozen| first2=David| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxv| work=The Interactive Constitution| publisher=The National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provide for situations where the president is temporarily unable to lead, such as if the president has a surgical procedure, becomes seriously ill or injured, or is otherwise unable to discharge the powers or duties of the presidency. Section 3 deals with self-declared incapacity, and Section 4 addresses incapacity declared by the joint action of the vice president and of a majority of the Cabinet.&lt;ref name=NCC25th/&gt; While Section 4 has never been invoked, Section 3 has been invoked on three occasions by two presidents. President [[Ronald Reagan]] did so once, on July 13, 1985, before undergoing surgery{{snd}}Vice President George H. W. Bush was acting president for approximately eight hours. President [[George W. Bush]] did so twice, on June 29, 2002 and July 21, 2007, prior to undergoing medical procedures, which were done under sedation{{snd}}Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was acting president for approximately two hours on each occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Woolley| first1=John| last2=Peters| first2=Gerhard| title=List of Vice-Presidents Who Served as "Acting" President Under the 25th Amendment| others=Gerhard Peters (database)| url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/acting_presidents.php| work=The American Presidency Project [online]| location=Santa Barbara, California| publisher=University of California (hosted)| accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal roles===
The extent of any informal roles and functions of the vice president depend on the specific relationship between the president and the vice president, but often include tasks such as drafter and spokesperson for the administration's policies, adviser to the president, and being a symbol of American concern or support. The influence of the vice president in this role depends almost entirely on the characteristics of the particular administration. Dick Cheney, for instance, was widely regarded as one of President George W. Bush's closest confidants. Al Gore was an important adviser to President [[Bill Clinton]] on matters of [[foreign policy]] and the [[environmental policy|environment]].

Under the American [[Presidential system|system of government]] the president is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Government: The Executive Branch|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-executive-branch/|website=whitehouse.gov|publisher=The White House|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ceremonial duties of the former position are often delegated to the vice president. The vice president will on occasion represent the president and the U.S. government at state funerals abroad, or at various events in the United States. This often is the most visible role of the vice president. The vice president may also meet with other heads of state at times when the administration wishes to demonstrate concern or support but cannot send the president personally.

==Selection process==

===Eligibility===
[[File:Johnadamsvp.flipped.jpg|thumb|[[John Adams]], the first Vice President of the United States]]
To be Constitutionally eligible to serve as the nation's vice president, a person must, according to the Twelfth Amendment, meet the eligibility requirements to become president (which are stated in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article II, Section 1, Clause 5]]). Thus, to serve as vice president, an individual must:
* be a [[Natural-born citizen|natural-born]] [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen]];
* be at least 35 years old;
* be a [[Residency (domicile)#United States|resident in the U.S.]] for at least 14 years.&lt;ref name=AC-XII&gt;{{cite web|title=Twelfth Amendment|url=http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/page/twelfth-amendment|work=Annenberg Classroom|publisher=The Annenberg Public Policy Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who meets the above qualifications is still disqualified from holding the office of vice president under the following conditions:
* Under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction|Article I, Section 3, Clause 7]], upon conviction in impeachment cases, the Senate has the option of disqualifying convicted individuals from holding federal office, including that of vice president;
* Under [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment]], no person who has sworn an oath to support the Constitution, who has later has gone to war against the United States, or given aid and comfort to the nation's enemies can serve in a state or federal office – including as vice president. This disqualification, originally aimed at former supporters of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], may be removed by a two-thirds vote of each house of the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Fourteenth Amendment|url=http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/page/fourteenth-amendment|work=Annenberg Classroom|publisher=The Annenberg Public Policy Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominating process===
Though the vice president does not need to have any political experience, most major-party vice presidential nominees are current or former United States Senators or Representatives, with the occasional nominee being a current or former Governor, a high-ranking military officer, or a holder of a major post within the Executive Department.  The vice presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidate. The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen, with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination, followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party's nomination.

In practice, the presidential nominee has considerable influence on the decision, and in the 20th century it became customary for that person to select a preferred running mate, who is then nominated and accepted by the convention. In recent years, with the presidential nomination usually being a foregone conclusion as the result of the primary process, the selection of a vice presidential candidate is often announced prior to the actual balloting for the presidential candidate, and sometimes before the beginning of the convention itself.  The first presidential aspirant to announce his selection for vice president before the beginning of the convention was [[Ronald Reagan]] who, prior to the [[1976 Republican National Convention]] announced that [[Richard Schweiker]] would be his running mate.  Reagan's supporters then sought to amend the convention rules so that [[Gerald R. Ford]] would be required to name his vice presidential running mate in advance as well.  The proposal was defeated, and Reagan did not receive the nomination in 1976.  Often, the presidential nominee will name a vice presidential candidate who will bring geographic or ideological balance to the ticket or appeal to a particular constituency.

The vice presidential candidate might also be chosen on the basis of traits the presidential candidate is perceived to lack, or on the basis of name recognition. To foster party unity, popular runners-up in the presidential nomination process are commonly considered. While this selection process may enhance the chances of success for a national ticket, in the past it often insured that the vice presidential nominee represented regions, constituencies, or ideologies at odds with those of the presidential candidate. As a result, vice presidents were often excluded from the policy-making process of the new administration. Many times their relationships with the president and his staff were aloof, non-existent, or even adversarial.

The ultimate goal of vice presidential candidate selection is to help and not hurt the party's chances of getting elected, nonetheless several vice presidential selections have been controversial. In 1984, Democratic nominee [[Walter Mondale]]'s groundbreaking choice of [[Geraldine Ferraro]] as his running mate (the first woman in U.S. history nominated for Vice President by a major political party), became a drag on the ticket due to repeated questions about her husband's finances. A selection whose positive traits make the presidential candidate look less favorable in comparison or which can cause the presidential candidate's judgment to be questioned often backfire, such as in 1988 when Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] chose experienced Texas Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]]; Bentsen was considered a more seasoned statesman in federal politics and somewhat overshadowed Dukakis. Questions about [[Dan Quayle]]'s experience were raised in the 1988 presidential campaign of [[George H. W. Bush]], but the Bush-Quayle ticket still won handily. [[James Stockdale]], the choice of third-party candidate [[Ross Perot]] in 1992, was seen as unqualified by many and Stockdale had little preparation for the vice presidential debate, but the Perot-Stockdale ticket still won about 19% of the vote. In 2008, Republican [[John McCain]] chose [[Sarah Palin]] as his running mate over his primary rivals and/or campaign surrogates such as [[Mitt Romney]] or [[Tom Ridge]]. This surprise move would, it was hoped, draw women voters disappointed by [[Hillary Clinton]]'s defeat in the Democratic presidential primaries into the McCain camp. Palin's selection soon came to be seen as a negative for McCain, due to her several controversies during her gubernatorial tenure which were highlighted by the press, and her feuding with McCain campaign chairman [[Steve Schmidt]]. This perception continued to grow throughout the campaign, especially after [[Sarah Palin interviews with Katie Couric|her interviews with Katie Couric]] led to concerns about her fitness for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |authorlink=Adam Nagourney |title=Concerns About Palin's Readiness as Big Test Nears |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 30, 2008 |page=A16 |url=http://www.newyorktimes.com/2008/09/30/us/politics/30palin.htm |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, vice presidential candidates were chosen to provide geographic and ideological balance to a presidential ticket, widening a presidential candidate's appeal to voters from outside his regional base or wing of the party. Candidates from electoral-vote rich states were usually preferred. However, in 1992, moderate Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] (of [[Arkansas]]) chose moderate Democrat [[Al Gore]] (of [[Tennessee]]) as his running mate. Despite the two candidates' near-identical ideological and regional backgrounds, Gore's extensive experience in national affairs enhanced the appeal of a ticket headed by Clinton, whose political career had been spent entirely at the local and state levels of government. In 2000, [[George W. Bush]] chose [[Dick Cheney]] of [[Wyoming]], a reliably Republican state with only three electoral votes, and in 2008, [[Barack Obama]] mirrored Bush's strategy when he chose [[Joe Biden]] of [[Delaware]], a reliably Democratic state, likewise one with only three electoral votes. Both Cheney and Biden were chosen for their experience in national politics (experience lacked by both Bush and Obama) rather than the ideological balance or electoral vote advantage they would provide.

Prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]], both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney lived in and voted in Texas. While nothing in the Constitution prohibits a presidential candidate and his or her running mate being from the same state, the "inhabitant clause" of the Twelfth Amendment does mandate that every presidential elector must cast a ballot for at least one candidate who is not from their own state. To avoid creating a potential problem for Texas' electors, Cheney changed his residency back to Wyoming prior to the campaign.&lt;ref name=AC-XII/&gt;

The first presidential candidate to choose his vice presidential candidate was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="sigelman"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2952169 The "Veepstakes": Strategic Choice in Presidential Running Mate Selection], by Lee Sigelman and Paul J. Wahlbeck, American Political Science Review, December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The last not to name a vice presidential choice, leaving the matter up to the convention, was [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in 1956. The convention chose [[Tennessee]] Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] over [[Massachusetts]] Senator (and later president) [[John F. Kennedy]]. At the tumultuous 1972 Democratic convention, presidential nominee [[George McGovern]] selected Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]] as his running mate, but numerous other candidates were either nominated from the floor or received votes during the balloting. Eagleton nevertheless received a majority of the votes and the nomination, though he later resigned from the ticket, resulting in [[Sargent Shriver]] becoming McGovern's final running mate; both lost to the Nixon-Agnew ticket by a wide margin, carrying only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.

In cases where the presidential nomination is still in doubt as the convention approaches, the campaigns for the two positions may become intertwined. In 1976, [[Ronald Reagan]], who was trailing President [[Gerald R. Ford]] in the presidential delegate count, announced prior to the Republican National Convention that, if nominated, he would select Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] as his running mate. This move backfired to a degree, as Schweiker's relatively liberal voting record alienated many of the more conservative delegates who were considering a challenge to party delegate selection rules to improve Reagan's chances. In the end, Ford narrowly won the presidential nomination and Reagan's selection of Schweiker became moot.

In the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries which pitted [[Hillary Clinton]] against [[Barack Obama]], Clinton suggested a Clinton-Obama ticket with Obama in the vice president slot as it would be "unstoppable" against the presumptive Republican nominee. Obama rejected the offer outright saying "I want everybody to be absolutely clear. I'm not running for vice president. I'm running for president of the United States of America" while noting "With all due respect. I won twice as many states as Sen. Clinton. I've won more of the popular vote than Sen. Clinton. I have more delegates than Sen. Clinton. So, I don't know how somebody who's in second place is offering vice presidency to the person who's in first place". Obama stated that the nomination process would have to be a choice between himself and Clinton, saying "I don't want anybody here thinking that 'Somehow, maybe I can get both'", by nominating Clinton as president and assuming he would be her running mate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/10/barackobama.hillaryclinton|title=Obama scoffs at Clinton's vice-presidential hint |first1=Allegra|last1=Stratton|first2=Daniel|last2=Nasaw |date=March 11, 2008|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/10/dems.campaign/index.html?iref=nextin|title=Obama rejects being Clinton's No. 2 |publisher=CNN|date=March 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggested that it was a ploy by the Clinton campaign to denigrate Obama as less qualified for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/trump-obama-clinton-2008-ad-224189 |title=Trump throws 2008 Obama ad in Clinton's face |work= Politico |date=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee, former President [[Jimmy Carter]] cautioned against Clinton being picked for the vice president slot on the ticket, saying "I think it would be the worst mistake that could be made.

{{Main|Electoral College (United States)}}

The vice president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the [[District of Columbia]] through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms. Each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]] provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Twenty-third Amendment|url=http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/page/twenty-third-amendment|work=Annenberg Classroom|publisher=The Annenberg Public Policy Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, all states and D.C. select their electors based on a popular election held on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]].&lt;ref name=CRS2017THN/&gt; In all but two states, the party whose presidential-vice presidential [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] receives a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of popular votes in the state has its entire [[Slate (elections)|slate]] of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Electors|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/electors.html|work=U.S. Electoral College|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] deviate from this {{nowrap|winner-take-all}} practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maine &amp; Nebraska|url=http://www.fairvote.org/maine_nebraska|website=fairvote.com|publisher=FairVote|location=Takoma Park, Maryland|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Split Electoral Votes in Maine and Nebraska|url=https://www.270towin.com/content/split-electoral-votes-maine-and-nebraska/|website=[[270towin.com]]|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective states (and in Washington D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. The certified results are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. A candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes for vice president (currently 270 of 538) is declared the winner. Otherwise, the Senate must meet to elect a vice president using a contingent election procedure in which senators, casting votes individually, choose between the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. For a candidate to win, he or she must receive votes from an absolute majority of senators (currently 51 of 100).&lt;ref name=CRS2017THN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Electoral College?|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/about.html|work=U.S. Electoral College|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been only one vice presidential contingent election since the Twelfth Amendment was ratified. It occurred on February 8, 1837, after no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes cast for vice president in the [[United States presidential election, 1836|1836 election]]. By a 33–17 vote, [[Richard M. Johnson]] ([[Martin Van Buren]]'s running mate) was elected the nation's ninth vice president over [[Francis Granger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bomboy|first=Scott|title=The one election where Faithless Electors made a difference|date=December 19, 2016|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-one-election-where-faithless-electors-made-a-difference|work=Constitution Daily|publisher=National Constitution Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inauguration ===
{{main|United States presidential inauguration}}
[[File:Johnson, Nixon, Agnew, Humphrey cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Four vice presidents: L-R, outgoing President [[Lyndon B.

Pursuant to the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], the vice president's term of office begins at noon on January 20, as does the president's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Twentieth Amendment| last1=Larson| first1=Edward J.| last2=Shesol| first2=Jeff| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xx| work=The Interactive Constitution| publisher=The National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]], were the [[Second inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|second terms]] of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=HHistory1201937&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Inauguration after the Lame Duck Amendment: January 20, 1937|url=http://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/35948?ret=True|publisher=Office of the Historian, U.S. House of Representatives|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933–37) of both men had been shortened by {{age in days|1937|1|20|1937|3|4}} days.&lt;ref name=GPOCONAN20171021&gt;{{cite web|title=Commencement of the Terms of Office: Twentieth Amendment|work=Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation|url=https://www.congress.gov/content/conan/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2017-10-21.pdf|publisher=United States Government Printing Office, Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2297–98|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1937, the Vice President's [[Oath of office of the Vice President of the United States|swearing-in]] ceremony was held on the Inaugural platform on the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]]'s east front immediately before the president's [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|swearing in]]. Up until then, most Vice Presidents took the oath of office in the Senate chamber, prior to the President's swearing-in ceremony.&lt;ref name=VPinaug&gt;{{cite web|title=Vice President's Swearing-in Ceremony|website=inaugural.senate.gov|url=https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/days-events/vice-presidents-swearing-in-ceremony/index.html|publisher=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Constitution contains the specific wording of the presidential oath, it only contains a general requirement, in [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]], that the vice president and other government officers shall take an [[oath]] or [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] to support the Constitution. The current form, which has been used since 1884 reads:

{{quote|I, (''first name last name''), do solemnly swear (or [[Affirmation in law|affirm]]) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oath of Office|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Oath_Office.htm|website=senate.gov|publisher=Secretary of the Senate|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Term of office===
The term of office for both the vice president and the president is four years. While the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-Second Amendment]] generally restricts the president to two terms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Twenty-second Amendment|url=http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/page/twenty-second-amendment|work=Annenberg Classroom|publisher=The Annenberg Public Policy Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no such limitation on the office of vice president, meaning an eligible person could hold the office as long as voters continued to vote for electors who in turn would reelect the person to the office; one could even serve under different presidents. This has happened twice: [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] (1805–1812) served under both [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]; and [[John C. Calhoun]] (1825–1832) served under [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Andrew Jackson]].&lt;ref name=VP-PS/&gt; Additionally, neither the Constitution's eligibility provisions nor the Twenty-second Amendment's presidential [[term limit]] explicitly disqualify a twice-elected president from serving as vice president. As of the 2016 election cycle however, no former president has tested the amendment's legal restrictions or meaning by running for the vice presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/19/AR2006101901572.html|title=VP Bill?

===Impeachment===
{{further|Impeachment in the United States}}
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 4: Impeachment|Article II, Section 4]] of the Constitution allows for the removal of federal officials, including the president, from office for "[[treason]], [[bribery]], or other [[high crimes and misdemeanors]]." [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Speaker and other officers; Impeachment|Article I, Section 2, Clause 5]] authorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a "[[grand jury]]" with the power to [[Impeachment|impeach]] said officials by a majority vote.&lt;ref name=A1essaySBP&gt;{{cite web|last=Presser| first=Stephen B.| title=Essays on Article I: Impeachment| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment| work=Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Trial of Impeachments|Article I, Section 3, Clause 6]] authorizes the Senate to serve as a [[court]] with the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerhardt| first=Michael J.| title=Essays on Article I: Trial of Impeachment| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment| work=Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; No vice president has ever been impeached.

==Salary==
The vice president's salary is $230,700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa011600a.htm| title=Current salary information| publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salary was set by the 1989 Government Salary Reform Act, which also provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees. The vice president does not automatically receive a pension based on that office, but instead receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on his position as President of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress|last=Purcell|first=Patrick J. |date=January 21, 2005|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30631.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vice president must serve a minimum of two years to qualify for a pension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Yoffe|url=http://www.slate.com/id/1006798|title=Pension information|publisher=Slate.com|date=January 3, 2001|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residence==
The home of the vice president was only designated in 1974, when Congress established [[Number One Observatory Circle]] as the official ''temporary'' residence of the Vice President of the United States. In 1966 Congress, concerned about safety and security and mindful of the increasing responsibilities of the office, allotted monies ($75,000) to fund construction of a residence for the vice president, but implementation stalled and after 8 years the decision was revised, and One Observatory Circle was then designated for the vice president.&lt;ref name="Groppe 2017 Where does..."&gt;{{cite news |last1=Groppe |first1=Maureen |title=Where does the vice president live? Few people know, but new book will show you |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/24/where-does-vice-president-live-few-people-know-but-new-book-show-you/892243001/ |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=USA TODAY |date=24 November 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the change, vice presidents lived in homes, apartments, or hotels, and were compensated more like cabinet members and members of Congress, receiving only a housing allowance. 

The three-story [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] mansion was built in 1893 on the grounds of the [[U.S. Naval Observatory]] in Washington, D.C., to serve as residence for the superintendent of the Observatory. In 1923, the residence was reassigned to be the home of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO), which it was until it was turned over to the office of the vice president fifty years later.

==Office as stepping stone to the presidency==
In recent decades, the vice presidency has frequently been used as a platform to launch bids for the presidency. The transition of the office to its modern stature occurred primarily as a result of Franklin Roosevelt's 1940 nomination, when he captured the ability to nominate his running mate instead of leaving the nomination to the convention. Prior to that, party bosses often used the vice presidential nomination as a consolation prize for the party's minority faction. A further factor potentially contributing to the rise in prestige of the office was the adoption of presidential preference primaries in the early 20th century. By adopting primary voting, the field of candidates for vice president was expanded by both the increased quantity and quality of presidential candidates successful in some primaries, yet who ultimately failed to capture the presidential nomination at the convention.

Of the thirteen presidential elections from 1956 to 2004, nine featured the incumbent president; the other four ([[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988]], [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]]) all featured the incumbent vice president. Former vice presidents also ran in [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984]] ([[Walter Mondale]]) and in 1968 ([[Richard Nixon]], against the incumbent vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]]). The presidential election of 2008 was the first presidential election since 1928 that saw neither an incumbent president nor an incumbent or former vice president take part in any primary or general election for the presidency on a major party ticket. Nixon is the only vice president to have been elected president while not an incumbent, as well as the only person elected twice to both the presidency and vice presidency.

==Vacancies==
[[File:Mr. and Mrs. Ford and Nixon 13&amp;nbsp;Oct&amp;nbsp;1973.jpg|thumb|alt=Two women are flanked by two men in suits, standing in a room of the White House.|(Left to right) President [[Richard Nixon]] and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] with [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Betty Ford]] after President Nixon nominated Ford to be Vice President, October 13, 1973.]]
Prior to ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency. As a result, when one occurred, the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing election and inauguration. Between 1812 and 1967, the vice presidency was vacant on sixteen occasions—as a result of seven deaths, one resignation, and eight cases in which the vice president succeeded to the presidency.&lt;ref name=succesionfacts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/us/succession-presidential-and-vice-presidential-fast-facts/|title=Succession: Presidential and Vice Presidential Fast Facts|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=September 26, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment established a procedure for filling such a vacancy:
{{quote|Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.&lt;ref name=XXVHeritage/&gt;}}
This procedure has been implemented twice since the amendment [[Coming into force|came into force]]. The first instance occurred in 1973 following the October 10 resignation of [[Spiro Agnew]], when [[Gerald Ford]] was nominated by President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[United States vice presidential selection, 1973|confirmed by Congress]]. The second occurred 10 months later following Ford's August 9, 1974 accession to the presidency upon Nixon's resignation, when [[Nelson Rockefeller]] was nominated by President Ford and [[United States vice presidential selection, 1974|confirmed by Congress]].&lt;ref name=FordhamLaw2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=succesionfacts/&gt; Had it not been for this new constitutional mechanism, the vice presidency would have remained vacant after Agnew's resignation and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Carl Albert]] would have become [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]] when Nixon resigned, under the terms of the [[Presidential Succession Act of 1947]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaker Albert Was Ready to Be President|last=Gup|first=Ted|date=November 28, 1982|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/11/28/speaker-albert-was-ready-to-be-president/84ebaa61-9cf1-4817-836e-a993e7e0e980/?utm_term=.766d612eb8a4|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth of the office==
[[File:Harry S. Truman.jpg|thumb|upright|Though prominent as a Missouri Senator, [[Harry Truman]] had been vice president only three months when he became president; he was never informed of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s war or postwar policies while vice president.]]
For much of its existence, the office of vice president was seen as little more than a minor position. John Adams, the first vice president, was the first of many frustrated by the "complete insignificance" of the office. To his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]] Adams wrote, "My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man . . . or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and met the common fate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Smith| first=Page| authorlink=Page Smith| title=John Adams| volume=Volume II 1784–1826| date=1962| publisher=Doubleday| location= New York| lccn=63-7188| page=844}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Nance Garner]], who served as vice president from 1933 to 1941 under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], claimed that the vice presidency "isn't worth a pitcher of warm piss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_vice-presidency_isn-t_worth_a_pitcher_of_warm/196103.html|title=John Nance Garner quotes |accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Truman]], who also served as vice president under Roosevelt, said that the office was as "useful as a cow's fifth teat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nation: Some Day You'll Be Sitting in That Chair |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875366,00.html|website=Time.com|accessdate=October 3, 2014|date=November 29, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas R. Marshall]], the 28th vice president, lamented: "Once there were two brothers. One ran away to sea; the other was elected Vice President of the United States. And nothing was heard of either of them again."&lt;ref name="casevpquote"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.case.edu/news/2004/10-04/vp_trivia.htm|title=A heartbeat away from the presidency: vice presidential trivia |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]]|date=October 4, 2004|accessdate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Calvin Coolidge]], was so obscure that [[Major League Baseball]] sent him free passes that misspelled his name, and a fire marshal failed to recognize him when Coolidge's Washington residence was evacuated.&lt;ref name="greenberg2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Calvin Coolidge profile |publisher=Macmillan|author=Greenberg, David|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wq1D6hcYlFwC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;vq=notary&amp;pg=PA40|isbn=0-8050-6957-7|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] asked [[Daniel Webster]] to run for the vice presidency on [[Zachary Taylor]]'s ticket, he replied "I do not propose to be buried until I am really dead and in my coffin."&lt;ref name="webster-novp"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FVSFAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22I+do+not+propose+to+be+buried+until+I+am+really+dead+and+in+my+coffin.%22|title=A Grammar of American Politics: The National Government|last=Binkley|first=Wilfred Ellsworth|last2=Moos|first2=Malcolm Charles|authorlink2=Malcolm Moos|location=New York|publisher=[[Alfred A.

Ironically, both of the presidents making the offer to Webster died in office, meaning the three-time presidential candidate could have become president if he had accepted either. Since presidents rarely died in office, however, the better preparation for the presidency was considered to be the office of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], in which Webster served under Harrison, Tyler, and later, Taylor's successor, Fillmore.

In the first 100 years of the United States no fewer than seven proposals to amend the constitution to abolish the office of Vice President were advanced in the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="ames"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ames|first1=Herman|title=The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States During the First Century of Its History|date=1896|publisher=[[American Historical Association]]|pages=70–72|url=https://archive.org/details/proposedamendmen00amesrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such amendment was presented by [[Samuel W. Dana]] in 1800 and was defeated by a vote of 27 to 85 in the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt; A second proposed amendment, introduced by [[United States Senator]] [[James Hillhouse]] in 1808 was also defeated.&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt; During the late-1860s and 1870s, five additional amendments were proposed.&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt; One supporter of the proposals, [[James Mitchell Ashley]] , opined that the office of Vice President was "superfluous" and dangerous.&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt;

[[Garret Hobart]], the first vice president under [[William McKinley]], was one of the very few vice presidents at this time who played an important role in the administration. A close confidant and adviser of the president, Hobart was called "Assistant President."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycentral.com/Bio/rec/GarretHobart.html|title=Garret Hobart|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, until 1919, vice presidents were not included in meetings of the [[United States Cabinet|President's Cabinet]]. This precedent was broken by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] when he asked [[Thomas R. Marshall]] to preside over Cabinet meetings while Wilson was in France negotiating the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lugar.senate.gov/services/pdf_crs/executive/The_Vice_Presidency.pdf|title=The Vice Presidency: Evolution of the Modern Office, 1933–2001|author=Harold C.

Harding]] also invited his vice president, Calvin Coolidge, to meetings. The next vice president, [[Charles G. Dawes]], did not seek to attend Cabinet meetings under President Coolidge, declaring that "the precedent might prove injurious to the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Charles_Dawes.htm|title=U.S. Senate Web page on Charles G. Dawes, 30th Vice President (1925–1929)|publisher=Senate.gov|accessdate=August 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106112435/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Charles_Dawes.htm|archive-date=November 6, 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President [[Charles Curtis]] was also precluded from attending by President [[Herbert Hoover]].

In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt raised the stature of the office by renewing the practice of inviting the vice president to cabinet meetings, which every president since has maintained. Roosevelt's first vice president, [[John Nance Garner]], broke with him over the "[[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing]]" issue, early in his second term, and became Roosevelt's leading critic. At the start of that term, on [[Second inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|January 20, 1937]], Garner had been the first Vice President to be sworn into office on the Capitol steps in the same ceremony with the president; a tradition that continues. Prior to that time, vice presidents were traditionally inaugurated at a separate ceremony in the Senate chamber. [[Gerald R. Ford]] and [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], who were both appointed to the office under the terms of the 25th amendment, were inaugurated in the House and Senate chambers, respectively.

[[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], Roosevelt's vice president during his third term (1941–1945), was given major responsibilities during World War II. However, after numerous policy disputes between Wallace and other [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt Administration]] and Democratic Party officials, he was denied renomination to office at the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]]. [[Harry Truman]] was selected instead.  During his {{age in days|January 20, 1945|April 12, 1945}} day vice presidency, Truman was not informed about any war or post-war plans, including the [[Manhattan Project]], leading Truman to remark, wryly, that the job of the Vice President was to "go to weddings and funerals." As a result of this experience, Truman, after succeeding to the presidency upon Roosevelt's death, recognized the need to keep the Vice President informed on national security issues. Congress made the vice president one of four statutory members of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] in 1949.

The stature of the vice presidency grew again while [[Richard Nixon]] was in office (1953–1961). He attracted the attention of the media and the Republican party, when [[Dwight Eisenhower]] authorized him to preside at [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meetings in his absence. Nixon was also the first vice president to formally assume temporary control of the executive branch, which he did after Eisenhower suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on September 24, 1955, [[ileitis]] in June 1956, and a [[stroke]] in November 1957.

Until 1961, vice presidents had their offices on [[Capitol Hill]], a formal office in the Capitol itself and a working office in the [[Russell Senate Office Building]]. [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was the first vice president to be given an office in the White House complex, in the [[Old Executive Office Building]]. The former Navy Secretary's office in the OEOB has since been designated the "Ceremonial Office of the Vice President" and is today used for formal events and press interviews. President [[Jimmy Carter]] was the first president to give his vice president, [[Walter Mondale]], an office in the [[West Wing]] of the White House, which all vice presidents have since retained. Because of their function as Presidents of the Senate, vice presidents still maintain offices and staff members on Capitol Hill.

Though Walter Mondale's tenure was the beginning of the modern day power of the vice presidency, the tenure of [[Dick Cheney]] saw a rapid growth in the office of the vice president. Vice President Cheney held a tremendous amount of power and frequently made policy decisions on his own, without the knowledge of the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031013/13cheney.htm|title=Dick Cheney is the most powerful vice president in history.

Palin and Sen. Biden |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rapid growth has led to calls for abolition of the vice presidency from various constitutional scholars and political commentators such as: [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], [[Matthew Yglesias]], and [[Bruce Ackerman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Natoli|first1=Marie|title=Abolish the Vice-Presidency?|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |date=1979|volume=9|issue=2|pages=202–203|jstor=27547463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yglesias|first1=Matthew|title=End the Vice Presidency|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/end-the-vice-presidency/307516/|accessdate=December 28, 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|title=Abolish the vice presidency |url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-oe-ackerman2-2008oct02-story.html?barc=0|accessdate=December 28, 2017 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Since 1977, former presidents and vice presidents who are elected or re-elected to the Senate are entitled to the largely honorific position of [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate#Deputy President pro tempore|Deputy President pro tempore]]. To date, the only former vice president to have held this title is Hubert Humphrey following his return to the Senate. Also, under the terms of an 1886 Senate resolution, all former vice presidents are entitled to a [[United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection|portrait bust]] in the Senate wing of the [[United States Capitol]], commemorating their service as presidents of the Senate. Dick Cheney is the most recent former vice president to be so honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection|website=senate.gov|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/common/slideshow/vp_busts.htm|publisher=Secretary of the Senate|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike former presidents, whose pension is fixed at the same rate, regardless of their time in office, former vice presidents receive their retirement income based on their role as President of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adamczyk|first=Alacia|date=January 20, 2017|title=Here's How Much Money Obama and Biden Will Get From Their Pensions|url=http://time.com/money/4640736/barack-obama-joe-biden-pension/|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, since 2008, each former vice president and their immediate family is entitled (under the "Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008") to [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] protection for up to six months after leaving office, and again temporarily at any time thereafter if warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.5938 – Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008, 110th Congress (2007–2008)|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/5938?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.5938%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1|website=congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
