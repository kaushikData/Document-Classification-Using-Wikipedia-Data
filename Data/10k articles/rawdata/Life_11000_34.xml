'''Saint Aaron of Aleth''' (died after 552), also called ''Saint Aihran'' or ''Eran'' in [[Breton language|Breton]], was a sixth-century [[hermit]], [[monk]] and [[abbot]] at a monastery on [[Cézembre]], a small island near [[Aleth]], opposite [[Saint-Malo]] in Brittany, France. Some sources say that he was born of British stock in [[Armorica]]n [[Domnonia]].

Aaron was a [[Welsh people|Welshman]] who lived in solitude near [[Lamballe]] and [[Pleumeur-Gautier]], before finally settling in Aleth. He attracted numerous visitors while there, including [[Saint Malo (saint)|Saint Malo]], it is said, in 544, and became their abbot. He died soon afterwards. Saint Malo then succeeded to the spiritual rule of the district subsequently known as Saint-Malo, and was consecrated first [[Bishop of Aleth]]. Aaron's feast day is 21 June (at Saint-Malo) or 22 June (elsewhere). He is mentioned in ''[[Les Vies des Saints de Bretagne]]''.&lt;ref name="Holweck"&gt;Holweck, F. G. ''A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints''. St. Louis, MO: B. Herder Book Co. (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron is believed to have died in the town of [[Saint-Aaron]] in Lamballe, France.

Sheikh '''Abadir Umar ar-Rida al Harari''' ([[Harari language|Harari]]: ኣው ኣባዲር, {{lang-so|Abaadir Umar Ar-Rida}}, {{lang-ar|الفقيه عمر الرضا أبادر البكري الصديقي التيمي القرشي الهرري}}), also known as '''Fiqi Umar''' and '''Abadir Musa Warwaje'le''',&lt;ref name="Esamw"&gt;[http://somaliswisstv.com/2009/06/28/first-emir-of-harar-sheikh-abadir-musa-warwaje’le/ Emir Sheikh Abadir Musa Warwaje’le]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] [[Ulama|cleric]] [[patron saint]] of the city of [[Harar]] in modern-day eastern [[Ethiopia]]. He is regarded as the immediate common patriarch of the [[Harari people|Harari]] and the [[Somalis|Somali]] [[Sheekhaal]] clan.

==History==
Ar-Rida is the main figure in the ''Fath Madinat Harar'', an unpublished history of [[Harar]] in the 13th century. According to the account, he along with several other religious leaders traveled from the [[Hijaz]] region of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]] to Harar in 612H (1216 AD).&lt;ref name="Uhlig"&gt;Siegbert Uhlig, ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N'', Volume 3, (Otto Harrassowitz Verlag: 2007), pp.111 &amp; 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Ar-Rida subsequently married a [[Harari people|Harari]] woman, and constructed the city's Jamia mosque.&lt;ref name="Esamw"/&gt;

==Descendants==
The [[Somalis|Somali]] [[Sheekhaal]] clan traces descent to Sheikh Abadir ar-Rida, also known as ''Fiqi Umar''.&lt;ref name="burton1856"&gt;{{Cite book | first=Richard | last=Burton | title=First Footsteps in East Africa | date=1856 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzhCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA279#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |  pages=279–280 | quote=The Shaykhash, or "Reverend" as the term means, are the only Somal of the mountains not derived from Dir and Darud. Claiming descent from the Caliph Abubakr, they assert that ten generations ago, one Ao Khutab bin Fakih Umar crossed over from El Hejaz, and settled in Eastern Africa with his six sons, Umar the greater, Umar the less, two Abdillahs, Ahmed, and lastly Siddik.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ar-Rida in turn traced his lineage to the first [[caliph]], [[Abu Bakr]] (Sayid Abubakar Al-Sadiq).&lt;ref name="burton1856" /&gt; According to the explorer [[Richard F. Burton]], Fiqi Umar crossed over from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] ten generations prior to 1854.&lt;ref name="burton1856" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2788">'''Abu Bakr II ibn `Abd al-Munan''' was the emir of [[Harar]] (1829-1852). He was the son of `Abd al-Mannan, the nephew of [[`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad]], and the husband of Guisti ([[Harari language|Harari]] "princess") Fatima, `Abd ar-Rahman's oldest daughter.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Caulk, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/180638 "Harar Town and Its Neighbours in the Nineteenth Century", ''Journal of African History''], '''18''' (1977), p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded to the throne of Harar upon the death of `Abd ar-Rahman. 

For a number of years in the 1830s, Abu Bakr campaigned against the neighboring [[Oromo people|Oromo]] with an armed force which the British explorer W. C. Barker described as "consisting of from 150 to 200 matchlock men, 100 cavalry armed with long spears, 60 spearmen on foot, and a few archers. Insignificant, however, as this force really is, the matchlockmen alone render it far superior to that of the neighbouring tribes, who have a great dread of fire-arms; they have not even a single matchlock in their possession."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1798000 "Extract Report on the Probable Geographical Position of Harrar; With Some Information Relative to the Various Tribes in the Vicinity", ''Journal of the Royal Geographical Society''], '''12''' (1842), pp. 239, 240&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his military successes, by 1840 Harari merchants lamented that the neighboring Oromo were devastating the neighboring villages. The Harari were attacked in their fields within sight of the city walls in the middle of the day, and the city was spared in the end only by paying tribute.&lt;ref name=Caulk-377&gt;Caulk, "Harar Town", p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; 

Burton alludes to the existence of communications between Emir Abu Bakr and the British governor of [[Aden]]. At the same time, there was tension between Harar and Hajj Sharmakay, ruler of [[Zeila]]; in response to the Emir's imprisonment of his agent in Harar, Hajj Sharmakay persuaded the son of [[Sahle Selassie]], ruler of [[Shewa]], to imprison about 300 citizens of Harar then resident in Shewa.&lt;ref name=Burton-176&gt;Burton, ''First Footsteps'', pp. 176 and note&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton also mentions that Abu Bakr's [[vizier]], or chief minister, was the treacherous Gerad Mohammed, who also served his son Ahmad. Burton had been told that, before his death, Abu Bakr had warned his son about the man.&lt;ref name=Burton-176/&gt;

He died on 8 July 1852 and was succeeded by his son Ahmad, who initially ruled under the regency of his mother Guisti Fatima, who was popular with the people of Harar.&lt;ref name=Caulk-377/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3818">[[File:Herma IstArchMu747.jpg|thumb|Herm of [[Hermes]], Roman copy of a late 5th century BC original, the forefront inscription states the herm was made by Alcamenes and dedicated by Pergamios, [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Istanbul Museums]].]]

'''Alcamenes''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλκαμένης}}) was an [[ancient Greek]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]] of [[Lemnos]] and [[Athens]],  who flourished in the 2nd half of the 5th century BC. He was a younger contemporary of [[Phidias]] and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works, among which a [[Hephaestus]] and an [[Aphrodite of the Gardens|Aphrodite "of the Gardens"]] were conspicuous.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alcamenes|volume=1|pages=517–518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says&lt;ref&gt;''Description of Greece'' V. 10. 8&lt;/ref&gt; that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of [[Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Pausanias&lt;ref&gt;''Description of Greece'' I. 8. 4&lt;/ref&gt; also refers to a statue of Ares by Alcamenes that was erected on the [[Athenian agora]], which some have related to the [[Ares Borghese]].  However, the temple of Ares to which he refers had only been moved from [[Acharnes]] and re-sited in the Agora in [[Augustus]]'s time, and statues known to derive from Alcamenes' statue show the god in a [[breastplate]],&lt;ref&gt;One sculpture of Ares and Aphrodite is depicted [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=20221 in this relief]&lt;/ref&gt; so the identification of Alcamenes' Ares with the Ares Borghese is not secure.

At [[Pergamum]] there was discovered in 1903 a Hellenistic copy of the head of the Hermes "Propylaeus" of Alcamenes.&lt;ref&gt;''Athenische Mittheilungen'', 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;180&lt;/ref&gt; As, however, the deity is represented in a [[Neo-Attic]], archaistic and conventional character, this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of Alcamenes, who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

It is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the [[Parthenon]], in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of Phidias.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He is said to be the most eminent sculptor in [[Athens]] after the departure of Phidias for [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11864">'''Antisense therapy''' is a form of treatment for [[genetic disorder]]s or infections. When the genetic sequence of a particular [[gene]] is known to be causative of a particular disease, it is possible to [[oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesize]] a strand of [[nucleic acid]] ([[DNA]], [[RNA]] or a chemical analogue) that will bind to the [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) produced by that gene and inactivate it, effectively turning that gene "off". This is because mRNA has to be single stranded for it to be translated.  Alternatively, the strand might be targeted to bind a [[Splicing (genetics)|splicing]] site on pre-mRNA and modify the [[exon]] content of an mRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Morcos | first = PA  |  year = 2007 | title = Achieving targeted and quantifiable alteration of mRNA splicing with Morpholino oligos | journal = Biochem Biophys Res Commun | volume = 358 | issue = 2 | pages = 521–7  | pmid = 17493584 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.04.172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This synthesized nucleic acid is termed an "anti-sense" [[oligonucleotide]] (AON) because its [[Base pair|base]] sequence is complementary to the gene's messenger RNA (mRNA), which is called the "sense" sequence (so that a sense segment of mRNA " 5'-AAGGUC-3' " would be blocked by the anti-sense mRNA segment " 3'-UUCCAG-5' ").

As of 2016, several antisense drugs have been approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA): [[fomivirsen]] as a treatment for [[cytomegalovirus retinitis]], [[mipomersen]] for homozygous [[familial hypercholesterolemia]], [[eteplirsen]] for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and [[nusinersen]] for spinal muscular atrophy.

==Example antisense therapies==

As of 2012, some 40 antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs were in clinical trials, including over 20 in advanced clinical trials (Phase II or III).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Cancer===
Also in 2006, German physicians reported on a dose-escalation study for the compound [[AP 12009]] (a phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide specific for the mRNA of human transforming growth factor TGF-beta2) in patients with high grade [[gliomas]].  At the time of the report, the median overall survival had not been obtained and the authors hinted at a potential cure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meeting.jco.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/18_suppl/1566 Results of G004, a phase IIb actively controlled clinical trial with the TGF-b2 targeted compound AP 12009 for recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma - Hau et al. 24 (18 Supplement): 1566 - ASCO Meeting Abstracts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712062953/http://meeting.jco.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/18_suppl/1566 |date=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cytomegalovirus retinitis===
[[Fomivirsen]]  (marketed as Vitravene), was approved by the U.S. FDA in Aug 1998 as a treatment for [[cytomegalovirus retinitis]].

===Familial hypercholesterolemia===
In January 2013 [[mipomersen]] (marketed as Kynamro) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of homozygous [[familial hypercholesterolemia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Andrew (29 January 2013) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/business/fda-approves-genetic-drug-to-treat-rare-disease.html F.D.A.

===Hemorrhagic fever viruses===
In early 2006, scientists studying the [[Ebola]] [[hemorrhagic fever]] virus at [[USAMRIID]] announced a 75% recovery rate after infecting four [[rhesus monkey]]s and then treating them with an antisense [[Morpholino]] drug developed by [[Sarepta Therapeutics]] (formerly named [[AVI BioPharma]]), a U.S. biotechnology firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usamriid.army.mil/press%20releases/warfield_press_release.pdf U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, Maryland.

In late 2008, AVI BioPharma successfully filed [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) applications with the FDA for its two lead products for [[Marburg virus|Marburg]] and Ebola viruses.  These drugs, [[AVI-6002]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15194784 |year=2004 |last1=Lu |first1=X |last2=Yu |first2=Q |last3=Binder |first3=GK |last4=Chen |first4=Z |last5=Slepushkina |first5=T|last6=Rossi|first6=J|last7=Dropulic|first7=B|title=Antisense-Mediated Inhibition of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Replication by Use of an HIV Type 1-Based Vector Results in Severely Attenuated Mutants Incapable of Developing Resistance |volume=78 |issue=13 |pages=7079–88 |doi=10.1128/JVI.78.13.7079-7088.2004 |pmc=421644 |journal=Journal of Virology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AVI-6003]] are novel analogs based on AVI's PMO antisense chemistry in which anti-viral potency is enhanced by the addition of positively charged components to the morpholino oligomer chain.

===HIV/AIDS===
Starting in 2004, researchers in the US have been conducting research on using antisense technology to combat HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15194784 | doi=10.1128/JVI.78.13.7079-7088.2004 | pmc=421644 | volume=78 | title=Antisense-mediated inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication by use of an HIV type 1-based vector results in severely attenuated mutants incapable of developing resistance | date=July 2004 | journal=J. Virol. | pages=7079–88 | last1 = Lu | first1 = X | last2 = Yu | first2 = Q | last3 = Binder | first3 = GK | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 researchers reported success in reducing HIV viral load using patient T-cells which had been harvested, modified with an RNA antisense strand to the HIV viral envelope protein, and re-infused into the patient during a planned lapse in retroviral drug therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100218191736.htm University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

=== Spinal muscular atrophy ===
In 2004, development of an antisense therapy for [[spinal muscular atrophy]] was started. Over the following years, an [[antisense oligonucleotide]] later named [[nusinersen]] was developed by [[Ionis Pharmaceuticals]] under a licensing agreement with [[Biogen]].  In December 2016, nusinersen received regulatory approval from [[FDA]] for use to treat spinal muscular atrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wadman|first1=Meredith|title=Updated: FDA approves drug that rescues babies with fatal neurodegenerative disease|journal=Science|date=23 December 2016|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/12/novel-drug-rescues-babies-fatal-neurodegenerative-disease}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/surprise-drug-approval-is-holiday-gift-for-biogen-1482856447|title=Surprise Drug Approval Is Holiday Gift for Biogen|last=Grant|first=Charley|date=2016-12-27|work=|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-12-27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duchenne muscular dystrophy ===
In September 2016 [[eteplirsen]], a Morpholino oligo, received FDA approval for the treatment of [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]].

=== Hypertriglyceridemia ===
[[Volanesorsen]] is in phase 3 clinical trials for treating hypertriglyceridemia as of December 2016.

==Delivery==

Because [[nuclease]]s that cleave the [[phosphodiester linkage]] in DNA are expressed in almost every cell, unmodified DNA molecules are generally degraded before they reach their targets. Therefore, antisense [[Biologic medical product|drug]]  candidate molecules are generally modified during the [[drug discovery]] phase of their development.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett CF, Swayze EE.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20055705/ RNA targeting therapeutics: molecular mechanisms of antisense oligonucleotides as a therapeutic platform]. Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol. 2010;50:259-93. {{doi|10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.010909.105654}}. {{PMID|20055705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu L, Anchordoquy T.

J Pharm Sci. 2011 Jan;100(1):38-52. {{doi|10.1002/jps.22243}}. {{PMID|20575003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, most targets of antisense are located inside cells, and getting nucleic acids across cell membranes is also difficult.   Therefore, most clinical candidates have modified DNA "backbones", or the [[nucleobase]] or sugar moieties of the [[nucleotides]] are altered.  Additionally, other molecules may be conjugated to antisense molecules in order to improve their ability to target certain cells or to cross barriers like cell membranes or the [[blood brain barrier]].&lt;ref name=Bennett /&gt;

'''Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council''' ('''BBSRC''') is a UK [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]] and [[non-departmental public body|NDPB]]  and is the largest UK public funder of non-medical bioscience. It predominantly funds [[science|scientific]] research institutes and [[university]] research departments in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

==Purpose==
Receiving its funding through the science budget of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS), BBSRC's mission is to "promote and support, by any means, high-quality basic, strategic and applied research and related postgraduate training relating to the understanding and exploitation of biological systems".&lt;ref&gt;BBSRC mission http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/organisation/mission.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
BBSRC's head office is at Polaris House &lt;ref&gt;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=polaris+house+swindon&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Polaris+House,+N+Star+Ave,+Swindon+SN2+1UJ&amp;gl=uk&amp;ei=A92UTbvfEdG5hAfc9en8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ8gEwAA&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Swindon]] - the same building as the other Research Councils, [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]] [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]], [[Economic and Social Research Council|ESRC]], [[Medical Research Council (UK)|MRC]], [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]], and [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]], as well as [[Research Councils UK|RCUK]] and the [[UK Space Agency|UKSA]].  Funded by Government, BBSRC invested over £509M in world-class bioscience in 2014-15. BBSRC also manages the joint Research Councils' Office in Brussels - the [[UK Research Office]] (UKRO).

==History==

BBSRC was created in 1994, merging the former [[Agricultural and Food Research Council]] (AFRC) and taking over the biological science activities of the former [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (SERC).&lt;ref name="BBSRC history"/&gt;

==Governance and management==
BBSRC is managed by the BBSRC Council consisting of a chairman (from 1 July 2009, Professor Sir [[Tom Blundell]]), a chief executive (Professor Melanie Welham) and from ten to eighteen representatives from UK universities, government and industry. The Council approves policies, strategy, budgets and major funding. On 11 February 2016, the Minister for Universities and Science, [[Jo Johnson]], announced the appointment of Professor Melanie Welham as interim Chief Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof Melanie Welham appointed BBSRC Chief Executive|url=http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/news/people-skills-training/2016/160211-pr-melanie-welham-interim-bbsrc-chief-executive/|publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Welham was previously Executive Director of Science at BBSRC.

A Research Panel provides expert advice which BBSRC Council draws upon in making decisions. The purpose of the Research Panel is to advise on:

* the development and implementation of the Council's strategic plans
* the competitiveness, relevance, economic impact, and societal considerations of the science and innovation activities funded by BBSRC
* opportunities for partnership with national and international organisations

===Boards, panels and committees===
In addition to the Council and the Research Panel, BBSRC has a series of other internal bodies for specific purposes.

* Appointments Board
* Audit Board
* Remuneration Board
* Strategy Panels - eight Panels advise and report to the BBSRC Chief Executive
* Research Committees - five Committees award research grants in specific science areas

==Institutes of BBSRC==

The Council strategically funds eight research institutes in the UK, and a number of centres ([http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/organisation/institutes BBSRC: Institutes and centres]).

The Institutes are tasked with delivering innovative, world class bioscience research and training, leading to wealth and job creation, generating high returns for the UK economy.{{cn|date=October 2015}} They have strong links with business, industry and the wider community, and support policy development.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The institutes' research underpins key sectors of the UK economy such as agriculture, bioenergy, biotechnology, food and drink and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the institutes maintain unique research facilities of national importance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10501">The '''Bounty Bowl''' was the name given to two [[National Football League|NFL]] games held in [[1989 NFL season|1989]] between the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The first, a [[1989 NFL season|1989]] [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] in [[Texas Stadium|Dallas]], was noted for allegations that the Eagles put a $200 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Cowboys [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Luis Zendejas]], who had been cut by Philadelphia earlier that season. The second was a rematch held two weeks later in Philadelphia. The Eagles, favored to win both games, swept the series.

The Cowboys/Eagles rivalry had been increasingly heated since the 1986 season, with [[Buddy Ryan]] arriving as the Eagles' head coach; the next year, during the NFL players' strike, the Cowboys (who were playing with a number of players that crossed picket lines) routed an Eagles squad filled with [[replacement player]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro Football: Ryan Gets Revenge in the End|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 26, 1987|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-26/sports/sp-10877_1_buddy-ryan|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan, believing that the Cowboys had [[running up the score|run up the score]] in poor form, responded in kind in the second game when the strike was over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He's sure no Buddy to the Cowboys|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date=October 27, 1987|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L2kVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eeEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6695,6719706|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1988 season, the Cowboys were sold to [[Jerry Jones]], who proceeded to gut the team and fire longtime head coach [[Tom Landry]] in preparation for rebuilding.

On November 23, 1989, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 27–0. Following the game, which was broadcast on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], Cowboys head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] alleged that Ryan had taken out a bounty on two of the former's players, kicker Luis Zendejas and quarterback [[Troy Aikman]]:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW9oYaSQdg&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|I have absolutely no respect for the way they played the game, I would have said something to Buddy, but he wouldn't stand on the field long enough. He put his big, fat rear end into the dressing room.}}

Ryan denied the bounty accusation, saying that film of the game "show that Small had no intention of hurting Zendejas."&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt; The Philadelphia coach asserted it would have been in the Eagles' best interests to keep Zendejas in the game because he was in a slump.&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt; Ryan also joked about Johnson's accusations:&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.philly.com/1989-11-25/sports/26136930_1_bounty-luis-zendejas-james-david-ryan | title = Despite Investigation, Buddy's Humor Bountiful | first = Tim | last = Kawakami | newspaper = [[Philadelphia Daily News]] | date = November 25, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|I resent that. I've been on a diet, I lost a couple of pounds, and I thought I was looking good.}}

When the Cowboys and Eagles met on Thanksgiving 25 years later, on November 27, 2014, Johnson joked that Ryan put up the bounty offer to keep his players interested since the Cowboys, who ultimately went 1-15, were so bad that year.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Johnson mentioned in the first segment of [[Fox NFL Sunday]] on November 27, 2014. Johnson was an analyst on the show at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zendejas spoke of having seen &lt;nowiki&gt;''Buddy call guys out and give them $100''&lt;/nowiki&gt; for what the kicker called a weekly Big Hit award but what Ryan called a Big Play award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-backfire-from-buddy-ryan-s-bounties.html|title=Sports of The Times; The Backfire From Buddy Ryan's 'Bounties'|last=Dave Anderson|date=1989-11-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This set of events set the stage for the scheduled rematch two weeks later in Philadelphia, dubbed "Bounty Bowl II."  As for the Eagles, they would not play another Thanksgiving game until the [[2008 NFL season]] when the Eagles faced the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] in a preview of that season's NFC Championship Game.

The second game in the series took place on December 10, 1989, with NFL commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] in attendance. The game was anticipated as a media event. [[CBS Sports]] did a pre-game opening touting the contest as "Bounty Bowl II", complete with wanted posters, the involved players' pictures, and bounty amounts.

During the game, Eagles' [[700 Level|fans]] threw snowballs, ice, and beer onto the field. Several game participants were targeted, including back judge [[Al Jury]] and Cowboys punter [[Mike Saxon]] (both struck by snowballs), as well as Cowboys coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], who was hit with objects as he was escorted off the field by the [[Philadelphia Police Department]]. Television announcers [[Verne Lundquist]] and [[Terry Bradshaw]] were also pelted with snowballs – Lundquist would claim on-air that a recent dental surgery had been less unpleasant than broadcasting a game in Philadelphia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSroPtp4jTI&amp;feature=related | title = 1989 Bounty Bowl II | publisher = YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and Eagles defensive lineman [[Jerome Brown]] was struck while standing on the sideline asking fans to cease throwing things.

Future [[Pennsylvania governor]] and Eagles fan [[Edward Rendell]] later admitted that he was involved in the incident. The then-former Philadelphia [[district attorney]] and future [[mayor of Philadelphia]] and [[governor of Pennsylvania]] bet another fan $20 that the latter couldn't reach the field with a snowball; Rendell lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/1769299/detail.html | title = Meet Ed Rendell: New Governor Led Philly Comeback | date = November 5, 2002 | location = Philadelphia | publisher = WTAE Pittsburgh, ThePittsburghChannel | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021107010050/http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/1769299/detail.html | archivedate = November 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eagles won the game 20–10. As a result of the incident, the Eagles added security and banned beer sales for their last home game of the year against the [[Phoenix Cardinals]] and the subsequent NFC wild-card playoff game versus the [[Los Angeles Rams]].

==Aftermath==

'''Porkchop Bowl'''
{{Main article|1990 Dallas Cowboys season#Porkchop Bowl}}
A third game in the heated rivalry took place the next season, known as the "Porkchop Bowl". The game got its name because Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan choked on a pork chop in the week leading up to the game. Philadelphia won this game as well, 21–20.

The '''Business Roundtable''' ('''BRT''') is a group of [[chief executive officers]] of major U.S. corporations formed to promote pro-business [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, L. (1991, March 7). The Business Roundtable is mentioned by G. William Domhoff in ''Who Rules America?''  Domhoff argues that the Business Roundtable supports the network of corporate control and influence over the economy, politics, and media.  Perils to conservatives in a conservative court.

==History==
The Roundtable was founded in 1972 by John Harper, the head of [[Alcoa]], and [[Fred J. Borch]], CEO of [[General Electric]], who were concerned about growing public hostility toward corporations as evidenced by support for government regulation of the workplace environment and about the power of unions to squeeze corporate profits in an increasingly competitive international market. The two CEOs talked with [[John Connally]], [[President Nixon]]'s [[Secretary of the Treasury]], and [[Arthur Burns]], the [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]], who advised them to set up a lobbying organization that would specifically represent large banks and corporations. Harper was the first president, followed by Thomas Murphy of [[General Motors]], Irving Shapiro of [[DuPont]], and Clifford Garvin of [[Exxon]]. 

The group was formed through the merger of three existing organizations: the March Group, consisting of chief executive officers who met informally to consider public policy issues; the Construction Users Anti-Inflation Roundtable, a group devoted to containing construction costs; and, the Labor Law Study Committee, largely made up of labor relations executives of major companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessroundtable.org//aboutUs/history.aspx "About Us"], Business Roundtable website&lt;/ref&gt; The group has called itself President Obama's "closest ally in the business community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Business leaders say Obama's economic policies stifle growth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/22/AR2010062205279.html |work= |location= |date= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Business Roundtable played a key role in defeating an [[anti-trust]] bill in 1975 and a [[Ralph Nader]] plan for a consumer protection agency in 1977. It also helped dilute the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act]]. But the Roundtable's most significant victory was in blocking labor law reform that sought to strengthen labor law to make it more difficult for companies to intimidate workers who wanted to form unions. The AFL-CIO produced a bill in 1977 that passed the House. But the Roundtable voted to oppose the bill, and through its aggressive lobbying, it prevented the bill's Senate supporters from rounding up the 60 votes in the Senate necessary to withstand a [[filibuster]].

In fiscal policy, the Roundtable was responsible for broadening the 1985 tax cuts signed into law by [[Ronald Reagan]], lobbying successfully for sharp reductions in corporate taxes. In trade policy, it argued for opening foreign markets to American trade and investment. The [[Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act|Omnibus Trade Act]] of 1988 reflected  the thinking of the Business Roundtable. In 1990, the Roundtable urged George Bush to initiate a free trade agreement with Mexico. In 1993, the Roundtable lobbied for [[NAFTA]] and against any strong side agreements on labor and the environment. It provided the money and leadership for the main pro-NAFTA lobby.

The Roundtable also successfully opposed changes in corporate governance that would have made boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders. In 1986, the Roundtable convinced the Securities and Exchange Commission to forgo new rules on merger and acquisitions, and in 1993 convinced President Clinton to water down his plan to impose penalties on excessive executive salaries. [[Citicorp]] CEO, John Reed, chairperson of the Roundtables Accounting Task Force, argued that Clinton's plan would have had negative effects on U.S. competitiveness. The Roundtable's Health, Welfare, and Retirement Income Task Force, chaired by [[Prudential Insurance]] CEO Robert C. Winters, cheered President Bush's plan, which consisted mainly of subsidies to the health care industry. The nation's health care system works well for the majority of Americans, the Roundtable announced in a June 1991 statement. "We believe the solutions lie not in tearing down the present system, but in building upon it."

In a press release, it said it "strongly supported passage of" the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2002, and was "actively working with states on implementation." It has issued press releases, submitted editorials, given congressional testimony, and distributed position advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessroundtable.org//taskForces/taskforce/issue.aspx?qs=6545BF159F849514481138A6DBE7A7A19BB6487BF6B38 "ISSUE: No Child Left Behind"] website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Business Roundtable also acts as a major [[lobbying|lobby]] that aims to extend or maintain administrators' rights/power in large companies. For example, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] adopted the so-called "shareholders’ access to proxy" rule, which aimed to empower shareholders in the proposition and nomination of administrators of big corporations. The Business Roundtable was strongly against that rule, as its president John Castellani reported to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' about removing this rule: "this is our highest priority [...] Literally all of our members have called about this".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/13/AR2010051305288.html&lt;/ref&gt; And they got the upper hand: the SEC rule was finally dropped after intense lobbying and lawsuits.

===Legislation===
The Business Roundtable wrote a letter to members of the House strongly endorsing the [[Customer Protection and End User Relief Act (H.R. 4413; 113th Congress)]].&lt;ref name=BRTletter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cutler|first1=Alexander M.|title=BRT Letter to House on the Customer Protection and End-User Relief Act|url=http://businessroundtable.org/resources/brt-letter-house-customer-protection-and-end-user-relief-act|publisher=Business Roundtable|accessdate=18 June 2014|date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Business Roundtable letter, a survey of chief financial officers and corporate treasurers "underscores the urgent need for the end-user provisions" in this bill because "eighty-six percent of respondents indicated the fully collateralizing over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives would adversely impact business investment, acquisitions, research and development, and job creation."&lt;ref name="BRTletter"/&gt; The letter concluded that the Business Roundtable "supports efforts to increase transparency in the derivatives markets and enhance financial stability for the U.S. economy through thoughtful new regulation while avoiding needless costs."&lt;ref name="BRTletter"/&gt;

==Criticism==

The Business Roundtable has been identified by advocates for shareholder democracy and owners' rights as a primary inhibitor of progress in corporate governance, who claim that through its lobbying of the SEC, the NYSE, and other regulatory and self-regulatory institutions, the Business Roundtable has sought to limit shareholders proxy rights and the power to nominate directors. The critics of the Business Roundtable contend that rather than fighting on behalf of stockholders in companies, it has focused purely on increasing executive power and compensation, thereby diminishing return to the owners (shareholders) of these firms.

* Corporate governance pioneer [[Robert A. G. Monks|Robert A.G. Monks]], in his 2007 book [[Corpocracy: How CEOs and the Business Roundtable Hijacked the World's Greatest Wealth Machine -- And How to Get It Back]], argues that the Business Roundtable has been a key player in the steady dilution of shareholder access to the boardroom and that this has contributed to the skyrocketing rates of CEO compensation.
* [[G. William Domhoff]], in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', argues that the Business Roundtable supports the network of corporate control, and influence over the economy, politics, and media.
* In [[The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism]], [[John C. Bogle]], the founder of the [[Vanguard Group]] and author of investing classic [[Common Sense on Mutual Funds: New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor]], argues that the Business Roundtable is to blame for the failure of recent corporate governance initiatives.
* The [[University of Hawaii]]'s Robert R. Locke, author of Confronting Managerialism, identifies the Business Roundtable as a major contributor to what he calls "Managerialism", the shift in power from owner/shareholders to those who are the manager/agents of firms. His 2011 work, [[Confronting Managerialism: How the Business Elite and Their Schools Threw Our Lives Out of Balance]], explores several cases in which the Business Roundtable has opposed changes to corporate governance rules that would have empowered shareholders at the expense of CEOs.

==Formation==
In 1995 [[Edwin Kagin]], member of the Free Inquiry Group of Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky (FIG), conceived of the idea for a secular summer camp for children of nontheistic and [[atheist]] families, in response to the exclusion of non-religious children from the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php/articles/3316 |author= [[Tom Flynn (author)|Tom Flynn]] |title=Happy Campers |publisher=[[Council for Secular Humanism]] |date= May 31, 1996 |work= Secular Humanist Bulletin |volume= 12 |number= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed a small committee of members of FIG with himself and Helen Kagin acting as directors and on August 11, 1996 the first camp took place in premises owned by [[Bullittsburg Baptist Church]] in [[Boone County, Kentucky]] with 20 children attending.&lt;ref name="Parenting Beyond Belief"&gt;{{cite book|title=Parenting Beyond Belief: On Raising Ethical, Caring Kids without Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVSa06j3fgIC&amp;pg=PA243|edition=Abridged ebook|date=15 February 2011|publisher=[[AMACOM]]|isbn=9780814474266|pages=242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wp2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zuckerman_SecularLife"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Phil|authorlink1=Phil Zuckerman|title=Living the Secular Life: New Answers to Old Questions|date=2014|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-508-8|pages=107-109|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Camp Quest moved to a nearby [[YMCA]] camp in [[Ohio]], Camp Kern, at which the Northern Kentucky Baptist Association then sought the legal right to restrict the use of their campgrounds based on religious beliefs. At their request, then-Kentucky Representative Tom Kerr sponsored legislation (House Bill 70) exempting religious organizations from anti-discrimination requirements of public accommodation laws. His legislation was not successful and the bill was passed over in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwinkagin.com/documents/bullittsburg/ |title=Camp Quest Lease of Baptist Summer Camp Spurs Legislative Efforts to Exempt Churches from Public Accommodation Laws |publisher=Edwin Kagin |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camp Quest Inc.==

In 2000 Camp Quest expanded with independent camps operating across the United States with the same mission statement, becoming Camp Quest Inc., an independent educational non-profit organization, in 2007 with [[Fred Edwords]] as its first president.&lt;ref name=cq2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=https://www.campquest.org/history/|website=Camp Quest|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Quest Inc. now serves as an umbrella group for all Camp Quest affiliates in North America. Edwin and Helen Kagin continued as co-directors of the original Camp Quest based in [[Ohio]] until their retirement in 2005. The original Camp Quest moved to [[4-H]] Camp Graham in Clarksville, Ohio, its current location.

The first affiliated group to begin operating a second Camp Quest summer camp session was the Rationalists of East Tennessee,&lt;ref name=et2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rationalists.org/|title=Rationalists of East Tennessee - Home|website=rationalists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which hosted its first camp session in Tennessee under the name Camp Quest of the Smoky Mountains in 2002.

in 2009 Camp Quest expanded outside North America with [[Camp Quest UK]] launching in the [[United Kingdom]]. Current Camp Quest UK director, Samantha Stein, became a volunteer for the organisation at a camp in [[Michigan]] and was prompted to start a camp in the UK with a group of volunteers.&lt;ref name="ind2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summertime camps boom: The 'Godless alternative' for non-believers|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/summertime-camps-boom-the-godless-alternative-for-non-believers-1675815.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jref"/&gt; The first UK camp was supported by a grant from the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]], and was held in [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/29/atheist-summer-camp-somerset |title= Summer camp offers 'godless' alternative for atheists |date= 29 July 2009 |accessdate= 13 April 2014 |first= Steven |last= Morris |work= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein fielded a considerable amount of press interest when the [[Sunday Times]] broadsheet newspaper ran a front-page article on Camp Quest UK with the headline 'Dawkins sets up kids’ camp to groom atheists'.&lt;ref name="jref"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1761-philosophising-children-and-camp-quest-uk-interview-with-samantha-stein.html |title= Philosophising Children And Camp Quest UK – Interview With Samantha Stein |accessdate= 13 April 2014 |first= Kylie |last= Sturgess |authorlink=Kylie Sturgess|work= [[James Randi Educational Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tele2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/5674934/Richard-Dawkins-launches-childrens-summer-camp-for-atheists.html |title= Richard Dawkins launches children's summer camp for atheists |date= 28 June 2009 |first= Ben |last= Leach |work= The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Times later went on to include it in their ''Best kids camps in Britain''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brookes|first1=Julia|title=The best kids camps in Britain|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-best-kids-camps-in-britain-6bxqt3f99nh|website=The Times|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''10 best kids' adventure holidays''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bleach|first1=Stephen|title=Britain's 10 best kids' adventure holidays|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britains-10-best-kids-adventure-holidays-fqr3chvv3gl|website=The Times|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CQUK also received support from the [[Humanists UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our supporters|url=http://camp-quest.org.uk/supporters/|website=Camp Quest UK|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and identity==
The camp's logo is based on original artwork by [[Edwin Kagin]]'s daughter, Kathryn. The letters "C" and "Q" are combined into an infinity symbol. The name Quest is an [[acronym]] for Question, Understand, Explore, Search, Test. The camp's slogan is, "Camp Quest. It's beyond belief!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camp-quest.org.uk/about/history/ |title=History |publisher=Camp Quest UK |year=2011 |access-date=2010-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108011654/http://www.camp-quest.org.uk/about/history/# |archive-date=2013-01-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Quest aims to provide a fun environment in which children can explore tasks using [[critical thinking]] and [[scientific reasoning]] as well as exploring ideas of [[ethics]], mutual respect and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="wp2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hesse|first1=Monica|title=Camp Quest is atheists’ answer to Bible school|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/camp-quest-is-atheists-answer-to-bible-school/2011/07/19/gIQAe1hRbI_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=30 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730095051/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/camp-quest-is-atheists-answer-to-bible-school/2011/07/19/gIQAe1hRbI_story.html?utm_term=.9d88f5bfb8cb|archivedate=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp also exists to create a welcoming environment for non-religious children, who may otherwise feel excluded from church-based activities at home and religious summer camps,&lt;ref name="econ2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glad to be godless|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14031492|website=The Economist|accessdate=30 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106040940/http://www.economist.com/node/14031492|archivedate=Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Susan|title=Summer Camp That's a Piece of Heaven for the Children, but Please, No Worshiping|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/education/summer-camp-thats-a-piece-of-heaven-for-the-children-but-please.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or want to feel confident to express [[Spiritual but not religious|spiritual]] or [[atheist]] beliefs with other children without disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bullivant|first1=Spencer Culham|editor1-last=Beaman|editor1-first=G|editor2-last=Tomlins|editor2-first=S|title=Believing to Belong: Non-religious Belief as a Path to Inclusion|journal=Atheist Identities - Spaces and Social Contexts.

==Programs and activities==
Most camps' activities include traditional summer camp events: campfires, singing, crafts, games,&lt;ref name=wp2017/&gt; swimming, canoeing and archery.&lt;ref name=econ2017/&gt;  Other activities explore science and nature and might include meteorology,&lt;ref name=nyt2017/&gt; astronomy,&lt;ref name=gua2017/&gt; evolution or building rockets.&lt;ref name=kotv2017/&gt; Campers are also encouraged to explore [[mythology]] and [[philosophy]],&lt;ref name=frit2017/&gt; including discussing [[ethics]] in a camp version of [[Socrates Cafe]].&lt;ref name="wp22017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Corrie|title=Camp Quest provides summer fun for atheist kids|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/camp-quest-provides-summer-fun-for-atheist-kids/2013/07/30/c441bc24-f959-11e2-a954-358d90d5d72d_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campers might also learn [[American Sign Language]], do drama or learn to build a radio.&lt;ref name="cqnw2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Life at camp|url=https://campquestnorthwest.org/life-at-camp/|website=Camp Quest North West|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the programs aim to introduce campers between the age of 8 and 17 to critical thinking, logic and [[freethought]].&lt;ref name=wp2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe | publisher=HarperCollins | author=Epstein, Greg | year=2010 | page=237 | isbn=978-0061670121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017 Camp Quest has expressed that it will not segregate activities by gender and has introduced policies to accommodate [[Genderqueer|non binary gender]] and [[transgender]] campers and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marusic|first1=Kristina|title=This Camp Is Making Itself Trans-Inclusive In The Most Amazing Way|url=http://www.newnownext.com/transgender-camp-camp-quest-west/01/2017/|website=Logo TV|publisher=Viacom International|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invisible unicorn challenge===

During Camp Quest attendees are tasked with the invisible [[Unicorn|unicorn]] challenge, aimed at showing that a negative cannot be proven.&lt;ref name=tele2017/&gt; The task is one of the ways used to encourage children to exercise [[logic]] and explore ideas about the [[burden of proof (philosophy)|burden of proof]] and challenges the children to prove that invisible unicorns do not exist. The children are told that two invisible unicorns exist at Camp Quest and that there is a valuable book proving their existence which has been passed from generation to generation but no one is allowed to read. Any camper who can prove that the unicorns do not exist will win a godless one-hundred dollar bill (issued before 1957, the year the U.S. Congress mandated that "[[In God We Trust]]" be printed on American [[Fiat money|fiat currency]].) In the UK the prize is a £10 note signed by [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref name="gua2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Steven|title=The great unicorn hunt|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/29/camp-quest-richard-dawkins|website=The Guardian|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since first offering this challenge in August 1996, the prize remains unclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camp-quest.org.uk/frequently-asked-questions/the-invisible-unicorn-challenge/|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Camp Quest|publisher=Camp Quest UK|date=April 29, 2009|access-date=2010-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303233901/http://www.camp-quest.org.uk/frequently-asked-questions/the-invisible-unicorn-challenge/#|archive-date=2012-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cassone della Torre''' (or ''Casso'', ''Cassono'', ''Castone'', ''Gastone''), also called '''Mosca''' (died 20 August 1318) was an Italian medieval condottiero and feudal lord. A member of the [[House of della Torre|Torriani]] family, he was [[Archbishop of Milan]] from 1308 to 1316 and [[patriarch of Aquileia]] from 1317 to 1318.

==Biography==
Cassone was the second son of [[Corrado della Torre]] and  grandson of [[Napo della Torre]]. In his youth, he stayed in [[Friuli]], then ruled by his grand-uncle [[Raimondo della Torre|Raimondo]] as [[patriarch of Aquileia]]: here most members of the family lived in exile from [[Milan]] after their arch-rival [[House of Visconti]] had been able to seize the power in that city.

Cassone was appointed canon of [[Cividale del Friuli|Cividale]] in 1296. When the della Torre were able to return to Milan in 1302, Cassone was appointed canon of the [[Cathedral of Milan]].

In 1308 he succeeded Francesco da Parma as [[Archbishop of Milan]], being elected by the [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]]of the Cathedral, of Milan, confirmed by [[Pope Clemente V]] and consecrated bishop in Milano by Ugaccione Borromeo bishop of Novara on about 12 October 1308.{{r|Fantoni}}

His appointment as Archbishop of Milano spurred a conflict with his cousin [[Guido della Torre]], who was afraid that Cassone could ally with the Visconti against him (two of the archbishop's brothers were married to nephews of Matteo Visconti's wife). In 1309 he took part to a successful papal military expedition against the [[Republic of Venice]], returning to Milan with great honors.{{r|Fantoni}} On 1 October 1309 Guido's troops attacked the archbishop's palace in Milan, and imprisoned him. On 29 October 1309 he was exiled from Milan. He moved to [[Bologna]] where the [[papal legate]] [[excommunicated]] Guido della Torre.{{r|Cazzani}}

Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Empire|Henry VII]] appointed Cassone mediator between the claims of the families [[House of della Torre|Torriani]] and [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] who were in long conflict for ruling Milan. Cassone find an agreement between the two families but it was not accepted by Guido della Torre; Emperor Henry VII then forced Guido della Torre to flee from Milan and sold the title of imperial vicar for Milan to [[Matteo I Visconti]]. Cassone re-entered in Milan and on 6 January 1311 he crowned Henry VII as [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]].{{r|Cazzani}} The debt due to the Emperor by the citizens of Milan created dissatisfaction and the Torriani instigated a revolt, which was suppressed by the Visconti, supported by the soldiers of the Emperor. Cassone then fled from Milan.{{r|Cazzani}}

On 31 December 1316 Cassone renounced the title of See of Milan, and was appointed as secular patriarch of Aquileia by [[pope John XXIII]]. However, he never took the post [[Friuli]] since he died in a fall from horse at [[Florence]]. There he was buried in the church of [[Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Florence]]; his funerary monument is attributed to [[Tino da Camaino]] or [[Agostino da Siena]].

'''Charcuterie''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɑr|ˌ|k|uː|t|ə|ˈ|r|iː}} or {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɑr|ˈ|k|uː|t|ər|i}}; northern {{IPA-fr|ʃaʁkytˈʁi|lang}} or southern {{IPA-fr|ʃaʁkytəˈʁi|lang}}, from {{lang-fr|chair||meat|label=none}}, and {{lang-fr|cuit||cooked|label=none}}) is the branch of [[cooking]] devoted to prepared meat products, such as [[bacon]], [[ham]], [[sausage]], [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s, ''[[galantine]]s'', ''[[ballotine]]s'', ''[[pâtés]]'', and ''[[confit]]'', primarily from [[pork]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlman, 18.; The Culinary Institute of America, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charcuterie is part of the ''[[garde manger]]'' [[chef]]'s repertoire.  Originally intended as a way to preserve meat before the advent of refrigeration, they are prepared today for their flavors derived from the preservation processes.&lt;ref name="Ruhlman, 19"&gt;Ruhlman, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The French word for a person who prepares charcuterie is {{lang|fr|charcutier}}, generally translated as "pork butcher".  This has led to the mistaken belief that charcuterie can only involve pork.  The ''[[Food Lover's Companion]]'', however, says, "it refers to the products, particularly (but not limited to) pork specialties such as {{lang|fr|[[pâté]]s, [[rillettes]], [[galantine]]s, [[crépinette]]s}}, etc., which are made and sold in a [[delicatessen]]-style shop, also called a ''charcuterie''." The 1961 edition of ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'' defines it as "[t]he art of preparing various meats, in particular pork, in order to present them in the most diverse ways."

==History==
[[File:Modern Charcuterie display.jpg|thumbnail|260px|right|A modern charcuterie display]]
In the first century AD, [[Strabo]] recorded the import of salted meat from [[Gaul]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Grigson]] ''Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery''&lt;/ref&gt; and the Romans may have been the first to regulate the trade of ''charcuterie'' as they wrote laws regulating the proper production of pork joints, but the [[French people|French]] have also had some influence.  In 15th-century France, local [[guild]]s regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city.  The guilds that produced ''charcuterie'' were those of the {{lang|fr|charcutiers}}.  The members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried meats, which varied, sometimes distinctively, from region to region.  The only "raw" meat the {{lang|fr|charcutiers}} were allowed to sell was unrendered [[lard]].  The {{lang|fr|charcutier}} prepared numerous items, including ''[[pâté]]s'', ''[[rillettes]]'', [[sausage]]s, [[bacon]], [[Pig's trotters|trotters]], and [[head cheese]] (brawn).  These preservation methods ensured the meats would have longer [[Shelf life|shelf lives]].&lt;ref name="Ruhlman, 19"/&gt;

==Products created with forcemeats==
{{main|Forcemeat}}

===Forcemeat===
Forcemeat is a mixture of ground, lean meat [[emulsified]] with fat.  The emulsification  can be accomplished by grinding, sieving, or puréeing the ingredients.  The emulsification may either be smooth or coarse in texture, depending on the desired consistency of the final product.  Forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in ''charcuterie''.  Meats commonly used in the production of forcemeats include [[pork]], [[fish]] ([[pike (fish)|pike]], [[trout]], or [[salmon]]), [[seafood]], [[Game (food)|game meat]]s ([[venison]], [[boar]], or [[rabbit]]), [[poultry]], [[game bird]]s, [[veal]], and pork livers.  [[Fatback|Pork fatback]] is often used for the fat portion of forcemeat, as it has a somewhat neutral flavor.&lt;ref name="CIA1"&gt;The Culinary Institute of America, 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In US usage, there are four basic styles of forcemeat. Straight forcemeats are produced by progressively grinding equal parts pork and pork fat with a third dominant meat which can be pork or another meat.  The proteins are cubed and then seasoned, cured, rested, ground and then placed into desired vessel.&lt;ref name="CIA1"/&gt;  Country-style forcemeats are a combination of pork, pork fat (often with the addition of pork liver) and garnish ingredients. The  finished product has a coarse texture.&lt;ref name="CIA1"/&gt;
The third style is [[gratin]], which has a portion of the main protein browned; the French term {{lang|fr|gratin}} connotes a "grated" product that is browned.&lt;ref name="CIA1"/&gt; The final style is ''[[Mousseline sauce|mousseline]]'', which are very light in texture using lean cuts of meat usually from [[veal]], poultry, fish, or shellfish.  The resulting texture comes from the addition of eggs and cream to this forcemeat.&lt;ref name="CIA1"/&gt;

===Sausage===
[[File:Sausage making-H-1.jpg|thumb|[[Sausage making]]]]
The word ''[[sausage]]'' is derived through French from the Latin {{lang-la|sal||salt|label=none}}, as the sausage-making technique involves placing ground or chopped meat along with salt into a tube.  The tubes can vary, but the more common animal-derived tubes include sheep, hog, or cattle intestinal linings.  Additionally, animal stomachs and bladders, as well as edible artificial casings produced from collagen and inedible plant cellulose or paper are also used.  Inedible casings are primarily used to shape, store, and age the sausage.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two main variants of sausage are fresh and cooked. Fresh sausages involve the production of raw meat placed into casings to be cooked at a later time, whereas cooked sausages are heated during production and are ready to eat at the end of production.&lt;ref name="Mcgee1"&gt;McGee, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emulsified sausage====
Emulsified sausages are cooked sausages with a very fine texture, using the combination of pork, beef, or poultry with fat, salt, cure, flavorings, and water.  These ingredients are emulsified at high speed in a food processor or blender.  During this process, the salt dissolves the muscle proteins, which helps to suspend the fat molecules.  Temperature is an important part of the process: if the temperature rises above 60&amp;nbsp;°F (16&amp;nbsp;°C) for pork or 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21&amp;nbsp;°C) for beef, the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process.&lt;ref name="Mcgee1"/&gt;

===Pâté, terrine, galantine, roulade===
[[File:Pates p1150435.jpg|thumb|left|Various ''pâtés'' and ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s'']]
''[[Pâté]]'' and ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s'' are often cooked in a pastry crust or an earthenware container.  Both the earthenware container and the dish itself are called a terrine.  ''Pâté'' and ''terrine'' are very similar: The term ''pâté'' often suggests a finer-textured [[forcemeat]] using liver, whereas terrines are more often made of a coarser forcemeat.  The meat is chopped or ground, along with heavy seasoning, which may include fat and aromatics.  The seasoning is important, as they will generally be served cold, which mutes the flavors.&lt;ref name="Mcgee2"&gt;McGee, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mixture is placed into a lined mold, covered, and cooked in a water bath to control the temperature, which will keep the forcemeat from separating, as the water bath slows the heating process of the terrine.  ''Pâté'' and ''terrine'' are generally cooked to 160&amp;nbsp;°F (71&amp;nbsp;°C), while terrine made of [[foie gras]] are generally cooked to an internal temperature of 120&amp;nbsp;°F (59&amp;nbsp;°C).  After the proper temperature is reached, the terrine is removed from the oven and placed into a cooling unit topped with a weight to compact the contents of the terrine. It is then allowed to rest for several days to allow the flavors to blend.&lt;ref name="Mcgee2"/&gt;

[[File:Galantina de pato.jpg|thumb|Duck ''galantine'']]
''[[Galantine]]'' is a chilled poultry product created after the [[French Revolution]] by the chef to the [[Marquis de Brancas]].  The term ''galant'' connotes urbane sophistication. Other origins are suggested: the older French word for chicken ''géline'' or ''galine'' or the word [[gelatin]]. Sources suggest the spelling of gelatin transformed into the words ''galentyne'', ''galyntyne'', ''galandyne'', and ''galendine''.

The galantine is prepared by skinning and boning a chicken or other poultry.  The skin is laid flat, with the pounded breast laid on top.  A forcemeat is then placed on top of the pounded breast.  The galantine is then rolled with the ends of the breast meeting one another.  The galantine is then wrapped in [[cheesecloth]] and poached in poultry stock until the proper internal temperature is reached.&lt;ref name="cia2"&gt;The Culinary Institute of America, 317–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Roulade]]'' is similar to a ''galantine''.  The two major differences are instead of rolling the poultry evenly for the ends of the breasts to meet, the bird is rolled into a pinwheel shape, and the roulade is cooled by chilling it after it has been removed from the poaching liquid.&lt;ref name="cia2"/&gt;

==Salt-cured and brined products==
{{main|Curing (food preservation)}}
[[File:Charcuterie &amp; cheese board.jpg|thumb|Homemade charcuterie &amp; [[cheese board]], containing [[salt-cured meat|salt-cured]] and [[brined]] meats]]
Salt serves four main purposes in the preservation of food in the charcuterie kitchen.  The first is inducing [[osmosis]]: This process involves the movement of water outside of the membranes of the cells, which in turn reabsorb the salted water back into the cell. This process assists in the destruction of harmful pathogens. The second is [[dehydration]], which means the salt pulls excess water from the protein, which aids in the [[shelf life]] of the protein, as there is less moisture present for bacterial growth.  [[Fermentation]] is the third, in which salt assists in halting the fermentation process which would otherwise completely break the meat down.  Finally, salt assists in [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] proteins, which in essence means the structure of the proteins is effectively shifted, similar to the effects of [[cooking]].&lt;ref&gt;The Culinary Institute of America, 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the discovery of [[nitrate]]s and [[nitrite]]s by German chemists around 1900, curing was done with unrefined salt and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]].  As saltpeter gives inconsistent results in preventing bacterial growth, nitrate and nitrite (in the forms of [[sodium nitrite]] and [[sodium nitrate]]) have increased in popularity for their consistent results.  Nitrates take a considerably longer period of time to break down in cured foods than nitrites. Because of this, nitrates are the preferred curing salts for lengthy curing and drying periods.  Nitrites are often used in foods that require a shorter curing time and are used for any item that will be fully cooked.&lt;ref&gt;The Culinary Institute of America, 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, a portion of the nitrates will be converted into nitrites&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 173.&lt;/ref&gt; by bacterial action.

Nitrite has multiple purposes in the curing process.  One purpose is flavor, the nitrites giving a sharp, piquant flavor to the meat.  Second, the nitrites react with substances in the meat to produce [[nitric oxide]]. Nitric oxide prevents iron from breaking down the fat in the meat, thus halting rancidity.  The binding also creates the characteristic reddish color found in most cured meat. Finally, the nitrite inhibits the growth of [[botulism]]-causing organisms that would ordinarily thrive in the oxygen-deprived environment in the sausage casing.  German scientists originally named botulism poisoning {{lang|de|Wurst[[wikt:Vergiftung|vergiftung]]}} ("sausage poisoning").  The term ''{{linktext|botulism}}'' derives its name from the Latin term for sausage.&lt;ref name="Mcgee3"&gt;McGee, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eating cured meat products has been linked to a small increase in [[gastric cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

These risks are generally regarded as minimal, and regulations in the United States limit ingoing nitrites to 156 parts per million (0.0156%) (less for bacon) as a precautionary measure.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--outdated &lt;ref name="Mcgee3"/&gt;--&gt;

===[[Curing salt|Curing salt blends]]===
Two main types of curing salt mixture are used by the charcutier.  The first is known by multiple names, including "tinted cure mix", "pink cure", "prague powder", or "insta-cure #1".  The mixture is 93.75% [[sodium chloride]] and 6.25% sodium nitrite.  When used, the recommended amount is a ratio of 4 oz for each 100&amp;nbsp;lb (1&amp;nbsp;kg for each 400&amp;nbsp;kg) of meat or 0.25% of the total weight of the meat.  This blend is colored bright pink to keep the charcutier from confusing the mixture with regular salt.&lt;ref name="cia3"&gt;The Culinary Institute of America, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second curing salt blend is called "prague powder II" or "insta-cure #2".  Also colored pink to differentiate it from table salt, it contains 6.25% [[sodium nitrite]], 4% [[sodium nitrate]], and 89.75% table salt..  This mixture is used for dry sausages that require a longer drying period which requires the presence of nitrate.&lt;ref name="cia3"/&gt;

===Seasoning and flavoring agents===
Sweeteners and other flavoring agents are necessary in the production of many cured products due to the harsh flavors of the  salt.  A number of sweeteners can be used in curing foods, including [[dextrose]], [[sugar]], [[corn syrup]], [[honey]], and [[maple syrup]].  Dextrose is seen often in cured meat, as it not only mellows the harshness, but it also increases the moisture content of the cured product while adding less sweetness to the cured meat.  The sweeteners also assist in stabilizing the colors in meat and help the fermentation process by giving a nutrient to the bacteria.&lt;ref name="cia4"&gt;The Culinary Institute of America, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous [[spice]]s and [[herb]]s are used in the curing process to assist with the flavor of the final product.  The sweet spices regularly used include [[cinnamon]], [[allspice]], [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], and [[cardamom]].  Other flavoring agents may include dried and fresh [[chili pepper|chili]]es, [[wine]], [[fruit juice]], or [[vinegar]].&lt;ref name="cia4"/&gt;

===Fermented sausage===
[[File:Saucisson 04.JPG|right|thumb|275px|[[saucisson]]]]
Fermented sausages are created by salting chopped or ground meat to remove moisture, while allowing beneficial bacteria to break down sugars into flavorful molecules.  Bacteria, including ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' species and ''[[Leuconostoc]]'' species, break down these sugars to produce [[lactic acid]], which not only affects the flavor of the sausage, but also lowers the pH from 6.0 to 4.5–5.0, preventing the growth of bacteria that could spoil the sausage.  These effects are magnified during the drying process, as the salt and acidity are concentrated as moisture is extracted.&lt;!-- if this article says proteins are broken down, then it is incorrect—lactic acid is from the fermentation of sugars&lt;ref name="Mcgee4"/&gt;--&gt;

The ingredients found in a fermented sausage include meat, fat, bacterial culture, salt, spices, sugar and nitrite.  [[Nitrite]] is commonly added to fermented sausages to prevent the formation of [[botulism]]-causing bacteria, while some traditional and artisanal producers avoid nitrites.  Sugar is added to aid the bacterial production of lactic acid during the 18-hour to three-day fermentation process; the fermentation time depends on the temperature at which the sausage is stored: the lower the temperature, the longer the required fermentation period.  A white mold and yeast sometimes adheres to the outside of the sausage during the drying process.  This mold adds to the flavor of the sausage and aids in preventing harmful bacteria from attaching to the sausage.&lt;ref name="Mcgee4"&gt;McGee, 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main types of fermented sausage are the dry, salted, spiced sausages found in warmer climates and fermented semidry sausages found in cooler, more humid climates.   Since the dry sausages of the [[Mediterranean]], in countries such as [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]] contain 25–35% water and more than 4% salt, they may be stored at room temperature.  The sausages of northern Europe usually contain less salt (around 3%) and 40–50% water, and as such do not dry well in the humid climate of countries such as [[Germany]].

[[Hell|Hades]], according to various [[Christian denominations]],  is "the [[Underworld|place or state of departed spirits]]".&lt;ref name ="ODCC"&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}): ''Hades''&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Bible==
===Old Testament===
In the [[Septuagint]] (an ancient translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into [[Greek language|Greek]]), the Greek term ᾅδης (Hades) is used to translate the Hebrew term שאול ([[Sheol]]) in, for example, {{bibleverse||Isaiah|38:18|HE}}.&lt;ref name ="ODCC"/&gt;

===New Testament===
[[File:Georgin François, The 3 Roads to Eternity, 1825 Cornell CUL PJM 1040 01.jpg|thumbnail|This is a folk-art allegorical map based on Matthew 7:13–14 Bible Gateway by the woodcutter Georgin François in 1825.]]
In [[New Testament]] Greek, the Hebrew phrase "לא־תעזב נפשׁי לשׁאול" (you will not abandon my soul to ''Sheol'') in {{bibleverse||Psalm|16:10}} is quoted in {{bibleverse||Acts|2:27}} as "οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψεις τὴν ψυχήν μου εἰς ᾅδου" (you will not abandon my soul to ''Hades'').

In the [[Textus Receptus]] version of the New Testament, on which the English [[King James Version]] is based, the word "ᾅδης" (Hades), appears 11 times;&lt;ref name ="Blueletter"&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G86&amp;t=kjv Blue Letter Bible. "Dictionary and Word Search for hadēs (Strong's 86)"]&lt;/ref&gt; but critical editions of the text of {{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:55}} have "θάνατος" (death) in place of "ᾅδης".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/GNT/Corinth1.html Greek New Testament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108054407/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/GNT/Corinth1.html |date=2008-11-08 }}; cf. [http://www.biblicaltheology.org/hades.pdf The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Vol. II:1314–1315 (1915)]&lt;/ref&gt; Except in this verse of 1 Corinthians, where it uses "grave", the King James Version translates "ᾅδης" as "hell". Modern translations, for which there are only 10 instances of the word "ᾅδης" in the New Testament, generally transliterate it as "Hades". 

In all appearances but one, "ᾅδης" has little if any relation to [[afterlife]] rewards or punishments. The one exception is Luke's parable of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], in which the rich man finds himself, after death, in Hades,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|16:23|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "in anguish in this flame",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|16:25|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in contrast the [[angel]]s take [[Rich man and Lazarus|Lazarus]] to "the [[bosom of Abraham]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|16:22|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as a state of comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|16:25–31|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Death and Hades are repeatedly associated in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|1:18|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|6:8|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Rev|20:13–14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Hades" appears in Jesus' promise to Peter: "And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|16:18|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Rejection of Jesus#Chorazin.2C Bethsaida and Capernaum|warning to Capernaum]]: "And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|10:15|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The word "Hades" in Christian usage in English==
In English usage the word "Hades" first appears around 1600, as a transliteration of the Greek word "ᾅδης" in the line in the [[Apostles' Creed]], "He descended into hell", the place of waiting (the place of "the spirits in prison" {{bibleverse|1|Peter|3:19}}) into which Jesus is there affirmed to have gone after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]. Because this descent, known in Old and Middle English as the [[Harrowing of Hell]], needed to be distinguished from what had come to be more usually called "hell", i.e. the place or state of those finally damned, the word was transliterated and given a differentiated meaning.&lt;ref name="ODCC"/&gt;

This development whereby "hell" came to be used to mean only the "hell of the damned" affected also the Latin word "infernum" and the corresponding words in Latin-derived languages, as in the name "Inferno" given to the first part of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]''. Greek, on the other hand, has kept the original meaning of  "ᾅδης" (Hades) and uses the word "{{lang|grc|κόλασις}}" (''kólasis'' – literally, "punishment"; cf. {{bibleverse||Matthew|25:46}}, which speaks of "everlasting ''kolasis''") to refer to what nowadays is usually meant by "hell" in English.

==Church teachings==
{{main|Intermediate state}}

===The dead as conscious===
Most mainstream Christian denominations and churches believe in some form of conscious existence after the death of the body.

====Eastern Orthodox====
The teaching of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] is that, "after the soul leaves the body, it journeys to the [[Underworld|abode of the dead]] (Hades). There are exceptions, such as the [[Theotokos]], who was [[Assumption of Mary|borne by the angels directly into heaven]]. As for the rest, we must remain in this condition of waiting. Because some have a prevision of the glory to come and others foretaste their suffering, the state of waiting is called "[[Particular Judgment]]". [[Second Coming of Christ|When Christ returns]], the [[Resurrection of the Dead|soul rejoins its risen body]] to be judged by Him in the [[Last judgment]]. The 'good and faithful servant' will inherit [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], the unfaithful with the unbeliever will spend eternity in hell. Their sins and their unbelief will torture them as fire."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Azkoul [http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/reading/ortho_cath.html ''What Are the Differences Between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], hold that a final [[Universal Judgment]] will be pronounced on all human beings when soul and body are reunited in the [[resurrection of the dead]]. They also believe that the fate of those in the abode of the dead differs, even while awaiting resurrection: "The souls of the righteous are in light and rest, with a foretaste of eternal happiness; but the souls of the wicked are in a state the reverse of this."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church], 372&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Catholic====
The [[Latin]] word ''infernus'' or ''infernum'' ([[underworld]]) indicated the abode of the dead and so was used as the equivalent of the Greek word "ᾅδης" (hades). It appears in both the documents quoted above, and pointed more obviously than the Greek word to an existence beneath the earth. Later, the transliteration "hades" of the Greek word ceased to be used in Latin and "infernum" became the normal way of expressing the idea of Hades. Though "infernus" is usually translated into English as "hell", it did not have the narrow sense that the English word has now acquired. It continued to have the generic meaning of "abode of the dead". For the modern narrow sense the term "infernum damnatorum" (hell of the damned) was used, as in question 69, article 7 of the Supplement of the [[Summa Theologica]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]], which distinguishes five states or abodes of the dead: paradise, hell of the damned, [[Limbo#Limbo of Infants|limbo of children]], [[purgatory]], and [[Limbo#Limbo of the Patriarchs|limbo of the Fathers]]: "The soul separated from the body is in the state of receiving good or evil for its merits; so that after death it is either in the state of receiving its final reward, or in the state of being hindered from receiving it. If it is in the state of receiving its final retribution, this happens in two ways: either in the respect of good, and then it is paradise; or in respect of evil, and thus as regards actual sin it is hell, and as regards original sin it is the limbo of children. On the other hand, if it be in the state where it is hindered from receiving its final reward, this is either on account of a defect of the person, and thus we have purgatory where souls are detained from receiving their reward at once on account of the sins they have committed, or else it is on account of a defect of nature, and thus we have the limbo of the Fathers, where the Fathers were detained from obtaining glory on account of the guilt of human nature which could not yet be expiated."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5069.htm Question 69. Matters concerning the resurrection, and first of the place where souls are after death]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anglican====
''The Anglican Catechist'' states that "there is an intermediate state between death and the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection]], in which the soul does not sleep in unconsciousness, but exists in happiness or misery till the resurrection, when it shall be reunited to the body and receive its final reward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holden|first=George |title=The Anglican Catechist: Manual of Instruction Preparatory to Confirmation |year=1855|publisher=Joseph Masters|location=London |pages=40|quote=We are further taught by it that there is an intermediate state between death and the resurrection, in which the soul does not sleep in unconsciousness, but exists in happiness or misery till the resurrection, when it shall be reunited to the body and receive its final reward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Henry Hobart]], an Anglican bishop, writes that "Hades, or the place of the dead, is represented as a spacious ''receptacle'' with gates, through which the dead enter."&lt;ref name="Hobart1825"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobart|first=John Henry|title=The State of the Departed |accessdate=10 April 2014|year=1825|publisher=T. and J.

====Methodist====
In the [[Methodist Church]], "''hades'' denotes the intermediate state of souls between death and the [[general resurrection]]," which is divided into [[Bosom of Abraham|Paradise]] (for the righteous) and [[Gehenna]] (for the wicked).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=The country is called Hades.

====Reformed====
[[John Calvin]] held that the [[intermediate state]] is conscious and that the wicked suffer in hell.

===The dead as unconscious===
{{Main|Christian mortalism}}
Several groups of Christians believe in [[Christian mortalism]] or "[[soul sleep]]" and in [[general judgment]] ("[[Last Judgment]]") only. Denominations that see the dead in the [[intermediate state]] as not having consciousness include early Unitarians,  Christian [[Universalist]]s, [[Christadelphians]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]]&lt;ref&gt;Fundamental Belief # 26 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church states "The wages of sin is death. But God, who alone is immortal, will grant eternal life to His redeemed. Until that day death is an unconscious state for all people. When Christ, who is our life, appears, the resurrected righteous and the living righteous will be glorified and caught up to meet their Lord. The second resurrection, the resurrection of the unrighteous, will take place a thousand years later. (Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11–14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51–54; 1 Thess. 4:13–17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1–10.)" &gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html Fundamental Belief # 26 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;"The dead are conscious of nothing." [http://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/when-you-die/ Bible Teachings-What Happens When You Die?, Official Website of Jehovah's Witnesses]&lt;/ref&gt; These groups also believe that Christ too was dead, unconscious and "asleep" during his time in the grave.

The views of Lutherans and Anglicans vary. [[Martin Luther]] himself appears inconsistent in his views though generally maintained that souls remained asleep until the resurrection whereupon hell awaited the condemned.
&lt;ref&gt;(LW 19:74&lt;/ref&gt; "I am not so sure what hell is like before the Day of Judgment. The notion that hell is a specific place, now tenanted by the souls of the damned, as artists portray it and the belly servers preach it, I consider of no value... However, on the Last Day this will assume a different aspect. Then hell will be a particular place and the abode of those consigned to it and the eternal wrath of God. But let this suffice. It is not very important whether or not one pictures hell as it is commonly portrayed and described. The fact remains that hell is far worse now—and will be even worse than it is now—than anyone is able to say, depict, or imagine."

The [[Church of England]] has a variety of views on the [[intermediate state|death state]]. Some, such as [[N. T. Wright]] have proposed a view of the grave which considers Hades to be a place where the dead sleep, and [[E. W. Bullinger]] argued for the cessation of the soul between death and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleunderstanding.com/richmanandlazarus_contents.htm E.W. Bullinger on Luke 16:19–31]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians believe in the soul's ''mortality'' ("[[Christian mortalism]]" or "[[soul sleep]]") and [[general judgment]] ("[[Last Judgment]]") only. This view is held by some [[Anglicans]] such as [[E. W. Bullinger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleunderstanding.com/richmanandlazarus_contents.htm E.W. Bullinger on Luke 16:19–31]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the mortality of the soul, and general judgment, for example Advent Christians, Conditionalists, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christadelphians]], and Christian [[Universalist]]s, argue that the story of the rich man and Lazarus is a parable using the framework of Jewish views of the [[Bosom of Abraham]], and is [[metaphor]]ical, and is not definitive teaching on the intermediate state for several reasons. After being emptied of the dead, Hades and death are thrown into the [[lake of fire]] in {{bibleref2|Revelation|20:13–14|NIV}}.

==Views of some early third-century writers==
[[Tertullian]] (c. 160 – c. 225), making an exception only for the [[martyr]]s, argued that the souls of the dead go down beneath the earth, and will go up to the sky ([[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]) only at the [[End time|end of the world]]: "You must suppose Hades to be a subterranean region, and keep at arm's length those who are too proud to believe that the souls of the faithful deserve a place in the lower regions … How, indeed, shall the soul mount up to heaven, where Christ is already sitting at the Father's right hand, when as yet the archangel's trumpet has not been heard by the command of God, when as yet those whom the coming of the Lord is to find on the earth, have not been caught up into the air to meet Him at His coming, in company with the dead in Christ, who shall be the first to arise? … The sole key to unlock Paradise is your own life's blood.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0310.htm A Treatise on the Soul], chapter 55&lt;/ref&gt;

The variously titled fragment [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0520.htm "Against Plato" or "De Universo"], attributed to [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (c. 170 – c. 236), has the following: "And this is the passage regarding demons.  But now we must speak of Hades, in which the souls both of the righteous and the unrighteous are detained. Hades is a place in the created system, rude, a locality beneath the earth, in which the light of the world does not shine; and as the sun does not shine in this locality, there must necessarily be perpetual darkness there. This locality has been destined to be as it were a guard-house for souls, at which the angels are stationed as guards, distributing according to each one's deeds the temporary punishments for characters. And in this locality there is a certain place set apart by itself, a lake of unquenchable fire, into which we suppose no one has ever yet been cast; for it is prepared against the day determined by God, in which one sentence of righteous judgment shall be justly applied to all. And the unrighteous, and those who believed not God, who have honoured as God the vain works of the hands of men, idols fashioned, shall be sentenced to this endless punishment. But the righteous shall obtain the incorruptible and un-fading kingdom, who indeed are at present detained in Hades, but not in the same place with the unrighteous."

In his study, "Hades of Hippolytus or Tartarus of Tertullian? The Authorship of the Fragment ''De Universo''", C. E. Hill argues that the depiction of the [[intermediate state]] of the righteous expounded in this text is radically opposed to that found in the authentic works of Hippolytus and must have been written by Tertullian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1584133 ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Vol. 43, No. 2 (Jun., 1989), pp. 105–26]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claude William Wilson''' (9 September 1858 – 29 June 1881) was an English [[Amateur sports#Football (soccer)|amateur]] [[association football|footballer]] who played in the [[1880 FA Cup Final]] for [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] and made two appearances for [[England national football team|England]].

==Career==

===Education===
Wilson was born in [[Banbury]], Oxfordshire and educated at [[Brighton College]], where he played for the college football team in 1876 and 1877, being captain in the latter year.&lt;ref name = "Betts"&gt;{{cite book | author=Graham Betts| title=England: Player by player | publisher=Green Umbrella Publishing | year=2006|page= 261| isbn=1-905009-63-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went up to [[Exeter College, Oxford]] where he won [[Blue (university sport)#University of Oxford|blue]]s for football in 1879, 1880 and 1881.

===Football career===

Wilson was called into the [[England national football team|England]] team for their first ever meeting with [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. The match was played at the [[Kennington Oval]] on 18 January 1879 in a blizzard. Due to the atrocious snowfall both captains agreed to play halves of only 30 minutes each. The poor attendance (reports range from 85 to 300) was also attributed to the weather. Some sources suggest that [[William Clegg]] turned up 20 minutes late for the game. Clegg, a solicitor, was working late on a case (the trial of [[Charles Peace]], the Banner Cross murderer) and was unable to leave [[Sheffield]] for London on the Friday night. The next morning, the southbound train with Clegg on it, was delayed by heavy snow. The match started without Clegg and England played with ten men until he arrived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1878-79/M0008Wal1879.html England 2 Wales 1; 18 January 1879 Match Summary and Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, England won the match by two goals to one, with [[Herbert Whitfeld]] and [[Thomas Sorby]] scoring for England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englandstats.com/matchreport.php?mid=8 England 2 – Wales 1; 18 January 1879 (Match summary)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1879-80 in English football|1880]], he was part of the [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] team that reached the [[1880 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]], where they met the previous year's losing finalists, [[Clapham Rovers F.C.|Clapham Rovers]]. This was the university's fourth appearance in the Cup Final since the Cup was inaugurated in 1872, and, having "conquered much-fancied Nottingham Forest in the semi-final" were favourites to take the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1880.html Report on 1880 FA Cup final] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311075013/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1880.html |date=11 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the Rovers defence were able to keep the university forwards at bay, and with Wilson and his fellow [[Defender (association football)#Full back|full-back]] [[Robert Stuart King|Robert King]] tiring towards the end of the second half, and the prospect of extra time imminent, [[Francis Sparks]] "made a clever run down the wing, crossed to the waiting [[Clopton Lloyd-Jones]] who had the simple task of slotting the ball between the Oxford goalposts to secure a one-goal lead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Philip Gibbons|title= Association Football in Victorian England – A History of the Game from 1863 to 1900|year= 2001|publisher= Upfront Publishing|page=58|isbn=1-84426-035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last appearance in an FA Cup Final for both teams.

His second England call-up came for the match against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] on 12 March 1881, in which England went down to a "humiliating"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Gibbons|title= Association Football in Victorian England |year= |publisher= |page=61|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6–1 defeat, with Scotland's goals including a [[hat-trick]] from [[John Smith (footballer born 1855)|John Smith]] and two from [[George Ker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englandstats.com/matchreport.php?mid=13 England 1 – Scotland 6;  12 March 1881 (Match summary)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson also played for the [[List of Old Brightonians|Old Brightonians]] and represented [[Sussex]]. He was described by [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]] in his 1882 ''"Football Annual"'' as "a splendid back; strong kick; very fast and active; his unexpected demise, in June, was deeply regretted by all who knew him".

===Cricket career===
Wilson also played cricket at [[First-class cricket|first-class]] level. He played in one match for the [[Oxford University Cricket Club|University]] against the Gentlemen of England in June 1881, when he scored 51 in the university's second innings in a drawn match.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2452.html Oxford University v Gentlemen of England; June 1881 (Scorecard)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after this match, he played for [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]]. In this match, in which he was the [[wicketkeeper]], he was dismissed [[Leg before wicket|LBW]] to [[W. G. Grace]], who led his team to a victory by 8 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2458.html Surrey v Gloucestershire; June 1881 (Match scorecard)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In June 1881, he caught [[sunstroke]] during a cricket match and subsequently died at [[Betchworth]], Surrey on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Deaths | newspaper = The Times |issue = 30237 | page = 1 | location = London | date = 4 July 1881  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Club of Budapest''' is an international organization founded in 1993 by [[Ervin László]] to expand beyond the exclusively scientific purpose of The [[General Evolution Research Group]] to try to mobilize the full cultural resources of humanity to meet the future challenges.

The Club of Budapest is an informal association of creative people in art, literature, and culture.

It has branches in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hawaii, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, [[the Netherlands]], Samoa, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States and Venezuela. Its first global ambassador was Fiona [[Douglas-Scott-Montagu]], baroness Montagu of Beaulieu.

The philosophy of the club is based on the realization that the challenges that humanity is facing can only be overcome through the development of a global cultural consciousness. Like [[Greenpeace]] fights for ecological issues, [[UNICEF]] for children in need, and [[Amnesty International]] for human rights, the Club of Budapest stands for global consciousness.

A '''cognitive module''' is, in theories of the [[modularity of mind]] and the closely related [[society of mind theory]], a specialised tool or sub-unit that can be used by other parts to resolve [[cognitive]] tasks. The question of their existence and nature is a major topic in [[cognitive science]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Some see cognitive modules as an independent part of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Coltheart]]: [http://www.biols.susx.ac.uk/ugteach/cws/iin/Readings/coltheart.pdf ''Modularity and cognition''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040829145655/http://www.biols.susx.ac.uk/ugteach/cws/iin/Readings/coltheart.pdf |date=2004-08-29 }} - Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Others also see new thought patterns achieved by experience as cognitive modules.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tooby|Tooby, John]] and [[Leda Cosmides|Cosmides, Leda]] 1992 ''The Psychological Foundations of Culture'', in Barkow, Jerome H., Cosmides, Leda, Tooby, John, (1992) ''[[The Adapted Mind]]: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture,'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-506023-7}}, page 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories similar to the ''cognitive module'' are ''cognitive description'',&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tooby|Tooby, John]] and [[Leda Cosmides|Cosmides, Leda]] 1992 ''The Psychological Foundations of Culture'', in Barkow, Jerome H., Cosmides, Leda, Tooby, John, (1992) ''[[The Adapted Mind]]: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture,'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-506023-7}}, page 64.&lt;/ref&gt; ''cognitive pattern''&lt;ref&gt;Doreen Kimura, Elizabeth Hampson (1994) ''Cognitive Pattern in Men and Women Is Influenced by Fluctuations in Sex Hormones.'' Current Directions in Psychological Science 3 (2), 57–61. {{doi|10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''psychological mechanism''. Such a mechanism, if created by evolution, is known as ''[[evolved psychological mechanism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Buss: ''Evolutionary Psychology - The New Science of the Mind''] - 2nd edition, Pearson Education 2004, pages 50ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological disorders – cognitive modules run amok==
Many common psychological and [[personality disorder]]s are caused by cognitive modules running amok.

'''[[Jealousy]]:''' A common cause of unnecessary conflict in relations is that a [[man]] is jealous of a [[woman]]'s  [[serial polygamy|previous sexual partners]] before she met him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web4health.info/en/answers/life-jealousy-past-relations.htm ''Problem with Jealousy of Past Relations''] By Gunborg Palme 2006&lt;/ref&gt; All people are born with a basic jealousy cognitive module, developed through as [[evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionary strategy]] in order to [[sexual selection|safeguard a mate]] and trigger [[aggression]] towards competitors to ensure [[paternity (law)|paternity]] and prevent [[Offspring|bastards]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?q=Olivia+Judson&amp;btnG=Search+Books Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation: The Definitive Guide to the Evolutionary Biology of Sex] Olivia Judson, Dr. Publisher: Vintage; New Ed (2003), 320p. {{ISBN|0-09-928375-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this module is activated to too strong a degree, it becomes a personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Buss: ''The evolution of desire''] - 2nd edition, Basic Books 2003, pages 125ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margo Wilson and Martin Daly: ''The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Chattel'', in Jerome H. Barkow et al., The Adapted Mind, Oxford University Press, 1992, page 302-305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David M. Buss: ''The evolution of desire''] - 2nd edition, Basic Books 2003, pages 129ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Stalking]]:''' An extreme psychological disorder related to jealousy is stalking.&lt;ref&gt;J. Reid Meloy ''The Psychology of Stalking - Clinical and Forensic Perspectives'', by J. Reid Meloy (ed.), Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A stalker is a person (usually a man) who behaves as if he had a relation to another person (usually a woman) who is not interested in him. There are also women who stalk men, men who stalk men and women who stalk women, but most common is a man stalking a woman. In modern [[western culture]] this behaviour is strongly frowned upon.

'''[[Paranoia]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-IV'', American Psychiatric Association 1994 page 287&lt;/ref&gt; Being suspicious of fellow human beings [[trait theory|is a trait]] to safeguard against perceived, secret [[game theory|plots against us]], a basic human cognitive module useful for [[natural selection|survival]]. But in some people, this turns into unreasonable suspiciousness where there is in reality no plotting against one. Such [[behaviour]] is by psychiatrists labeled as ''[[paranoid schizophrenia]]'' or in milder forms as ''[[paranoid personality disorder]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-IV'', American Psychiatric Association 1994 pages 634ff&lt;/ref&gt; These disorders thus occur when the suspiciousness cognitive module is triggered too often and too strongly for triggers that would not trigger this module in normal people.&lt;ref&gt;Erlene Rosowsky, Robert C. Abrams, Richard A. Zweig: Personality Disorders in Older Adults: Emerging Issues in Diagnosis and Treatment; Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1999. p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]]:''' In this quite common disorder, a person will repeatedly check, for example, that a door is locked. One may repeatedly wash hands or other body parts, sometimes for hours, to ensure cleanliness.&lt;!--relation to phobias?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-IV'', American Psychiatric Association 1994 pages 417ff&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this disorder is a malfunction of a normal [[adaptation]] in all humans to check that a door is locked, to wash to keep us [[hygiene|clean]], etc.

'''[[Transference]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Stephen P. (2006) ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/freud.htm Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)]''&lt;/ref&gt; A cognitive module developed to solve a particular problem can sometimes crop up in other situations where it is not appropriate. One may be angry at one's boss, but take the anger out on one's fellow man. Often, the transference is [[consciousness|unconscious]] (see also [[Subconscious mind]] and [[Unconscious mind]]). In [[psychotherapy]], the [[patient]] is made aware of this, which makes it easier to modify the unsuitable behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbard GO, Horwitz L, Allen JG, Frieswyk S, Newsom G, Colson DB, Coyne L.: "Transference interpretation in the psychotherapy of borderline patients: a high-risk, high-gain phenomenon", Harv Rev Psychiatry. 1994 Jul-Aug;2(2):59-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/freud.htm Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)]'' Thornton, Stephen P. (2006)''&lt;/ref&gt; said that cognitive modules for some activities, such as [[sex]], may incorrectly show up in disguise in cases where they are not suitable. Freud also [[Sigmund Freud#The Unconscious|introduced the idea of the unconscious]], which interpreted as cognitive modules where a person is not aware of the initial cause of these modules and may use them inappropriately.

'''[[Schizophrenia]]:''' is a psychotic disorder where cognitive modules are triggered too often, overwhelming the brain with information.&lt;ref&gt;D. Weinberger, ''Prefrontal neurons and the genetics of schizophrenia'' Biological Psychiatry, Volume 50, Issue 11, Pages 825-844.&lt;/ref&gt; The inability to repress [[information processing|overwhelming information]] is a cause of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph M. Nesse and Alan T. Lloyd, ''The Evolution of Psychodynamic Mechanisms'', in Jerome H. Barkow et al., The Adapted Mind, Oxford University Press, 1992, page 608.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of cognitive module psychological disorders===
[[Cognitive therapy]] is a [[psychotherapeutic]] method that helps people better understand the cognitive modules that cause them to do certain things, and to teach them alternative, more appropriate cognitive modules to use instead in the future.

===Psychoanalytic view of cognitive modules===
According to [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theory]], many cognitive modules are unconscious and [[psychological repression|repressed]], to avoid mental conflicts. ''Defenses'' are meant to be cognitive modules used to suppress the awareness of other cognitive modules. Unconscious cognitive modules may influence our behaviour without our being aware of it.

==Evolutionary psychology view==
In the research field of [[evolutionary psychology]] it is believed that some cognitive modules are inherited and some are created by learning, but the creation of new modules by learning is often guided by inherited modules.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Buss: ''Evolutionary Psychology - The New Science of the Mind''] - 2nd edition, Pearson Education 2004, pages 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the ability to drive a car or throw a basketball are certainly learned and not inherited modules, but they may make use of inherited modules to rapidly compute trajectories.

There is some disagreement between different social scientists on the importance to the capabilities of the human mind of inherited modules. Evolutionary psychologists claim that other social scientists do not accept that some modules are partially inherited,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tooby|Tooby, John]] and [[Leda Cosmides|Cosmides, Leda]] 1992 ''The Psychological Foundations of Culture'', in ''[[The Adapted Mind]]: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture,'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-506023-7}} page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; other social scientists claim that evolutionary psychologists are exaggerating the importance of inherited cognitive modules.

==Memory and creative thought==
A very important aspect of how humans think is the ability, when encountering a situation or problem, to find more or less similar, but not identical, experiences or cognitive modules. This can be compared to what happens if you sound a tone near a piano. The piano string corresponding to this particular tone will then vibrate. But also other strings, from nearby strings, will vibrate to a lesser extent.

Exactly how the human mind does this is not known, but it is believed that when you encounter a situation or problem, many different cognitive modules are activated at the same time, and the mind selects those most useful for understanding a new situation or solving a new problem.&lt;ref&gt;Liane Gabora: [http://cogprints.org/2105/0/inklings.htm ''Toward a theory of creative inklings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015121252/http://cogprints.org/2105/0/inklings.htm |date=2007-10-15 }} In (R. Ascott, ed.) ''Art, Technology, and Consciousness,'' Intellect Press, p. 159-164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Vital lies, simple truths, Simon &amp; Schuster 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and law==
Most law-abiding people have cognitive modules that stop them from committing crimes. Criminals have different modules, causing criminal behaviour. Thus, cognitive modules can be a cause of both ethical and unethical behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Abrahamsen]]: The Psychology of Crime; Columbia University Press, 1960. p. 158ff&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incubation''' refers to the process by which certain [[Oviparity|oviparous]] (egg-laying) animals hatch their [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]; it also refers to the development of the [[embryo]] within the egg. Multiple and various factors are vital to the incubation of various species of animal. In many species of reptile for example, no fixed temperature is necessary, but the actual temperature determines the sex ratio of the offspring. In birds in contrast, the sex of offspring is genetically determined, but in many species a constant and particular [[temperature]] is necessary for successful incubation. Especially in [[poultry]], the act of sitting on eggs to incubate them is called brooding.&lt;ref name="ekarius"/&gt; The action or behavioral tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs is also called [[broodiness]], and most [[Egg (biology)|egg]]-laying breeds of [[poultry]] have had this behavior [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] out of them to increase production.&lt;ref name="ekarius"&gt;{{cite book |title=Storey's Illustrated Guide to Poultry Breeds |last=Ekarius |first=Carol |year=2007 |publisher=Storey Publishing |location=210 MAS MoCA Way, North Adams MA 01247  |isbn=978-1-58017-667-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avian incubation==
A wide range of incubation habits is displayed among birds. In [[warm-blooded]] species such as [[bird]] species generally, body heat from the brooding parent provides the constant temperature, though several groups, notably the [[megapode]]s, instead use heat generated from rotting vegetable material, effectively creating a giant compost heap while [[crab plover]]s make partial use of heat from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;De Marchi, G., Chiozzi, G., Fasola, M. 2008 Solar incubation cuts down parental care in a burrow nesting tropical shorebird, the crab plover Dromas ardeola. Journal of Avian Biology 39 (5):484–486&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Namaqua sandgrouse]] of the deserts of southern [[Africa]], needing to keep its eggs cool during the heat of the day, stands over them drooping its wings to shade them. The humidity is also critical, because if the air is too dry the egg will lose too much water to the atmosphere, which can make hatching difficult or impossible. As incubation proceeds, an egg will normally become lighter, and the air space within the egg will normally become larger, owing to evaporation from the egg.

In the species that incubate, the work is divided differently between the sexes. Possibly the most common pattern is that the female does all the incubation, as in the [[Atlantic canary]] and the [[Indian robin]], or most of it, as is typical of [[falcon]]s. In some species, such as the [[whooping crane]], the male and the female take turns incubating the egg. In others, such as the [[Cassowary|cassowaries]], only the male incubates. The male [[mountain plover]] incubates the female's first clutch, but if she lays a second, she incubates it herself. In [[hoatzin]]s, some birds (mostly males) help their parents incubate later broods.

The incubation period, the time from the start of uninterrupted incubation to the emergence of the young, varies from 11 days (some small [[passerine]]s and the [[Black-billed Cuckoo|black-billed]] and [[yellow-billed cuckoo]]s) to 85 days (the [[wandering albatross]] and the [[brown kiwi]]). In these latter, the incubation is interrupted; the longest uninterrupted period is 64 to 67 days in the [[emperor penguin]]. In general smaller birds tend to hatch faster, but there are exceptions, and cavity nesting birds tend to have longer incubation periods. It can be an energetically demanding process, with adult albatrosses losing as much as 83 g of body weight a day.&lt;ref&gt;Warham, J. (1990) ''The Petrels - Their Ecology and Breeding Systems'' London:Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Megapode eggs take from 49 to 90 days depending on the mound and ambient temperature. Even in other birds, ambient temperatures can lead to variation in incubation period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ornithology in Laboratory and field|edition=4| pages= 357–360| author=Pettingill, OS Jr|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally the egg is incubated outside the body. However, in one recorded case, the egg incubation occurred entirely within a chicken. The chick hatched inside and emerged from its mother without the shell, leading to internal wounds that killed the mother hen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embryo development remains suspended until the onset of incubation. The freshly laid eggs of domestic fowl, ostrich, and several other species can be stored for about two weeks when maintained under 5 C. Extended periods of suspension have been observed in some marine birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Divoky, G.J. |author2=Harter, B.B. |year=2010 |title=Supernormal delay in hatching, embryo cold tolerance, and egg-fostering in the Black Guillemot ''Cepphus grylle'' |journal=Marine Ornithology |volume=38 |pages=7–10 |url=http://www.cooperisland.org/Files/Divoky%20and%20Harter%202010.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321182531/http://www.cooperisland.org/Files/Divoky%20and%20Harter%202010.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species begin incubation with the first egg, causing the young to hatch at different times; others begin after laying the second egg, so that the third chick will be smaller and more vulnerable to food shortages. Some start to incubate after the last egg of the clutch, causing the young to hatch simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Anim.

==Mammalian incubation==
Very few [[mammal]]s lay eggs. In perhaps the best known example, the [[platypus]], the eggs develop ''[[in utero]]'' for about 28 days, with only about 10 days of external incubation (in contrast to a chicken egg, which spends about one day in tract and 21 days externally).&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology.iastate.edu/InternationalTrips/1Australia/04papers/CromerMonotrRepro.htm|title=Monotreme Reproductive Biology and Behavior|publisher=Iowa State University|author=Erica Cromer|date=2004-04-14|accessdate=2009-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313030236/http://www.biology.iastate.edu/InternationalTrips/1Australia/04papers/CromerMonotrRepro.htm|archivedate=2009-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After laying her eggs, the female curls around them. The incubation period is divided into three phases. In the first phase, the [[embryo]] has no functional organs and relies on the [[yolk sac]] for sustenance. The yolk is absorbed by the developing young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ockhams Razor |work=The Puzzling Platypus |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s332655.htm |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404151303/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s332655.htm |archivedate=April 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the second phase, the digits develop. In the last phase, the [[egg tooth]] appears.&lt;ref name="RS2"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences|title =The development of the external features of the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus)|author1=Paul R. Manger |author2=Leslie S. Hall |author3=John D. Pettigrew |volume=353|issue=1372|pages=1115–1125|date=1998-07-29|pmid=9720109|publisher=The Royal Society|pmc=1692310|doi =10.1098/rstb.1998.0270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other egg-laying mammal is the [[echidna]]. New science research has been found that eggshells have a nanostructure that has inner and outer layers. The structure of this shell contains a protein known as osteopontin which is also found in tooth and bone. What reachers found was that the inner layers of the shell were thinner than the outer shells. This is because in the process of the egg being incubated the chicken embryos are taking the protein from the shell making the chicks skeleton stronger. 

==Reptilian incubation==
Methods of incubation vary widely among the many different kinds of reptiles.

Various species of [[sea turtle]]s bury their eggs on beaches under a layer of sand that provides both protection from predators and a constant temperature for the nest.

[[Snake]]s may lay eggs in communal burrows, where a large number of adults combine to keep the eggs warm.

[[Alligator]]s and [[crocodile]]s either lay their eggs in mounds of decomposing vegetation or lay them in holes they dig in the ground.

==Incubation by other vertebrates==
Fish generally do not incubate their eggs. However, some species [[mouthbrood]] their eggs, not eating until they hatch.

Some amphibians brood their eggs. The female salamander ''[[Ensatina]]'' (''Ensatina eschscholtzii'') curls around the clutch of eggs and massages individual eggs with her pulsating throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=Robert C. Stebbins|last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03281-8 |page=196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some aquatic frogs such as the Surinam toad (''[[Pipa pipa]]'') have pouches in their skin into which the eggs are inserted. Other neotropical frogs in the family [[Hemiphractidae]] also have pouches in which the eggs develop, in some species directly into juvenile frogs and in others into tadpoles that are later deposited in small water bodies to continue their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=Robert C. Stebbins|last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03281-8 |page=200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The male [[Darwin's frog]] carries the eggs around in his mouth until [[metamorphosis]], and the female stomach-brooding frog of Australia swallows the eggs, which develop in her stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C.|authorlink1=Robert C. Stebbins |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03281-8 |pages=202–204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incubation by invertebrates==
Brooding occurs in some invertebrates when the fertilised eggs are retained inside or on the surface of the parent, usually the mother. This happens in some [[cnidaria]]ns ([[sea anemone]]s and [[coral]]s), a few [[chiton]]s, some [[Gastropoda|gastropod molluscs]], some [[cephalopod]]s, some [[Bivalvia|bivalve molluscs]], many [[arthropod]]s, some [[entoprocta]]ns, some [[brachiopod]]s, some [[bryozoa]]ns, and some [[starfish]].&lt;ref name=Ruppert&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=62, 123, 297, 337, 364, 398, 811, 828, 887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chimpanzee_Enos_before_the_flight_of_Mercury-Atlas_5.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Enos being prepared for insertion into the [[Mercury-Atlas 5]] capsule in 1961.]] 
'''Enos''' (d. November 4, 1962) was the second [[chimpanzee]] launched into space by [[NASA]]. He was the first [[chimpanzee]], and third [[hominid]] after [[cosmonaut]]s [[Yuri Gagarin]] and [[Gherman Titov]], to achieve Earth orbit. Enos' flight occurred on November 29, 1961.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Enos was brought from the Miami Rare Bird Farm on April 3, 1960. He completed more than 1,250 training hours at the [[University of Kentucky]] and Holloman [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] Base. Training was more intense for him than for his predecessor [[Ham the Chimp|Ham]], because Enos was exposed to [[weightlessness]] and higher [[g-force|''g'']]s for longer periods of time. His training included psychomotor instruction and aircraft flights.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Enos was selected for flight only three days before launch. Two months prior, [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] launched [[Mercury Atlas 4]] on September 13, 1961, to conduct an identical mission with a "crewman simulator" on board. Enos flew into space aboard [[Mercury Atlas 5]] on November 29, 1961. He completed his first orbit in 1 hour and 28.5 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Animals In Space: From Research Rockets to the Space Shuttle, Chris Dubbs and [[Colin Burgess (author)|Colin Burgess]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Enos was scheduled to complete three orbits, but the mission was aborted after two due to two issues: capsule overheating and a malfunctioning "avoidance conditioning" test subjecting the primate to 76 electrical shocks.  The capsule was brought aboard the [[USS Stormes|USS ''Stormes'']] (DD-780) in the late afternoon and Enos was immediately taken below deck by his Air Force handlers. The ''Stormes'' arrived in Bermuda the next day.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Enos's flight was a full dress rehearsal for the next Mercury launch on February 20, 1962, which would make [[John Glenn]] the first American to orbit Earth, after astronauts [[Alan Shepard, Jr.]] and [[Gus Grissom]]'s successful suborbital space flights. On November 4, 1962, Enos died of [[shigellosis]]-related [[dysentery]], which was resistant to then-known antibiotics. He was constantly observed for two months before his death. Pathologists reported no symptoms that could be attributed or related to his previous space flight.  Many believe Enos's remains were dissected like [[Ham the Chimp|Ham]], who was extensively studied postmortem at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.  Some of Ham's remains, minus the skeleton (which remained with AIP), were buried at the [[International Space Hall of Fame]] in New Mexico.  Recent attempts by space scholars to locate Enos's remains were unsuccessful. Post-mortem study was undertaken. His remains were then packed and sent to the Smithsonian Institute according to Dr. James E. Cook Veterinary Pathologist who was involved in Enos' autopsy and was also the Head of the Chimp Consortium at Holloman AFB at the time of Enos' death.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

'''''Inkerman''''' and '''''Cerisoles''''' were two French [[minesweeper]]s named after major battles fought during the [[Crimean War]] and Italian war, and which vanished on their maiden voyage in a storm on [[Lake Superior]] in 24 November 1918.&lt;ref name=DuluthNewsTribune2017-08-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronicleJournal2016-10-16/&gt; No trace of the two vessels have ever been found. 76 French sailors and two Canadian captains disappeared along with the minesweepers. ''Inkerman'' and ''Cerisoles'' are the last warships to disappear on the [[Great Lakes]], and their sinkings caused the largest loss of life of any Lake Superior shipwreck.

== Vessel specifications ==
''Inkerman'' and ''Cerisoles'' were {{sclass-|Navarin|minesweeper|1}}s, designed to clear [[naval mine]]s in the [[English Channel]]. Built at the [[Canada Car and Foundry]] Company in what was then known as [[Fort William, Ontario]], the vessels were {{convert|140|ft|m}} long, and displaced 630 tons.&lt;ref name=DuluthNewsTribune2017-08-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronicleJournal2016-10-16/&gt; Their steel-framed wooden hulls were divided into four water-tight compartments. Each ship was fitted with twin screws and a single funnel, and had a top speed of about {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}}. Two {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} [[deck guns]], with a range of about {{convert|20|km|yd}}, were located forward and aft. It was rumored that because of the end of [[World War I]], construction funds were cut short and wooden plugs took the place of metal rivets in the minesweepers, which could have led to their demise. A [[sister ship]] called ''Sebastopol'' was built alongside ''Inkerman'' and ''Cerisoles'', and almost sank during its maiden voyage.

French naval documents refer to the ships as "chalutiers" not "drageurs de mines." This is because the ships were designed to function as [[fishing trawler]]s after the war.

==Maiden voyage and loss==
[[File:Canadian Car &amp; Foundry, in Port William, Ontario, built minesweepers for France, in WW1 -a.jpg|thumb|''Inkerman'', ''Cerisoles'', and ten sister ships were completed in less than eight months.&lt;ref name=DuluthNewsTribune2017-08-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronicleJournal2016-10-16/&gt;]]
In the middle of November 1918, the three minesweepers ''Inkerman'', ''Cerisoles'', and ''Sebastopol'' left the harbour of Fort William, Ontario, on the northern shore of Lake Superior, headed for the Atlantic Ocean via the Great Lakes and the [[St. Lawrence River]].&lt;ref name=DuluthNewsTribune2017-08-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronicleJournal2016-10-16/&gt; 76 French sailors made up the crews of ''Inkerman'' and ''Cerisoles'', with the addition of two veteran Canadian captains, Capt. R. Wilson and W.J. Murphy. As the ships steamed further into Lake Superior, they encountered a blizzard with recorded winds of {{convert|50|mph}} and waves {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} high. All three ships soon lost sight of each other through the snow and waves. The storm was so bad that a sailor aboard ''Sebastopol'' said "We had to get out the life boats and put on lifebelts ... the boat almost sank – and it was nearly 'goodbye' to anyone hearing from us again ... You can believe me, I will always remember that day. I can tell you that I had already given myself up to God." Water poured into ''Sebastopol'', flooding part of her engine room and nearly putting out the coal fires in her [[boiler]]s. The storm pounded ''Sebastopol'' for two days but the vessel managed to reach [[Sault Ste. Marie (disambiguation)|Sault Ste. Marie]], at the eastern end of Lake Superior. What soon became apparent was that ''Inkerman'' and ''Cerisoles'' were nowhere to be found. As days passed, rumours spread that the warships sailed through the locks unnoticed all the way to the St. Lawrence River, but it was assumed the ships were lost. On 3 December 1918, ten days after the three ships left Fort William, a search effort was launched, but because of wartime censorship it was small and the public was left out of the search. The public knew nothing of the loss of ''Inkerman'' and ''Cerisoles'' until wartime censorship in Canada ended in 1918. No wreckage of ''Inkerman'' or ''Cerisoles'' was ever found, and their exact whereabouts and fate remain unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2737">'''Gua''' was a [[chimpanzee]] raised as though she were a human child by scientists Luella and [[Winthrop Kellogg]] alongside their infant son Donald. Gua was the first chimpanzee to be used in a cross-rearing study in the US.

Gua was born on November 15, 1930 in [[Havana, Cuba]]. She was given, along with her mother, Pati, and her father, Jack, to the old [[Orange Park, Florida]] site of the [[Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center]] by Pierre Abreu on May 13, 1931 after the death of his mother, Madame Rosalia Abreu.

Gua was brought into the Kellogg home at the age of 7 1/2 months, and reared with their son Donald, who was 10 months old at the time. For nine months the Kelloggs raised the two as "brother and sister", and comprehensively recorded the development of the chimpanzee and the human child. When around one year old, Gua often tested ahead of Donald in such tasks as responding to simple commands or using a cup and spoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Little 'Chimp' Proves Smarter Than Human Baby After 1 Year|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V8stAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bpkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1629,4022683&amp;dq=gua+chimpanzee&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=July 27, 1954|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slight differences in their placement included people recognition. Gua recognized people from their clothes and their smell while Donald recognized them by their faces.

The parting difference came with language. Donald was about 16 months and Gua was a little over a year old when they had language testing. Gua could not speak, but Donald could form words. On March 28, 1932, nine months into it, the Kelloggs officially ended the experiment as Donald began to copy Gua's sounds. Gua was returned to the primate center with [[Robert Yerkes]] in Florida, where she did experimental work with Yerkes' wife Ada. The Kelloggs returned to Indiana.

Gua died of pneumonia on December 21, 1933, less than a year after her human "stepbrother" Donald Agger Kellogg and she were separated. She had just turned 3.

Many videos posted on [[YouTube]] coming from the archives of [[Emory University]], [[Wesleyan University]], [[Kellogg University]] and other institutions continue to memorialize Gua, her short life, and her contribution to psychology.

'''HMS ''Chub''''' (or ''Chubb'') was a British [[Royal Navy]] [[Ballahoo class schooner|''Ballahoo''-class schooner]] of four 12-pounder [[carronade]]s and a crew of 20. The prime contractor for the vessel was Goodrich &amp; Co., in [[Bermuda]], and she was launched in 1807.&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), p.359.&lt;/ref&gt; She and her crew were lost when she was wrecked in August 1812.

==Service==
''Chub'' was commissioned in March 1807 under Lieutenant Wentworth Parsons Croke. ''Chub'' may have assisted at the [[Invasion of Martinique (1809)|invasion of Martinique]] between January and February 1809.&lt;ref&gt;O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; If so, she does not appear among the vessels whose crews qualified for the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]] when the Admiralty awarded it in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20939|page=242|date=26 January 1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant William Innes replaced Croke in June 1809 (who went on to command the schooner {{HMS|Shamrock|1808|2}}), and was in turn replaced by Lieutenant Samuel Nisbett in 1812.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

On 5 March 1812 ''Chub'' left Bermuda to search for ''Mary'', Wilson, master, which had been sailing from Tobago to London. Admiral [[Herbert Sawyer|Sawyer]] had received information that ''Mary'' was in great distress from leaks and trying to reach Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'',[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1812/05-12-1812.jpg] - accessed 26 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chub'' returned two days later without having found ''Mary''. By 8 April ''Mary'' had still not arrived at Bermuda and it was feared that she had foundered.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'',[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1812/06-24-1812.jpg] - accessed 26 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chub'' captured several vessels in 1812 while on the [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] station. On 18 July she captured the privateer ''Eliza'' and on 6 August the merchantman ''Grace''.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Harrison Scott, II (transcriber) ''American Prisoners of War Held at Halifax, During the War of 1812'', Volume I. (Society of the War of 1812, Ohio).&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 18 July she recaptured ''Ann'', M'Donald, master, which had been sailing from Cadiz to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]] when the American privateer [[Teazer (privateer)|''Teazer'']] captured her the day before. ''Chub'' brought ''Ann'' into [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'',[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1812/09-15-1812.jpg] - accessed 26 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, at dusk, ''Chub'' came under friendly fire from {{HMS|Emulous|1806|6}}, which mistook ''Chubb'' for an American privateer. ''Chubb'' had earlier stopped at [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia]] and taken on board some volunteers who wanted to go a cruise with her. A chain-shot from ''Emulous'' killed two of these volunteers, Ebenezer Herrington (or Harrington), and James Scott.&lt;ref name=More&gt;More (1873), pp. 184-5.&lt;/ref&gt;(Herrington was buried in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Trask. Putting the War of 1812 to Rest. ''Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society Journal''. Vol. 18, 2015, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chubb'' returned the surviving volunteers to Liverpool and resumed her cruise.&lt;ref name=More/&gt;

==Fate==
''Chub'' was driven ashore on 14 August on the "Sisters" (Black Rocks) within two miles of the [[Sambro Island Light]] near [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gossett (1986), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Nisbett and all on board perished.&lt;ref&gt;Grocott (1997), p.343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; She was stationed with the blockade of the American fleet at the time of sinking.

'''Hamdi Lembarki''' ({{lang-ar|حمدي لمباركي}} &amp;lrm;; 1974 – 30 October 2005) was a [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] man killed by Moroccan police after a demonstration in [[El Aaiun]], during the 2005 [[Independence Intifada (Western Sahara)|Independence Intifada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All quiet on the Western Sahara front|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/11/worlddispatch.ianblack|author=[[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]]|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2005-11-11|accessdate=06-10-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and funeral==
Hamdi Lembarki was detained by members of the [[Groupes urbains de sécurité]] during a demonstration on the night of 29 October 2005 in [[El Aaiun]]. He died hours later in [[police custody]]. While at first the Moroccan authorities claimed that Lembarki had died from wounds from other protestors who were throwing stones, eyewitnesses and the [[Association marocaine des droits humains]] affirmed that police beat him to death in the street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61695.htm 2005 County Reports on Human Rights Practices - Morocco - Respect of Human rights] US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Un joven detenido por la Policía, primera víctima mortal de la "Intifada saharaui"|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-01-11-2005/abc/Internacional/un-joven-detenido-por-la-policia-primera-victima-mortal-de-la-intifada-saharaui_611978896048.html|author=Luis de Vega|publisher=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]]|date=01-11-2005|accessdate=06-10-2012}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, in an unprecedented movement in the territory, two Moroccan policemen were processed for alleged tortures to Lembarki, which finally caused him death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dos policías marroquíes, sospechosos de torturar a un saharui|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2005/11/14/internacional/1131922812_850215.html|author=Ignacio Cembrero|publisher=[[El País]]|date=2005-11-14|accessdate=06-10-2012}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamdi Lembarki was buried on the Gdeim Izik cemetery, in the outskirts of El Aaiun, in January 14, 2006. Hundreds of Sahrawis participated in the funeral, some waving [[Saharawi Republic]]/[[POLISARIO]] flags.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10964">'''Hypergravity''' is defined as the condition where the [[force]] of [[gravity]] exceeds that on the surface of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Hypergravity?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Hypergravity&amp;sa=Search#922 |title=
Specialty Definition: Hypergravity |author= |work=Websters Online Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed as being greater than 1 g. Hypergravity conditions are created on Earth for research on [[human physiology]] in aerial combat and space flight, as well as testing of materials and equipment for space missions. Manufacturing of titanium aluminide turbine blades in 20 g is being explored by researchers at the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).

All of this is of extreme importance because human physiology and materials are used to build planes, spaceships and structures, which are all accustomed to Earth’s normal gravity.
NASA scientists have recently been looking at meteorite impacts, and after testing certain strains of bacteria, they discovered that most strains were able to reproduce under pressures exceeding 7,500 g’s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universetoday.com/89416/hypergravity/{{full citation needed|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an [[ultracentrifuge]] at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 times "g" (the normal acceleration due to gravity on Earth). Another study that has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reports that some bacteria can exist even in extreme "hypergravity". In other words, they can still live and breed despite gravitational forces that are 400,000 times greater than what's felt here on Earth.
''Paracoccus denitrificans'' was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of [[supernova]]s. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful  growth under '''hypergravity'''. The research has implications on the feasibility of existence of [[exobacteria]] and [[panspermia]]. A concern of this practice is rapid spinning. If someone moves their head too quickly while they're inside a fast-moving centrifuge, they might feel uncomfortably like they're tumbling head over heels. This can happen when balance-sensing fluids in the semicircular canals of the inner ear become "confused". Some experiments using centrifuges often include devices that fix the subjects' heads in place to prevent that illusion. Traveling through space, however, with one's head fixed in place is not practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110425-gravity-extreme-bacteria-e-coli-alien-life-space-science/|title=Bacteria Grow Under 400,000 Times Earth's Gravity |author=Than, Ker |date=25 April 2011 |work=National Geographic- Daily News |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1018027108 |pmid=21518884 |pmc=3093466 |title=Microbial growth at hyperaccelerations up to 403,627 × ''g'' |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=108 |issue=19 |pages=7997–8002 |year=2011 |last1=Deguchi|first1=Shigeru |author2=Hirokazu Shimoshige |author3=Mikiko Tsudome |author4=Sada-atsu Mukai |author5=Robert W.

To understand and describe the influence of gravity in systems, the observation of behaviour in microgravity and at 1g (where g is the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth) is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Education/SEMAEVZRA0G_0.html|title=The Large Diameter Centrifuge|first=|last=esa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers calculated from a weight loss experiment that using 5&amp;nbsp;lb. ankle weights and 2.5&amp;nbsp;lb. wrist weights would have a 14% improved NEAT calorie burn while doing household chores. Track and basketball primarily plyometric) metrics improved by 8–25% mostly depending upon if the subjects used weighted vests all day or only when training, but the effect disappeared after a month of not using hypergravity training.

Researchers reported that the high-gravity level can effectively affect the phase composition and morphology of the products.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Effects on rate of aging of rats==
Ever since Pearl proposed the rate of living theory of aging, numerous studies have demonstrated its validity in poikilotherms. In mammals, however, satisfactory experimental demonstration is still lacking because an externally imposed increase of basal metabolic rate of these animals (e.g. by placement in the cold) is usually accompanied by general homeostatic disturbance and stress. The present study was based on the finding that rats exposed to slightly increased gravity are able to adapt with little chronic stress but at a higher level of basal metabolic expenditure (increased 'rate of living'). The rate of aging of 17-month-old rats that had been exposed to 3.14 ''g'' in an animal centrifuge for 8 months was larger than of controls as shown by apparently elevated lipofuscin content in heart and kidney, reduced numbers and increased size of mitochondria of heart tissue, and inferior liver mitochondria respiration (reduced 'efficiency': 20% larger ADP: 0 ratio, P less than 0.01; reduced 'speed': 8% lower respiratory control ratio, P less than 0.05).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0167-4943(82)90035-8 |pmid=7186330 |title=Effects of simulated increased gravity on the rate of aging of rats: Implications for the rate of living theory of aging |journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=349–63 |year=1982 |last1=Economos |first1=A.C. |last2=Miquel |first2=J. |last3=Ballard |first3=R.C. |last4=Blunden |first4=M. |last5=Lindseth |first5=K.A. |last6=Fleming |first6=J. |last7=Philpott |first7=D.E. |last8=Oyama |first8=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steady-state food intake per day per kg body weight, which is presumably proportional to 'rate of living' or specific basal metabolic expenditure, was about 18% higher than in controls (P less than 0.01) after an initial 2-month adaptation period. Finally, though half of the centrifuged animals lived only a little shorter than controls (average about 343 vs. 364 days on the centrifuge, difference statistically nonsignificant), the remaining half (longest survivors) lived on the centrifuge an average of 520 days (range 483–572) compared to an average of 574 days (range 502–615) for controls, computed from onset of centrifugation, or 11% shorter (P less than 0.01). Therefore, these results show that a moderate increase of the level of basal metabolism of young adult rats adapted to hypergravity compared to controls in normal gravity is accompanied by a roughly similar increase in the rate of organ aging and reduction of survival, in agreement with Pearl's rate of living theory of aging, previously experimentally demonstrated only in poikilotherms.

==Effects on the behavior of adult rats==
Pups from gestating rats exposed to hypergravity (1.8 G) or to normal gravity at the perinatal period were evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thullier|first1=F.|last2=Hayzoun|first2=K.|last3=Dubois|first3=M.|last4=Lestienne|first4=F.|last5=Lalonde|first5=R.|title=Exploration and motor activity in juvenile and adult rats exposed to hypergravity at 1.8 G during development: a preliminary report.|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=2002|volume=76|pages=617–622|doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(02)00766-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison to controls, the hypergravity group had shorter latencies before choosing a maze arm in a T-maze and fewer exploratory pokes in a hole board. During dyadic encounters, the hypergravity group had a lower number of self-grooming episodes and shorter latencies before crossing under the opposing rat.

He was known for his partnership with [[Dean Martin]] as the groundbreaking act of [[Martin and Lewis]].

Lewis went on to star in, write, produce and direct many motion pictures, such as ''[[The Delicate Delinquent]]'', ''[[The Sad Sack]]'', ''[[Rock-A-Bye Baby (film)|Rock-A-Bye Baby]]'', ''[[The Geisha Boy]]'', ''[[Don't Give Up The Ship (film)|Don't Give Up The Ship]]'', ''[[Visit to a Small Planet]]'', ''[[Cinderfella]]'', ''[[The Bellboy]]'', ''[[The Ladies' Man]]'', ''[[The Errand Boy]]'', ''[[It's Only Money]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[Who's Minding the Store?]]'', ''[[The Patsy (1964 film)|The Patsy]]'', ''[[The Disorderly Orderly]]'' and ''[[The Family Jewels (film)|The Family Jewels]]''. 

Outside of his career, he supported fundraising for [[muscular dystrophy]] research, during 60 years as national chairman and spokesman of the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] and 44 years hosting ''[[The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon]]'' every [[Labor Day]] weekend. In 1977, Lewis was nominated for a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work with the organization.

As one of the most successful performers in show business, with worldwide box office receipts of his films in excess of $800 million, Lewis received global acclaim for his unique ability and style with both comedy and drama. As part of Martin and Lewis and as a solo actor, he was voted Hollywood's top box-office draw from 1951 to 1965, in later years as the sole comedian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2017/08/20/jerry-lewis-comedian-whose-fundraising-telethons-became-famous-his-hit-movies-dies/XQdg3xyd0SmWMuhQP0UtaK/story.html|title=Jerry Lewis, comedian and telethon fund-raiser, dies at 91|first=Mark|last=Fenny|date=August 20, 2017|publisher=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Ten_Money_Making_Stars_Poll|first=|last=|title=Top Ten Money Making Stars|via=Wikipedia|publisher= [[Martin Quigley (publisher)|Quigley Publishing Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a "character" even in his teenage years, pulling pranks in his neighborhood including sneaking into kitchens to steal fried chicken and pies. He dropped out of [[Irvington High School (New Jersey)|Irvington High School]] in the tenth grade. By age 15, he had developed his "Record Act" miming lyrics to songs while a phonograph played offstage. He used the professional name Joey Lewis but soon changed it to Jerry Lewis to avoid confusion with comedian [[Joe E. Lewis]] and heavyweight boxing champion [[Joe Louis]].&lt;ref name="JLIP"/&gt;{{rp|85}} He landed a gig at a burlesque house in Buffalo, but his performance fell flat and was unable to book any more shows.

==Career==
===With Dean Martin===
{{Main|Martin and Lewis}}

[[File:Lewis and Martin.jpg|thumb|200px|Lewis with [[Dean Martin]] in 1950]]
Lewis initially gained attention as part of a double act with singer [[Dean Martin]], who served as [[straight man]] to Lewis' zany antics as the [[Martin and Lewis]] comedy team. They were different from other duo acts of the time because they played to each other and had ad-libbed improvisational segments within their planned routines.

After forming in 1946, they quickly rose to national prominence, first with their popular nightclub act, then as stars of ''[[The Martin and Lewis Show]]'' on the radio [[NBC Red Network]].&lt;ref name="varietyobit" /&gt; The two made appearances on early [[live television]] on their June 20, 1948 debut broadcast on ''Toast of the Town'' (later renamed as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on September 25, 1955) on CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/comedy-icon-jerry-lewis-dies-91/story?id=49323636|title=Comedy icon Jerry Lewis dies at 91|last=McKenzie|first=Joi-Marie|date=2017-08-20|website=ABC News|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was followed on October 3, 1948, by an appearance on NBC's ''[[Welcome Aboard (TV series)|Welcome Aboard]]''.

In 1950, Martin and Lewis signed with NBC to be one of a series of weekly rotating hosts of ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', a live Sunday evening broadcast.  Lewis, writer for the team's nightclub act, hired [[Norman Lear]] and Ed Simmons as regular writers for their ''Comedy Hour'' material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/norman-lear-recalls-early-days-as-tv-comedy-writer-1201629371/|title=Norman Lear Looks Back on Early Days as TV Comedy Writer|first=Tim|last=Gray|date=October 30, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12-IA1|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=October 31, 1953|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Comedy Hour'' shows consisted of stand-up dialogue, song and dance from their nightclub act and movies, backed by [[Dick Stabile]]'s [[big band]], slapstick and satirical sketch comedy, Martin's solo songs, and Lewis' solo pantomimes or physical numbers.

Martin and Lewis often broke character, ad-libbing and [[Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]]. While not completely capturing the orchestrated mayhem of their nightclub act, the ''Comedy Hour'' displayed the charismatic energy between the team and established their popularity nationwide. By 1951, with an appearance at New York's [[Paramount Theater (New York City)|Paramount Theater]], they were a cultural phenomenon, attracting crowds rivaled only by [[Frank Sinatra]] earlier (a friend of Lewis and Martin) and later by other stars [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]].

The duo began their [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] film careers as ensemble players in ''[[My Friend Irma (film)|My Friend Irma]]'' (1949), based on the [[My Friend Irma (radio-TV)|radio series of the same name]], and its sequel ''[[My Friend Irma Goes West]]'' (1950). Starting with ''[[At War with the Army]]'' (1950), Martin and Lewis were the stars of their own vehicles in fourteen additional titles, ''[[That's My Boy (1951 film)|That's My Boy]]'' (1951), ''[[Sailor Beware (1952 film)|Sailor Beware]]'' (1952), ''[[Jumping Jacks]]'' (1952), ''[[The Stooge]]'' (1952), ''[[Scared Stiff (1953 film)|Scared Stiff]]'' (1953), ''[[The Caddy]]'' (1953), ''[[Money from Home]]'' (1953), ''[[Living It Up]]'' (1954), ''[[3 Ring Circus]]'' (1954), ''[[You're Never Too Young]]'' (1955), ''[[Artists and Models]]'' (1955) and ''[[Pardners]]'' (1956) ending with ''[[Hollywood or Bust]]'' (1956). All 16 films were produced by [[Hal B. Wallis]].

They also starred as cameos in [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Bob Hope]]'s film ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952).  Attesting to the duo's popularity, [[DC Comics]] published ''[[The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis]]'' from 1952 to 1957. In 1954, the team appeared on episode 191 of ''[[What's My Line?]]'' as mystery guests, appeared on the 27th annual [[Academy Awards]] in 1955 and then appeared on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' and ''[[The Today Show]]'' in 1956.

The Martin and Lewis films were reliable financial successes for Paramount, and hugely popular with audiences. In later years, both Lewis and Martin admitted frustration, and were critical of Wallis for his formulaic and trite film choices, restricting them to narrow, repetitive roles. As Martin's roles in their films became less important over time, Lewis receiving the majority of critical acclaim, the partnership came under strain.

Martin's participation became an embarrassment in 1954 when ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine published a publicity photo of the team for the magazine cover but cropped Martin out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Mike|title='Dean &amp; Me' really is a love story|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2005-10-25-dean-and-me_x.htm|access-date=January 15, 2013|newspaper=usatoday.com|date=October 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership ended with their final nightclub act on July 24, 1956 (the team's 10th anniversary of their debut as a duo). Both Martin and Lewis went on to highly successful solo careers, and neither would comment on the split nor consider a reunion. However, they would occasionally be seen at the same public events.

===Going solo===

====Late 1950s and contract with Paramount====
After his partnership with Martin ended in 1956, Lewis and his wife Patty took a vacation in Las Vegas to consider the direction of his career. He felt his life was in a crisis state: "I was unable to put one foot in front of the other with any confidence. I was completely unnerved to be alone".&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt; While there, he received an urgent request from his friend [[Sidney Luft|Sid Luft]], who was [[Judy Garland]]'s husband and manager, saying that she couldn't perform that night in Las Vegas because of [[Streptococcal pharyngitis|strep throat]],&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt; and asking Lewis to fill in.

Lewis had not sung alone on stage since he was five years old, twenty-five years before, but he appeared before the audience of a thousand nonetheless, delivering jokes and clowning with the audience while Garland sat off-stage, watching. He then sang a rendition of a song he'd learned as a child, "[[Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody]]" along with "[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]." Lewis recalled, "When I was done, the place exploded. I walked off the stage knowing I could make it on my own".&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;

At his wife's pleading, Lewis used his own money to record the songs on a [[Single (music)|single]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RfVeOpw-NPY/hqdefault.jpg|title=Image of record cover for Jerry Lewis single recording of "Rock-A-Bye Baby"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Record company [[Decca Records]] heard it, liked it and insisted he record an album for them.&lt;ref name=Muncie&gt;"Jerry Lewis 'Goes Over' in a Big Way," ''The Star Press'' (Muncie, Indiana), Dec. 2, 1956, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The single of ''Rock-a-Bye Your Baby'' went to #10 and the album ''Jerry Lewis Just Sings'' went to #3 on the ''Billboard'' charts, staying near the top for four months and selling a million and a half copies.&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2&gt;Lewis, Jerry. [https://jolsonville.net/2011/03/24/rock-a-bye-helps-jerry-lewis-become-a-singer/ "''Rock-a-Bye'' helps Jerry Lewis become a singer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of that album he recorded the additional albums ''More Jerry Lewis'' (an EP of songs from this release was released as ''Somebody Loves Me''), and ''Jerry Lewis Sings Big Songs For Little People'' (later reissued with fewer tracks as ''Jerry Lewis Sings For Children''). Non-album singles were released, and ''[[It All Depends On You]]'', hit the charts in April and May 1957, but peaked at only #68. Further singles were recorded and released by Lewis into the mid-1960s.

But these were not Lewis's first foray into recording, nor his first appearance on the hit charts. During his partnership with Martin, they made several recordings together, charting at #22 in 1948 with the 1920s chestnut ''That Certain Party'' and later mostly re-recording songs highlighted in their films. Also during the time of their partnership, but without Martin, he recorded numerous novelty-comedy numbers for adults as well as records specifically intended for the children's market.

Having proven he could sing and do live shows, he began performing regularly at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Las Vegas, beginning in late 1956, which marked a turning point in his life and career. The Sands signed him for five years, to perform six weeks each year and paid him the same amount they had paid Martin and Lewis as a team.&lt;ref name=Muncie /&gt; The critics gave him positive reviews: "Jerry was wonderful. He has proved that he can be a success by himself," wrote one.&lt;ref name=Muncie /&gt; He continued with club performances in Miami, New York, Chicago and Washington.

Such live performances became a staple of his career and over the years he performed at casinos, theaters and state fairs coast-to-coast. In February 1957, he followed Garland at the [[Palace Theatre (Albany, New York)|Palace Theater]] in New York and Martin called on the phone during this period to wish him the best of luck.&lt;ref name=Muncie /&gt; "I've never been happier," said Lewis. "I have peace of mind for the first time."&lt;ref name=Muncie /&gt; Lewis established himself as a solo act on TV starting with the first of six appearances on ''What's My Line?'' from 1956 to 1966.

He guest appeared on both ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]'' and ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and beginning in January 1957, in a number of solo TV specials for NBC. He starred in his adaptation of "[[The Jazz Singer]]" for ''Startime''. Lewis hosted the Academy Awards three times, in 1956, 1957 and the [[31st Academy Awards]] in 1959, which ran twenty minutes short, forcing Lewis to improvise to fill time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=2riKdGOdU3E|title=Jerry Lewis Ad Libs at the Oscars|first=|last=1959 Academy Awards|date=1959|publisher=The Oscars|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC Comics, switching from Martin and Lewis, published a new comic book series titled ''The Adventures of Jerry Lewis'', running from 1957 to 1971.

Lewis remained at Paramount and became a comedy star in his own right. His first solo movie was ''[[The Delicate Delinquent]]'' (1957), marking Lewis' debut as film producer and screenwriter. It originally had been planned as the next Martin and Lewis film. Lewis and Martin had made two films with director [[Frank Tashlin]], whose background as a ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon director suited Lewis' brand of humor. On his own, after starring in ''[[The Sad Sack]]'' (1957), Lewis then made more films with Tashlin starting with ''[[Rock-A-Bye Baby (film)|Rock-A-Bye Baby]]'' (1958) and ''[[The Geisha Boy]]'' (1958).

On two occasions, after the split, Lewis was invited by Martin on stage in 1958 and 1961. But the split was seriously realized. He also appeared in ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship (film)|Don't Give Up The Ship]]'' (1959), and played Itchy McRabbitt, an uncredited character role in ''[[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|Li'l Abner]]'' (1959). By the end of his contract with producer Hal B. Wallis, Lewis had several productions of his own under his belt and was eager to flex his creative muscle. As a solo, Lewis was free to deepen his comedy with [[pathos]], believing, "Funny without pathos is a pie in the face. And a pie in the face is funny, but I wanted more."

In 1959, a contract between Paramount and Jerry Lewis Productions (Lewis' production company) was signed specifying a payment of $10&amp;nbsp;million plus 60% of the profits for 14 films over a seven-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krutnik|first=Frank |title=Inventing Jerry Lewis |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |year=2000 |page=105 |isbn=978-1560983699}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contract made Lewis the highest paid individual Hollywood talent to date and was unprecedented in that he had unlimited creative control, including final cut, and the return of film rights after 30 years.

Lewis' clout and box office were so strong that Barney Balaban, the head of production at Paramount at that time, told the press, "If Jerry wants to burn down the studio I'll give him the match!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wearemoviegeeks.com/2014/01/method-madness-jerry-lewis-dvd-review/|title=Method to The Maddess of Jerry Lewis the DVD Review|first=Sam|last=Moffitt|date=January 20, 2014|publisher=wearemoviegeeks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1960s and emergence as director====
[[File:Jerry_Lewis_1973.JPG|thumb|left|200px]] He had finished his film contract with Wallis with ''[[Visit to a Small Planet]]'' (1960) and wrapped up production on his own film ''[[Cinderfella]]'' (1960), with [[Ed Wynn]] and directed by Tashlin. The movie was postponed for a Christmas 1960 release. Paramount Pictures, needing a quickie motion picture for its summer 1960 schedule, held Lewis to his contract to produce one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jerry-lewis-dead-nutty-professor-bellboy-star-was-91-721408|title=Jerry Lewis, Nonpareil Genius of Comedy, Dies at 91|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he made his debut as film director of and starred in ''[[The Bellboy]]'' (1960). 

Using the [[Fontainebleau Miami Beach|Fontainebleau Hotel]] in Miami as his setting&amp;nbsp;— on a small budget, with a very tight shooting schedule&amp;nbsp;— Lewis shot the film during the day and performed at the hotel in the evenings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Bill Richmond (writer)|Bill Richmond]] collaborated with him on many of the sight gags. Lewis later revealed that Paramount was not happy about financing a "silent movie" and withdrew backing. Lewis used his own funds to cover the movie's $950,000 budget.

Lewis’ idol, [[Stan Laurel]] (of [[Laurel and Hardy]]), acted anonymously as consultant, convincing Lewis to make important edits. Interestingly enough, Ted Richmond did a Stan “cameo “, an imitation. Lewis and Richmond made a filmed appeal to Laurel for permission to use his likeness. Lewis offered Laurel a lucrative contract to do what he did for “''The Bellboy''”, on subsequent Lewis films.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Laurel took the offer seriously but after watching one of Lewis’ solo films and not understanding his on screen character, declined. {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}Lewis followed “''The Bellboy''” by directing several more movies he co-wrote with Richmond, including ''[[The Ladies Man]]'' (1961), where Lewis constructed a three-story dollhouse-like set spanning two sound stages. The set was equipped with state of the art lighting and sound, eliminating the need for boom mics in each room.

His next feature ''[[The Errand Boy]]'' (1961), was one of the earliest films about moviemaking, utilizing all of Paramount's backlot and offices. Lewis then starred in his first special in three years ''The Wacky World of Jerry Lewis''. He appeared in an episode of ''Celebrity Golf'' followed by a guest spot on an episode of ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. He then starred in Tashlin's ''[[It's Only Money]]'' (1962).

Lewis took on as guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' during the transition from [[Jack Paar]] to [[Johnny Carson]] in 1962. His appearance on the show scored the highest ratings thus far in late night, surpassing other guest hosts and Paar. The three major networks began a bidding war, wooing Lewis for his own talk show, which debuted the following year. Lewis then directed, co-wrote and starred in the smash hit ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' (1963), with [[Stella Stevens]] as co-star.

A parody of ''[[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', it featured him as a socially awkward professor inventing a serum that turns him into a handsome but obnoxious ladies man. It is largely considered to be Lewis' finest and most memorable film and in 2004, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Lewis then appeared in a cameo role in [[Stanley Kramer]]'s comedy epic ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963).

He starred next in Tashlin's ''[[Who's Minding the Store?]]'' (1963) and then hosted ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]'', a 13-week lavish, big-budget show for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], that aired from September to December in 1963. The show suffered in the ratings, beleaguered by technical and other difficulties, including the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]], which left the country in a somber mood. Lewis co-wrote and starred in ''[[The Patsy (1964 film)|The Patsy]]'' (1964), his satire about the Hollywood star-making industry.

His last film collaboration with Tashlin was ''[[The Disorderly Orderly]]'' (1964), in which Lewis served as executive producer of. After that, Lewis then directed, co-wrote and appeared in ''[[The Family Jewels (film)|The Family Jewels]]'' (1965) about a young heiress who must choose among six uncles, one of whom is up to no good and out to harm the girl's beloved bodyguard who practically raised her. Lewis played all six uncles and the bodyguard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2016/jerry-lewis/the-family-jewels/|title=The Family Jewels (1965) • Senses of Cinema|website=sensesofcinema.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[This Diamond Ring]], a song sung by Lewis' son [[Gary Lewis (musician)|Gary Lewis]] and [[Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys|his band]] was featured in the film.

In 1965, Lewis was interviewed on ''[[The David Susskind Show]]''. Lewis' last film for Paramount ''[[Boeing Boeing (1965 film)|Boeing Boeing]]'' (1965), co-starred him with [[Tony Curtis]]'s lead and is based on the [[Boeing-Boeing (play)|French stage play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-News-Jerry-Lewis-Dies-at-91-20170820|title=Breaking News: Jerry Lewis Dies at 91|last=|first=|date=|work=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for this role. Lewis directed and appeared on an episode of ''[[Ben Casey]]'', an early dramatic role. He also appeared on  ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', and ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'' with his son Gary Lewis.  In 1966, Paramount changed ownership and the new executives declined to renew Lewis' 1959 profit sharing contract.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Lewis moved to other studios, starting with [[Columbia Pictures]], where he made and starred in ''[[Three on a Couch]]'' (1966). He appeared on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' alongside [[Richard Pryor]]. For [[20th Century Fox]], Lewis starred in ''[[Way...Way Out]]'' (1966) with [[Connie Stevens]], then he had cameos in ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[Laugh In]]'', was a panalist on ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'' and in a pilot for ''Sheriff Who''.  Lewis returned with a new version of ''The Jerry Lewis Show'', this time as a one-hour variety show for NBC, which ran from 1967 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-obit-jerry-lewis-20170820-story.html|title=Iconic comedian Jerry Lewis dies at 91|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He would next direct and star in ''[[The Big Mouth]]'' (1967).

Lewis made an appearance on ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'', starred in [[Jerry Paris]]' film ''[[Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River]]'' (1968) and then appear as a guest on ''[[Playboy After Dark]]'', surprising Davis Jr. in 1968. Lewis went on to star in ''[[Hook, Line &amp; Sinker (1969 film)|Hook, Line &amp; Sinker]]'' (1969) with co-star [[Peter Lawford]] and afterwards, guest starred in an episode of ''[[Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters|Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters Hour]]''.

====1970s====
[[File:Jerry_Lewis_show.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lewis performing]]
In 1970, Lewis guest appeared on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', then contributed to some scripts for the [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down]]''. He later guest hosted ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' and then directed an episode of ''[[The Bold Ones]]''. He made guest appearances on ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', ''The Engelbert Humperdinck Show'', ''The Irv Kupcinet Show'', ''[[The Linkletter Show]]'', ''The Real Tom Kennedy Show'' and ''A Christmas Night with the Stars''.

For [[United Artists]], Lewis directed and made his first offscreen voice performance as a bandleader in ''[[One More Time (1970 film)|One More Time]]'' (1970), a sequel to the 1968 film ''[[Salt and Pepper (film)|Salt and Pepper]]''. Next, he produced, directed and starred in ''[[Which Way to the Front?]]'' (1970) for [[Warner Bros.]] and then guest appeared on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', ''The Rolf Harris Show'' and ''[[The Kraft Music Hall]]'' in 1971.

Lewis then directed and starred in the partly unreleased ''[[The Day the Clown Cried]]'' (1972), a drama set in a [[Nazi concentration camp]]. Lewis rarely discussed the film, but stated litigation over post-production finances and copyright prevented the film's completion and theatrical release. During his book tour for ''Dean and Me'' he also said a factor for the film's burial was that he was not proud of the effort.

Lewis explained his reason for choosing the project and the emotional difficulty of the subject matter in an interview with an Australian documentary film crew in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2CdfppsqKQ|title=Clown: teaser for unfinished Jerry Lewis Documentary|publisher=tracesfilm|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 31-minute version was shown on the German television station ARD, in the documentary Der Clown in 2016. It was later put on DVD and shown at Deutsches Filminstitute

Within historical context, the movie was the earliest attempt by an American motion picture director to address the subject of [[The Holocaust]], preceding by thirteen years [[Claude Lanzmann]]'s groundbreaking film ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/postscript-jerry-lewis|first=Richard|last=Brody|title=Postscript: Jerry Lewis|date=August 20, 2017|publisher=New Yorker Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than twenty years, [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Life is Beautiful]]'', dealing with similar themes. Significant speculation continues to surround the film. Following this, Lewis would take a break from the movie business for several years.

In 1973, Lewis was a guest on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' and ''NBC Follies''. He then appeared on ''Celebrity Sportsman'' in 1974. Next, Lewis appeared as guest on both ''[[Cher (TV series)|Cher]]'' and ''[[Dinah!]]'' in 1975. Lewis then guested on an episode of ''[[Tony Orlando and Dawn (TV series)|Tony Orlando and Dawn]]''. In September 1976, Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Dean Martin on stage during the ''MDA Jerry Lewis Telethon''.

As Martin and Lewis embraced, the audience cheered and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years. Lewis reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, "So, you working?", which he stated was a call-back to a remark he'd made to Martin when they first met. Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was "at the Meggum" (meaning the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]]). The reunion made international headlines and is considered one of the most iconic moments in TV history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/dean-martin-jerry-lewis-reunion-anniversary|title=When Jerry Met Dean-Again, on Live Television|first=Donald|last=Liebenson|date=September 2016|publisher=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less well known, Lewis returned the surprise the following year by walking onto the [[Planet Hollywood Las Vegas|Aladdin]] stage in Las Vegas during Martin and Sinatra's performance. They exchanged jokes for several minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeNDDqbIZMw|first=|last=|title=23 August 1977|publisher=drowsyvenus|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis then starred in a revival of ''[[Hellzapoppin (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]'' with co-star [[Lynn Redgrave]], but it closed on the road before reaching [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/bwidb/productions/Hellzapoppin%27_8211/|title=''Hellzapoppin'' 1976 revival, closed on the road before reaching Broadway|publisher=Broadwayworld.com|access-date=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he served as guest host and ringmaster of ''[[Circus of the Stars]]''.

===Later years===
====1980s====
[[File:Jerry_Lewis_-_1981.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lewis in 1981]] After an absence of 11 years, Lewis returned to the big screen in ''[[Hardly Working]]'' (1981), which he directed and starred in. Despite being panned by critics, it eventually earned $50&amp;nbsp;million. In 1982, Lewis was a guest on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. In 1983, Lewis co-starred in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'', as a late-night TV host, plagued by two obsessive fans, played by [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Sandra Bernhard]]. He received wide critical acclaim and a [[BAFTA]] nomination for this serious dramatic role.

Lewis guest hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and also starred in ''[[Cracking Up (film)|Cracking Up]]'' a.k.a. ''Smorgasbord'' (1983) and ''[[Slapstick of Another Kind|Slapstick (Of Another Kind)]]'' (1984). Next, Lewis starred in two French films, ''[[Retenez Moi...Ou Je Fais Un Malheur|To Catch a Cop]]'' a.k.a. ''The Defective Detective'' (1984) and ''[[Par ou t'es rentre ? On t'a pas vu sortir|How Did You Get In? We Didn't See You Leave]]'' (1984). Lewis stated that as long as distribution of the two movies are under his control, they would never be released in America.

He then hosted a syndicated talk show for Metromedia, which was not continued beyond the scheduled five shows. In 1985, Lewis directed an episode of the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''Brothers''. In 1986, Lewis appeared at the first [[Comic Relief USA|Comic Relief]], where he was the only performer to receive a standing ovation and after that, he was interviewed on ''Classic Treasures''. Lewis also starred in the ABC televised movie ''[[Fight for Life (film)|Fight For Life]]'' (1987) with [[Patty Duke]].

In 1987, Lewis and Davis Jr. performed in Las Vegas together (his first 'double-act' since the split with Martin in 1956). That same year, he also learned of the death of Martin's son [[Dean Paul Martin]] and attended the funeral, which lead to a more substantial reconciliation with Martin. In 1988, Lewis hosted ''America's All-Time Favorite Movies'', then was interviewed by [[Howard Cosell]] on ''Speaking of Everything.'' He then starred in five episodes of the CBS program ''[[Wiseguy]]''.

The filming schedule of the show forced Lewis to miss the [[Museum of the Moving Image]]'s opening with a retrospective of his work. In 1989, Lewis joined Martin on stage, for what would be Martin's final live performance, at Bally's Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Lewis wheeled out a cake on Martin's 72nd birthday, sang "[[Happy Birthday to you|Happy Birthday]]" to him and joked, "Why we broke up, I'll never know".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_10-23-2005/featured_0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322110107/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_10-23-2005/featured_0|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 22, 2006|title='We Had That X Factor' (Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis)|last=Lewis|first=Jerry|last2=Kaplan|first2= James|authorlink2=James Kaplan|date=October 23, 2005|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|access-date=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, their appearance together made headlines. He then appeared in ''[[Cookie (film)|Cookie]]'' (1989).

====1990s====
In 1991, Lewis guest starred in and directed an episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] series ''[[Good Grief (TV series)|Good Grief]]''. In 1992, Lewis had a cameo in ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'' (1992), appeared as a guest on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'',  ''[[The Whoopi Goldberg Show]]'' and was interviewed by [[Alan King]] on ''Inside The Comedy Mind''. Lewis produced a three-part retrospective for [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] entitled ''Martin &amp; Lewis: Their Golden Age of Comedy'', using previously unseen [[kinescope]]s from his personal archive, highlighting his years as part of a team with Martin and his solo work.

In 1993, he was the first of a series of 'classic' comedians to guest star in ''[[Mad About You]]'', playing an eccentric billionaire. He appearanced on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and co-starred in the film ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993) as a car salesman uncle to [[Johnny Depp]]'s character as his nephew. Lewis then starred as the 'Comedy Legend' father of a young comic, played by [[Oliver Platt]], in ''[[Funny Bones]]'' (1995).

Lewis' role serves as the metaphorical pivot in 20th Century comedy, from slapstick anarchists to clever storytellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dem Bones|first=Shawn|last=Levy|pages=2–3, 7|issue=May/June, 1995|publisher=Film Comment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Arizona Dream'' and ''Funny Bones'' were tongue-in-cheek roles for independent films. In 1995, realizing a lifelong ambition, Lewis made his Broadway debut, as a replacement cast member, in a revival of ''[[Damn Yankees]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Theater Review: Damn Yankees; Finally, Jerry Lewis Is on Broadway |author=Vincent Canby |date=March 13, 1995 |newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/theater/theater-review-damn-yankees-finally-jerry-lewis-is-on-broadway.html?mcubz=3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822102229/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/theater/theater-review-damn-yankees-finally-jerry-lewis-is-on-broadway.html?mcubz=3 |archivedate=2017-08-22 |access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing the devil, he was reportedly paid the highest sum in Broadway history at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jerry-lewis-dead-nutty-professor-bellboy-star-was-91-721408|first=Duane|last=Byrge|first2=Mike|last2=Barnes|title=Jerry Lewis Nonpareil Genius of Comedy Dead at 91|date=August 20, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed in both the national and London runs of the musical.

Lewis missed three performances of the live show in four-plus years, one being Martin's funeral. He was then interviewed by [[James Lipton]] on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''. In 1996, Lewis served as executive producer of the [[Universal Pictures]] release of [[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|''The Nutty Professor'' remake]], starring [[Eddie Murphy]] as the lead role of Professor Sherman Klump. Lewis would also appear on the 12th [[American Comedy Awards]] in 1998.

====2000s====
In 2000, Lewis appeared as a guest on ''[[The Martin Short Show]]'', then ''Russell Gilbert Live'' and also executive produced ''[[The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]''. In 2003, Lewis did guest appearances on ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'', ''[[Your World with Neil Cavuto]]'' and did a guest voice as [[Professor Frink]]'s father in a ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He then made a cameo in ''[[Miss Cast Away and the Island Girls]]'' in 2004.

In 2005, Lewis went on make guest appearances on ''[[Late Night with Conan O' Brien]]'' and ''Live with Kelly''. In 2006, He guest starred in an episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' as [[John Munch|Munch]]'s uncle. Lewis sang and recorded the duet song "[[Time After Time (1947 song)|Time After Time]]" with Dean Martin's daughter, [[Deana Martin]], for her album ''Memories Are Made of This''. He then appeared on the [[81st Academy Awards]] in 2009.

====2010s====
[[File:Jerry_Lewis_Cannes_2013_2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lewis at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2013]] In 2012, Lewis directed a musical theatre play of ''The Nutty Professor''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.

In [[Brazil]], he appeared in ''[[Até que a Sorte nos Separe 2|Till Luck Do Us Part 2]]'' (2013), a sequel to the 2012 film ''[[Ate que a Sorte nos Separe|Till Luck Do Us Part]]''. In 2014, Lewis was guest on ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]'' and then on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]''. In 2015, he was interviewed by [[Raymond Arroyo]] on ''World Over''.

Lewis starred in a small role in ''[[The Trust (film)|The Trust]]'' (2016) and a serious lead role in his final film ''[[Max Rose (film)|Max Rose]]'' (2016), which premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Jerry Lewis To Star In 'Max Rose'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003719.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 15, 2009|access-date=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a guest on ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'' and in December, expressed interest in another movie.&lt;ref name="hr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jerry-lewis-interview-painful-awkward-awful-7-minutes-watch-957115|title=Watch the Most Painfully Awkward Interview of 2016: 7 Minutes with Jerry Lewis|last=Lewis|first=Andy|date=December 19, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis' last appearance was in an episode of ''[[Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee]]''.

==Video assist==
During production of ''The Bellboy'', Lewis pioneered the technique of using video cameras and multiple closed circuit monitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/20/entertainment/jerry-lewis-dies/index.html|title=Comedian Jerry Lewis dies at 91, publicist says|last=Leopold|first=Todd|date=|website=CNN|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed him to review his performance instantly. This was necessary since he was acting as well as directing. His techniques and methods of [[video assist]], documented in his book and his USC class, enabled him to complete most of his films on time and under budget since reshoots could take place immediately instead of waiting for the [[dailies]].

''Man in Motion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061947/|title=Man in Motion|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2018|via=imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[featurette]] for ''Three on a Couch'', features the video system, named "Jerry's Noisy Toy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGyntfAGkME|title="Man in Motion", behind-the-scenes featurette, 1966, Jerry Lewis, Janet Leigh |first=|last=soapbxprod|date=19 October 2011|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and shows Lewis receiving the Golden Light Technical Achievement award for its development. Lewis stated he worked with the head of [[Sony]] to produce the prototype. While he initiated its practice and use, and was instrumental in its development, he did not hold a patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/20/jerry-lewis-dies-at-91/|title=Comedian Jerry Lewis dies at 91|date=2017-08-20|website=Orange County Register|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/video-assist-predates-jerry-lewis-patent/|title=Video assist predates Jerry Lewis 'patent'|work=CNET|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is now commonplace in filmmaking.

==USC film class==
Starting in 1967, Lewis taught a film directing class at the [[University of Southern California]] in Los Angeles for a number of years. His students included [[George Lucas]], whose friend Steven Spielberg sometimes sat in on classes.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Lewis: TV Guide Biography&lt;/ref&gt;  Lewis screened Spielberg's early film ''[[Amblin']]'' and told his students, "That's what filmmaking is all about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph McBride|title=Steven Spielberg – A Biography|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1997|page=168|isbn=978-1604738360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class covered all topics related to filmmaking, including pre and post production, marketing and distribution, and filming comedy with rhythm and timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Total Filmmaker|first=Jerry|last=Lewis|year=1971|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780446669269}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''The Total Film Maker'' (1971), was based on 480 hours of his class lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mda.org/jerry-lewis/biography.html|title=Jerry Lewis Biography|publisher=MDA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French critical acclaim==
While Lewis was popular in France for his duo films with Dean Martin and his solo comedy films, his reputation and stature increased after the Paramount contract, when he began to exert total control over all aspects of his films.  His involvement in directing, writing, editing and art direction coincided with the rise of [[auteur|auteur theory]] in French intellectual film criticism and the [[French New Wave]] movement. He earned consistent praise from French critics in the influential magazines ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' and ''[[Positif (magazine)|Positif]]'', where he was hailed as an ingenious auteur.

His singular ''[[mise-en-scene]]'', and skill behind the camera, were aligned with [[Howard Hawks]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Satyajit Ray]]. Appreciated too, was the complexity of his also being in front of the camera. The new French criticism viewed [[Cinematography|cinema]] as an art form unto itself, and comedy as part of this art. Lewis is then fitted into a historical context and seen as not only worthy of critique, but as an innovator and satirist of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film|first=Hollis|last=Alpert|chapter=le roi du crazy|publisher=The Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc.|location=New York|pages=23–25|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Pierre Coursodon]] states in a 1975 [[Film Comment]] article, "The merit of the French critics, auteurist excesses notwithstanding, was their willingness to look at what Lewis was doing as a filmmaker for what it was, rather than with some preconception of what film comedy should be."

Not yet curricula at universities or art schools, [[Film studies|Cinema Studies]] and [[Film theory]] were [[avant-garde]] in early 1960s America. Mainstream movie reviewers such as [[Pauline Kael]], were dismissive of auteur theory, and others, seeing only absurdist comedy, criticized Lewis for his ambition and "castigated him for his self-indulgence" and egotism.&lt;ref name="Mclellen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-jerry-lewis-20170820-story.html|title=The Slapstick, The Telethons, The Laaady!|first=Dennis|last=Mclellen|date=August 20, 2017|publisher=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The total film-maker, so admired in France, made Hollywood uncomfortable, since the system has always operated otherwise."

Appreciation of Lewis became a misunderstood stereotype about "the French", and it was often the object of jokes in American pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1349/do-the-french-really-love-jerry-lewis|title=Do the French really love Jerry Lewis?|date=October 1, 1999|publisher=The Straight Dope|author=Cecil Adams|access-date=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "That Americans can't see Jerry Lewis' genius is bewildering," says N. T. Binh, a French film magazine critic. Such bewilderment was the basis of the book ''Why the French Love Jerry Lewis''.&lt;ref name=Poirier /&gt; In a lingering perception that French audiences adored him, Lewis stated in interviews he was more popular in [[Germany]], [[Japan]] and [[Australia]].

==Activism with MDA==
[[File:Mda2018logo.png|thumb|200px|right]]
Throughout his adult life and career, Lewis was a world-renowned humanitarian, [[philanthropist]] and "number one volunteer" who supported fundraising for research into [[muscular dystrophy]]. From 1956 to 2011, he served as national chairman of and spokesman for the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] (formerly, the Muscular Dystrophy Associations of America).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.com/id/44013800/ns/us_news-giving/#.TjqwhTvj6rg|title=Jerry Lewis no longer MDA's national chairman|publisher=MSNBC|date=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as December 1951, Lewis, along with Martin, made appeals for MDA at the conclusion of ''The Colgate Comedy Hour''.

In 1954, Lewis and [[Rocky Marciano]] fought in a special boxing bout for MDA's fund drive, with Martin as referee. He then began hosting New York area telethons to benefit the organization from 1952 to 1959, leading up to the live annual [[Labor Day]] event of ''[[The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon]]'' (also referred to as ''Jerry Lewis Extra Special Special'', ''Jerry Lewis Super Show'' and ''Jerry Lewis Stars Across America''), which ran from 1966 to 2010. In 1977, Lewis was nominated for a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

By 1990, popular culture had shifted its view of the differently-abled and the telethon format. Lewis and the telethon's methods were criticized by disabled-rights activists who believed the show was "designed to evoke pity rather than empower the disabled." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-09-03/news/0609030039_1_muscular-dystrophy-jerry-lewis-telethon|first=E.A.|last=Torriero|title=Telethon Raises Criticism|date=September 3, 2006|publisher=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activists said the telethon perpetuated prejudices and stereotypes, that Lewis treated those he claimed to be helping with little respect, and that he used offensive language when describing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/21/jerry-lewis-telethons-raised-billions-for-muscular-dystrophy-many-cheered-when-he-went-off-the-air/?utm_term=.ca0ea8947e40|first=Travis|last=Andrews|title=Jerry Lewis Telethons Raised Billion For Muscular Dystrophy Many Cheered When He Went Off The Air|date=August 21, 2017|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis rebutted the criticism and defended his methods saying, "If you don't tug at their heartstrings, then you're on the air for nothing."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webhost.bridgew.edu/jhuber/readings/mda_telethon.html|title=The MDA Telethon Pity Or Compassion|first=Joseph|last=Hubber|publisher=bridgew.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Lewis' telethon became the first ever to be viewed around the globe via internet simulcast by [[RealNetworks]] on MDA's website. In 2009, Lewis was presented the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] for his efforts for MDA. On August 3, 2011, it was announced that Lewis would no longer host the MDA telethons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jerry Lewis Dropped from Labor Day Telethon|author=Brian Stelter|date=August 4, 2011|url=http://artbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/jerry-lewis-dropped-from-labor-day-telethon|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=May 3, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was no longer associated with the Muscular Dystrophy Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/07/27/jerry-lewis-screwed-again-by-mda-theyre-using-his-old-clips-with-a-list-stars-to-promote-themselves|title=Jerry Lewis Screwed Again by MDA: They're Using His Old Clips With A List Stars to Promote Themselves|publisher=Showbiz411|date=July 27, 2014|access-date=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on May 1, 2015, it was announced that in view of "the new realities of television viewing and philanthropic giving", the telethon was being discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|agency=Associated Press |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/labor-day-telethon-jerry-lewis-792831|title=Labor Day Telethon That Jerry Lewis Memorably Ran Pulls Plug|date=May 1, 2015|issn=0018-3660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Lewis broke a five-year silence by making a surprise online video statement at MDA's brand re-launch event at Carnegie Hall in New York City for the organization on its website in honor of its rebranding marking his first (and as it turned out, his final) appearance in support of MDA since his last telethon in 2010 and the end of his tenure as national chairman and spokesman in 2011.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

For over half a century, Lewis raised an estimated $2.6 billion in donations for the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/06/24/3252231.htm|title=Jerry Lewis wows ACTU crowd|publisher=ABC News|date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDA's website states, "Jerry's love, passion and brilliance are woven throughout this organization, which he helped build from the ground up. Lewis courted sponsors for MDA, appeared at openings of MDA care and research centers, addressed meetings of civic organizations, volunteers and the MDA Board of Directors, successfully lobbied Congress for federal neuromuscular disease research funds and made countless phone calls and visits to families served by MDA.

During Lewis' lifetime, MDA-funded scientists discovered the causes of most of the diseases in the Muscular Dystrophy Association's program, developing treatments, therapies and standards of care that have allowed many people living with these diseases to live longer and grow stronger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://strongly.mda.org/in-loving-memory-of-jerry-lewis/|first=|last=|title=In Loving Memory of Jerry Lewis-MDA|publisher=MDA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 research and treatment facilities were built with donations raised by the Jerry Lewis Telethons.

==Theater chain==
In 1969, Lewis agreed to lend his name to "Jerry Lewis Cinemas", offered by National Cinema Corporation as a franchise business opportunity for those interested in theatrical movie exhibition. Jerry Lewis Cinemas stated that their theaters could be operated by a staff of as few as two with the aid of automation and support provided by the franchiser in booking film and other aspects of film exhibition. A forerunner of the smaller rooms typical of later multi-screen complexes, a Jerry Lewis Cinema was billed in franchising ads as a "mini-theatre" with a seating capacity of between 200 and 350.

In addition to Lewis's name, each Jerry Lewis Cinemas bore a sign with a cartoon logo of Lewis in profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connelly|first=Sherilyn|title=Bad Ideas from the 1970s: Jerry Lewis Cinema Franchises Were a Nutty Disaster|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2011/08/jerry_lewis_cinemas_the_nutty.php|newspaper=SF Weekly|access-date=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially 158 territories were franchised, with a buy-in fee of $10,000 or $15,000 depending on the territory, for what was called an "individual exhibitor". For $50,000, Jerry Lewis Cinemas offered an opportunity known as an "area directorship", in which investors controlled franchising opportunities in a territory as well as their own cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id8z8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;1pg=PP1&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA75-IA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|work=Life|title=Join Jerry Lewis (advt.)|page=75|date=December 31, 1971|access-date=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the chain was hampered by a policy of only booking second-run, family-friendly films.

Eventually the policy was changed, and the Jerry Lewis Cinemas were allowed to show more competitive movies. But after a decade the chain failed and both Lewis and National Cinema Corporation declared bankruptcy in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=ccrouch|title=Fantasy &amp; Failure With Jerry Lewis Cinemas|url=http://cinelog.org/cinelog/2009/03/28/fantasy-failure-with-jerry-lewis-cinemas/|publisher=Cinelog.org|access-date=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other charity work==
In 1990, Lewis wrote and directed a short film for [[UNICEF]]'s ''How Are The Children?'' anthology exploring the rights of children worldwide. The eight-minute segment, titled ''Boy'', was about a young white child in a black world and being subjected to quiet, insidious racism, and outright racist bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6XuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA452&amp;lpg=PA452|title=King of Comedy: The Life and Art of Jerry Lewis|last=Levy|first=Shawn|date=1996|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312132484|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Lewis met with seven-year-old Lochie Graham, who shared his idea for "Jerry's House", a place for vulnerable and traumatized children. Lewis and Graham entered into a joint partnership for an Australian and a U.S.-based charity and began raising funds to build the facility in [[Melbourne, Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader//outer-east/ringwood-east-teen-lochie-graham-bands-with-comedian-jerry-lewis-to-create-a-house-full-of-laughter/news-story/c7c7ad1847d30dd2751d3fa90d956a51|title=Laughter really is the best medicine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hope2day.org/jerrys-house/|title=jerryshouse|website=jerryshouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 2016, Lewis lent his name and star power to [[Criss Angel]]'s HELP (Heal Every Life Possible) charity event.

==Political views==
Lewis kept a low political profile for many years, having taken advice reportedly given to him by President [[John F. Kennedy]], who told him "Don't get into anything political. Don't do that because they will usurp your energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/doug-elfman/how-jack-kennedy-talked-jerry-lewis-out-500-million-charity-loan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924005840/http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/doug-elfman/how-jack-kennedy-talked-jerry-lewis-out-500-million-charity-loan|archivedate=2016-09-24|title=How Jack Kennedy Talked Jerry Lewis Out Of A $500 Million Charity Loan|first=Doug|last=Elfman|date=August 31, 2008|access-date=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he campaigned and performed on behalf of both JFK and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Lewis was a supporter of the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]. For his 1957 NBC special, Lewis held his ground when southern affiliates objected to his stated friendship with Sammy Davis Jr. In a 1971 ''Movie Mirror'' magazine article, Lewis came out against the [[Vietnam War]], when his son, Gary, returned from service traumatized.  He vowed to leave the country rather than send another of his sons. 
 
Lewis once stated political speeches should not be at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. "I think we are the most dedicated industry in the world. And I think that we have to present ourselves that night as hard-working, caring and important people to the industry. We need to get more self-respect as an industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jerry-lewis-talks-hollywood-argo-424974|title=Jerry Lewis on 'Argo,' Old Hollywood and his Fans in France|publisher=|access-date=December 20, 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2004 interview with [[The Guardian]], Lewis was asked what he was least proud of, to which he answered, "Politics". Not his politics, but the world's politics – the madness, the destruction, the general lack of respect. He lamented citizens' lack of [[patriotism|pride in their country]], stating, "President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] is my president. I will not say anything negative about the president of the United States. I don't do that. And I don't allow my children to do that. Likewise when I come to England don't you do any jokes about 'Mum' to me. That is the [[Elizabeth II|Queen of England]], you moron." "Do you know how tough a job it is to be the Queen of England?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/apr/08/1|title='My dream is to be perfect'|first=Simon|last=Hattenstone|date=April 8, 2004|publisher=|access-date=December 20, 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 2015 interview on EWTN's ''World Over'' with Raymond Arroyo, Lewis expressed opposition to the United States letting in [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]], saying "No one has worked harder for the human condition than I have, but they're not part of the human condition if 11 guys in that group of 10,000 are [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. How can I take that chance?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.news/2016-01-15-jerry-lewis-unleashed-acclaimed-comedian-slams-obamas-destructive-policies-while-praising-donald-trump.html|title=Jerry Lewis unleashed: Acclaimed comedian slams Obama's destructive policies while praising Donald Trump|website=www.liberty.news}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, he criticized President [[Barack Obama]] for not being prepared for ISIS, while expressing support for [[Donald Trump]], saying he would make a good president because he was a good "[[showman]]". He also added that he admired [[Ronald Reagan]]'s presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGmyHivWyN8|title=World Over – 2015-12-17  – Jerry Lewis Exclusive with Raymond Arroyo|publisher=EWTN|date=December 18, 2015|access-date=December 20, 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/06/06/donald-trumps-celebrity-endorsements-a-complete-list/jerry-lewis/|title=From Jon Voight to Azealia Banks: a guide to Donald Trump's celebrity supporters|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/jerry-lewis-says-syrian-refugees-stay-where-hell-173251288.html|title=Jerry Lewis Praises Donald Trump, Says Syrian Refugees 'Should Stay Where the Hell They Are' (Video)|website=Yahoo!

===Controversial statements===
In 1998, at the [[The Comedy Festival|Aspen U.S. Comedy Arts Festival]], when asked which women comics he admired, Lewis answered, "I don't like any female comedians." "A woman doing comedy doesn't offend me but sets me back a bit." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.com/celebrity/jerry-lewis-not-funny/|title=Jerry Lewis: Not Funny|date=October 29, 1998|first=|last=People staff|publisher=People Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later clarified his statements saying, "Seeing a woman project the kind of aggression that you have to project as a comic just rubs me wrong." "I cannot sit and watch a lady diminish her qualities to the lowest common denominator." Lewis mentioned his attitude as that of an older generation and said women are funny but not in 'broad' and 'crude' humor.

He went on to praise [[Lucille Ball]] as "brilliant" and said [[Carol Burnett]] is "the greatest female entrepreneur of comedy."  On other occasions Lewis expressed admiration for female comedians [[Totie Fields]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Kathleen Freeman]], [[Elayne Boosler]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Tina Fey]]. During the 2007 MDA Telethon, Lewis used the word "[[Faggot (slang)|fag]]" in a joke, for which he apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lewis-slur/jerry-lewis-apologizes-for-anti-gay-slur-idUSN0444968820070904|title=Jerry Lewis apologizes for anti-gay slur|last=Gorman|first=Steve|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis used the same word the following year on Australian television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/20/the-two-sides-of-jerry-lewis/|title=Appreciation: The Two Sides of Jerry Lewis|publisher=The Washington Post|date=August 20, 2017|first=Elahe|last=Izadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stalking incident==
In 1995, a man named Gary Benson was revealed to  have been stalking Lewis and his family. Benson subsequently served four years in prison.

===Illness===
Lewis had a number of illnesses and [[addiction]]s related both to aging and a back injury sustained in a comedic [[wiktionary:pratfall|pratfall]]. The fall has been stated as being either from a piano while performing at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] on March 20, 1965,&lt;ref name= usat&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark|first=Mike|title= Jerry Lewis Tells It Like It Is – And Was|url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/2002-08-29-jerry_x.htm|date=August 29, 2002|work=[[USA Today]]| access-date=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seattlepi&gt;{{cite news|title=A Moment With ...

It was discovered that he had pneumonia, as well as a severely damaged heart. He underwent a [[cardiac catheterization]]{{when|date=November 2017}} and two [[stent]]s were inserted into one of his coronary arteries, which was 90 percent blocked. The surgery resulted in increased blood flow to his heart and allowed him to continue his rebound from earlier lung problems. Having the cardiac catheterization meant canceling several major events from his schedule, but Lewis fully recuperated in a matter of weeks. In 1999, Lewis' Australian tour was cut short when he had to be hospitalized in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] with viral [[meningitis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} He was ill for more than five months. It was reported in the Australian press that he had failed to pay his medical bills. However, Lewis maintained that the payment confusion was the fault of his health insurer.

The resulting negative publicity caused him to sue his insurer for US$100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Price |first=Jenna |date=June 11, 2000 |title=Jerry Lewis Calls The Shots Now That He's Paid His Bill |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis had [[prostate cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henkel|first=John|title=Prostate Cancer: New Tests Create Treatment Dilemmas|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n10_v28/ai_15955600/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708120551/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n10_v28/ai_15955600/ |dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2012-07-08|date=December 1994|work=[[FDA Consumer]]|publisher= [[BNET]]|access-date=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]],&lt;ref name="seattlepi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/jerry-lewis-opens-up-sons-709775|date=6 June 2014|author=Feinberg, Scott|title=At Home With Jerry Lewis as He Opens Up About Son's Death, Skirmishes With Fans|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pulmonary fibrosis]],&lt;ref name="usat" /&gt; and a decades-long history of [[cardiovascular disease]]. [[Prednisone]]&lt;ref name="usat" /&gt; treatment in the late 1990s for pulmonary fibrosis resulted in weight gain and a noticeable change in his appearance. In September 2001, Lewis was unable to perform at a planned London charity event at the [[London Palladium]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} He was the headlining act, and he was introduced but did not appear. He had suddenly become unwell, apparently with heart problems.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

He was subsequently taken to the hospital. Some months thereafter, Lewis began an arduous, months-long therapy that weaned him off [[prednisone]] and enabled him to return to work. On June 12, 2012, he was treated and released from a hospital after collapsing from [[hypoglycemia]] at a [[New York Friars Club]] event. This latest health issue forced him to cancel a show in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-friars-club-jerry-lewis-collapsemt1thewrap43976-20120613,0,4472954.story |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614152004/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-friars-club-jerry-lewis-collapsemt1thewrap43976-20120613%2C0%2C4472954.story |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 14, 2012 |title=Jerry Lewis Rushed to Hospital After Friars Club Collapse (Report) |last=Kenneally |first=Tim |date=June 13, 2012 |work= [[Chicago Tribune]] |agency= Reuters |access-date=June 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2016 interview with ''Inside Edition'', Lewis acknowledged that he might not star in any more films, given his advanced age, while admitting, through tears, that he was afraid of dying, as it would leave his wife and daughter alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiyQtff7r64|title=90-Year-Old Jerry Lewis Breaks Down In Tears While Discussing Death|work = [[Inside Edition]] |date=October 5, 2016|publisher=|access-date= December 20, 2016|via= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, Lewis was hospitalized at a Las Vegas hospital for a [[urinary tract infection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/06/05/jerry-lewis-making-progress-after-hospitalization.html|title=Jerry Lewis 'making progress' after hospitalization| first= Sasha | last= Savitsky|publisher=[[Fox News]]|access-date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes and legacy==
For almost two decades, from the late '40s to the mid-'60s, "Lewis was a virtually unprecedented force in American popular culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Here at Last--A Serious Life of Jerry Lewis|author=Bruce Handy|publisher=Time Magazine|page=180|date=July 29, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely acknowledged as a comic genius, Lewis influenced successive generations of comedians, comedy writers, performers and filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/arts/jerry-lewis-critic-comedians-influence.html|title=For Jerry Lewis Few Statuettes But Lots of Influence|first=Neil|last=Genzlinger|date=August 20, 2017|publisher=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Lewis was often referenced as the bridge from [[Vaudeville]] to modern comedy, [[Carl Reiner]] wrote after Lewis' death, "All comedians watch other comedians, and every generation of comedians going back to those who watched Jerry on the ''Colgate Comedy Hour'' were influenced by Jerry. They say that mankind goes back to the first guy ... which everyone tries to copy.  In comedy that guy was Jerry Lewis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/carl-reiner-tribute-jerry-lewis-he-was-a-true-genius-1031722|title=Carl Reiner on 7 Decades of Laughter With Friend Jerry Lewis|first=Carl|last=Reiner|date=August 23, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box||align=right|width=25em|bgcolor=Cornsilk|quote=Jerry Lewis was the most profoundly creative comedian of his generation and arguably one of the two or three most influential comedians born anywhere in this century.|source= —''The King of Comedy'', 1996|first=Shawn|last=Levy|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]}}

Lewis "single-handedly created a style of humor that was half anarchy, half excruciation. Even comics who never took a pratfall in their careers owe something to the self-deprecation Jerry introduced into American show business." &lt;ref name="Mclellen"/&gt;  His self-deprecating humor can be found in [[Larry David]] or [[David Letterman]].

Lewis' comedy style was physically uninhibited, expressive, and potentially volatile. He was known especially for his distinctive voice, facial expressions, pratfalls, and physical stunts. His [[improvisation]]s and ad-libbing, especially in nightclubs and early television, were revolutionary among performers. It was "marked by a raw, edgy energy that would distinguish him within the comedy landscape." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/20/16176098/jerry-lewis-comedian-filmmaker-obituary|title=Jerry Lewis, Legendary Standup, Actor-Director, and comedy Misanthrope, is Dead at 91|first=Aja|last=Romano|date=August 20, 2017|publisher=vox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Will Sloan, of ''[[Flavorwire]]'' wrote, "In the late '40s and early '50s, nobody had ever seen a comedian as wild as Jerry Lewis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/563565/pure-unfiltered-id-reappraising-jerry-lewis-brutally-unfunny-comedy|title=Pure Unfiltered Id Reappraising Jerry Lewis|first=Will|last=Sloan|date=March 1, 2016|publisher=Flavorwire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placed in the context of the conservative era, his antics were radical and liberating, paving the way for future comedians [[Richard Pryor]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Andy Kaufman]], [[Paul Reubens]], and [[Jim Carrey]].

Acting the bumbling and stammering '[[everyman]]', Lewis used tightly choreographed, sophisticated sight gags, physical routines, verbal [[double-talk]] and [[malapropism]]s. "You cannot help but notice Lewis' incredible sense of control in regards to performing—they may have looked at times like the ravings of a madman but his best work had a genuine grace and finesse behind it that would put most comedic performers of any era to shame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/an-american-original-the-rogerebertcom-staff-remembers-jerry-lewis|first=Peter|last=Sobczynski|title=An American Original The RogerEbert.com Staff Remembers Jerry Lewis|date=August 22, 2017|publisher=rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are "choreographed as exactly as any ballet, each movement and gesture coming on natural beats and conforming to the overall rhythmic form which is headed to a spectacular finale: absolute catastrophe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2016/jerry-lewis/jerry-lewis-the-fool/|title=Deconstruction Jerry: Lewis as Director: Some Basic Characteristics of the Fool|first=Alan|last=Finney ed.|publisher=Melbourne Film Bulletin|date=April 1070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis' work, specifically his self-directed films, have warranted steady reappraisal. [[Richard Brody]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said, Lewis was "one of the most original, inventive, ... profound directors of the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/postscript-jerry-lewis|first=Richard|last=Brody|title=Postscript: Jerry Lewis|date=August 29, 2017|publisher=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "one of the most skilled and original comic performers, verbal and physical, ever to appear on screen." Film critic and film curator for the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Dave Kehr]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]''  of Lewis' "fierce creativity", "the extreme formal sophistication of his direction" and, Lewis was ". ... one of the great American filmmakers."

"Lewis was an explosive experimenter with a dazzling skill, and an audacious, innovatory flair for the technique of the cinema. He knew how to frame and present his own adrenaline-fuelled, instinctive physical comedy for the camera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/aug/20/jerry-lewis-a-knockabout-clown-with-a-dark-and-melancholy-inner-life|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=August 21, 2017|title=Jerry Lewis, a Knockabout Clown with a Dark and Melancholy Inner Life|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis was in the forefront in the transition to [[independent film]]making, which came to be known as [[New Hollywood]] in the late 1960s. Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2005, screenwriter [[David Weddle]] lauded Lewis' audacity in 1959 "daring to declare his independence from the [[studio system]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/27/magazine/tm-lewis09|title=Jerry Lewis Is a Brilliant Comic Artis, a Technically Innovative Filmmaker and an Enduring Creative Influence in Hollywood|first=David|last=Weddle|publisher=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis came along to a studio system in which the industry was regularly stratified between players and coaches.  The studios tightly controlled the process and they wanted their people directing. Yet Lewis regularly led, often flouting the power structure to do so. 
Control over material was smart business, and it was also good art. Neither the entrepreneur nor the auteur were common types among actors in mid-20th century Hollywood. But there Lewis was, at a time of strict studio control, doing both.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An appreciation: Jerry Lewis helped write the auteur's playbook|first=Steven| last=Zeitchikhttp|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-mn-jerry-lewis-legacy-20170820-story.html|date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No other comedic star, with the exceptions of [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton|Keaton]] in the  [[silent film|silent era]], dared to direct himself.  "Not only would Lewis' efforts as a director pave the way for the likes of [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Woody Allen]], but it would reveal him to be uncommonly skilled in that area as well." "Most screen comedies until that time were not especially cinematic—they tended to plop down the camera where it could best capture the action and that was it. Lewis, on the other hand, was interested in exploring the possibilities of the medium by utilizing the tools he had at his disposal in formally innovative and oftentimes hilarious ways." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/an-american-original-the-rogerebertcom-staff-remembers-jerry-lewis|title=An American Original RogerEbert.com Staff Remembers Jerry Lewis|first=Peter|last=Sobczynski|date=August 22, 2017|publisher=rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In Lewis' work the way the scene is photographed is an integral part of the joke. His purposeful selection of lenses, for example, expands and contracts space to generate laughs that aren't necessarily inherent in the material, and he often achieves his biggest effects via what he leaves off screen, not just visually but structurally." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americancinematheque.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-innovator-jerry-lewis-at-paramount.html|first=Jim|last=Hemphill|date=August 18, 2016|title=The Innovator: Jerry Lewis at Paramount|publisher=AmericanCinemateque}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a director, Lewis advanced the film comedy genre with innovations in the areas of fragmented narrative, experimental use of music and sound technology, and near [[surrealism|surrealist]] use of color and art direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2016/jerry-lewis/jerry-lewis-as-director/|title=Deconstructing Jerry, Lewis As A Director|first=Daniel|last=Fairfax|date=July 2016|publisher=Senses of Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/movies/jerry-lewis-dead-celebrated-comedian-and-filmmaker.html|title=Jerry Lewis, A Jester Both Silly and Stormy, Dies at 91|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=August 20, 2017|publisher=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/the-king-of-comedy-20081117|title=Wresting Order From Disorder in Jerry Lewis's Adventures In Multiplicity|first=Chris|last=Fujiwara|date=November 17, 2008|publisher=The Museum Of The Moving Image}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted his peer, filmmaker [[Jean Luc Godard]] to proclaim, "Jerry Lewis ... is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn't falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ... Lewis is the only one today who's making courageous films. He's been able to do it because of his personal genius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Hillier, ed.|title=Cahiers du Cinema 1960–1968 New Wave, New Cinema, Re-evalutating Hollywood (Godard in interview with Jacques Bontemps, Jean-Louis Comolli, Michel Delahaye, and Jean Narboni)|year=1987|page=295|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674090651}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jim Hemphill]] for ''[[American Cinematheque]]'' wrote, "They are films of ambitious visual and narrative experimentation, provocative and sometimes conflicted commentaries on masculinity in post-war America, and unsettling self-critiques and analyses of the performer's neuroses."

Intensely personal and original, Lewis' films were groundbreaking in their use of dark humor for psychological exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/563565/pure-unfiltered-id-reappraising-jerry-lewis-brutally-unfunny-comedy|title=Pure,Unfiltered Id: Reappraising Jerry Lewis' Brutally Unfunny Comedy|first=Will|last=Sloan|date=March 1, 2016|publisher=Flavorwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Justin Chang]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "The idea of comedians getting under the skin and tapping into their deepest, darkest selves is no longer especially novel, but it was far from a universally accepted notion when Lewis first took the spotlight. Few comedians before him had so brazenly turned arrested development into art, or held up such a warped fun house mirror to American identity in its loudest, ugliest, vulgarest excesses. Fewer still had advanced the still-radical notion that comedy doesn't always have to be funny, just fearless, in order to strike a nerve".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-jerry-lewis-appreciation-film-20170821-story.html|title=Jerry Lewis, The Movie's Mad and Mercerial Comic Genius|first=Justin|last=Chang|authorlink=Justin Chang|date=August 21, 2017|publisher=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre 1960, Hollywood comedies were [[screwball comedy film|screwball]] or [[farce]]. Lewis, from his earliest 'home movies, such as ''[[How to Smuggle a Hernia Across the Border]]'', made in his playhouse in the early 1950s, was one of the first to introduce [[satire]] as a full-length film. This "sharp eyed" satire continued in his mature work, commenting on the cult of celebrity, the machinery of 'fame', and "the dilemma of being true to oneself while also fitting into polite society." Stephen Dalton in ''The Hollywood Reporter'' wrote, Lewis had "an agreeably bitter streak, offering self-lacerating insights into celebrity culture which now look strikingly [[modernism|modern]]. Even [[postmodernity|post-modern]] in places." Speaking of ''The King of Comedy'', "More contemporary satirists like [[Garry Shandling]], [[Steve Coogan]] and [[Ricky Gervais]] owe at least some of their self-deconstructing chops to Lewis' generously unappetizing turn in Scorsese's cult classic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/critics-notebook-jerry-lewis-a-comic-genius-by-turns-sweet-bitter-1031194|first=Stephen|last=Dalton|title=Critics Notebook: Jerry Lewis a Comic Genius by Turns Sweet and Bitter|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis was an early master of  [[deconstruction]] to enhance comedy. From the first ''Comedy Hour''s he exposed the artifice of on stage performance by acknowledging the lens, sets, malfunctioning props, failed jokes, and tricks of production. As [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] wrote:  Lewis had "the impulse to deconstruct and even demolish the fictional "givens" of any particular sketch, including those that he might have dreamed up himself, a kind of perpetual auto-destruction that becomes an essential part of his filmmaking as he steadily gains more control over the writing and direction of his features."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2017/06/the-lewis-contradiction/|title=The Lewis Contradiction|first=Jonathan|last=Rosenbaum|date=October 2013|publisher=Viennale Catalogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; His self directed films abound in behind-the-scene reveals, demystifying movie-making. Daniel Fairfax writes in ''Deconstructing Jerry: Lewis as a Director'', "Lewis deconstructs the very functioning of the joke itself". ... quoting Chris Fujiwara, "''[[The Patsy (1964 film)|The Patsy]]'' is a film so radical that it makes comedy out of the situation of a comedian who isn't funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2016/jerry-lewis/jerry-lewis-as-director|title=Deconstrucing Jerry: Lewis as Director|first=Daniel|last=Fairfax|date=July 2016|publisher=sensesofcinema.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final scene of ''The Patsy'' is famous for revealing to the audience the movie as a movie, and Lewis as actor/director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/jerry-lewis-b-joseph-levitch-newark-new-jersey-1926-res-hollywood/|first=Michael|last=Stern|date=August 21, 2017|title=Jerry Lewis: b. Joseph Levitch, Newark New Jersey, res. Hollywood|publisher=brightlightsfilm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis wrote in ''The Total Filmmaker'', his belief in [[breaking the fourth wall]], actors looking directly into the camera, despite industry norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Total Filmmaker|first=Jerry|last=Lewis|year=1971|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780446669269|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; More contemporary  comedies such as ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', and ''[[The Office]]'' continue this method.

[[Robert DeNiro]] and [[Sandra Bernhard]] (both of whom starred with Lewis in ''The King of Comedy'') reflected on his death, Bernhard said, "It was one of the great experiences of my career, he was tough but one of a kind". De Niro said, "Jerry was a pioneer in comedy and film. And he was a friend. I was fortunate to have seen him a few times over the past couple of years. Even at 91, he didn't miss a beat ... or a punchline. You'll be missed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/08/20/jerry-lewis-dead-king-of-comedy|title=Jerry Lewis Dead, King of Comedy|publisher=EW.com|date=August 20, 2017 |accessdate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Chelsom]], director of ''Funny Bones'' wrote, "Working with him was a masterclass in comic acting – and in charm. From the outset he was generous." "There's a very thin line between a talent for being funny and being a great actor. Jerry Lewis epitomised that.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3934">In Turkic mythology, '''Konrul''' or '''Kongrul / Konqrul''' (''Koñrul'', Azerbaijani: ''Qonrul'') is a long-lived bird that is cyclically regenerated or reborn.

In [[Turkish people|Turkish]] folklore, Konrul refers to a supernatural bird, often glossed as, or identified with, the Greek [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] or Persian ''[[Simurgh|Simurg]]'' (in Turkish languages '''Semrük'''&lt;ref name="Juan"&gt;Juan Eduardo Cirlot, A Dictionary of Symbols, Courier Dover Publications, 2002, p.253&lt;/ref&gt;).

Konrul is depicted as a winged creature in the shape of a bird, gigantic enough to carry off an elephant. It appears as a peacock with the head of a dog and the claws of a lion; sometimes however also with a human face. It has an enmity towards snakes and its natural habitat is a place with plenty of water. Its feathers are said to be the colour of copper, and though it was originally described as being a Dog-Bird, later it was shown with either the head of a dog.

==Different aspects of other mythologies==
In [[Turkic mythology|Turkic culture]] Konrul has a twin and its name is '''Toghrul''' ([[Turul]]). In one of the folk tales, a hero rescues Konruls offspring by killing a snake that was crawling up the tree to feed upon them. As a reward, Konrul gives him three of her feathers which the hero can use to call her for help by burning them. Later the hero uses the feathers, and the Konrul carries him to a distant land. In the other tale, Konrul carries the hero out of the netherworld; here Konrul feeds its young with its teats.

===Turul and Kongrul===
Turul and Konrul are twin birds in Turkish mythology. They known also '''Buğdayık and Kumayık''' or '''Semrük and Kerkes''' and sometimes '''Züzülö and Öksökö'''. They roosted in Tree of Life, which stands in the middle of the world. The relationship between the Turul and Konrul is extremely close.

==Similarities with Anka==
'''Anka''' also spelled '''Ankha''', also known as '''Angha''' (Persian: عنقا), is a benevolent, mythical flying creature and common figure in Middle East cultures. The figure can be found in all periods of Greater Iranian art and literature, and is evident also in the iconography of medieval Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;P Donabedian and J. M. Thierry, ''Armenian Art'', New York, 1989, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; the Byzantine empire,&lt;ref&gt;Thierry, N. and M., ''Nouvelles églises rupestres de Cappadoce'', Paris, 1963, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; and other regions that were within the sphere of Persian cultural influence. The mythical bird is also found in the mythology of the Turkic peoples of Central Asia and is called ''Semrug, Semurg, Samran and Samruk''.&lt;ref name="Juan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Der Artikel in the Encyclopedia of Bashkortostan&lt;/ref&gt; Simurgh is shortened to "Sīmīr" in the Kurdish language.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Hanns-Peter Schmidt, Encyclopedia Iranica - "Simorgh".&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Azeri folklore===
Konrul also goes by the name of ''Zumrud'' (emerald). It was an ancient tale about Malik Mammad, the son of one of the wealthiest kings of Azerbaijan. That king had a big garden. In the center of this garden is a magical apple tree which yields apples every day. One ugly giant called Div decides to steal all the apples every night. The king sends Malik Mammad and his elder brothers fight the giant. In the middle of this tale Malik Mammad saves Zumrud's babies from a dragon. Zumrud takes pleasure of Malik Mammad and decides to help him. When Malik Mammad wants to pass from The Dark world into the Light world Zumrud asks him to provide 40 half carcasses of meat and 40 wineskin filled with water. When Zumrud puts water on its left wing and meat on its right wing Malik Mammad is able to enter the Light world.

The '''Man-Thing''' ('''Dr. Theodore "Ted" Sallis''')&lt;ref&gt;{{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|l|ɪ|s}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writers [[Stan Lee]], [[Roy Thomas]], and [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Gray Morrow]], the character first appeared in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #1 (May 1971), and went on to be featured in various titles and in his own series, including ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'', which introduced the character [[Howard the Duck]].

[[Steve Gerber]]'s 39-issue run on the series&lt;ref&gt;Gerber's run is continuous from ''Fear'' #11-19, and ''Man-Thing'' #1-22, as well as the concurrent ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1-5, and ''Monsters Unleashed'' #8-9, and these were followed quickly by a story in ''The Rampaging Hulk'' #7 for a total of 39 issues. In addition, Gerber also wrote Man-Thing as a guest-starring character into ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #1, ''Daredevil'' #113-114 and ''Iron Man Annual'' #3.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered to be a [[Cult following|cult classic]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Man-Thing is a large, slow-moving, [[empathy|empathic]], [[humanoid]] [[swamp monster]] living in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] near a [[Seminole]] [[Indian reservation|reservation]] and the fictitious town of [[Citrusville]] in Cypress County, Florida. [[Conan Stevens]] portrayed the character in the 2005 film ''[[Man-Thing (film)|Man-Thing]]''.

==Publication history==
As described in the text featurette "The Story Behind the Scenes" in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d May 1971), the black-and-white adventure fantasy magazine in which the character debuted in an 11-page origin story, Man-Thing was conceived in discussions between [[Marvel Comics]] editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer [[Roy Thomas]], and that together they created five possible origins. Lee provided the name, which had previously been used for unrelated creatures in Marvel's early science-fiction/fantasy anthology ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #7 (Jan. 1960) and #81 (Sept. 1966),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=15469 ''Tales of Suspense'' #7 (Jan. 1960)]: "I Fought the [[Molten Man-Thing]]!", writer unknown, at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronologyproject.com/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=4073&amp;sid=37aa7778a4232117321b5e4ac8a3eee3&amp;p=25609#p25609 |title=Marvel Chronology Project • View topic - Man-Thing I |publisher=Chronologyproject.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the concept of the man losing sentience.

As Thomas recalled in 2002:
{{blockquote|Stan Lee called me in; it would've been late '70 or early '71. [...] He had a couple of sentences or so for the concept — I think it was mainly the notion of a guy working on some experimental drug or something for the government, his being accosted by spies, and getting fused with the swamp so that he becomes this creature. The creature itself sounds a lot like the [[Heap (comics)|Heap]], but neither of us mentioned that character at the time.... I didn't care much for the name 'Man-Thing', because we already had the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] [of the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]]], and I thought it would be confusing to also have another one called Man-Thing.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Thomas interview, ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' #81 (October 2008), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas worked out a detailed plot&lt;ref&gt;The three-page, single-spaced plot for the 11-page story is reprinted in ''Alter Ego'' #81 (October 2008), pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;  and gave it to [[Gerry Conway]] to script. Thomas and Conway are credited as writers, with [[Gray Morrow]] as artist. A second story, written by [[Len Wein]] and drawn by [[Neal Adams]], was prepared at that time, but, upon ''Savage Tales''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; cancellation after that single issue,&lt;ref&gt;The magazine was later revived, beginning with issue #2 (Oct. 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; "took a year or two to see print", according to Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas interview, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; That occurred in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #12 (June 1972), in which the seven-page story was integrated in its entirety within the 21-page feature "[[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]", starring Marvel's jungle-lord hero. This black-and-white interlude (with yellow highlighting) segued to Man-Thing's introduction to color comics as Ka-Zar's antagonist-turned-ally in this and the following issue (both written by Thomas, with the first [[penciler|penciled]] by [[John Buscema]] and the second by Buscema and [[Rich Buckler]]).

The Wein-written Man-Thing story appeared in between Wein's first&lt;ref&gt;The character Alex Olsen, introduced in DC's ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'' #92 (July 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; and second&lt;ref&gt;The character Alec Holland, introduced in DC's ''Swamp Thing'' #1 (Nov. 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; version of his [[DC Comics]] character [[Swamp Thing]]. Wein was Conway's roommate at the time, and as Thomas recalled in 2008,

{{blockquote|Gerry and I thought that, unconsciously, the origin in ''Swamp Thing'' #1 was a bit too similar to the origin of Man-Thing a year-and-a-half earlier. There was vague talk at the time around Marvel of legal action, but it was never really pursued. I don't know if any letters even changed hands between Marvel and DC. [...] We weren't happy with the situation over the ''Swamp Thing'' #1 origin, but we figured it was an accident. Gerry was rooming with Len at the time and tried to talk him into changing the Swamp Thing's origin. Len didn't see the similarities, so he went ahead with what he was going to do. The two characters verged off after that origin, so it didn't make much difference, anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas interview, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Man-Thing received his own 10-page feature, again by Conway (with Morrow inking pencils by [[Howard Chaykin]]), in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #10 (Oct. 1972), sharing that anthological title with reprinted 1950s [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy]] stories. [[Steve Gerber]], who would become Man-Thing's signature writer, succeeded Conway the following issue, with art by Rich Buckler (Mayerik began with issue #13). The feature expanded to 15 pages with #12 (art by [[Jim Starlin]]), became 16 pages two issues later, and reached the then-standard 19-page length of Marvel [[superhero]] comics with issue #15, at which point the series also went from bi-monthly to monthly. In ''Fear''  #11 (Dec. 1972), page 11, Gerber created the series' narrative tagline, used in captions: "Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch!"
[[File:Man-Thing 1 (1974).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Man-Thing'' #1 (Jan. 1974). Cover art by [[Frank Brunner]].]]

After issue #19 (Dec.1973), Man-Thing received a solo title ''The Man-Thing'', which ran 22 issues (Jan. 1974 - Oct. 1975). Following Morrow, the main series' primary [[penciller]]s were, successively, [[Val Mayerik]], [[Mike Ploog]], John Buscema, and [[Jim Mooney]].

A sister publication was the larger, quarterly ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1-5 (August 1974 - August 1975), which featured 1950s horror-fantasy and 1960s [[science fiction]]/monster reprints as back-up stories, with a two-part [[Howard the Duck]] co-feature added in the final two issues. The unintentional [[double entendre]] in this sister series' title has become a recurring joke among comics readers.&lt;ref&gt;As Thomas, for one, recalled: "''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' later had a decidedly funny ring to it, but not ''Man-Thing'' in itself". (Thomas interview, p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final issue, writer Gerber appeared as a character in the story, claiming he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on. Gerber continued to write Man-Thing guest appearances in other Marvel titles, as well as the serialized, eight-page Man-Thing feature in the omnibus series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #1-12 (Sept. 1988 - Feb. 1989), and a supporting role in ''[[The Evolutionary War]]'', coming to the aid of [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Web of Spider-Man]] Annual'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; Gerber also wrote a graphic novel that [[Kevin Nowlan]] spent many years illustrating, but he did not live to see it published.&lt;ref name="lonely.geek.nz"&gt;[http://www.lonely.geek.nz/fording_the_mainstream/man-thing/infernal.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second ''Man-Thing'' series ran 11 issues (Nov. 1979 - Jan. 1981). Writer [[Michael Fleisher]] and penciller Mooney teamed for the first three issues, with the letters page of #3 noting that Fleisher's work had received a great deal of negative criticism and that he had been taken off the book. He was succeeded by, primarily, writer [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrators [[Don Perlin]] (breakdowns) and [[Bob Wiacek]] (finished pencils).  Claremont's stories introduced Man-Thing and [[Jennifer Kale]] to [[Doctor Strange]] (whose series he was concurrently writing), after which his material focused on two new supporting characters: John Daltry, Citrusville's new sheriff, and Bobbie Bannister, a formerly wealthy girl who is the only survivor when her parents' yacht is attacked.  These characters' stories he resolved by tying them to a resolution for his own ''[[War Is Hell (comics)|War Is Hell]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;''Man-Thing'' (vol. 2) #10-11, guest starring John Kowalski&lt;/ref&gt;

Black and white Man-Thing stories, and some color covers, also appeared in the Marvel magazine ''[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]'' as well.&lt;ref name="unleashed"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url= http://www.comicvine.com/monsters-unleashed-3-man-thing/4000-13808/ |title=Monsters Unleashed! #3 |work=[[Comic Vine]] |date= |accessdate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Jowett]] provided a Man-Thing story in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #164-168 (Early Oct.-Late Nov. 1994). The story was set soon after Sallis' transformation, yet depicted Sallis using a standard [[personal computer]] with up-to-date graphics rather than hard-copy files, an example of the [[floating timeline]] effect.

[[J.M. DeMatteis]] began writing the character in a backup story in ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 2) #9 (March 1981), which opened with a fill-in by Dickie McKenzie.&lt;!--He is credited as "Dickie" in the issue--&gt; DeMatteis would go on to write Man-Thing stories in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'', ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'', and the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''Daydreamers'', as well as ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 3) #1-8 (Dec. 1997 - July 1998), illustrated by [[Liam Sharp]]. The two would re-team for the Man-Thing feature in ''Strange Tales'' (vol. 4) #1-2 (Sept.-Oct. 1998). Four issues were written, but #3 and 4 were never published. Their stories were summarized briefly in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]] Annual '99'', also by DeMatteis, with art by Sharp and others.&lt;ref name=ebrandt&gt;[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/brandtellenmt.htm Ellen Brandt] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kadmon&gt;[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/spyrosad.htm K'Ad-Mon of the Fallen Stars] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/cleitoatlantismt.htm Cleito] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, Man-Thing has starred in a handful of stories appearing in [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and miniseries, including ''Marvel Knights Double Shot'' #2 (July 2002) by [[Ted McKeever]], and ''Legion of Monsters: Man-Thing'' #1 (May 2007) by [[Charlie Huston]] and [[Klaus Janson]].

In 2008, writer [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] retold Man-Thing's origin in ''[[Dead of Night (comics)|Dead of Night]] featuring the Man-Thing'' #1-4 (April–July 2008), from the [[Max (comics)|Marvel MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=12531 Aguirre-Sacasa talks "Dead of Night featuring Man-Thing"], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an eight-page story in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' (vol. 2) #12 (Oct. 2008), by writer Jai Nitz and artist Ben Stenbeck.

Man-Thing appeared regularly during [[The Punisher]]'s ''[[Franken-Castle]]'' story arc and became a regular member of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' with issue #144.  The series was retitled ''Dark Avengers'' with #175, and Man-Thing continued to appear as a regular character until issue #183. Steve Gerber's posthumous Man-Thing story ''The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man'', with art by [[Kevin Nowlan]], originally planned as a 1980s graphic novel before being left uncompleted by the artist,&lt;ref name=bigwait&gt;{{cite web | url = http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/09/the-next-big-wait-project-emerges-man-thing-by-gerber-and-nowlan/ | date = September 21, 2011 | first = Chris | last = Arrant | title = The Next Big-Wait Project Emerges: Man-Thing by Gerber and Nowlan | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | accessdate = February 14, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101035505/http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/09/the-next-big-wait-project-emerges-man-thing-by-gerber-and-nowlan/ | archivedate=January 1, 2012 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was revived in the 2010s and appeared as a three-issue miniseries cover-titled ''The Infernal Man-Thing'' (Early Sept.-Oct. 2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/66559/ ''Infernal Man-Thing''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; The story was a sequel to Gerber's "Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man" in ''Man-Thing'' #12 (Dec. 1974).&lt;ref name=bigwait /&gt;

Author [[R.L. Stine]] made his comics debut with a five-issue ''Man-Thing'' miniseries in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gene Gustines |first=George |date=December 9, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/books/rl-stine-to-write-man-thing-series-for-marvel.html?_r=0 |title=R.L.

==Fictional character biography==
Young [[biochemist]] '''Dr. Theodore "Ted" Sallis''', a native of [[Omaha, Nebraska]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe#The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol. II (Deluxe Edition)|The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe (Deluxe Edition)]]|story=Man-Thing| volume = 2| issue = #8| date = July 1986| publisher = Marvel|page=p. 15|artist=[[Bret Blevins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is working in the [[Everglades]] as part of Dr. Wilma Calvin's Project: Gladiator team, which includes Dr. [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Barbara Morse]] and her [[fiancé]] Dr. Paul Allen. A Dr. Wendell is later cited as being on the staff after Dr. Calvin is shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/calvin_wilma.htm Dr. Wilma Calvin] at the Appendix to the Marvel Universe&lt;/ref&gt; The group is attempting to recreate the super-soldier serum that had created [[Captain America]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}} ''Web of Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #6 revealed that Sallis at one point treated and worked alongside [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] shortly after Connors' arm was amputated, driving the research that would eventually transform Connors into the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].

Though warned that the technological terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.) has been operating in the area, Sallis breaches security by bringing with him his lover, [[Ellen Brandt]] (referred to here as "Miss Brandt", but later [[retcon]]ned to be his wife). He destroys his notes to his formula, which he has memorized. Later, he is ambushed and learns Brandt has betrayed him. Fleeing with the only sample of his serum, he injects himself with it in hopes of saving himself. However, he crashes his car into the swamp where chemical and, as ''Man-Thing'' #1 later explained, magical forces instantly transform him into a slow-moving plant-matter creature with large, solid red eyes,&lt;ref&gt;They were yellow in ''Fear'' #10-13, but red in the ''Astonishing Tales'' issues, and all subsequent issues from ''Fear'' #14.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to speak, and with dim memories, he attacks the ambushers and Brandt, burning and scarring part of her face with an acid he now secretes in the presence of violent emotions. The Man-Thing then wanders away into the swamp.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;''Savage Tales'' #1 (May 1971) / ''Astonishing Tales'' #12 (June 1972); Wein/Adams segment&lt;/ref&gt;

Sallis' mind was apparently extinguished, although on rare occasions he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form, as in ''Doctor Strange'' (vol. 2) #41 (June 1980) and ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual '99'',  and even to his human form, as in ''Adventure into Fear'' #13 (April 1973), ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #1 (Jan. 1974), ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #164 (Oct. 1994), and ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 3) #5 and #7-8 (April 1998, June–July 1998).

Under writer [[Steve Gerber]], the Man-Thing encounters the sorceress [[Jennifer Kale]], with whom he briefly shared a psychic link and who knew his true identity, in a story arc in ''Fear'' #11-13 — the final issue of which established that the swamp had mystical properties as the Nexus of All Realities. Through an interdimensional portal in ''Fear'' #19, he meets [[Howard the Duck]], who becomes stranded in this reality. Man-Thing became the guardian of the Nexus, and found himself facing demons, ghosts and time-traveling warriors, while continuing to encounter such non-supernatural antagonists as rapacious land developers, fascist vigilantes and common criminals. He formed a bond with young [[Radio personality|radio DJ]] [[Richard Rory]] and nurse Ruth Hart. Issue #12's "Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man", about an institutionalized writer named Brian Lazarus, spawned Gerber's posthumously published 2012 sequel, "The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man", in the three-issue miniseries ''The Infernal Man-Thing''.

In ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 2) #1-11 (Nov. 1979 - July 1981), writer [[Chris Claremont]] introduced himself as a character in the final issue, as Gerber had in the finale of the first series. Additionally, Claremont temporarily ''became'' the Man-Thing after being stabbed to death. His and other characters' deaths were later resolved with the intervention of the ''War Is Hell'' series lead, [[John Kowalski (comics)|John Kowalski]], now an aspect of Marvel Comics' manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. In ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 3) #1-8 (Dec. 1997 - July 1998), Ellen Brandt Sallis returns to the Citrusville area and encounters a little boy, Job Burke, who is actually the Sallis' son, who had been put up for adoption. Following this series, the story continued in ''Strange Tales'' (vol. 4) #1-2, and was projected to continue in the unpublished issues #3-4. Summaries based on DeMatteis' unillustrated scripts appear on the K'Ad-mon and Ellen Brandt pages in Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe.&lt;ref name=ebrandt /&gt;&lt;ref name=kadmon /&gt;

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, two [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents unsuccessfully attempt to  register the Man-Thing with the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents'' (vol. 2) #12&lt;/ref&gt; Man-Thing later appears as a member of the [[Legion of Monsters]] alongside [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]], [[Werewolf by Night]], [[Manphibian]], and [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher'' (vol. 8) #11&lt;/ref&gt; He later gains the ability to speak comprehensibly through the use of the "Universal Language".&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #144&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phil Coulson]] subsequently recruits Man-Thing for his incarnation of the [[Howling Commandos]].&lt;ref&gt;''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' (vol. 3) #6&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding, Man-Thing appears as a member of [[S.T.A.K.E.]]'s Howling Commandos.&lt;ref&gt;''Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2008}}
Man-Thing is a former scientist who was transformed into a creature composed of vegetable matter through the synergistic interaction of mystical energy and swamp mutagens. Though the beast now lacks a normal human intellect and has shed any desire to communicate with human society, it nevertheless often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] scenarios.

In the pages of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|The Thunderbolts]]'', [[Dr. Henry Pym]] has expressed the view that the Man-Thing is sentient, though difficult to communicate with.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #144,&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he once rescued an infant and left the child with a doctor (which would require an understanding of the function of a doctor and the ability to navigate to a specific address).&lt;ref&gt;As demonstrated in such issues as ''Fear'' #10, ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 2) #9, and ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]: The Return'' #1.&lt;/ref&gt; He is shown to understand concepts such as how to ring a doorbell,&lt;ref name="Fear #10"&gt;''Fear'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; how to put an arm in a sling,&lt;ref&gt;''Fear'' #12&lt;/ref&gt; and even how to flip an auto-destruct switch.&lt;ref name="Astonishing Tales #13"&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; The change in Man-Thing's intellect can partly be explained by fact that its brain, sensory organs, and central nervous system are now organized in a completely different fashion than a human's; for instance, Man-Thing's auditory receptors are in his forehead.&lt;ref name="Fear #17"&gt;''Fear'' #17&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of what level of humanity the creature still possesses, it can discern when a person's motivations are evil, which causes it pain and motivates it to lash out.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear'' #12; ''Man-Thing'' #1, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Man-Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers, described below, that are derived from the interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of Realities.

It is able to sense human emotions, and is enraged by fear and automatically secretes a poisonous chemical; anyone feeling fear and clutched by the Man-Thing is prone to be burned (either chemically or mystically), hence the series' tagline: "Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch!" Though fear is understandably most people's response to the creature, both for his monstrous appearance and the physical danger of his touch, typically only villains end up meeting an immolating death at its hands.  Many survive being burned, notably Ellen Brandt,&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Tales'' #1, ''Monsters Unleashed'' #5, ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 3) #1-8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt "Nightcrawler" Wagner]]&lt;ref&gt;''Nightcrawler'' (vol. 3) #10&lt;/ref&gt; (whom he does not even scar),&lt;ref name="Nightcrawler vol. 3 #12"&gt;''Nightcrawler'' (vol. 3) #12&lt;/ref&gt; and Mongu, whose hand he permanently attaches to his axe,&lt;ref name="Fear #14"&gt;''Fear'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; either due to intervention or dissipation. Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the "brain" cells located throughout his body. These unique forces render the Man-Thing extremely sensitive to emotions. Emotions that are mild and generally considered positive arouse curiosity and the Man-Thing will sometimes observe from a distance. However, emotions that are often viewed as negative, such as violent emotions like anger, hatred and fear, cause the Man-Thing great discomfort and might provoke him to attack. Once provoked into violent actions, his body secretes highly concentrated acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds. Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand this potent acid. While the Man-Thing is devoid of violent emotions, his body produces a type of foamy, soapy mucus that neutralizes the acid.

Although Man-Thing's superhuman strength, speed, intelligence, durability, immortality, give the monster powers it is his spiritual ability that makes him immune to any other disease, it has been established that the creature possesses physical stamina beyond the limitations of any human athlete. Initially, the Man-Thing is only slightly stronger than Captain America,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} but in later appearances, the Man-Thing possesses sufficient superhuman strength to stand toe-to-toe with much stronger villains.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He is able to lift a 2,000 pound automobile when sufficiently moved to do so.&lt;ref name="Man-Thing #1"&gt;''Man-Thing'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Man-Thing's body is practically invulnerable to harm. Because his body is not entirely solid, but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp, fists, bullets, knives, energy blasts, etc. will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body. Even if a vast portion of the Man-Thing's body were to be ripped away or incinerated, he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation. [[Devil-Slayer]] once sliced him nearly in half,&lt;ref&gt;''Man-Thing'' vol. 3, #4&lt;/ref&gt; and he has survived being incinerated by a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]],&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes Reborn: The Return'' #1 / ''Marvel Team-Up'' (vol. 2) #4&lt;/ref&gt; although his healing from the latter has been the longest and most complex in his lifetime.&lt;ref name=mtu4&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' (vol. 2) #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the construction of his body, the Man-Thing is able to ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass through. The smaller the opening, the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side. This ability&lt;ref&gt;First demonstrated in ''Astonishing Tales'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; can be defeated mystically.&lt;ref name="Fear #14"/&gt;

The Man-Thing was once dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival; his body would slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or would be greatly damaged if exposed to clean water. His exposure to the Citrusville waste treatment plant&lt;ref&gt;''Man-Thing'' #17 (May 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; greatly enhanced his ability to leave the swamp, as he became a self-contained ecosystem, feeding off of his own waste products.&lt;ref&gt;''Man-Thing'' #19&lt;/ref&gt; He generally leaves the swamp of his own accord only if he senses a mystical disturbance. Man-Thing has also demonstrated himself susceptible to possession by other entities.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #98; ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 3) #4; Strange Tales (vol. 4) #1-2; ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual '99''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Man-Thing lacks a normal human intellect, in his life as Ted Sallis, he possessed a Ph.D. in biochemistry.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Sallis is legally dead, but his identity is known to numerous living people, including Wilma Calvin, Ellen Brandt, Stephen Strange, [[Molecule Man|Owen Reece]], [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], [[Thog|Thog the Nether-Spawn]], Jennifer Kale, and anyone they may have told or written to about it. His identity as Man-Thing could not be considered secret, but his existence is generally believed to be a hoax, and an obscure one at that.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mtu4 /&gt; [[In-universe]], knowledge of his existence is rarely tied to the experiments of Sallis, as are speculations as to any human identity he may have had. Despite having appeared in Citrusville many times, many there still believe him to be a rumor.&lt;ref&gt;''Shadows &amp; Light'' #2; ''Man-Thing'' (vol. 3) #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other known Man-Things==
There were other known Man-Things in the comics besides Ted Sallis:

* In the pages of ''[[Savage Wolverine]]'' as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a different Man-Thing appeared where it resided on a mysterious island somewhere in the [[Savage Land]]. [[Amadeus Cho]] confirmed that this Man-Thing is not Ted Sallis as it has been rooted on the island for a long time. The [[Neanderthal]]s on the island used the blood of this Man-Thing to resurrect [[Shanna the She-Devil]].&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Wolverine'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a bunch of Man-Things reside on the [[Battleworld]] domain of [[Weirdworld]] where they are found in the Forest of the Man-Things. The Man-Things encounter [[Arkon]] and [[Skull the Slayer]] after they fell into their area.&lt;ref&gt;''Weirdworld'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; The Man-Things are ruled over by the Swamp Queen of the Man-Things (a variation of [[Jennifer Kale]]) who is behind the rebellion against the Witch Queen [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]].&lt;ref&gt;''Weirdworld'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)#Warzones|Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars]]'' revealed the existence of She-Man-Thing, a character that fought on [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s team in a bonus round of the [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]].&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] had created a spawn of Man-Thing as [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] has its abilities enhanced with the DNA of [[Groot]]. When [[Weapon H|Clayton]] is in the [[Redwood National and State Parks|Redwood National Forest]], Dario orders Dr. Baines to unleash the spawn. Roxxon's Man-Thing attacks Clayton who transforms into Weapon H. Eventually, Weapon H sets off Man-Thing's immolation ability enough to start a forest fire. When in the presence of Sonia Sung and Dr. Ella Stirling, Weapon H used his power clap to defeat Roxxon's Man-Thing enough to put out the forest fire. This same Man-Thing was held in a cage with the Brood-infected human Blake in a Roxxon facility as they are freed by Weapon H.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon H'' #3-5. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; When it was revealed that Roxxon had opened a portal to Weirdworld, Man-Thing took his leave as Blake claims that he'll find a pond to settle in. When the Skrullduggers emerge from the portal and start attacking the nearby humans, Man-Thing and Blake assist Weapon H in fighting them until it was discovered that the Skrullduggers are shapeshifters.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon H'' #6. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; After Man-Thing secures the defeated Skrullduggers, he is later sent with Blake to keep more Skrullduggers from emerging from the portal. When Weapon H and Dario later check up on them, it was discovered that they had some help in defeating the Skrullduggers from [[Korg (comics)|Korg]].&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon H'' #7. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; When Man-Thing agreed to help in fighting the Skrullduggers, Blake asked him if he had a human form which Man-Thing doesn't respond to. As Weapon H leads the mission to Weirdworld, they are attacked by a tribe of blue-skinned humanoids called the Inaku who blame them for breaking the Earth and allowing the Skrullduggers to take their queen.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon H'' #8. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After Weapon H got free and Titania knocked Protector Hara into the protective dome enough to damage it, Man-Thing helps to fortify it as Korg and Titania are assigned to help Man-Thing protect the Inaku village.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon H'' #9. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a Man-Thing that lives in Mbali, [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;''Champions'' Vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic book spin-offs==
Dr. Barbara "Bobbi" Morse was introduced in the second Man-Thing story by Len Wein/Neal Adams, although because of publication delays, she was introduced in ''Astonishing Tales'' #6, with the Wein/Adams story presented as flashback. Morse became the costumed hero [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #95 and went on to become a prominent member of [[Avengers West Coast]], eventually sacrificing her life to save her husband, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint "Hawkeye" Barton]], from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers West Coast'' #100.&lt;/ref&gt;  Until recently, her spirit fought alongside Daimon Hellstrom to eliminate demons from his Hell;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] Annual '00''; ''Hellcat'' (2000) miniseries #1-3&lt;/ref&gt; however, she has appeared alive during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' crossover event.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}  At the end of ''Secret Invasion'', Mockingbird was revealed to be alive and had been one of the early captures of the Skrulls.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}  Morse has joined the New Avengers and has had adventures alongside Hawkeye.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

[[Jennifer Kale]] debuted in ''Fear'' #11, which was the first story Steve Gerber wrote for Marvel after his initial tryout. She went on to appear in two team books, ''[[The Legion of Night]]'', created and written by Gerber and partially composed of several other Gerber-created supporting cast members such as Martin Gold and Dr. Katherine Reynolds, and Bronwyn Carlton and Bryan Walsh's ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' in which she teamed with [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]] and [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] under the tutelage of Doctor Strange.

Gerber introduced [[Howard the Duck]] in a Man-Thing story in ''Adventure into Fear'' #19. Howard, who was displaced from a planet of [[anthropomorphics]] in another dimension via the swamp's Nexus of All Realities, later acquired his own series, which was written by Gerber for the first 27 issues.

The [[Foolkiller]], a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone he considered foolish, was introduced in issue #3 of this series, bent on slaying [[disc jockey]] [[Richard Rory]], introduced in the previous issue. When Rory served time for trumped-up kidnapping charges, he accidentally created another Foolkiller when he revealed too much detail about the previous incarnation and the whereabouts of his gear. This Foolkiller became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. Both Rory and this second Foolkiller, along with nurse Ruth Hart (who appeared in ''Man-Thing'' # 2-7) were supporting characters in Gerber's ''[[Omega the Unknown]]'', while [[David Anthony Kraft]] made Rory a potential [[love interest]] for [[She-Hulk]]. A third version of the character, who was in [[Internet]] communication with the second, starred in Gerber's 1990 ''Foolkiller'' miniseries. A second series by Greg Hurwitz, featuring a fourth Foolkiller, appeared in 2008.

==Other versions==

===''The Adventures of the X-Men''===
In ''[[X-Men (TV series)#Spin-offs|The Adventures of the X-Men]]'', which is based on the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated series]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Jean Grey]] are inadvertently teleported to Man-Thing's swamp from the [[Mojoverse]]. The three battle [[D'Spayre]], who appears as a fake preacher trying to lead people up a suicide tower that is drawing energy out of the Nexus of All Realities. D'Spayre, working for the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]], is burned by Man-Thing when he fears failure. After their defeat of D'Spayre, Jean makes a psychic link with Man-Thing (which she had done earlier to learn his origin) and is imparted information that she believes is the most important thing in the world. Jean is forced to become the Phoenix once more, using the information obtained from Man-Thing, destroys the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], and in doing so, ends the universe. However, one survivor is sent into the universe to come, [[Galactus]], thereby implying that the animation continuity takes place eons before the mainstream Marvel continuity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Men (TV series)#Spin-offs|The Adventures of the X-Men]]'' #11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mutant X''===
The ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' comic book series depicts a Marvel Universe in which characters' counterparts are vastly different. In the ''Mutant X Annual '99'' (1999), [[Doctor Strange]], the sorcerer supreme of Earth, reveals himself to be the Man-Thing.&lt;ref&gt;''Mutant X Annual '99''&lt;/ref&gt; He returns in ''Mutant X Annual '01'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;''Mutant X Annual '01''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mutant X'' #32 (June 2001).&lt;ref&gt;''Mutant X'' #32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth-691===
''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' (vol. 2) #38 tells the story of what happened when [[Killraven]] stumbled across the Miami Museum of Cultural Development and became caught up in the projected dreams of an astronaut from the "Mars launch in 1999." During the hallucination, Killraven encountered distorted versions of numerous Marvel characters. Rather ambiguously, the awakened astronaut later described the figures as "all the heroes from my youth" but he also often referred to them as "myths". The only Marvel character that is definitely "real" in the projected nightmare is the Man-Thing who appears as part of an actual memory of an encounter that the astronaut had with the creature in the Florida Everglades.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===''Marvel Super Hero Squad''===
Man-Thing appears in issue #10 of ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad (comics)|Marvel Super Hero Squad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Super Hero Squad'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe''===
Man-Thing appears in the last issue and appears to be standing guard over all creation.  It ultimately accepts [[Deadpool]]'s plan and kills the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Deadpool#Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe|Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe]]'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ultimate Marvel''===
Ultimate Man-Thing, in the alternate-universe ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], is similar to his traditional counterpart in mainstream continuity. In his first appearance, he teamed with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up|Ultimate Marvel Team Up]]'' [[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up#Issue|#10]], unwittingly saving the superhero from the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #7, during a flashback that transformed [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and his colleagues into the [[Fantastic Four]], the Man-Thing is shown for a moment.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

===''What If''===
The second story in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-reality]] [[anthology]] ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #26 (April 1981) asked, "What if the Man-Thing had Regained Ted Sallis' Brain?" Written by [[Steven Grant]], with art by [[penciller]] [[Herb Trimpe]] and [[inker]] [[Bob Wiacek]]. In the story, an alligator Dr. Oheimer was working on became the new Man-Thing while Sallis self-immolated at his own fear while fighting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=What If|volume=1|issue=#26|date=April 1981|writer=Steven Grant| penciller =Herb Trimpe|inker=Bob Wiacek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' (vol. 2) #11 (March 1990) featured the [[Fantastic Four]] in four scenarios written and penciled by [[Jim Valentino]], showing what might have happened if the team-members had all had the same powers as one another. In "What if the Fantastic Four had All Become Monsters Like the Thing?", [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]]'s appearance was that of the Man-Thing. In this form she had lost all but her very basic intelligence and could no longer speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=What If|volume=2|issue=#11|date=March 1990|writer=Jim Valentino| penciller =Jim Valentino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5303">'''Means-ends analysis'''&lt;ref&gt;Simon, H. A. (1981). ''The sciences of the artificial.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''MEA''') is a problem solving technique used commonly in [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) for limiting search in AI  programs.

It is also a technique used at least since the 1950s as a creativity tool, most frequently mentioned in engineering books on design methods. MEA is also related to means-ends chain approach used commonly in consumer behavior analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kaciak, E and Cullen, C.W. (2006). ''[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/palgrave.jt.5750028.pdf Analysis of means-end chain data in marketing research].'' Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis for Marketing 15, 12 – 20.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a way to clarify one's thoughts when embarking on a [[mathematical proof]].

== Problem-solving as search  ==
An important aspect of intelligent behavior as studied in AI is ''goal-based'' problem solving, a framework in which the solution to a problem can be described by finding a sequence of ''actions'' that lead to a desirable goal.  A goal-seeking system is supposed to be connected to its outside environment by sensory channels through which it receives information about the environment and motor channels through which it acts on the environment.  (The term "afferent" is used to describe "inward" sensory flows, and "efferent" is used to describe "outward" motor commands.) In addition, the system has some means of storing in a ''memory'' information about the ''state'' of the environment (afferent information) and information about actions (efferent information).  Ability to attain goals depends on building up associations, simple or complex, between particular changes in states and particular actions that will bring these changes about.  Search is the process of discovery and assembly of sequences of actions that will lead from a given state to a desired state. While this strategy may be appropriate for machine learning and problem solving, it is not always suggested for humans (e.g. [[cognitive load]] theory and its implications).

== How means-ends analysis works  ==
The MEA technique is a strategy to control search in problem-solving.  Given a current state and a goal state, an action is chosen which will reduce the ''difference'' between the two.  The action is performed on the current state to produce a new state, and the process is recursively applied to this new state and the goal state.

Note that, in order for MEA to be effective, the goal-seeking system must have a means of associating to any kind of detectable difference those actions that are relevant to reducing that difference.  It must also have means for detecting the progress it is making (the changes in the differences between the actual and the desired state), as some attempted sequences of actions may fail and, hence, some alternate sequences may be tried.

When knowledge is available concerning the importance of differences, the most important difference is selected first to further improve the average performance of MEA over other brute-force search strategies. However, even without the ordering of differences according to importance, MEA improves over other search heuristics (again in the average case) by focusing the problem solving on the actual differences between the current state and that of the goal.

== Some AI systems using MEA ==
The MEA technique as a problem-solving strategy was first introduced in 1961 by [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] in their computer problem-solving program [[General Problem Solver]] (GPS).&lt;ref&gt;Newell, A., &amp; Simon, H. A. (1959). ''The simulation of human thought.'' Santa Monica, Calif: Rand Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newell, A., &amp; Simon, H. A. (1961). ''GPS, a program that simulates human thought.'' Santa Monica, Calif: Rand Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;  In that implementation, the correspondence between differences and actions, also called ''operators'', is provided a priori as knowledge in the system. (In GPS this knowledge was in the form of ''table of connections''.)

When the action and side-effects of applying an operator are penetrable{{clarify|date=September 2013}} the search may select the relevant operators by inspection of the operators and do without a table of connections.  This latter case, of which the canonical example is [[STRIPS]], an [[automated planning]] computer program, allows task-independent correlation of differences to the operators which reduce them.

Prodigy, a problem solver developed in a larger learning-assisted automated planning project started at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] by Jaime Carbonell, Steven Minton and Craig Knoblock, is another system that used MEA.

Professor Morten Lind, at [[Technical University of Denmark]] has developed a tool called multilevel flow modeling (MFM). It performs means-end based diagnostic reasoning for industrial control and automation systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4898">''' Melias'''  ({{lang-el|Μελίας}}; died 973 or 974) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] general of [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin, active in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars|wars against the Arabs]] in the east under [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] and [[John I Tzimiskes]]. He was defeated before [[Amid]] in 973 by the [[Hamdanids]] and died in captivity shortly after.

== Life ==
Melias was a relative and namesake of [[Melias]] (Armenian: Mleh), an Armenian who entered Byzantine service in the early 900s under [[Leo VI the Wise]], founded the border province of [[Lykandos]], and played a major role in Byzantium's wars with its Arab neighbours until the 930s.{{sfn|Kazhdan|Cutler|1991|p=1334}}{{sfn|Whittow|1996|pp=315–316, 356}} Melias is mentioned in the sources only during the early reign of [[John I Tzimiskes]] (reigned 969–976), but is depicted on horseback along with Tzimiskes in the so-called "Pigeon House" church (cf. [[Churches of Göreme]]) at Çavuşin in [[Cappadocia]], which was built and painted during the reign of Tzimiskes' predecessor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] (r. 963–969) to commemorate him and his family. Melias' and Tzimiskes' presence is probably connected with their participation in Nikephoros II's conquest of [[Cilicia]] in 965.{{sfn|Baun|2007|pp=164–165, 225–226}}{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Melias (#25042)}} Although Melias is identified as a ''[[magistros]]'' in the "Pigeon House", this is a later emendation over the original inscription; he probably gained the rank of ''magistros'' at or after Tzimiskes' accession.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Melias (#25042)}} 

Melias is mentioned in the sources as a participant in the expeditions against the Arabs in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] in 972–973. The first expedition, in autumn and winter of 972, was led by Tzimiskes in person and resulted in the capture of [[Nisibis]] and [[Mayyafariqin]] (Greek: Martyropolis), forcing the local Arab ruler, the [[Hamdanid]] emir [[Abu Taghlib]], to agree to pay an annual tribute in exchange for the Byzantines' withdrawal.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Melias (#25042)}} Tzimiskes then withdrew from the area, but left Melias in his stead as [[Domestic of the Schools]] of the East (commander-in-chief of the eastern field army). Melias then advanced against [[Amid]] with an army numbering, according to the Arab sources, 50,000 men. The commander of the local garrison, Hezarmerd, called upon Abu Taghlib for aid, and the latter sent his brother, Hibatallah, who arrived before the city on 4 July 973. On the next day, a battle was fought before the walls of Amid in which the Byzantines were defeated. Melias and a group of other Byzantine generals were captured on the next day and brought captive to Abu Taghlib.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Melias (#25042)}} 

Melias died soon after in captivity, but the sources disagree on the date and cause. The 11th-century historian [[Yahya of Antioch]] and [[Stephen of Taron]] record that he remained captive at Abu Taghlib's court until his death in February/March 974. The 13th-century Persian historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] on the other hand states that Melias died soon after the battle before Amid of his wounds. [[Ibn al-Athir]] and others record that he died in the year 363 [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] (October 973 – September 974) of an illness, although Abu Taghlib had sent doctors to help him, while the less reliable accounts of [[Matthew of Edessa]] and [[Bar Hebraeus]] claim that he was brought to [[Baghdad]], where he died from an [[ulcer]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Melias (#25042)}}

{{nihilism}}
'''Metaphysical nihilism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory that there ''might'' have been no objects at all—that is, that there is a [[possible world]] in which there are no objects at all; or at least that there might have been no ''concrete'' objects at all, so that even if every possible world contains some objects, there is at least one that contains only [[abstract object]]s.{{fact|date=March 2012}}

To understand metaphysical nihilism, one can look to the subtraction theory in its simplest form, proposed by Thomas Baldwin.  

#There could have been finitely many things.
#For each thing, that thing might not have existed.
#The removal of one thing does not necessitate the introduction of another.
#Therefore, there could have been no things at all. 

The idea is that there is a possible world with finitely many things. One can thus get another possible world by taking a single thing away, and one does not need to add any other thing as its replacement. Then one can take another thing away, and another, until one is left with a possible world that is empty.

Against the possible strength of this intuitive argument, some philosophers argue that there are necessarily some concrete objects. It is a consequence of [[David Kellogg Lewis]]'s concrete modal realism that it is impossible that no concrete objects exist; for since worlds are concrete, there is at least one concrete object—the world itself—at each world. E. J. Lowe has likewise argued that there are necessarily some concrete objects. His argument runs as follows: Necessarily, there are some abstract objects, such as numbers. The only possible abstract objects are sets or universals, but both of these depend on the existence of concrete objects (for sets, their members; for universals, the things that instantiate them). Therefore, there are necessarily some concrete objects.

[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|300px|The initial stages of [[human embryogenesis]]]]
[[File:Human embryo 8 weeks 2.JPG|thumb|300px|Parts of a human embryo]]

'''Ontogeny''' (also '''ontogenesis''' or '''[[morphogenesis]]''') is the origination and development of an [[organism]], usually from the time of [[fertilization]] of the [[ovum|egg]] to the organism's mature form—although the term can be used to refer to the study of the entirety of an organism's lifespan.

Ontogeny is the developmental history of an organism within its own lifetime, as distinct from [[phylogeny]], which refers to the [[evolution]]ary history of a species. In practice, writers on evolution often speak of species as "developing" traits or characteristics. This can be misleading. While developmental (i.e., ontogenetic) processes can influence subsequent evolutionary (e.g., phylogenetic) processes&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, S.J.]] (1977). ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[evolutionary developmental biology]]), individual organisms develop (ontogeny), while species evolve (phylogeny).

Ontogeny, embryology and developmental biology are closely related studies and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.  The term ontogeny has also been used in [[cell biology]] to describe the development of various [[cell types]] within an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thiery|first=Jean Paul|title=Epithelial–mesenchymal transitions in development and pathologies|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|date=1 December 2003|volume=15|issue=6|pages=740–746|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2003.10.006|pmid=14644200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontogeny is a useful field of study in many disciplines, including [[developmental biology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]], and [[developmental psychobiology]].

Ontogeny is also a concept used in [[anthropology]] as "the process through which each of us embodies the history of our own making".&lt;ref name="Toren, Christina 2002"&gt;Toren, Christina. "Comparison and ontogeny." Anthropology, by comparison (2002): 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''ontogeny'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wiktionary:ὤν|ὄν]]&lt;!--[sic] (neuter), not ὤν (masculine)--&gt;, ''on'' ([[Genitive|gen.]] ὄντος, ''ontos''), i.e. "being; that which is", which is the [[Present tense|present]] [[participle]] of the [[verb]] [[wiktionary:εἰμί|εἰμί]], ''eimi'', i.e. "to be, I am", and from the suffix ''-geny'' from the Greek -γένεια -''geneia'', which expresses the concept of "mode of production".&lt;ref&gt;See ''-geny'' in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition, 1989; online version March 2011, accessed 9 May 2011. Earlier version first published in ''New English Dictionary'', 1898.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and nurture==
A seminal paper named ontogeny as one of the [[Tinbergen's four questions|four primary questions]] of biology, along with [[Julian Huxley|Huxley's]] three others: causation, survival value and evolution.&lt;ref name=Tinbergen/&gt;  [[Niko Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] emphasized that the change of behavioral ''machinery'' during development was distinct from the change in behavior during development. "We can conclude that the thrush itself, i.e. its behavioral machinery, has changed only if the behavior change occurred while the environment was held constant...When we turn from description to causal analysis, and ask in what way the observed change in behavior machinery has been brought about, the natural first step is to try and distinguish between environmental influences and those within the animal...In ontogeny the conclusion that a certain change is internally controlled (is "innate") is reached by ''elimination''. " (p. 424) Tinbergen was concerned that the elimination of environmental factors is difficult to establish, and the use of the word "innate" is often misleading.

==Ontogenetic allometry==

Most organisms undergo [[allometry|allometric]] changes in [[shape]] as they grow and [[Developmental biology|mature]], while others engage in [[metamorphosis]].  Even "reptiles" (non-avian sauropsids, e.g., [[crocodilians]], [[turtles]], [[snakes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pough | first1 = F. H. | year = 1978 | title = Ontogenetic changes in endurance in water snakes (''Natrix sipedon''): Physiological correlates and ecological consequences | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1978 | issue = | pages = 69–75 | doi=10.2307/1443823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[lizards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garland Jr | first1 = T. | authorlink = Theodore Garland, Jr. | year = 1985 | title = Ontogenetic and individual variation in size, shape and speed in the Australian [[agamid]] lizard ''Amphibolurus nuchalis'' | url = | journal = Journal of Zoology | volume = 207 | issue = | pages = 425–439 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1985.tb04941.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in which the offspring are often viewed as miniature adults, show a variety of ontogenetic changes in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garland Jr. | first1 = T. | authorlink = Theodore Garland, Jr. | last2 = Else | first2 = P. L. | year = 1987 | title = Seasonal, sexual, and individual variation in endurance and activity metabolism in lizards | url = | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

==Anthropological application==

Comparing ourselves to others is something humans do all the time. "In doing so we are acknowledging not so much our sameness to others
or our difference, but rather the commonality that resides in our difference. In other words, because each one of us is at once remarkably similar to, and remarkably different from, all other humans, it makes little sense to think of comparison in terms of a list of absolute similarities and a list of absolute differences. Rather, in respect of all other humans, we find similarities in the ways we are different from one another and differences in the ways we are the same. That we are able to do this is a function of the genuinely historical process that is human ontogeny".&lt;ref name="Toren, Christina 2002"/&gt;

'''Otto Gold''' (18 May 1909 – 7 April 1977) was a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[figure skater]] and coach.

Gold, who competed in men's singles, won the silver medal at the [[1930 European Figure Skating Championships]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Hines2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=James R.

He began coaching in 1932. He coached [[Sonia Henie]] at the [[1935 World Figure Skating Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mary Rose Not Yet At Peak: Otto Gold,  Her Instructor, Sees Improvement|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/39328491/?terms=Otto%2BGold|accessdate=24 July 2017|work=The Winnipeg Tribune|date=2 February 1942|page=15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, he moved to [[Ontario]], Canada, where he began a four-decade coaching career at the [[Minto Skating Club]]. He was one of the first coaches of 1948 Olympic champion [[Barbara Ann Scott]], and also worked in Vancouver, Connecticut and Lake Placid. He has been recognised for raising the level of figure skating in North America.&lt;ref name="hof"&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 Canadian Figure Skating Hall of Fame Induction|url=https://skatecanada.ca/1990-canadian-figure-skating-hall-of-fame-induction/|publisher=Skate Canada|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1977, Gold died in a Toronto hospital from injuries caused by a fire at his apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Otto Gold dies in fire|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/49989677/?terms=Otto%2BGold|accessdate=24 July 2017|work=The Ottawa Journal|date=9 April 1977|page=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter, Frances Gold Lynn, was a figure skater who placed fourth at the [[1962 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] and later became a coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baran|first1=Nancy|title=Interest in Figure Skating Sparked by Olympic Star|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/60252327/?terms=Otto%2BGold|accessdate=24 July 2017|work=The Bridgeport Post|date=8 May 1977|page=101|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[Skate Canada Hall of Fame|Canadian Figure Skating Hall of Fame]] in its inaugural class of 1990.&lt;ref name="hof"/&gt;

The '''pallid sturgeon''' (''Scaphirhynchus albus'') is an [[endangered species]] of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], [[Endemism|endemic]] to the waters of the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and lower [[Mississippi River|Mississippi river]] basins of the United States.

Named for its pale coloration, it is closely related to the relatively common [[shovelnose sturgeon]] (''Scaphirhynchus platorynchus''), but is much larger, averaging between {{convert|30|and|60|in|cm}} in length and {{convert|85|lb}} in weight at maturity.&lt;ref name="montana"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pallid Sturgeon - Scaphirhynchus albus |publisher=Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks |url=http://fwp.mt.gov/wildthings/tande/pallid.html |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107171623/http://fwp.mt.gov/wildthings/tande/pallid.html |archivedate=2008-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Platte"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus)| publisher = Platte River Endangered Species Partnership| url = http://www.platteriver.org/backgr/sturg.htm| accessdate =2008-11-19|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930003925/http://www.platteriver.org/backgr/sturg.htm |archivedate = 2007-09-30|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species takes 15&amp;nbsp;years to mature and spawns infrequently, but can live up to a century. A member of the sturgeon family, [[Sturgeon|Acipenseridae]], which originated during the [[Cretaceous period]] 70&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the pallid sturgeon has changed little since then.&lt;ref name="dinosaur"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Pallid Sturgeon, a Missouri River "Dinosaur"| work = Feature Series, Vol I, No. 4| publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| url = http://www.r6.fws.gov/feature/sturgeon.html| accessdate = 2008-11-19| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081119020600/http://www.r6.fws.gov/feature/sturgeon.html| archivedate = 2008-11-19| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] &lt;!-- (USFWS) --&gt; placed the pallid sturgeon on its endangered species list because few young individuals had been observed in the preceding decade and sightings had greatly diminished;&lt;ref name="endangered"&gt;{{cite web| title = Operation and Maintenance of the Upper Mississippi River 9-Foot Channel| work = Endangered Species Program| publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| date = November 18, 2008| url = http://www.fws.gov/midwest/Endangered/section7/pallid.html| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the species is now rarely seen in the wild. It was the first fish species in the Missouri River drainage area to be listed as endangered, and a loss of its habitat is thought to be responsible for its decline. The vast majority of the Missouri River drainage system has been [[River engineering|channeled and dammed]], reducing the gravel deposits and slow-moving side channels that are its favored [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] areas. Until the middle of the 20th century, pallid sturgeon were common and anglers found catching such a large fish in [[fresh water]] a rewarding experience. The species is considered to be good-tasting, and its eggs have been used as [[caviar]], although less commonly than those of many other sturgeon.&lt;ref name="NRCS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Threatened and Endangered Species: Pallid Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus Fact Sheet |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |date=November 16, 2005 |url=http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126220804/http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html |archivedate=November 26, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to prevent the species from becoming extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen [[Fish hatchery|hatcheries]] and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is to survive in the wild.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==

Taxonomists [[Stephen Alfred Forbes|S. A. Forbes]] and R. E. Richardson classified the pallid sturgeon in 1905, grouping it in the [[genus]] ''Parascaphirhynchus'' and the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Acipenseridae]], which includes all [[sturgeon]] worldwide. Its closest relatives are the shovelnose sturgeon (''Scaphirhynchus platorynchus''), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered [[Alabama sturgeon]] (''Scaphirhynchus suttkusi''), which may soon become [[Extinction|extinct]].&lt;ref name="AlabamaIUCN"&gt;{{IUCN2008| title=''Scaphirhynchus suttkusi'' | assessor=Parauka, F. M. |year=2004 | id=19942 | downloaded = December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlabamaSEFC"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Desperate Dozen: Fishes on the Brink | publisher = Southeastern Fishes Council | date = November 2008 | url = http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/organizations/sfc/DesDoz_report.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three species belong to the subfamily [[Scaphirhynchinae]], which has only one other genus, ''[[Pseudoscaphirhynchus]]'', represented by three species found in west-central [[Asia]].

The word pallid means "deficient in color",&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{cite web| title = Pallid| work = | publisher = Merriam-Webster| year = 2008| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pallid| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compared to other species of sturgeon, the pallid is noticeably paler.&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pallid Sturgeon |work=Animal Field Guide |publisher=Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks |url=http://fwp.mt.gov/fieldguide/detail_AFCAA02010.aspx |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108123929/http://fwp.mt.gov/fieldguide/detail_AFCAA02010.aspx |archivedate=2008-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific name for the fish is derived from ''Scaphirhynchus'', a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "spade snout" and ''albus'' which is [[Latin]] for "white".&lt;ref name="Riis"&gt;{{cite web| last = Riis| first = Jim| title = Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) | publisher = South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks| year = 1993| url = http://www.northern.edu/natsource/ENDANG1/Pallid1.htm| accessdate = 2008-11-19|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080206135111/http://www.northern.edu/natsource/ENDANG1/Pallid1.htm |archivedate = 2008-02-06|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biology ==

=== DNA studies ===
To better protect the pallid sturgeon from extinction,  research on its [[DNA]] and that of other closely related species was conducted to assess the differences within various populations of pallid sturgeon, and the differences between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. Early DNA research indicated that pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon were a single species.&lt;ref name="Tranah1"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tranah| first = G. J.|author2=D. E. Campton |author3=B. May  | title = Genetic Evidence for Hybridization of Pallid and Shovelnose Sturgeon | journal = Journal of Heredity| volume = 95| issue = 6| pages = 474–480| publisher = The American Genetic Association| year = 2004| url = http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/6/474| doi = 10.1093/jhered/esh077| accessdate = 2008-12-14| pmid = 15475392}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2000 study comparing DNA sequences in the three members of the genus ''Scaphirhynchus''(pallid, shovelnose, and Alabama sturgeon) showed that the three are distinct species.&lt;ref name="Campton"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Campton| first = Donald E.| author2 = Anna L. Bass |author3=Frank A. Chapman |author4=Brian W. Bowen| title = Genetic distinction of pallid, shovelnose, and Alabama sturgeon: emerging species and the US Endangered Species Act| journal = Conservation Genetics| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 17–32| publisher = Springer Netherlands| location = | date = March 2000| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/w76485t849537674/| doi = 10.1023/A:1010121417487| accessdate = 2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2001 and 2006, several studies examined two populations of pallid sturgeon located in the upper [[Great Plains]] section of the Missouri River and compared them to a southern population located in the [[Atchafalaya River]] in [[Louisiana]]. These DNA studies concluded that the northern populations of pallid sturgeon are [[Reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]] and are genetically distinct from the Atchafalaya population. However, the genetic variability among pallid sturgeon was found to be far less than that between them and the shovelnose sturgeon.&lt;ref name="Tranah2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tranah |first=G.

Another reason for DNA testing was to determine the rates of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids.&lt;ref name="Billings"/&gt; Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon.&lt;ref name="Tranah2"/&gt; Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the [[Endangered Species Act]] to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another.&lt;ref name="Campton"/&gt; It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear to be the result of pallid sturgeon [[egg (biology)|eggs]] being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.&lt;ref name="Tranah1"/&gt;

=== Physical characteristics ===
[[File:Pallid Sturgeon head detail.JPG|thumb|right|Detail and measurement of head of a hatchery-raised pallid sturgeon]]
The pallid sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in North America. They are generally between {{convert|30|and|60|in|cm}} in length and weigh as much as {{convert|85|lb}}.&lt;ref name="montana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Platte"/&gt; The species is ancient and has remained virtually unchanged for 70&amp;nbsp;million years, since the [[Cretaceous]] period. The pallid sturgeon has a distinctive appearance that has been referred to as "primitive", "dinosaur-like" and even "ugly".&lt;ref name="dinosaur"/&gt; Although visually similar, the shovelnose sturgeon is much smaller and usually weighs no more than {{convert|5|lb}}. Pallid sturgeon are much paler in coloration with grayish white backs and sides, while shovelnose sturgeon are brown.&lt;ref name="NRCS"/&gt; Pallid sturgeon turn whiter as they age and younger specimens are easily confused with adult shovelnose sturgeon since they are similar in color.&lt;ref name="Missouri"&gt;{{cite web|title=Endangered Sturgeon Struggle for Survival |work=The Sturgeon of Missouri Missouri's Aquatic Dinosaurs |publisher=Conservation Commission of Missouri |year=2008 |url=http://mdc.mo.gov/fish/sport/sturgeon/info/ |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203150314/http://www.mdc.mo.gov/fish/sport/sturgeon/info/ |archivedate=2008-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the shovelnose sturgeon, their tails are [[heterocercal]], with the top tail fin being longer than the bottom fin, though this is more pronounced in pallid sturgeon.&lt;ref name="Johnsgard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnsgard|first=Paul A.|title=The Nature of Nebraska| publisher = Bison Books| date = April 1, 2005|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|pages=169–170|isbn=978-0-8032-7621-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other sturgeon, pallid sturgeon lack the [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] or bones found in more "modern" species of fish. Instead, they have [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] skeletons with five rows of thick cartilage plates that extend along their sides, undersides, and backs, as well as over most of the head. These thick cartilage plates are covered by the skin and serve as a protective armor.&lt;ref name="Johnsgard"/&gt;  The bony cartilage also extends along the backside, from the [[dorsal fin]] to the tail.&lt;ref name="Riis"/&gt;

The pallid sturgeon's snout and head are longer than that of the shovelnose sturgeon.&lt;ref name="Missouri"/&gt; In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their extendable mouths to suck up small fish, [[mollusk]]s, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four [[Barbel (anatomy)|barbels]] which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources.&lt;ref name="Johnsgard"/&gt; On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length.&lt;ref name="NRCS"/&gt; The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels is one of the best ways to distinguish the two species.&lt;ref name="Missouri"/&gt;

=== Reproduction and lifecycle ===

For several decades, no natural reproduction of pallid sturgeon was observed, since all the fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Burton"/&gt; In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the [[Missouri National Recreational River]] area located downstream from [[Gavins Point Dam]] on the Missouri River.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web| title = Sturgeon Research Update: Confirmed Pallid Sturgeon Spawning in the Missouri River in 2007| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey|date=July 2007| url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2007/3053/pdf/FS2007-3053.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate =2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==

=== Distribution ===
The pallid sturgeon's historical [[range (biology)|range]] spanned the entire Missouri River and into the Mississippi River.  Historically, the species was rare to nonexistent in the upper Mississippi, probably due to a lack of proper habitat.  Currently, the species is considered imperiled throughout its entire range.&lt;ref name="Louisiana"&gt;{{cite web| title = Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus)| publisher = Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries| url = http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fact_sheet_animal/32189-Scaphirhynchus%20albus/scaphirhynchus_albus.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate = 2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2008, pallid sturgeon can still be found throughout their original range, but their population numbers have severely declined from the mid-20th century. The Missouri and Mississippi rivers from [[Montana]] to Louisiana, as well as the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, continue to harbor an aging population of pallid sturgeon.&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt; Pallid sturgeon have never been very common;  as early as 1905 when the species was first identified, they represented only one in five of all sturgeon in the lower Missouri River and as few as one in 500 where the [[Illinois River]] meets the Mississippi.&lt;ref name="Grady"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grady |first=Joanne |author2=Jim Milligan |title=Pallid and Shovelnose Sturgeon in the Lower Missouri and Middle Mississippi Rivers |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=February 2001 |url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/columbiafisheries/documents/MICRA_sturgeon_report.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225123625/http://www.fws.gov/midwest/columbiafisheries/documents/MICRA_sturgeon_report.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1985 and 2000, the ratio of pallid sturgeon to all sturgeon netted declined from one in about 400 to one in nearly 650. A 1996 study concluded that between 6,000 and 21,000 pallid sturgeon remained in their natural habitat at that time.&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Krentz, S.

[[File:Pallid sturgeon activity with syphoning.webmhd.webm|thumb|right|Pallid sturgeon (''Scaphirhynchus albus'') showing siphoning feeding behaviour]]
Six areas were studied for wild pallid sturgeon population estimates and recovery recommendations by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) between 1990, when the species was declared endangered, and 2006. The USFWS has referred to these six areas of wild population studies as "recovery priority management areas" (RPMAs). In the northernmost region of the study, known as RPMA 1, located between the [[Marias River]] in Montana and the western reaches of Fort Peck Reservoir, only 45 wild (nonhatchery) individuals remain. Of these, no juveniles were observed and the population was declining. In RPMA 2, located between Fort Peck Dam, the headwaters of [[Lake Sakakawea]], and the lower [[Yellowstone River]] up to the confluence of the [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]], Montana, only 136 wild specimens remain. In RPMA 3, stretching from upstream of the [[Niobrara River]] to [[Lewis and Clark Lake]] along the Missouri River, no native populations were recorded. All collected specimens appeared to be hatchery-raised. However, these specimens were apparently maturing and adjusting well to this section of the river. Recovery priority management area 4 extends from Gavins Point Dam to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This region also includes the Platte River. Here, at least 100 unique nonhatchery specimens were collected during the study period. Evidence also indicates some wild reproduction is going on in this region. In RPMA 5, between the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], several hundred specimens were documented. Again, some evidence suggests natural reproduction is occurring, as demonstrated by the recovery of a few examples of immature, nonhatchery-raised individuals. The Atchafalaya River basin is designated as RPMA 6 and the findings there were similar to those in RPMAs 4 and 5, but with greater numbers of unique individuals, near 500 in total.&lt;ref name="Billings"/&gt;

=== Habitat ===
Pallid sturgeon prefer moderate to swift river currents and most captured specimens have been recovered in rivers and streams in which the current averages between {{convert|0.33|and|2.9|ft/s|m/s}}. They also prefer [[Turbidity|turbid]] waterways and water depths between {{convert|3|and|25|ft}}. The species is more commonly found where sandy substrates are plentiful, but also lives in predominately rocky waterways. Pallid sturgeon prefer swift river currents more often than do shovelnose sturgeon.&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt;

In a study based in Montana and North Dakota conducted on both the pallid and shovelnose sturgeon, both species were fitted with radio transmitters so researchers could track their swimming habits. Pallid sturgeon were found to prefer wider river channels, midchannel sandbars, and numerous islands, and were most commonly recorded in water depths between {{convert|2|and|47|ft}}. The study also showed that the pallid sturgeon moved as much as {{convert|13|mi}} per day and up to {{convert|5.7|mi/h|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="Bramblett"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Bramblett| first = Robert|author2=Robert White| title = Habitat Use and Movements of Pallid and Shovelnose Sturgeon in the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers in Montana and North Dakota| journal = Transactions of the American Fisheries Society | volume = 130| issue = 6| pages = 1006–1025| publisher = American Fisheries Society| location = Bethesda, Maryland| year = 2001| doi = 10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130&lt;1006:HUAMOP&gt;2.0.CO;2| issn = 1548-8659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pallid sturgeon are believed to have preferred the muddy and generally warmer waters that existed prior to Missouri River dam construction.&lt;ref name="McKean"/&gt;

=== Food preferences ===
Pallid sturgeon are generally [[bottom feeder]]s, skimming the sandy reaches of the various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though little is known about the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders.&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt; One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic.&lt;ref name="Wanner"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Wanner | first = Greg|author2=D. A. Shuman |author3=D. W.

Though never believed to be common, pallid sturgeon populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990.&lt;ref name="NRCS"/&gt; The [[U.S. government]] and most of the states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species.&lt;ref name="montana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wildhaber"&gt;{{cite web| last = Wildhaber| first = Mark L.|author2=Aaron J.

All captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the [[roe]] from females was used as [[caviar]].&lt;ref name="Guide"/&gt;

The route and the environmental characteristics of Missouri River in the northern [[Great Plains]] states of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana have been significantly altered. The resultant changes to the Missouri River in the upper Great Plains from channelization and impoundment prevent upstream migration. The reduced water flow rates and sediment loads have brought an end to the seasonal flooding of the flood plains in the region. Since the construction of the [[Fort Peck Dam]] in Montana in 1937, and subsequent damming and channelization, the Missouri River has lost over 90% of its wetland and sandbar ecosystems. More than {{convert|2000|mi|abbr=on}} of the Missouri River have been altered and only that stretch of the river above Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana remains relatively unchanged.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;{{cite web|last=Power |first=Greg |title=The Missouri River System's "Other" Fish |publisher=U.

In the 13 U.S. states where the pallid sturgeon is found, only a few other fish species are listed as endangered.&lt;ref name="Tess"&gt;{{cite web|title=How many species are listed in each state (based on published population data)? |work=Threatened &amp; Endangered Species System |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |year=2008 |url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/StateListing.do?state=all |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207200043/http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/StateListing.do?state=all |archivedate=2006-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although substantial efforts are being implemented to ensure the survival of this species, the rarity of self-sustaining populations of pallid sturgeon ensures that it will remain federally protected for many decades.

=== Species preservation efforts ===
Two populations of pallid sturgeon in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both at risk of extinction, and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018.&lt;ref name="montana"/&gt; Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15&amp;nbsp;years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]] has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the [[Tiber Dam]] every four to five&amp;nbsp;years to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done in an effort to restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.&lt;ref name="montana2"&gt;{{cite web| title = Pallid Sturgeon — Scaphirhynchus albus| publisher = State of Montana| url = http://fieldguide.mt.gov/detail_AFCAA02010.aspx| accessdate =2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Radio transmitter implant in pallid sturgeon.jpg|right|thumb|Surgical implant of a radio transmitter in a sexually mature pallid sturgeon]]
In Nebraska, a small number of pallid sturgeon have been captured along the lower reaches of the [[Platte River]]. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte, between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from hatcheries, have been captured from the Platte River.&lt;ref name="Platte2"&gt;{{cite book| author = Committee on Endangered and Threatened Species in the Platte River Basin| title = Endangered and Threatened Species of the Platte River| publisher = The National Academies Press| year = 2004| location = Washington, D. C.| pages = 225–239| url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10978&amp;page=225| isbn = 978-0-309-09230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with [[Tracking animal migration|radio transmitters]] which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer. By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River.

The lower reaches of the Platte River, a more than {{convert|30|mi|adj=on}} stretch from the [[Elkhorn River]] to its confluence with the Missouri River, has suitable spawning habitat for pallid sturgeon, although no conclusive evidence has been found that spawning is occurring in this region.&lt;ref name="Platte2"/&gt; Along with the lower Yellowstone River, the lower Platte River was identified as one of the best of the remaining regions with the potential for the natural spawning.&lt;ref name="Billings"/&gt;

In Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms section of the [[Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge]], wild pallid sturgeon larvae were collected in 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50&amp;nbsp;years. The recovery was made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning.&lt;ref name="Ikenson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ikenson| first = Ben | title = Biologists struggle to keep the pallid sturgeon from going extinct | work = Reviving the Missouri River's dinosaur| publisher = ESPN| date = May 31, 2006| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/general/columns/story?columnist=guest_columnist&amp;page=c_col_Ikenson_sturgeon_pallid| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The side channel was apparently being used by the larva pallid sturgeon for protection from the swifter currents of the Missouri River.&lt;ref name="Mississippi"&gt;{{cite web| title = Pallid Sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus| publisher = Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association| url = http://wwwaux.cerc.cr.usgs.gov/MICRA/PALLIDST.HTM| accessdate = 2008-11-19| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081007185220/http://wwwaux.cerc.cr.usgs.gov/micra/PALLIDST.HTM| archivedate = 2008-10-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the USFWS concluded that hatchery-based reproduction efforts should be continued, along with monitoring of any population changes, to determine the effectiveness of human intervention. The 2007 findings also emphasized the need to determine the most likely areas of spawning, to identify any parasite or disease that may be impacting the reproductive capabilities of pallid sturgeon, and to examine engineering possibilities that may permit recreation of suitable habitats without reducing the USFWS's ability to protect people from harmful and destructive flooding, and to maintain its ability to provide adequate water impoundment for irrigation and recreation purposes.&lt;ref name="Billings"/&gt;

Her brief career was cut short when she died from [[postpartum]] [[embolism]] at the age of 31. She is becoming recognized as the first female painter to paint nude self-portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/10/paula-modersohn-becker-modern-paintings-missing-piece.html#slide_ss_0=8|first= John |last=Colapinto |title=Paula Modersohn-Becker: Modern Painting (Missing Piece) |publisher= ''[[The New Yorker]]''|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an important member of the artistic movement of [[modernism]] at the start of the twentieth century.

==Biography==
[[Image:Friedrichstr46.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friedrichstadt (Dresden)|Dresden-Friedrichstadt]]: After Paula's birth, the Becker family moved into a house in "Friedrichstraße 29" (today "Friedrichstraße 46")]]
[[Image:Bremen-PaulaBeckerHaus.jpg|thumb|[[Bremen]]: Becker's parental home 1888–1899]]
Becker was born and grew up in [[Friedrichstadt (Dresden)|Dresden-Friedrichstadt]]. She was the third of seven children in her family. Her father Carl Woldemar Becker (January 31, 1841 [[Odessa]] – November 30,  1901, Bremen), the son of a Russian university professor of French, was employed as an engineer with the [[Union of German Railway Administrations|German railway]]. Her mother, Mathilde (November 3,  1852 [[Lübeck]] –  January 22, 1926 Bremen) was from an aristocratic family "von Bültzingslöwen", and her parents provided their children a cultured and intellectual household environment.

[[Image:Clara Rilke-Westhoff.jpg|thumb|[[Clara Westhoff|''Clara Rilke Westhoff'']], Paula Modersohn-Becker, 1905]]
In 1888 the family moved from Dresden to [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. While visiting a maternal aunt in [[London]], Becker received her first instruction in drawing at [[St John's Wood Art School]]. In 1893 she was introduced to works of the artists' circle of [[Worpswede]]; [[Otto Modersohn]], [[Fritz Mackensen]], [[Fritz Overbeck]] and [[Heinrich Vogeler]] presented their paintings in Bremen's Art Museum, [[Kunsthalle Bremen]]. In addition to her teacher training in Bremen in 1893–1895, Becker received private instruction in painting. In 1896 she participated in a course for painting and drawing sponsored by the Verein der Berliner Künstlerinnen (Union of Berlin Female Artists) which offered art studies to women.

Becker's friend [[Clara Westhoff]] left Bremen in early 1899 to study in Paris. By December of that year, Becker followed her there, and in 1900 she studied at the [[Académie Colarossi]] in the [[Quartier Latin|Latin Quarter]].

In April 1900 the great [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Centennial Exhibition]] was held in Paris. On this occasion Fritz Overbeck and his wife, along with [[Otto Modersohn]], arrived in June. Modersohn's ailing wife Helen had been left in Worpswede and died during his trip to Paris. With this news Modersohn and the Overbecks rushed back to Germany.

[[Image:Otto Modersohn schlafend.jpg|thumb|250px|''Otto Modersohn Sleeping'', Paula Modersohn-Becker, 1906]]
In 1901 Paula married Otto Modersohn and became stepmother to Otto's two-year-old daughter, Elsbeth Modersohn, the child from his first marriage. She functioned in that capacity for two years, then relocated to Paris again in 1903. She and Modersohn lived mostly apart from that time forward until 1907, when she returned to Germany full-time, apparently in hopes of conceiving her own child.

The marriage with Modersohn remained unconsummated until their final year together.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} By 1906, Becker (now known as Paula Modersohn-Becker) had reversed her previous desire to avoid having children and began an affair with a well-known Parisian "ladies' man". However, by early 1907 she returned to her husband, became pregnant, and in November she delivered a daughter, Mathilde.

After the pregnancy, she complained of severe leg pain, so the physician ordered bed rest. After 18 days he told her to get up and begin moving, but apparently, an [[embolism]] had formed in her leg, and with her mobility, broke off and then caused her death within hours.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Career==
[[Image:Paula Modersohn-Becker 028.jpg|thumb|''Reclining Mother and Child'']]
In 1898, at age 22, Becker immersed herself in the artistic community of Worpswede, where artists such as [[Fritz Mackensen]] (1866–1953) and [[Heinrich Vogeler]] (1872–1942) had retreated to protest against the domination of the art [[academy]] style and life in the big city. She studied under Mackensen, painting the nearby farmers, and the northern German landscape. At this time she began close friendships with the sculptor [[Clara Westhoff]] (1875–1954) and the poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] (1875–1926).

Until the years when Becker began the practice, women painters had not widely used nude females as subjects for their work. The only notable exceptions to this dearth are works by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], three centuries earlier; for example, art historians assume that Gentileschi used her own body as the model for her work ''[[Susannah and the Elders]]''. Her work on the female nude is unconventional and expresses an ambivalence to both her subject matter and the method of its representation.&lt;ref&gt;see Burns, ''Looking as Women: The Paintings of Suzanne Valadon, Paula Modersohn-Becker and Frida Kahlo''&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker was trained in the methods of [[Realism (art movement)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]], along with a recognizable [[Modernism (art)|simplicity of form]]. She was able to achieve a distinct texture to her work by scratching into the wet paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museen-boettcherstrasse.de/english/|title=English » Museen Böttcherstraße|website=www.museen-boettcherstrasse.de|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later abandoned those techniques to move into [[Fauvism]]. She is becoming recognized as having influenced at least one of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso's]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Radiograph probings of Picasso's portrait of [[Gertrude Stein]] show that he reworked the head several times, finally posturing it exactly as Modersohn-Becker had done in her portrait of Lee Hoelger (see Radycki, ''Paula Modersohn-Becker: The First Modern Woman Artist'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trips to Paris==
[[Image:Paula Modersohn-Becker 016.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'', Paula Modersohn-Becker (1906)]]
Until 1907 Modersohn-Becker made another six extended trips to Paris for artistic purposes, sometimes living separately from her husband, Otto. During one of her stays in Paris she took courses at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. She visited contemporary exhibitions often, and was particularly intrigued with the work of [[Paul Cézanne]]. Other [[Post-Impressionism|post impressionists]] were especially influential, including [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Gauguin]]. [[Fauvism]] influences also appear in her works such as ''Poorhouse Woman with a Glass Bottle''. The influence of French painter [[Jean-François Millet]] is noted in such pieces as her 1900 ''Peat Cutters''.

During her last trip to Paris in 1906, she produced a series of paintings about which she felt very great excitement and satisfaction. During this period of painting, she produced her initial nude self-portraits, unprecedented for female artists, as well as portraits of her friends, including Rainer Maria Rilke and Werner Sombart. Art historians concur that this period was the strongest and most compelling time of her art production.

==Final year and death==
[[Image:Gc-paula.jpg|thumb|Paula with Mathilde, November 1907 (days before Paula's death)]]
In 1907 Paula Modersohn-Becker returned to her husband in Worpswede, despite period correspondence that indicated her desire for independence. She wrote in detail about her love for her husband but also of her need to delay motherhood in her pursuit of artistic freedom. She continued to express ambivalence regarding motherhood as she was concerned about her ability to paint while raising a child; her diary entries indicate that she had planned on achieving a painting career by age thirty, then having children. So, when her daughter Mathilde (Tillie) Modersohn was born on November 2, 1907, Paula and Otto were joyous. The joy became tragedy nineteen days later, when Paula suddenly died. She had complained of pain in her legs after the delivery, and was advised to remain in bed. When the physician returned on 21 November, he advised her to rise. She walked a few steps, then sat down, called for the infant to be placed in her arms, complained of leg pain, and died, saying only "What a pity." She was buried in the [[Zion's Church (Worpswede)#The churchyard|Worpswede Cemetery]] where her grave is preserved. [[File:Modersohn Grave.JPG|thumb|Monument on the grave of Paula Modersohn-Becker in Worpswede cemetery, by sculptor [[Bernhard Hoetger]] (1907)]]

==Painting technique==
Modersohn-Becker employed the same technique throughout her short career as a painter.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmeister-zur Nedden, Angelica, Zur Maltechnik von Paula Modersohn-Becker (On the painting technique of Paula Modersohn-Becker), Zeitschrift für Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung Jahrgang 11 (1997), Heft 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;286–300.&lt;/ref&gt; She worked in [[tempera]] and [[Oil painting|oil]] with a limited [[Color scheme|range of pigments]] such as [[zinc white]], [[cadmium yellow]], [[viridian]], and synthetic [[ultramarine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/modersohn-portrait-old-woman/ Paula Modersohn-Becker, Portrait of an Old Lady in the Garden], ColourLex.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
By 1899 [[Clara Westhoff]] had made a bust of her friend Becker, saying that it was a symbol of their friendship and shared passion for art.

In 1908 [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] wrote the renowned poem "Requiem for a Friend" in memory of Paula Modersohn-Becker.

The art and architecture of the [[Paula Modersohn-Becker Museum]] was denounced by local Nazis in 1935&lt;ref&gt;Das Schwarze Korps; 24/10/1935; pages 11,34&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Ludwig Roselius]] ignored this until Hitler denounced the Böttcherstrase in September 1936 and Roselius contemplated suicide&lt;ref&gt;Leidig, Ludwig. Bombshell. sbpra 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-62516-346-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Barbara Götte intervened on his behalf with Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Roselius: Ein Nachruf von Barbara Götte, Bremisches Jahrbuch, 1951, www.brema.suub.uni-bremen.de/periodical/pageview/62875 viewed on 26/3/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathilde Modersohn (1907–1998) founded the Paula Modersohn-Becker Foundation (Paula Modersohn-Becker-Stiftung) in 1978.

In 1988 a stamp with the portrait of Paula Modersohn-Becker was issued in the series [[Women in German history]] by the German post-office authority [[Deutsche Bundespost]].

Paula Modersohn-Becker was not widely known at the time of her untimely death, and would have dropped into obscurity but for her voluminous writing. She maintained a diary, and corresponded regularly with friends in her artistic circle. Her letters were collected and widely published (in German) during the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;The collected letters were published by noted publisher [[Kurt Wolff (publisher)|Kurt Wolff]], who had also published [[Franz Kafka]].&lt;/ref&gt; and it was largely through them that her legacy was maintained. In the 1970s, US art historian Diane Radycki first translated them into English (they have also been translated by others since then). Two-thirds of the correspondence occurred from age 16 to the early years of her marriage, and are full of youthful optimism and energy.

On the 8th of February 2018 Becker's birthday was celebrated in a [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.au/webhp?hl=en&amp;ictx=2&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg94Kk_pXZAhWFq5QKHaAMBUYQPQgD|title=Google|website=www.google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paula Becker House===
Modersohn-Becker's house in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], where she spent much of her life, opened in October 2007 as a private [[art museum]] and [[Art museum|gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haus-paula-becker.de/html/kunstkabinett_.html|title=Kunstkabinett website|publisher=Haus-paula-becker.de|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family moved from Dresden to Bremen in 1888 and lived in this house. Becker lived here until 1899, when she was 23 years old, and set up her first studio in this house. There was an active artist community in Bremen and via Becker's mother's friendships in the art world, Paula grew to be part of the community. Apart from her teacher training in Bremen in 1893–1895, Paula took private instruction in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senatspressestelle.bremen.de/detail.php?id=11826|title=Eine Straße für Paula Modersohn-Becker!|date=5 February 2001|publisher=Bremen. Verwaltung online|language=German|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not well known that the young Becker had lived here for ten years; in 2003 Heinz and Betty Thies bought the then run-down house, and had it restored in time for the [[centennial|100th anniversary]] of the artist's death. At that time (November 2007) it was turned into a public museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/region/norddeutschland/article883015/Wo-Paula-ihre-Kindheit-verbrachte.html|title=Where Paula spent her childhood (German)|publisher=Abendblatt.de|date=9 October 2007|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piaget's theory of cognitive development''' is a comprehensive theory about the nature and development of human [[intelligence]]. It was first created by the Swiss [[developmental psychologist]] [[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980). The theory deals with the [[epistemology|nature of knowledge]] itself and how humans gradually come to acquire, construct, and use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileyse/cognitive_development/0|title=Cognitive Development - Encyclopedia of Special Education: A Reference for the Education of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Disabilities and Other Exceptional Individuals - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piaget's theory is mainly known as a [[Developmental stage theories|developmental stage theory]].

To Piaget, [[cognitive development]] was a progressive reorganization of mental processes resulting from biological maturation and environmental experience. He believed that children construct an understanding of the world around them, experience discrepancies between what they already know and what they discover in their environment, then adjust their ideas accordingly.&lt;ref name=McLeod&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=S. A.|title=Piaget {{!}} Cognitive Theory|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html|publisher=Simply Psychology|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Piaget claimed that cognitive development is at the center of the human organism, and language is contingent on knowledge and understanding acquired through cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/edinburghthinkl/jean_piaget/0|title=JEAN PIAGET - Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piaget's earlier work received the greatest attention.

Child-centered classrooms and "[[open education]]" are direct applications of Piaget's views.&lt;ref&gt;Great Lives from History: The Twentieth Century; September 2008, p1–3&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its huge success, Piaget's theory has some limitations that Piaget recognized himself: for example, the theory supports sharp stages rather than continuous development ([[horizontal and vertical décalage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300160&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=b6bd1ae3a4e93016b772396b5848a349|title=Concrete Operational Period|first=Karen E.|last=Singer-Freeman|date=30 November 2005|publisher=|journal=Encyclopedia of Human Development|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of intelligence: operative and figurative==
Piaget noted that [[reality]] is a dynamic system of continuous change. Reality is defined in reference to the two conditions that define dynamic systems. Specifically, he argued that reality involves transformations and states.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1977). The role of action in the development of thinking. In Knowledge and development (pp. 17–42). Springer US.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Transformations''' refer to all manners of changes that a thing or person can undergo. '''States''' refer to the conditions or the appearances in which things or persons can be found between transformations. For example, there might be changes in shape or form (for instance, liquids are reshaped as they are transferred from one vessel to another, and similarly humans change in their characteristics as they grow older), in size (a toddler does not walk and run without falling, but after 7 yrs of age, the child's sensory motor anatomy is well developed and now acquires skill faster), or in placement or location in space and time (e.g., various objects or persons might be found at one place at one time and at a different place at another time). Thus, Piaget argued, if human [[intelligence]] is to be adaptive, it must have functions to represent both the transformational and the static aspects of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX1562500095&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=15311e6ee67b398da4f1a1967f58503d|title=Constructivism|first=Garance|last=Mar&amp;eacute;chal|date=30 November 2009|publisher=|journal=Encyclopedia of Case Study Research|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that operative intelligence is responsible for the representation and manipulation of the dynamic or transformational aspects of reality, and that figurative intelligence is responsible for the representation of the static aspects of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J., &amp; Inhelder, B. (1973). ''Memory and intelligence''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operative intelligence''' is the active aspect of intelligence. It involves all actions, overt or covert, undertaken in order to follow, recover, or anticipate the transformations of the objects or persons of interest.&lt;ref name="Furth, H. G. 1977"&gt;Furth, H. G. (1977). The operative and figurative aspects of knowledge in Piaget's theory. B. A. Geber (Ed.). London,, England: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Figurative intelligence''' is the more or less static aspect of intelligence, involving all means of representation used to retain in mind the states (i.e., successive forms, shapes, or locations) that intervene between transformations. That is, it involves [[perception]], [[imitation]], [[mental image]]ry, drawing, and language.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup.com1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3407100185&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=b71fd57e9d31971ea40106f27e199015|title=Piaget, Jean (1896-1980)|first=Howard E.|last=Gruber|date=30 November 2003|publisher=|journal=Learning and Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the figurative aspects of intelligence derive their meaning from the operative aspects of intelligence, because states cannot exist independently of the transformations that interconnect them. Piaget stated that the figurative or the representational aspects of intelligence are subservient to its operative and dynamic aspects, and therefore, that understanding essentially derives from the operative aspect of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Furth, H. G. 1977"/&gt;

At any time, operative intelligence frames how the world is understood and it changes if understanding is not successful. Piaget stated that this process of understanding and change involves two basic functions: '''assimilation''' and '''accommodation'''.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3406000055&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=174d9bd2c42c2e8475446e5c13301c8d|title=Assimilation|date=30 November 2000|publisher=|journal=The Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300066&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=ed09320c311b0c0e856cb2ce7c4cd810|title=Assimilation|first=Jill Englebright|last=Fox|date=30 November 2005|publisher=|journal=Encyclopedia of Human Development|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3403200491&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=8de3eeb14aba519a97e788201dd42234|title=Piaget, Jean (1896&amp;ndash;1980)|first=DAVID|last=ELKIND|date=30 November 2001|publisher=|journal=Encyclopedia of Education|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assimilation and Accommodation===
Through his study of the field of education, Piaget focused on two processes, which he named [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|assimilation]] and [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|accommodation]]. To Piaget, assimilation meant integrating external elements into structures of lives or environments, or those we could have through experience. '''Assimilation''' is how humans [[Perception|perceive]] and [[Adaptation|adapt]] to new information. It is the process of fitting new information into pre-existing cognitive [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]].&lt;ref name=Stassen_p44&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kathleen Stassen|last1=Berger|title=The developing person through the life span|publisher=Worth|isbn=9780716760801|date=2008|page=44|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Assimilation''' in which new experiences are reinterpreted to fit into, or assimilate with, old ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kathleen Stassen|last1=Berger|title=The developing person through the life span|publisher=Worth|isbn=9780716760801|date=2008|page=45|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs when humans are faced with new or unfamiliar information and refer to previously learned information in order to make sense of it. In contrast, '''accommodation '''is the process of taking new information in one's environment and altering pre-existing schemas in order to fit in the new information. This happens when the existing schema (knowledge) does not work, and needs to be changed to deal with a new object or situation.&lt;ref name="simplypsychology.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html|title=Jean Piaget - Cognitive Theory - Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accommodation is imperative because it is how people will continue to interpret new concepts, schemas, frameworks, and more.&lt;ref&gt;"Block, Jack"  "Assimilation, Accommodation, and the Dynamics of Personality Development"&lt;/ref&gt; Piaget believed that the human brain has been programmed through [[human evolution|evolution]] to bring equilibrium, which is what he believed ultimately influences structures by the internal and external processes through assimilation and accommodation.&lt;ref name=Stassen_p44 /&gt;

Piaget's understanding was that assimilation and accommodation cannot exist without the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Block | first1 = Jack | year = 1982 | title = Assimilation, accommodation, and the dynamics of personality development | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 281–295 | doi=10.2307/1128971}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are two sides of a coin. To assimilate an object into an existing mental schema, one first needs to take into account or accommodate to the particularities of this object to a certain extent. For instance, to recognize (assimilate) an apple as an apple, one must first focus (accommodate) on the contour of this object. To do this, one needs to roughly recognize the size of the object. Development increases the balance, or equilibration, between these two functions. When in balance with each other, assimilation and accommodation generate mental schemas of the operative intelligence. When one function dominates over the other, they generate representations which belong to figurative intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etec512learningconference-piaget.weebly.com/theory.html|title=Theory|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensorimotor stage===

In his theory of [[Cognitive development]], Jean Piaget proposed that humans progress through four developmental stages:
the '''sensorimotor''', '''preoperational''', '''concrete operational''' and '''formal operational period'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kathleen Stassen|last1=Berger|title=The developing person through the life span|publisher=Worth|isbn=9780716760801|date=2008|page=43|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, the '''[[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor stage]]''' "extends from birth to the acquisition of language."&lt;ref&gt;Tuckman, Bruce W., and David M. Monetti. Educational Psychology. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2010. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In this stage, infants progressively construct knowledge and understanding of the world by coordinating experiences (such as vision and hearing) with physical interactions with objects (such as grasping, sucking, and stepping).&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Penner, and Clarke-Stewart, Roy. ''Psychology Study Guide''&lt;/ref&gt; Infants gain knowledge of the world from the physical actions they perform within it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/sensorimotor.html|title=Sensorimotor Stage}}&lt;/ref&gt; They progress from reflexive, instinctual action at birth to the beginning of symbolic thought toward the end of the stage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Children learn that they are separate from the environment. They can think about aspects of the environment, even though these may be outside the reach of the child's senses. In this stage, according to Piaget, the development of [[object permanence]] is one of the most important accomplishments.&lt;ref name=Stassen_p44 /&gt; '''Object permanence''' is a child's understanding that an object continues to exist even though they cannot see or hear it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; [[Peekaboo|Peek-a-boo]] is a game in which children who have yet to fully develop object permanence respond to sudden hiding and revealing of a face.   By the end of the sensorimotor period, children develop a permanent sense of self and object and will quickly lose interest in Peek-a-boo.&lt;ref name="Santrockk"/&gt;

[[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] divided the sensorimotor stage into six sub-stages".&lt;ref name="Santrockk"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach To Life-Span Development'' (pp.211–216). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

|1 ''Simple reflexes''
|Birth-6&amp;nbsp;weeks
|"Coordination of sensation and action through reflexive behaviors".&lt;ref name="Santrockk"/&gt; Three primary reflexes are described by Piaget: sucking of objects in the mouth, following moving or interesting objects with the eyes, and closing of the hand when an object makes contact with the palm ([[palmar grasp]]). Over the first six weeks of life, these reflexes begin to become voluntary actions. For example, the palmar reflex becomes intentional grasping.&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;{{cite book |last=Piaget |first=J. |year=1977 |title=The essential Piaget |editor1-first=H.E. |editor1-last=Gruber |editor2-first=J.J. |editor2-last=Voneche |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-

| 6&amp;nbsp;weeks-4&amp;nbsp;months
|"Coordination of sensation and two types of [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]: habits (reflex) and primary circular reactions (reproduction of an event that initially occurred by chance). The main focus is still on the infant's body".&lt;ref name="Santrockk"/&gt; As an example of this type of reaction, an infant might repeat the motion of passing their hand before their face. Also at this phase, passive reactions, caused by [[classical conditioning|classical]] or [[operant conditioning]], can begin.&lt;ref name="Gruber"/&gt;
|-
|3 ''Secondary circular reactions phase''
|4–8&amp;nbsp;months
|Development of [[habit (psychology)|habits]]. "Infants become more object-oriented, moving beyond self-preoccupation; repeat actions that bring interesting or pleasurable results".&lt;ref name="Santrockk"/&gt; This stage is associated primarily with the development of [[Motor coordination|coordination]] between [[Visual perception|vision]] and [[Prehensility|prehension]]. Three new abilities occur at this stage: intentional grasping for a desired object, secondary circular reactions, and [[Inductive reasoning aptitude|differentiations]] between ends and means. At this stage, infants will intentionally grasp the air in the direction of a desired object, often to the amusement of friends and family. Secondary circular reactions, or the repetition of an action involving an external object begin; for example, moving a switch to turn on a light repeatedly. The differentiation between means and ends also occurs. This is perhaps one of the most important stages of a child's growth as it signifies the dawn of [[logic]].&lt;ref name="Gruber"/&gt;
|-
|4 ''Coordination of secondary circular reactions stages''
|8–12&amp;nbsp;months
|"Coordination of vision and touch—hand-eye coordination; coordination of schemas and [[intentionality]]".&lt;ref name="Santrockk"/&gt; This stage is associated primarily with the development of logic and the coordination between means and ends. This is an extremely important stage of development, holding what Piaget calls the "first proper [[intelligence]]". Also, this stage marks the beginning of [[goal-oriented|goal orientation]], the deliberate planning of steps to meet an [[Goal|objective]].&lt;ref name="Gruber"/&gt;
|-
|5 ''Tertiary circular reactions, novelty, and curiosity''
|12–18&amp;nbsp;months
|"Infants become intrigued by the many properties of objects and by the many things they can make happen to objects; they experiment with new behavior".&lt;ref name="Santrockk"/&gt; This stage is associated primarily with the discovery of new means to meet goals. Piaget describes the child at this juncture as the "young scientist," conducting pseudo-experiments to discover new methods of meeting challenges.&lt;ref name="Gruber"/&gt;
|-
|6 ''Internalization of schemas''
| 18–24&amp;nbsp;months
|"Infants develop the ability to use primitive symbols and form enduring mental representations".&lt;ref name="Santrockk"/&gt; This stage is associated primarily with the beginnings of [[insight]], or true [[creativity]]. This marks the passage into the preoperational stage.
|}

===Pre-operational stage===
By observing sequences of play, Piaget was able to demonstrate that, towards the end of the second year, a qualitatively new kind of psychological functioning occurs, known as the pre-operational stage, the second of Piaget's four developmental stages.&lt;ref name="Atkinson &amp; Hilgards"&gt;Loftus, Geoff. (2009). "Introduction to Psychology (15th Ed.)".- Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Santrock8"&gt;Santrock, John W. (2004). ''Life-Span Development (9th Ed.)''. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill College – Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; It starts when the child begins to learn to speak at age two and lasts up until the age of seven. During the pre-operational stage of cognitive development, Piaget noted that children do not yet understand concrete logic and cannot mentally manipulate information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/piagetstheory/p/preoperational.htm|title=What Is the Preoperational Stage of Cognitive Development?|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage. However, the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view. The children's play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols. Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks, pieces of paper being plates, and a box being a table. Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved.

The pre-operational stage is sparse and logically inadequate in regard to mental operations. The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs. The child, however, is still not able to perform operations, which are tasks that the child can do mentally, rather than physically. Thinking in this stage is still [[Egocentrism|egocentric]], meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others. The Pre-operational Stage is split into &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; substages: the symbolic function substage, and the [[Intuition|intuitive]] thought substage. The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand, represent, remember, and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them. The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of "why?" and "how come?" This stage is when children want to understand everything.&lt;ref name="Santrock8"/&gt;

====Symbolic function substage====
At about two to four years of age, children cannot yet manipulate and transform information in a logical way. However, they now can think in images and symbols. Other examples of mental abilities are language and pretend play. Symbolic play is when children develop imaginary friends or role-play with friends. Children's play becomes more social and they assign roles to each other. Some examples of symbolic play include playing house, or having a tea party. The type of symbolic play in which children engage is connected with their level of creativity and ability to connect with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russ|first=S. W.|title=Pretend play, affect, and creativity|journal=New directions in aesthetics, creativity and the arts, Foundations and frontiers in aesthetics|year=2006|pages=239–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the quality of their symbolic play can have consequences on their later development. For example, young children whose symbolic play is of a violent nature tend to exhibit less prosocial behavior and are more likely to display [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] tendencies in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Judy|author2=Hughes, Claire|title="I Got Some Swords And You're Dead!": Violent Fantasy, Antisocial Behavior, Friendship, And Moral Sensibility In Young Children|journal=Child Development|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00292|volume=72|pages=491–505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this stage, there are still limitations, such as egocentrism and precausal thinking.

[[File:Egocentrism1.Musfica.png|thumb|Egocentrism]]
[[Egocentrism]] occurs when a child is unable to distinguish between their own perspective and that of another person. Children tend to stick to their own viewpoint, rather than consider the view of others. Indeed, they are not even aware that such a concept as "different viewpoints" exists.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, A Child's Conception of Space, Norton Edition, 1967; p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Egocentrism can be seen in an experiment performed by Piaget and Swiss developmental psychologist [[Bärbel Inhelder]], known as the [[three mountain problem]]. In this experiment, three views of a mountain are shown to the child, who is asked what a traveling doll would see at the various angles. The child will consistently describe what they can see from the position from which they are seated, regardless of the angle from which they are asked to take the doll's perspective. Egocentrism would also cause a child to believe, "I like ''[[Sesame Street]]'', so Daddy must like ''Sesame Street'', too."

Similar to preoperational children's egocentric thinking is their structuring of a [[Causality|cause and effect]] relationships. Piaget coined the term "precausal thinking" to describe the way in which preoperational children use their own existing ideas or views, like in egocentrism, to explain cause-and-effect relationships. Three main concepts of causality as displayed by children in the preoperational stage include: [[animism]], artificialism and [[Transduction (psychology)|transductive]] reasoning.&lt;ref name="Rathus 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rathus|first=Spencer A.|title=Childhood: voyages in development|year=2006|publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]]|location=Belmont, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animism is the belief that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have lifelike qualities. An example could be a child believing that the sidewalk was mad and made them fall down, or that the stars twinkle in the sky because they are happy. Artificialism refers to the belief that environmental characteristics can be attributed to human actions or interventions. For example, a child might say that it is windy outside because someone is blowing very hard, or the clouds are white because someone painted them that color. Finally, precausal thinking is categorized by transductive reasoning. Transductive reasoning is when a child fails to understand the true relationships between cause and effect.&lt;ref name="Santrock8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbuscityschools.org/lee/pioneer/stage2.htm | title=Preoperational Stage | accessdate=February 2, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728114723/http://www.columbuscityschools.org/lee/pioneer/stage2.htm | archivedate=July 28, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] or [[inductive reasoning]] (general to specific, or specific to general), transductive reasoning refers to when a child reasons from specific to specific, drawing a relationship between two separate events that are otherwise unrelated. For example, if a child hears the dog bark and then a balloon popped, the child would conclude that because the dog barked, the balloon popped.

====Intuitive thought substage====
At between about the ages of 4 and 7, children tend to become very curious and ask many questions, beginning the use of primitive reasoning. There is an emergence in the interest of reasoning and wanting to know why things are the way they are. Piaget called it the "intuitive substage" because children realize they have a vast amount of knowledge, but they are unaware of how they acquired it. [[Centration]], [[conservation (psychology)|conservation]], [[Irreversible process|irreversibility]], class inclusion, and transitive inference are all characteristics of preoperative thought.
Centration is the act of focusing all attention on one characteristic or dimension of a situation, whilst disregarding all others. Conservation is the awareness that altering a substance's appearance does not change its basic properties. Children at this stage are unaware of conservation and exhibit centration. Both centration and conservation can be more easily understood once familiarized with Piaget's most famous experimental task.

In this task, a child is presented with two identical beakers containing the same amount of liquid. The child usually notes that the beakers do contain the same amount of liquid. When one of the beakers is poured into a taller and thinner container, children who are younger than seven or eight years old typically say that the two beakers no longer contain the same amount of liquid, and that the taller container holds the larger quantity (centration), without taking into consideration the fact that both beakers were previously noted to contain the same amount of liquid. Due to superficial changes, the child was unable to comprehend that the properties of the substances continued to remain the same (conservation).

Irreversibility is a concept developed in this stage which is closely related to the ideas of centration and conservation. Irreversibility refers to when children are unable to mentally reverse a sequence of events. In the same beaker situation, the child does not realize that, if the sequence of events was reversed and the water from the tall beaker was poured back into its original beaker, then the same amount of water would exist. Another example of children's reliance on visual representations is their misunderstanding of "less than" or "more than". When two rows containing equal amounts of blocks are placed in front of a child, one row spread farther apart than the other, the child will think that the row spread farther contains more blocks.&lt;ref name="Santrock8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Preoperational Stage - Egocentrism"&gt;McLeod, S. A. (2010). ''Simply Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Class inclusion refers to a kind of conceptual thinking that children in the preoperational stage cannot yet grasp. Children's inability to focus on two aspects of a situation at once inhibits them from understanding the principle that one category or class can contain several different subcategories or classes.&lt;ref name="Rathus 2006"/&gt; For example, a four-year-old girl may be shown a picture of eight dogs and three cats. The girl knows what cats and dogs are, and she is aware that they are both animals. However, when asked, "Are there more dogs or animals?" she is likely to answer "more dogs". This is due to her difficulty focusing on the two subclasses and the larger class all at the same time. She may have been able to view the dogs as dogs ''or'' animals, but struggled when trying to classify them as both, simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Glenda |author2=Graeme S. Halford |author3=Karen Murphy |author4=Kathy Knox|title=Integration Of Weight And Distance Information In Young Children: The Role Of Relational Complexity|journal=Cognitive Development|year=2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=49–60|doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2008.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Branco|first=J. C|author2=Lourenco, O|title=Cognitive and linguistic aspects in 5- to 6-year-olds' class inclusion reasoning|journal=Psicologia Educacao Cultura|year=2004|volume=8|issue=2|pages=427–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to this is concept relating to intuitive thought, known as "transitive inference".

Transitive inference is using previous knowledge to determine the missing piece, using basic logic. Children in the preoperational stage lack this logic. An example of transitive inference would be when a child is presented with the information "A" is greater than "B" and "B" is greater than "C". This child may have difficulty here understanding that "A" is also greater than "C".

===Concrete operational stage===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jean Piaget]]. --&gt;
The '''concrete operational stage''' is the third stage of Piaget's theory of cognitive development. This stage, which follows the preoperational stage, occurs between the ages of 7 and 11&amp;nbsp;(preadolescence) years,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Ginsburg and Sylvia Opper (1979), ''Piaget's Theory of Intellectual Development'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-675140-7}}, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; and is characterized by the appropriate use of logic. During this stage, a child's thought processes become more mature and "adult like". They start solving problems in a more logical fashion. Abstract, [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] thinking is not yet developed in the child, and children can only solve problems that apply to concrete events or objects. At this stage, the children undergo a transition where the child learns rules such as [[Conservation (psychology)|conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Concrete Operations [Video file]. (1993). Davidson Films, Inc. Retrieved October 6, 2014, from Education in Video: Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt; Piaget determined that children are able to incorporate [[Inductive reasoning]]. Inductive reasoning involves drawing inferences from observations in order to make a [[generalization]]. In contrast, children struggle with [[deductive reasoning]], which involves using a generalized principle in order to try to predict the outcome of an event. Children in this stage commonly experience difficulties with figuring out logic in their heads. For example, a child will understand that "A is more than B" and "B is more than C". However, when asked "is A more than C?", the child might not be able to logically figure the question out in his or her head.

Two other important processes in the concrete operational stage are logic and the elimination of egocentrism.

Egocentrism is the inability to consider or understand a perspective other than one's own. It is the phase where the thought and morality of the child is completely self focused.&lt;ref&gt;SCOTT, J., &amp; MARSHALL, G. (2009). ''A dictionary of sociology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage, the child acquires the ability to view things from another individual's perspective, even if they think that perspective is incorrect. For instance, show a child a comic in which Jane puts a doll under a box, leaves the room, and then Melissa moves the doll to a drawer, and Jane comes back. A child in the concrete operations stage will say that Jane will still think it's under the box even though the child knows it is in the drawer. (See also [[False-belief task]].)

Children in this stage can, however, only solve problems that apply to actual (concrete) objects or events, and not abstract concepts or hypothetical tasks. Understanding and knowing how to use full common sense has not yet been completely adapted.

Piaget determined that children in the concrete operational stage were able to incorporate inductive logic. On the other hand, children at this age have difficulty using deductive logic, which involves using a general principle to predict the outcome of a specific event. This includes mental reversibility. An example of this is being able to reverse the order of relationships between mental categories. For example, a child might be able to recognize that his or her dog is a Labrador, that a Labrador is a dog, and that a dog is an animal, and draw conclusions from the information available, as well as apply all these processes to hypothetical situations.&lt;ref name="Santrock2"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach to Life Span Development'' (pp.221–223). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abstract quality of the adolescent's thought at the formal operational level is evident in the adolescent's verbal problem solving ability.&lt;ref name=Santrock2/&gt; The logical quality of the adolescent's thought is when children are more likely to solve problems in a trial-and-error fashion.&lt;ref name=Santrock2/&gt; Adolescents begin to think more as a scientist thinks, devising plans to solve problems and systematically test opinions.&lt;ref name=Santrock2/&gt; They use hypothetical-deductive reasoning, which means that they develop hypotheses or best guesses, and systematically deduce, or conclude, which is the best path to follow in solving the problem.&lt;ref name=Santrock2/&gt; During this stage the adolescent is able to understand love, logical proofs and values. During this stage the young person begins to entertain possibilities for the future and is fascinated with what they can be.&lt;ref name=Santrock2/&gt;

Adolescents also are changing cognitively by the way that they think about social matters.&lt;ref name=Santrock2/&gt; Adolescent egocentrism governs the way that adolescents think about social matters, and is the heightened self-consciousness in them as they are, which is reflected in their sense of personal uniqueness and invincibility.&lt;ref name=Santrock2/&gt; Adolescent egocentrism can be dissected into two types of social thinking, [[imaginary audience]] that involves attention-getting behavior, and [[personal fable]], which involves an adolescent's sense of personal uniqueness and invincibility.&lt;ref name=Santrock2/&gt; These two types of social thinking begin to affect a child's egocentrism in the concrete stage. However, it carries over to the formal operational stage when they are then faced with abstract thought and fully logical thinking.

====Testing for concrete operations====
Piagetian tests are well known and practiced to test for concrete operations. The most prevalent tests are those for conservation. There are some important aspects that the experimenter must take into account when performing experiments with these children.

One example of an experiment for testing conservation is the water level task.&lt;ref name="Tran, U. S. 2008"&gt;Tran, U. S., &amp; Formann, A. K. (2008). Piaget's water-level tasks: Performance across the lifespan with emphasis on the elderly. ''Personality and Individual Differences, 45,'' 232-237.&lt;/ref&gt;
An experimenter will have two glasses that are the same size, fill them to the same level with liquid, which the child will acknowledge is the same. Then, the experimenter will pour the liquid from one of the small glasses into a tall, thin glass. The experimenter will then ask the child if the taller glass has more liquid, less liquid, or the same amount of liquid. The child will then give his answer. The experimenter will ask the child why he gave his answer, or why he thinks that is.
* ''Justification'': After the child has answered the question being posed, the experimenter must ask why the child gave that answer. This is important because the answers they give can help the experimenter to assess the child's developmental age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FjIso13i20|title=Classic Piaget Volume 1|first=|last=Davidson Films, Inc.|date=10 August 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Number of times asking'': Some argue that if a child is asked if the amount of liquid in the first set of glasses is equal then, after pouring the water into the taller glass, the experimenter asks again about the amount of liquid, the children will start to doubt their original answer. They may start to think that the original levels were not equal, which will influence their second answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/concrete-operational.html|title=Concrete Operational Stage - Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Word choice'': The phrasing that the experimenter uses may affect how the child answers. If, in the liquid and glass example, the experimenter asks, "Which of these glasses has more liquid?", the child may think that his thoughts of them being the same is wrong because the adult is saying that one must have more. Alternatively, if the experimenter asks, "Are these equal?", then the child is more likely to say that they are, because the experimenter is implying that they are.

[[File:Piagetian operations.jpg|thumb|Piagetian operations]]

===Formal operational stage===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jean Piaget]]. --&gt;
The final stage is known as the '''formal operational stage''' (adolescence and into adulthood, roughly ages 11 to approximately 15–20): Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts. This form of thought includes "assumptions that have no necessary relation to reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Intelligence|last = Piaget|first = Jean|publisher = Littlefield|year = 1972|isbn = |location = Totowa, NJ|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the person is capable of hypothetical and deductive reasoning. During this time, people develop the ability to think about abstract concepts.

Piaget stated that "[[hypothetico-deductive reasoning]]" becomes important during the formal operational stage. This type of thinking involves hypothetical "what-if" situations that are not always rooted in reality, i.e. [[counterfactual thinking]]. It is often required in science and mathematics.

* [[Abstract thought]] emerges during the formal operational stage. Children tend to think very concretely and specifically in earlier stages, and begin to consider possible outcomes and consequences of actions.
* [[Metacognition]], the capacity for "thinking about thinking" that allows adolescents and adults to reason about their thought processes and monitor them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnett|first=Jeffrey Jensen|title=Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood|year=2013|publisher=Person Education Inc.|location=NJ|isbn=0-205-89249-3|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Problem-solving]] is demonstrated when children use trial-and-error to solve problems. The ability to systematically solve a problem in a logical and methodical way emerges.
While children in primary school years mostly used [[inductive reasoning]], drawing general conclusions from personal experiences and specific facts, adolescents become capable of [[deductive reasoning]], in which they draw specific conclusions from abstract concepts using logic. This capability results from their capacity to think hypothetically.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"However, research has shown that not all persons in all cultures reach formal operations, and most people do not use formal operations in all aspects of their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnett|first=Jeffrey|title=Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood: A Cultural Approach|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=New York|page=91|edition=5th|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Experiments====
Piaget and his colleagues conducted several experiments to assess formal operational thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The growth of logical thinking from childhood to adolescence: An essay on the construction of formal operational structures|last = Inhelder|first = Barbel|publisher = Basic Books|year = 1958|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Piaget|first2 = Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the experiments, Piaget evaluated the cognitive capabilities of children of different ages through the use of a scale and varying weights. The task was to balance the scale by hooking weights on the ends of the scale. To successfully complete the task, the children must use formal operational thought to realize that the distance of the weights from the center and the heaviness of the weights both affected the balance. A heavier weight has to be placed closer to the center of the scale, and a lighter weight has to be placed farther from the center, so that the two weights balance each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While 3- to 5- year olds could not at all comprehend the concept of balancing, children by the age of 7 could balance the scale by placing the same weights on both ends, but they failed to realize the importance of the location. By age 10, children could think about location but failed to use logic and instead used trial-and-error. Finally, by age 13 and 14, in early adolescence, some children more clearly understood the relationship between weight and distance and could successfully implement their hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The psychology of the child|last = Piaget|first = Jean|publisher = Basic Books|year = 1969|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Inhedler|first2 = Bärbel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The stages and causation===
Piaget sees children's conception of [[Causality|causation]] as a march from "primitive" conceptions of cause to those of a more scientific, rigorous, and mechanical nature. These primitive concepts are characterized as [[Magic (paranormal)|supernatural]], with a decidedly non-natural or non-mechanical tone. Piaget has as his most basic assumption that babies are [[Phenomenalism|phenomenists]]. That is, their knowledge "consists of assimilating things to schemas" from their own action such that they appear, from the child's point of view, "to have qualities which, in fact, stem from the organism". Consequently, these "subjective conceptions," so prevalent during Piaget's first stage of development, are dashed upon discovering deeper [[empirism|empirical]] truths.

Piaget gives the example of a child believing that the moon and stars follow him on a night walk. Upon learning that such is the case for his friends, he must separate his self from the object, resulting in a theory that the moon is immobile, or moves independently of other [[Agency (philosophy)|agents]].

The second stage, from around three to eight years of age, is characterized by a mix of this type of magical, [[Animism|animistic]], or "non-natural" conceptions of causation and mechanical or "naturalistic" causation. This conjunction of natural and non-natural causal explanations supposedly stems from experience itself, though Piaget does not make much of an attempt to describe the nature of the differences in conception. In his interviews with children, he asked questions specifically about [[natural phenomena]], such as: "What makes clouds move?", "What makes the stars move?", "Why do rivers flow?" The nature of all the answers given, Piaget says, are such that these objects must perform their actions to "fulfill their obligations towards men". He calls this "moral explanation".&lt;ref name=Piaget1928&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Piaget | first1 = J | year = 1928 | title = La causalité chez l'enfant | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 276–301 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1928.tb00466.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical applications==
Parents can use Piaget's theory when deciding how to determine what to buy in order to support their child's growth.&lt;ref name=". So Young, and So Gadgeted"&gt;BUCKLEITNER, W. (2008, June 12). ''New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers can also use Piaget's theory, for instance, when discussing whether the syllabus subjects are suitable for the level of students or not.&lt;ref name=". Elementary Teachers' Application of Jean Piaget's Theories of Cognitive Development "&gt;Hinde, E. R., &amp; Perry, N. (2007). ''Elementary School Journal, 108(1), 63–79.''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, recent studies have shown that children in the same grade and of the same age perform differentially on tasks measuring basic addition and subtraction fluency. While children in the preoperational and concrete operational levels of cognitive development perform combined arithmetic operations (such as addition and subtraction) with similar accuracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramos-Christian|first=Vanessa |author2=Robert Schleser |author3=Mary E. Varn|title=Math fluency: Accuracy versus speed in preoperational and concrete operational first and second grade children|journal=Early Childhood Education Journal|date=2008|volume=35|issue=6|pages=543–549|doi=10.1007/s10643-008-0234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; children in the concrete operational level of cognitive development have been able to perform both addition problems and subtraction problems with overall greater fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wubbena|first=Zane|title=Mathematical fluency as a function of conservation ability in young children|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2013.01.013|volume=26|pages=153–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage of cognitive growth of a person differ from another. Cognitive development or thinking is an active process from the beginning to the end of life. Intellectual advancement happens because people at every age and developmental period looks for cognitive equilibrium. To achieve this balance, the easiest way is to understand the new experiences through the lens of the preexisting ideas. Infants learn that new objects can be grabbed in the same way of familiar objects, and adults explain the day's headlines as evidence for their existing worldview.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Kathleen Stassen. (2011). ''The Developing Person Through the Life Span'' (8th ed., pp. 45–46). Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the application of standardized Piagetian theory and procedures in different societies established widely varying results that lead some to speculate not only that some cultures produce more cognitive development than others but that without specific kinds of cultural experience, but also formal schooling, development might cease at certain level, such as concrete operational level. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} A procedure was done following methods developed in Geneva (i.e. water level task). Participants were presented with two beakers of equal circumference and height, filled with equal amounts of water. The water from one beaker was transferred into another with taller and smaller circumference. The children and young adults from [[Nonliterate|non-literate]] societies of a given age were more likely to think that the taller, thinner beaker had more water in it. On the other hand, an experiment on the effects of modifying testing procedures to match local cultural produced a different pattern of results. In the revised procedures, the participants explained in their own language and indicated that while the water was now "more", the quantity was the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileycs/culture_and_cognitive_development/0|title=Culture and Cognitive Development - Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piaget's water level task has also been applied to the [[elderly]] by [[Anton Formann|Formann]] and results showed an age-associated non-linear decline of performance.&lt;ref name="Tran, U. S. 2008"/&gt;

==Postulated physical mechanisms underlying schemas and stages==
In 1967, Piaget considered the possibility of [[RNA]] molecules as likely embodiments of his still-abstract [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s (which he promoted as units of action)—though he did not come to any firm conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1967/1971). ''Biologie et connaissance: Essai sur les relations entre les régulations organiques et les processus cognitifs''. Gallimard: Paris  —  ''Biology and Knowledge''. Chicago University Press;  and Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, due to work such as that of Swedish biochemist Holger Hydén, RNA concentrations had, indeed, been shown to correlate with learning, so the idea was quite plausible.

However, by the time of Piaget's death in 1980, this notion had lost favor. One main problem was over the [[protein]] which, it was assumed, such RNA would necessarily produce, and that did not fit in with observation. It was determined that only about 3% of RNA does code for protein.&lt;ref name="ondwelle.com"&gt;[http://www.ondwelle.com/OSM02.pdf Traill, R.R. (2008). ''Thinking by Molecule, Synapse, or both? — From Piaget's Schema, to the Selecting/Editing of ncRNA''. Ondwelle: Melbourne.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, most of the remaining 97% (the "[[ncRNA]]") could theoretically be available to serve as Piagetian schemas (or other regulatory roles in the 2000s under investigation). The issue has not yet been resolved experimentally, but its theoretical aspects were reviewed in 2008&lt;ref name="ondwelle.com"/&gt; — then developed further from the viewpoints of [[biophysics]] and [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;Traill, R.R.

==Relation to psychometric theories of intelligence==
Piaget designed a number of tasks to verify hypotheses arising from his theory. The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences, and they have no equivalent in [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] intelligence tests. Notwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed, the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude. A common general factor underlies them. It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of [[G factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] as standard IQ tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphreys | first1 = L.G. | last2 = Rich | first2 = S.A. | last3 = Davey | first3 = T.C. | year = 1985 | title = A Piagetian Test of General Intelligence | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 872–877 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.21.5.872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lautrey, J.

==Challenges to Piagetian stage theory==
Piagetian accounts of development have been challenged on several grounds. First, as Piaget himself noted, development does not always progress in the smooth manner his theory seems to predict. ''Décalage'', or progressive forms of cognitive developmental progression in a specific domain, suggest that the stage model is, at best, a useful approximation.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup.com2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300160&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=b6bd1ae3a4e93016b772396b5848a349|title=Concrete Operational Period|first=Karen E.|last=Singer-Freeman|date=30 November 2005|publisher=|journal=Encyclopedia of Human Development|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, studies have found that children may be able to learn concepts and capability of complex reasoning that supposedly represented in more advanced stages with relative ease (Lourenço &amp; Machado, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;145).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lourenço | first1 = O. | last2 = Machado | first2 = A. | year = 1996 | title = In defense of Piaget's theory: A reply to 10 common criticisms | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 103 | issue = 1| pages = 143–164 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.103.1.143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych406-5.3.2.pdf Kay C. Wood, Harlan Smith, and Daurice Grossniklaus. "Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development". pp. 6] Retrieved May 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, Piaget's theory is "[[Domain-general learning|domain general]]," predicting that cognitive maturation occurs concurrently across different domains of knowledge (such as mathematics, logic, and understanding of [[physics]] or language).&lt;ref name="go.galegroup.com2"/&gt; Piaget did not take into account variability in a child's performance notably how a child can differ in sophistication across several domains.

During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive developmentalists were influenced by [[Psychological nativism|"neo-nativist"]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] ideas. These ideas de-emphasized domain general theories and emphasized [[domain specificity]] or [[modularity of mind]].&lt;ref name="Callaghan, T. C. 2005 pp. 204-209"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX1311100053&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=c822fe0523f5b1258756f6e7855acc8d|title=Cognitive Development Beyond Infancy|first=Tara C.|last=Callaghan|date=30 November 2004|publisher=|journal=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Child Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modularity implies that different cognitive faculties may be largely independent of one another, and thus develop according to quite different timetables, which are "influenced by real world experiences".&lt;ref name="Callaghan, T. C. 2005 pp. 204-209"/&gt; In this vein, some cognitive developmentalists argued that, rather than being domain general learners, children come equipped with domain specific theories, sometimes referred to as "core knowledge," which allows them to break into learning within that domain. For example, even young infants appear to be sensitive to some predictable regularities in the movement and interactions of objects (for example, an object cannot pass through another object), or in human behavior (for example, a hand repeatedly reaching for an object has that object, not just a particular path of motion), as it becomes the building block of which more elaborate knowledge is constructed.

Piaget's theory has been said to undervalue the influence that culture has on cognitive development. Piaget demonstrates that a child goes through several stages of cognitive development and come to conclusions on their own but in reality, a child's sociocultural environment plays an important part in their cognitive development. Social interaction teaches the child about the world and helps them develop through the cognitive stages, which Piaget neglected to consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kail|first1=Robert|title=Children and Their Development|date=2007|publisher=Pearson|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejournal1.com/journals_n/1433324999.pdf|title=Assan, E.

More recent work has strongly challenged some of the basic presumptions of the "core knowledge" school, and revised ideas of domain generality—but from a newer dynamic systems approach, not from a revised Piagetian perspective. Dynamic systems approaches harken to modern [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] research that was not available to Piaget when he was constructing his theory. One important finding is that domain-specific knowledge is constructed as children develop and integrate knowledge. This enables the domain to improve the accuracy of the knowledge as well as organization of memories.&lt;ref name="Callaghan, T. C. 2005 pp. 204-209"/&gt; However, this suggests more of a "smooth integration" of learning and development than either Piaget, or his neo-nativist critics, had envisioned. Additionally, some psychologists, such as [[Lev Vygotsky]] and [[Jerome Bruner]], thought differently from Piaget, suggesting that language was more important for cognition development than Piaget implied.&lt;ref name="Callaghan, T. C. 2005 pp. 204-209"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3406000105&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=650268d1759955de0b9432be0e28ba5f|title=Bruner, Jerome S.|date=30 November 2000|publisher=|journal=The Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Piagetian and neo-Piagetian stages==
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}
In recent years, several theorists attempted to address concerns with Piaget's theory by developing new theories and models that can accommodate evidence which violates Piagetian predictions and postulates.

* The [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], advanced by Robbie Case, [[Andreas Demetriou]], Graeme S. Halford, [[Kurt W. Fischer]], [[Michael Commons|Michael Lamport Commons]], and Juan Pascual-Leone, attempted to integrate Piaget's theory with cognitive and differential theories of cognitive organization and development. Their aim was to better account for the cognitive factors of development and for intra-individual and inter-individual differences in cognitive development. They suggested that development along Piaget's stages is due to increasing [[working memory]] capacity and processing efficiency by "biological maturation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3027800184&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=5fee96b9c6312e2ec80a2b957d08d51e|title=Neo-Piagetian Theories of Development|date=30 November 2008|publisher=|journal=Psychology of Classroom Learning|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Andreas Demetriou|Demetriou]]'s theory ascribes an important role to hypercognitive processes of "self-monitoring, self-recording, self-evaluation, and self-regulation", and it recognizes the operation of several relatively autonomous domains of thought (Demetriou, 1998; Demetriou, Mouyi, Spanoudis, 2010; Demetriou, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;153).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adesignmedia.com/OnlineResearch/sp_Mind%20Self%20and%20Personality.pdf|title=Demetriou, A.

* Piaget's theory stops at the formal operational stage, but other researchers have observed the thinking of adults is more nuanced than formal operational thought. This fifth stage has been named [[postformal thought|post formal thought]] or operation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan D. Sinnott "The Development of Logic in Adulthood: Postformal Thought and Its Applications" (Plenum Press 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300423&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=c6e23814559096bdcd16fc9068c727ee|title=Middle Adulthood|first=David J.|last=Johnson|date=30 November 2005|publisher=|journal=Encyclopedia of Human Development|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post formal stages have been proposed.

The '''platoon system''' or '''two-platoon system'''&lt;ref name="casey"/&gt; in [[baseball]] or [[American football|football]] is the method directing the substitution of players.

==Baseball==
[[File:Casey Stengel 1953.png|right|thumb|[[Casey Stengel]] popularized the platoon system as [[manager (baseball)|manager]] of the [[New York Yankees]].]]
In baseball, a platoon  is a method of sharing playing time, where two players are selected to play a single defensive position. Usually, one platoon player is right-handed and the other is left-handed. Typically the right-handed half of the platoon is played on days when the opposing starting pitcher is left-handed and the left-handed player is played otherwise.&lt;ref name=inventing/&gt; The theory behind this is that generally players hit better against their opposite-handed counterparts, and that in some cases the difference is extreme enough to warrant complementing the player with one of opposite handedness.
===Strategy===
Right-handed batters have an advantage against left-handed pitchers, as left-handed batters benefit from facing right-handed pitchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/04/19/4190930/the-difference-between-right-and.html |title=The difference between right and left-handed hitters |publisher=KansasCity.com |date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a right-handed pitcher's [[curveball]] breaks to the left, from his own point of view, which causes it to cross the plate with its lateral movement away from a right-handed batter but towards a left-handed batter (and vice versa for a left-handed pitcher), and because batters generally find it easier to hit a ball that is over the plate.&lt;ref name=inventing/&gt; Furthermore, since most pitchers are right-handed, left-handed batters generally have less experience with left-handed pitchers.&lt;ref name=redsox/&gt; A left-handed pitcher may also be brought in to face a [[switch-hitter]] who generally bats left-handed, forcing the batter to shift to his less-effective right-handed stance or to take the disadvantages of batting left-handed against a left-handed pitcher.

Platooning can be viewed negatively. Players prefer to play every day,&lt;ref name=redsox/&gt; and managers, including [[Walter Alston]], feared that sharing playing time could decrease confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Walter Bingham |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1072996/index.htm |title=A season of struggling to win with percentage baseball is – 09.18.61 – SI Vault |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=September 18, 1961 |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mookie Wilson]] of the [[New York Mets]] requested a trade in 1988 after serving in a platoon for three seasons with [[Lenny Dykstra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&amp;dat=19880301&amp;id=8CdVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aI8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5245,6225102|title=Baseball roundup: Mookie Wilson asks for trade|agency=[[United Press International]]|newspaper=The Daily Record|location=Ellensburg, Washington|date=March 1, 1988|page=11|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The advantage to alternating hitters based on handedness was known from the early days of baseball. [[Bob Ferguson (infielder)|Bob Ferguson]], in 1871, became baseball's first [[switch hitter]], allowing him to bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers, and right-handed against left-handed pitchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NAPaOOrSVywC&amp;pg=PA595&amp;lpg=PA595&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CA+History+of+Platooning.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T8QezX6gYV&amp;sig=-VYevgBcJrdfxx9kt6_2uv0DE8c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FNPvUrasAoTJygGhmoBo&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CA%20History%20of%20Platooning.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Armchair Book of Baseball: An All-Star Lineup Celebrates America's National Pastime|first=Bill|last=James|authorlink=Bill James|editor=John Thorn|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=1997|page=586|isbn=9781578660049}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded platoon took place in 1887, when the [[St. Louis Maroons/Indianapolis Hoosiers|Indianapolis Hoosiers]] briefly paired the right-handed [[Gid Gardner]] and left-handed [[Tom Brown (center fielder)|Tom Brown]] in [[Center fielder|center field]].&lt;ref name=historical&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uSbqUm8hSAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22gid+gardner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_1JhTvKLBcr10gHrk_0G&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22gid%20gardner%22&amp;f=false|title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neyer |first=Rob |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=neyer_rob&amp;id=1800872|title=Game's progressive past|work=[[ESPN.com]]|date=May 13, 2004|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the [[Detroit Tigers]] alternated [[Boss Schmidt]], [[Jack Warner (catcher)|Jack Warner]], and [[Fred Payne (baseball)|Freddie Payne]] at [[catcher]] for the entire season.&lt;ref name=book595&gt;James, p. 595&lt;/ref&gt; As [[manager (baseball)|manager]] of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]], [[George Stallings]] employed platoons during the [[1914 Boston Braves season|1914 season]], which helped the "Miracle" Braves win the [[1914 World Series]].&lt;ref name="here to stay"/&gt; No Braves [[outfielder]] reached 400 [[at-bat]]s during the 1914 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/1caa4821 |title=George Stallings |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] |date= |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 and 1935, [[Detroit Tigers]]' [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Mickey Cochrane]] routinely platooned [[Gee Walker]], a right-handed batter, to spell center fielder [[Goose Goslin]] and [[right fielder]] [[Jo-Jo White]], who were both left-handed batters. Cochrane, a left-handed batter, also platooned himself behind the plate with [[Ray Hayworth]], a right-handed batter. Also in the 1930s, [[Bill Terry]] of the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] platooned center fielders [[Hank Leiber]] and [[Jimmy Ripple]].&lt;ref name=inventing/&gt; The approach was seldom used in the 1930s,&lt;ref name=book595/&gt; but [[Casey Stengel]], managing the Braves, platooned [[third basemen]] [[Debs Garms]] and [[Joe Stripp]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=inventing/&gt; Stengel himself had been platooned as a player by managers [[John McGraw]] and [[Wilbert Robinson]].&lt;ref name="here to stay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/bd6a83d8 |title=Casey Stengel |publisher=Society for American Baseball Research |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garms won the [[National League]]'s [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting title]] in 1940 with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] as a part-time player under [[Frankie Frisch]].&lt;ref name=inventing/&gt;

Terms for this strategy included "double-batting shift, "switch-around players", and "reversible outfield". [[Tris Speaker]] referred to his strategy as the "triple shift", because he employed it at three positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinberg |first=Steve |url=http://sabr.org/research/manager-speaker |title=Manager Speaker |publisher=Society for American Baseball Research |date= |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "platoon" was coined in the late 1940s.

Platooning decreased in frequency from the late 1980s through the 1990s, as teams expanded their [[bullpen]]s to nullify platoon advantages for hitters.&lt;ref name=historical/&gt; However, the use of platoons has increased in recent years. As teams increase their analysis of data, they attempt to put batters and pitchers in situations where they are more likely to succeed. Generally, small market teams, which cannot afford to sign the league's best players to market-value contracts, are most likely to employ platoons. Under manager [[Bob Melvin]], the Athletics have employed many platoons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article/oak/as-trio-of-catchers-marching-to-success-in-platoon-system?ymd=20140117&amp;content_id=66792000 |title=A's trio of catchers marching to success in platoon system &amp;#124; oaklandathletics.com: News |publisher=Oakland.athletics.mlb.com |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Josh Reddick]] calling Melvin the "king of platoons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130314&amp;content_id=42764170&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Anthony Castrovince: 'King of platoons' Bob Melvin back at it in Oakland &amp;#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Maddon]] began to employ platoons as manager of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=tampabaycom |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/rays/content/rays-platoon-hinske-ruggiano-left/2075017 |title=Rays to platoon Hinske, Ruggiano in left &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |publisher=Tampabay.com |date=August 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/tampa-bay-rays-manager-joe-maddon-sticks-with-platoon-advantage-against/1127530 |title=Tampa Bay Rays manager Joe Maddon sticks with platoon advantage against Rangers ace Cliff Lee &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |publisher=Tampabay.com |date= |accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==
===History===
[[File:Fritz Crisler.png|thumb|right|Fritz Crisler was known as the "father of two-platoon football."]]
Prior to 1941, virtually all football players saw action on "both sides of the ball," playing in both offensive and defensive roles in a [[one-platoon system]]. From 1941 to 1952, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) allowed unlimited substitution. This change was originally made because of the difficulty in fielding highly skilled players during the years of the [[Second World War]], in which many able-bodied college-age men volunteered for or were drafted into military service.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

The first known use of the so-called "two-platoon" system was by [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] head coach [[Fritz Crisler]] in 1945 against an [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] team under head coach "Colonel" [[Red Blaik|Earl "Red" Blaik]]. Michigan lost the game 28&amp;ndash;7, but Crisler's use of eight players who played only on offense, eight who played only on defense, and three that played both, impressed Blaik enough for him to adopt it for his own team.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Blaik, a former soldier himself, coined the "[[platoon]]" terminology in reference to the type of military unit.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Douglas S. Looney, [http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136503/index.htm One Is More Like It], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 3 September 1990, retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1946 and 1950, Blaik's two-platoon teams twice finished the season ranked second in the [[AP Poll|Associated Press poll]]s and never finished lower than 11th.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

In 1954, the NCAA emplaced a set of new rules requiring the use of the one-platoon system, primarily due to financial reasons.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thumbs"&gt;Clarence Munn, [http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1128569/index.htm Thumbs Down On The One Platoon], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 29 November 1954, retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The system allowed only one player to be substituted between plays, which effectively put an end to the use of separate specialized units.&lt;ref name="border"/&gt; [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] head coach "General" [[Robert Neyland]] praised the change as the end of "chickenshit football".&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;
[[File:Paul Dietzel (1958).jpg|thumb|160px|left|Paul Dietzel used a unique "three-platoon" system.]]
In 1958, LSU coach [[Paul Dietzel]] came up with a unique three-platoon system. It consisted of three teams of 11 different players, and was designed to keep his players from being fatigued in an era when most players started on both offense and defense. Instead of replacing individual players during the game, Dietzel would bring in an entirely new set of players between plays and series. The three teams were called the White Team (the first-string offense and defense), the Gold (Go) Team (the second-string offense), and the [[Chinese Bandits]] (the second-string defense).  The system worked, as the Tigers went undefeated and won the national championship. The Chinese Bandits, the second-string defensive unit, which consisted of less-talented but ferocious players, became hugely popular with LSU fans and remains one of the most legendary pieces of LSU football history.&lt;ref&gt;Chet Hilburn, ''The Mystique of Tiger Stadium: 25 Greatest Games: The Ascension of LSU Football'' ([[Bloomington, Indiana]]: WestBow Press, 2012), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1964 season, twelve years since the mandate requiring one-platoon, the NCAA repealed the rules enforcing its use and allowed an unlimited amount of player substitutions.&lt;ref name="border"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athlonsports.com/college-football/4331/17-reasons-why-knute-rockne-wouldnt-recognize-this-game 17 Reasons Why Knute Rockne Wouldn't Recognize This Game], Athlon Sports, retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed, starting with the 1965 season,&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Gallagher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITJWCpaunpoC ''The Express: The Ernie Davis Story''], p. 63, Random House, 2008, {{ISBN|0-345-51086-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; teams to form separate offensive and defensive units as well as "[[special teams]]" which would be employed in kicking situations. The reinstatement of the two-platoon system allowed players to become more specialized by focusing on a limited number of plays and skills related to their specific position.&lt;ref name="border"&gt;K. Adam Powell, Woody Durham, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NkWTt9D_UMcC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=%22one-platoon%22+football&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5JxJqktoRO&amp;sig=uyrs6fkzPZpJBeeX_h9AaElD1-4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=14&amp;ct=result#PPA59,M1 "An Era of Change (1963-1968)] ([[Google search|Google Books]] cache), ''Border Wars: The First Fifty Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football'', Scarecrow Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8108-4839-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-4839-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With players now fresher, coaches could now build their teams for speed and agility rather than brute strength and endurance; [[Don Coryell]] took advantage of the quarterbacks and wide receivers that were overlooked in the days of one-platoon ball to create one of the first predominantly passing offenses in top-level football.&lt;ref name=coryell_dies_sdut&gt;{{cite web

===Quarterbacks===

[[File:Spurrier_1999.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Steve Spurrier]] often used "platooning quarterbacks."]]

When a football team uses two (or more) [[quarterback]]s to run their offense, rather than the traditional one in football, it is known as "platooning quarterbacks."  This tactic becomes less common the higher the level of football ([[high school football|high school]] teams are more likely to do it than [[National Football League]] teams for example).  Quarterbacks may be switched in and out of the game every play, every drive, every quarter, or depending on certain situations.  If quarterbacks are switched game to game that is not platooning, that is a "quarterback controversy" or a simple benching.

Using two different quarterbacks allows an offense to use players with different skill sets.  One common reason teams platoon quarterbacks is because one player is a good passer and the other a good runner (see for example [[Stanley Jackson (American football)|Stanley Jackson]] and [[Joe Germaine]] of the [[1997 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1997 Ohio State Buckeyes]]).  Thus defenses have to prepare for two types of quarterback, not just one.  It also allows offenses to run a greater variety of plays.

The '''Richland High School shooting''' was a [[school shooting]] that occurred on Wednesday, November 15, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EEDC1231F933A25757C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |title= The Well-Marked Roads to Homicidal Rage |newspaper=New York Times |date= April 10, 2000 |author= LAURIE GOODSTEIN and WILLIAM GLABERSON}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lynnville, Tennessee]], a small community located in [[Giles County, Tennessee|Giles County]]. Seventeen-year-old James Ellison "Jamie" Rouse, a senior student at the school, killed one teacher and one student, and seriously wounded another teacher.&lt;ref name="Shooting Stops"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Richrd E.|title=When The Shooting Stops|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/22/news/ss-24169|accessdate=17 December 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=22 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting==
Rouse used a [[Remington Model 522 Viper|.22-calibre Remington Viper]] [[semi-automatic rifle]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140310051132/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/kids1/index_1.html  Crimelibrary.com - School Killers]&lt;/ref&gt; which he hid behind bushes before driving to retrieve his friend. His friend drove Jamie the rest of the way to Richland High School. He parked the car outside the school, and Rouse entered through the north entrance hallway. Inside the hallway he confronted teachers Carolyn Yancey and Carolyn Foster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/12/48hours/main611470.shtml |title=The mind of a school killer |work=48 Hours |publisher=CBS News |author=    Rebecca Leung }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then shot both teachers in the head in the view of over fifty students in the hallway. He then aimed his rifle at football coach Ron Shirey; however, he missed and fatally shot freshman Diane Collins in the throat. He was then tackled by a male student and an Agriculture Teacher, who forcibly took the rifle away from him. Carolyn Foster was killed by a gunshot wound to the head, while Carolyn Yancey survived in serious condition.&lt;ref name="Shooting Stops"/&gt;

Rouse was convicted as an adult of one count of [[first-degree murder]], one count of [[second-degree murder]], and one count of first-degree attempted murder. He was sentenced to [[life in prison]] without the possibility of [[parole]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sino.trellisinteractive.com/nfa/chronology.html Violence Goes to School] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021191956/http://www.sino.trellisinteractive.com/nfa/chronology.html |date=October 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salman Betyrovich Raduyev''' (or '''Raduev'''; {{lang-ru|Салма́н Бетырович Раду́ев}}; February 13, 1967 &amp;ndash; December 14, 2002) was a [[Chechnya|Chechen]] [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[warlord]] considered to be one of the most radical and notorious rebel commanders  of the period between 1994 and 1999. Arrested in 2000, he died in a [[Russia]]n [[penal colony]] under mysterious circumstances.

==Early life==
Raduyev was born in 1967 into the Gordaloy [[teip]] (clan) in Novogroznensky near [[Gudermes]] in eastern Chechnya. During the early 1980s Raduyev was active in the communist youth league [[Komsomol]] of which he eventually became a leader for the whole [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name="salman" /&gt; After attending a high school in Gudermes, Raduyev served 1985-1987 in the [[Soviet Army]] as a construction engineer in a [[Strategic Rocket Forces]] unit stationed in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], where he became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="pravda"/&gt; After demobilization, he studied economics and worked in the Soviet construction industry.

After Chechnya declared independence, he was appointed the [[prefect]] of Gudermes in June 1992 by his [[father-in-law]], [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], who was the president of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].&lt;ref name="salman" /&gt; He also married the daughter of Dudayev's sister.

==Field commander==
During the [[First Chechen War]] Raduyev became a field commander for the separatist Chechen forces. He fought in the [[Battle of Grozny (1994–1995)|battle of Grozny]] and was wounded in March 1995 during an attempt to capture him by the [[Spetsnaz|Russian special forces]]. In October 1995, he became one of the most important of the Chechen field commanders, leading the 6th Brigade based in the strategically important [[Gudermessky District]] and responsible for the Gudermessky, part of the capital [[Grozny]] and the town of [[Argun River (Caucasus)|Argun]]. On December 14, 1995, Raduyev, along with [[Sultan Geliskhanov]], led a raid on the city of Gudermes.

On January 9, 1996, Raduyev, allegedly copying [[Shamil Basayev]]'s [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis|1995 Budyonnovsk attack]] in Chechnya, led a large-scale [[Kizlyar-Pervomayskoye hostage crisis|Kizlyar hostage taking raid]] into the neighboring Russian region of [[Dagestan]], where his men took at least 2,000 civilians hostage. The raid, which made Raduyev world-famous, escalated into an all-out battle that ended with the complete destruction of the border village of Pervomayskoye, and led to other Chechen leaders criticizing the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9601/chechen_rebels/01-24/index.html Chechen rebels survive, prolong hostage crisis], CNN, January 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1996, Raduyev was shot in the head and incorrectly reported dead;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9603/raduyev_dead/index.html Chechen rebel leader killed, reports say], CNN, March 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Russian special forces claimed to have "killed" him in revenge for the Kizlyar attack,&lt;ref name="salman"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20021216/ai_n12662547 Obituary: Salman Raduyev], ''The Independent'', Dec 16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while the other sources said he was shot in a Chechen [[feud]]. On March 7, 63 out of 101 deputies of the [[Parliament of Estonia]] sent condolences to Dudayev expressing "deep sympathy with the Chechen people" on "the loss of commander Raduyev,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Riigikogu ei toeta terrorismi |author=Jaanus Betlem |journal=[[Postimees]] |date=11 March 1996 |url=http://arhiiv2.postimees.ee:8080/leht/96/03/11/arvamus.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626165828/http://arhiiv2.postimees.ee:8080/leht/96/03/11/arvamus.htm |archivedate=2007-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; sparking a row with the [[Russian Duma]]. In fact, Raduyev just disappeared as he went for medical treatment abroad.

==Warlord==
In the summer of 1996, Raduyev returned to the republic and refused the orders of Chechnya's acting president, [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev]], to stop carrying out [[terrorism|terrorist]] operations (he claimed ordering bombings of trolleybuses in [[Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070527185019/http://www.moscowtimes.ru/stories/1996/07/19/002.html Raduyev Resurfaces To Claim Bus Blasts], ''The Moscow Times'', July 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and train stations in [[Armavir, Russia|Armavir]] and [[Pyatigorsk]]), in light of the ceasefire and talks that would lead up to the [[Khasav-Yurt Accord]]. Raduyev even accused Yandarbiyev of [[treason]] for agreeing to a ceasefire and threatened to attack him.&lt;ref name="back"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960719/ai_n14058444 Chechen rebel back from dead to wage holy war], ''The Independent'', Jul 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Raduyev, his face deformed by injury and now hidden behind bushy red beard and black sunglasses, was the only field commander to announce openly that the "war without rules" with Russia would continue despite the signing of [[Russian-Chechen Peace Treaty|the peace agreement]].

In 1997, the newly elected Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]] stripped Raduyev of the rank of [[brigadier general]] to [[Private (rank)|private]]. However, further action was blocked by a public opposition from Raduyev-led war veterans, including a prolonged rally in Grozny. This rally ended in a shootout, resulting in the deaths of both the commander of Raduyev's militia, Vakha Dzhafarov, and of the Chechen security forces chief Lechi Khultygov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amina.com/article/ser_sky.html A serene sky over Ichkeria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612125023/http://www.amina.com/article/ser_sky.html |date=2008-06-12 }}, Chechen Republic Online&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Raduyev kept claiming responsibility for every explosion in Russia, including even official [[gas leak]]s. He claimed that Dudayev, who had died in 1996, was still alive,&lt;ref name="back" /&gt; and issuing orders to him from "a secret [[NATO]] base in [[Turkey]]" with the goal of the "liberation" of the entire [[North Caucasus]].

Raduyev was captured in March 2000 by the Russian special operations FSB unit ''[[Vympel]]'' in his home in Novogroznensky; During the second war Salman was very ill and had to go for treatment abroad, so he shaved his beard and moved to a house near the borders in preparation for the exit. One of his men, however, informed the Russian forces about his location, he was arrested without incident.

==Death==

In contrast, gametes are cells that fuse during [[sexual reproduction]], [[germ cell]]s are cells that give rise to gametes, and [[stem cells]] are cells that can divide through [[mitosis]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into diverse specialized cell types. For example, in [[mammal]]s, somatic cells make up all the internal organs, skin, bones, blood and connective tissue, while mammalian germ cells give rise to [[spermatozoa]] and [[ovum|ova]] which fuse during [[fertilization]] to produce a cell called a [[zygote]], which divides and differentiates into the cells of an [[embryo]]. There are approximately 220 types of somatic cells in the human body.&lt;ref name="campbell229"/&gt;

Theoretically, these cells are not germ cells (the source of gametes); they never transmit to their descendants the mutations they have undergone. However, in [[sponge]]s, non-differentiated somatic cells form the germ line and, in [[Cnidaria]], differentiated somatic cells are the source of the germline.

The word "somatic" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''sōma'', meaning "body".

==Evolution==
As [[multicellularity]] evolved many times, sterile somatic cells did too. The evolution of an immortal [[germline]] producing specialized somatic cells involved the emergence of [[Death#In biology|mortality]], and can be viewed in its simplest version in [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3098969 | pmid=21174128 | doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 | volume=24 | title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae | year=2011 | journal=Sex. Plant Reprod. | pages=97–112 | author=Hallmann A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those species with a separation between sterile somatic cells and a germ line are called [[Weismann barrier|Weismannists]]. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g., [[vertebrate]]s, [[arthropod]]s, ''[[Volvox]]''), as a great number of species have the capacity for [[somatic embryogenesis]] (e.g., [[land plant]]s, most [[algae]], many [[invertebrates]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 29-297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niklas, K. J. (2014) [http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/1/6.long The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics and chromosome content==
Like all cells, somatic cells contain [[DNA]] arranged in [[chromosome]]s.  If a somatic cell contains chromosomes arranged in pairs, it is called [[diploid]] and the organism is called a diploid organism. (The gametes of diploid organisms contain only single unpaired chromosomes and are called [[haploid]].)  Each pair of chromosomes comprises one chromosome inherited from the father and one inherited from the mother. For example, in humans, somatic cells contain 46 [[chromosomes]] organized into 23 pairs.  By contrast, gametes of diploid organisms contain only half as many chromosomes. In humans, this is 23 unpaired chromosomes. When two gametes (i.e. a spermatozoon and an ovum) meet during conception, they fuse together, creating a [[zygote]]. Due to the fusion of the two gametes, a human zygote contains 46 chromosomes (i.e. 23 pairs).

However, a large number of [[species]] have the chromosomes in their somatic cells arranged in fours ("[[tetraploid]]") or even sixes ("[[hexaploid]]"). Thus, they can have diploid or even triploid germline cells. An example of this is the modern cultivated species of [[wheat]], ''Triticum aestivum L.'', a hexaploid species whose somatic cells contain six copies of every [[chromatid]].

The frequency of spontaneous [[mutation]]s is significantly lower in advanced male [[germ cell]]s than in somatic cell types from the same individual.&lt;ref name="pmid9707592"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB |title=Mutation frequency declines during spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=95 |issue=17 |pages=10015–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9707592 |pmc=21453 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.95.17.10015|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Female germ cells also show a mutation frequency that is lower than that in corresponding somatic cells and similar to that in male germ cells.&lt;ref name="pmid23153565"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphey P, McLean DJ, McMahan CA, Walter CA, McCarrey JR |title=Enhanced genetic integrity in mouse germ cells |journal=Biol.

Such mechanisms likely include elevated levels of [[DNA repair]] enzymes that ameliorate most potentially mutagenic [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damages]].&lt;ref name="pmid23153565" /&gt;

==Cloning==
In recent years, the technique of [[cloning]] whole organisms has been developed in mammals, allowing almost identical genetic clones of an animal to be produced. One method of doing this is called "[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]" and involves removing the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] from a somatic cell, usually a skin cell. This nucleus contains all of the genetic information needed to produce the organism it was removed from. This nucleus is then injected into an [[ovum]] of the same species which has had its own genetic material removed. The ovum now no longer needs to be fertilized, because it contains the correct amount of genetic material (a [[diploid]] number of [[chromosomes]]). In theory, the ovum can be implanted into the [[uterus]] of a same-species animal and allowed to develop. The resulting animal will be a nearly genetically identical clone to the animal from which the nucleus was taken. The only difference is caused by any [[mitochondria]]l DNA that is retained in the ovum, which is different from the cell that donated the nucleus.  In practice, this technique has so far been problematic, although there have been a few high-profile successes, such as [[Dolly the Sheep]] and, more recently, [[Snuppy]], the first cloned [[dog]].
Somatic cells have also been collected in the practice of [[cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] as a means of conserving animal genetic material, including to clone livestock.

==Genetic Modifications==
Development of [[biotechnology]] has allowed for the genetic manipulation of somatic cells, whether for the modelling of chronic disease or for the prevention of malaise conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 generates and corrects a metabolic disease|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44624|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Commits $190M to Somatic Gene-Editing Tools/Tech Research|url=https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/nih-commits-190m-to-somatic-gene-editing-toolstech-research/81255414|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic engineering of somatic cells has resulted in some [[Human genetic engineering#Controversy|controversies]], although the International Summit on Human Gene Editing has released a statement in support of genetic modification of somatic cells, as the modifications thereof are not passed on to offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Treat Gene Editing Differently In Two Types Of Human Cells?|url=http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-treat-gene-editing-differently-two-types-human-cells/|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bone remodels in response to stress in order to maintain constant strain energy per bone mass throughout.&lt;ref name=Marzban&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iris.lib.neu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=mech_eng_theses |title=Different approaches of remodeling of bone to predict bone density distribution of proximal femur |date=January 1, 2008 |author=Ali Marzban |accessdate=2013-02-23 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To do this, it grows more dense in areas experiencing high stress, while resorbing density in areas experiencing low stress.

==Countermeasures==
[[File:TVIS treadmill.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut [[Sunita Williams|Sunita "Suni" Williams]] bungeed to the [[Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization|TVIS treadmill]] aboard the [[International Space Station]].]]
Since Gemini, exercise has been tried as a way of preventing bone loss, but it has not been shown to be successful. This may be in part due to lack of adequately designed studies (no controlled study had been done as of 2005, either in space or using bedrest as an attempt to simulate conditions which lead to bone loss). It is not known whether a different exercise regimen (perhaps including larger loads than past ones) would be effective.&lt;ref name="cavanagh"/&gt;

Increasing dietary [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] is a standard countermeasure for [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="cavanagh"/&gt;  [[Clay]] is reportedly used by NASA for retaining calcium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080403060558/http://research.calacademy.org/calwild/2005winter/stories/mud.html Ubick, Suzanne; ''Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud,'' The Magazine of the California Academy of Sciences, Apr. 3, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of drug remedies currently used or proposed for osteoporosis may work for spaceflight, including [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone therapy]] (estrogen and/or progestin), [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s, [[bisphosphonate]]s, [[teriparatide]], and others. Whether they can provide the same benefits for spaceflight as they do for osteoporosis is not yet known.&lt;ref name="cavanagh"/&gt;

[[File:Elephants in Kenya.jpg|thumb|270px|[[African elephant]]s form the [[genus]] ''Loxodonta'', a widely accepted taxon.]]

In [[biology]], a '''taxon''' (plural '''taxa'''; [[back-formation]] from ''[[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]'') is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular [[Taxonomic rank|ranking]], especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal [[scientific name]], its use is then governed by one of the [[nomenclature codes]] specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping.

Although preceded by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]'s system in ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (10th edition, 1758)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Quammen |first=David |title=A Passion for Order |publisher=National Geographic Magazine |date=June 2007 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2007/06/linnaeus-name-giver/david-quammen-text |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unpublished work by [[Bernard de Jussieu|Bernard]] and [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]], the notion of a unit-based "natural system" of [[biological classification]] was first made widely available in 1805 through the publication, as the introduction to the third edition of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ''Flore françoise'', of [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]]'s ''Principes élémentaires de botanique'', an exposition of a system for the "natural classification" of plants. Since then, systematists have striven to construct an accurate classification encompassing the diversity of life; today, a "good" or "useful" taxon is commonly taken to be one that reflects [[Phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This is not considered as mandatory, however, as indicated by terms for non-[[Monophyly|monophyletic]] groupings ("invertebrates", "conifers", "fish", etc).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many modern systematists, such as advocates of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], use [[Cladistics|cladistic]] methods that require taxa to be [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] (all descendants of some ancestor). Their basic unit, therefore, is the [[clade]] rather than the taxon. Similarly, among those contemporary taxonomists working with the traditional [[Binomial nomenclature|Linnean (binomial) nomenclature]], few propose taxa they know to be [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Phylogeny as a Central Principle in Taxonomy: Phylogenetic Definitions of Taxon Names |author=de Queiroz, K &amp; J Gauthier |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=39 |issue=4 |year=1990 |pages=307–322 |url=http://vertebrates.si.edu/herps/herps_pdfs/deQueiroz_pdfs/1990deQ_GauSZ.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2307/2992353 |jstor=2992353}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a well-established taxon that is not also a clade is the [[Class (biology)|class]] [[Reptile|Reptilia]], the reptiles; birds are descendants of reptiles but are not included in the Reptilia.

== History ==
The term ''taxon'' was first used in 1926 by [[:de:Adolf Meyer-Abich|Adolf Meyer-Abich]] for animal groups, as a backformation from the word [[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]]; the word ''Taxonomy'' had been coined a century before from the Greek components ''[[wiktionary:τάξις|τάξις]]'' ([[taxis]], meaning arrangement) and ''[[wiktionary:νόμος|-νομία]]'' ([[:wikt:-nomy|-nomia]] meaning [[Scientific method|method]]).&lt;ref name="AdnetSenut2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Sylvain Adnet |author2= Brigitte Senut |author3= Thierry Tortosa |author4= Romain Amiot, Julien Claude, Sébastien Clausen, Anne-Laure Decombeix, Vincent Fernandez, Grégoire Métais, Brigitte Meyer-Berthaud, Serge Muller |title= Principes de paléontologie |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SUz8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122|date=25 September 2013|publisher=Dunod|isbn=978-2-10-070313-5|pages=122|quote=La taxinomie s'enrichit avec l'invenition du mot «taxon» par Adolf Meyer-Abich, naturaliste allemand, dans sa Logik der morphologie, im Rahmen einer Logik der gesamten Biologie (1926) [Translation: Taxonomy is enriched by the invention of the word "taxon" by Adolf Meyer-Abich, German naturalist, in his Logik der morphologie, im Rahmen einer Logik der gesamten Biologie (1926).]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer-Abich|first=Adolf|title=Logik der Morphologie im Rahmen einer Logik der gesamten Biologie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8miBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|year=1926|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3-642-50733-5|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; For plants, it was proposed by [[Herman Johannes Lam]] in 1948, and it was adopted at the VII [[International Botanical Congress]], held in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Naik, V. N. (1984). Taxonomy of Angiosperms. Tata McGraw Hill, New Delhi, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

*"taxon, (pl. taxa), n.

::A taxonomic unit, whether named or not: i.e. a population, or group of populations of organisms which are usually inferred to be phylogenetically related and which have characters in common which differentiate (q.v.) the unit (e.g. a geographic population, a genus, a family, an order) from other such units. A taxon encompasses all included taxa of lower rank (q.v.) and individual organisms. [...]"

== Ranks ==
{{Biological classification}}

A taxon can be assigned a [[taxonomic rank]], usually (but not necessarily) when it is given a formal name.

"Phylum" applies formally to any biological [[domain (biology)|domain]], but traditionally it was always used for animals, whereas "Division" was traditionally often used for [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], etc.

A prefix is used to indicate a ranking of lesser importance. The prefix ''super-'' indicates a rank above, the prefix ''sub-'' indicates a rank below. In zoology the prefix ''infra-'' indicates a rank below ''sub-''.  For instance, among the additional ranks of [[Class (biology)|class]] are superclass, subclass and infraclass.

Rank is relative, and restricted to a particular systematic schema. For example, [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]] have been grouped, in various systems of classification, as a family, order, class, or division (phylum). The use of a narrow set of ranks is challenged by users of [[cladistics]]; for example, the mere 10 ranks traditionally used between animal families (governed by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]) and animal phyla (usually the highest relevant rank in taxonomic work) often cannot adequately represent the evolutionary history as more about a lineage's [[phylogeny]] becomes known. In addition, the class rank is quite often not an evolutionary but a [[phenetic]] or [[paraphyletic]] group and as opposed to those ranks governed by the ICZN (family-level, genus-level and [[species]]-level taxa), can usually not be made monophyletic by exchanging the taxa contained therein. This has given rise to [[phylogenetic taxonomy]] and the ongoing development of the ''[[PhyloCode]]'', which has been proposed as a new alternative to replace Linnean classification and govern the application of names to [[clade]]s.  Many cladists do not see any need to depart from traditional nomenclature as governed by the ICZN, [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]], etc.

'''''The All Souls' Waiting Room''''' is a 2002 half fiction, half non-fiction, [[autobiographical novel]] from [[Paki S. Wright]].

==Content==
Johnnine Hapgood, the woman who is the hero of the novel, had been born into a family that lived in the milieu of [[Wilhelm Reich|Reichian]] psychoanalysts in the 1940s in New York City.

During a suicide attempt with alcohol and pills in 1962, she has a [[Near death experience]], leading her to the All Souls' Waiting Room, which is a copy of the city of Vienna, where [[psychoanalysis]] had been born, especially [[Sigmund Freud]]'s counseling room, the Bibliothek (Library at the Hofburg), the Hotel Sacher and so on.

During the experience she is shown a film about her life, and learns things about spiritual development and about reincarnation and the female principle, represented through a person named Xofia. She meets Freud, [[Wilhelm Reich]], and [[Carl Jung]], and is then returned to her apartment.

While the events and persons in the Waiting Room, for example Xofia and The (Akashic) Recorder, are fiction, there are other things and persons, such as Wilhelm Reich and Carl Jung, who are real, and with respect to Reich's UFO sightings during the work with the [[Cloudbuster]], and some other events, it is not easy to tell if the story is fiction or not.

'''''The Trojan Women''''' ({{lang-grc|Τρῳάδες}}, ''Trōiades''), also known by its Latin title '''''Troades''''', is a [[tragedy]] by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[playwright]] [[Euripides]]. Produced in 415 BC during the [[Peloponnesian War]], it is often considered a commentary on the capture of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] island of [[Milos|Melos]] and the subsequent slaughter and subjugation of its populace by the [[Athens|Athenians]] earlier that year ''(see [[Milos#History|History of Milos]])''.&lt;ref&gt;See Croally 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 415 BC was also the year of the scandalous desecration of the ''[[herma]]i'' and the Athenians' second expedition to [[Sicily]], events which may also have influenced the author.

''The Trojan Women'' was the third tragedy of a trilogy dealing with the [[Trojan War]]. The first tragedy, ''Alexandros'', was about the recognition of the Trojan prince Paris who had been abandoned in infancy by his parents and rediscovered in adulthood. The second tragedy, ''[[Palamedes (play)|Palamedes]]'', dealt with Greek mistreatment of their fellow Greek [[Palamedes (Greek mythology)|Palamedes]]. This trilogy was presented at the [[Dionysia]] along with the comedic [[satyr play]] ''Sisyphos''. The plots of this trilogy were not connected in the way that Aeschylus' ''Oresteia'' was connected. Euripides did not favor such connected trilogies.

Euripides won second prize at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] for his effort, losing to the obscure tragedian [[Xenocles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus]]: ''Varia Historia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/aelian/varhist2.xhtml 2.8.] (page may cause problems with [[Internet Explorer]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The four Trojan women of the play are the same that appear in the final book of the ''[[Iliad]]'' lamenting over the corpse of [[Hector]]. Taking place near the same time is ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', another play by Euripides.

==Plot==

{{Quotation|[[Hecuba]]: ''Alas! Alas! Alas! Ilion is ablaze; the fire consumes the citadel, the roofs of our city, the tops of the walls!''&lt;br /&gt;
Chorus: ''Like smoke blown to heaven on the wings of the wind, our country, our conquered country, perishes. Its palaces are overrun by the fierce flames and the murderous spear.''&lt;br /&gt;
Hecuba: ''O land that reared my children!''}}

Euripides's play follows the fates of the women of [[Troy]] after their city has been sacked, their husbands killed, and as their remaining families are about to be taken away as slaves. However, it begins first with the gods [[Athena]] and [[Poseidon]] discussing ways to punish the Greek armies because they condoned that [[Ajax the Lesser]] raped [[Cassandra]], the eldest daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, after dragging her from a statue of Athena. What follows shows how much the Trojan women have suffered as their grief is compounded when the Greeks dole out additional deaths and divide their shares of women.

The Greek herald [[Talthybius]] arrives to tell the dethroned queen Hecuba what will befall her and her children. Hecuba will be taken away with the Greek general [[Odysseus]], and Cassandra is destined to become the conquering general Agamemnon's [[Concubinage|concubine]].

[[File:Trojan women cassandra.jpg|thumb|Karen Tiegren (Cassandra) in ''The Trojan Women,'' directed by [[Brad Mays]] at the [[ARK Theatre Company]] in [[Los Angeles]], 2003]]
Cassandra, who can see the future, is morbidly delighted by this news: she sees that when they arrive in [[Argos]], her new master's embittered wife [[Clytemnestra]] will kill both her and her new master. However, Cassandra is also cursed so that her visions of the future are never believed, and she is carried off.

The widowed princess [[Andromache]] arrives and Hecuba learns from her that her youngest daughter, [[Polyxena]], has been killed as a sacrifice at the tomb of the Greek warrior [[Achilles]].

[[File:Trojan Women - Andromache.jpg|thumb|left|Aomawa Baker (Andromache) in ''The Trojan Women,'' directed by Brad Mays at the ARK Theatre Company in Los Angeles, 2003]]
Andromache's lot is to be the concubine of [[Achilles]]' son [[Neoptolemus]], and more horrible news for the royal family is yet to come: Talthybius reluctantly informs her that her baby son, [[Astyanax]], has been condemned to die. The Greek leaders are afraid that the boy will grow up to avenge his father Hector, and rather than take this chance, they plan to throw him off from the battlements of Troy to his death.

[[Helen of Troy|Helen]], though not one of the Trojan women, is supposed to suffer greatly as well: [[Menelaus]] arrives to take her back to Greece with him where a death sentence awaits her. Helen begs and tries to seduce her husband into sparing her life. Menelaus remains resolved to kill her, but the audience watching the play knows that he will let her live and take her back. At the end of the play it is revealed that she is still alive; moreover, the audience knows from Telemachus' visit to Sparta in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' that Menelaus continued to live with Helen as his wife after the Trojan War.

[[File:Trojan Women - Helen &amp; Menaleusonline.jpg|thumb|Shelley DeLane (Helen) and Pab Schwendimann (Menelaus) in ''The Trojan Women,'' directed by Brad Mays at the ARK Theatre Company in Los Angeles, 2003]]
In the end, Talthybius returns, carrying with him the body of little Astyanax on [[Hector]]'s shield. Andromache's wish had been to bury her child herself, performing the proper rituals according to Trojan ways, but her ship had already departed. Talthybius gives the corpse to Hecuba, who prepares the body of her grandson for burial before they are finally taken off with Odysseus.

Throughout the play, many of the Trojan women lament the loss of the land that reared them. Hecuba in particular lets it be known that Troy had been her home for her entire life, only to see herself as an old grandmother watching the burning of Troy, the death of her husband, her children, and her grandchildren before she will be taken as a slave to Odysseus.

==Modern Treatments and Adaptations==

In 1974, Ellen Stewart, founder of La MaMa Experimental Theater Club in New York, presented "The Trojan Women" as the last Fragment of a Trilogy (including Medea and Electra).  With staging by Romanian-born theater director Andrei Serban and music by American composer Elizabeth Swados, this production of The Trojan Women went on to tour more than thirty countries over the course of forty years.  Since 2014, The Trojan Women Project has been sharing this production with diverse communities that now include Guatemala, Cambodia and Kosovo.  A Festival of work from all participants is scheduled for December, 2019.

The French [[Intellectual|public intellectual]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote a version of ''The Trojan Women'' that mostly is faithful to the original Greek text, yet includes veiled references to European [[imperialism]] in Asia, and emphases of [[existentialism|existentialist]] themes. The Israeli playwright [[Hanoch Levin]] also wrote his own version of the play, adding more disturbing scenes and scatological details.

A 1905 stage version, translated by [[Gilbert Murray]], starred [[Gertrude Kingston]] as [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/desmond-maccarthy/the-court-theatre-1904-1907-a-commentary-and-criticism-with-an-appendix-conta-hci/page-10-the-court-theatre-1904-1907-a-commentary-and-criticism-with-an-appendix-conta-hci.shtml] MacCarthy, Desmond ''The Court Theatre, 1904-1907; a Commentary and Criticism''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican film ''Las Troyanas'' (1963) directed by [[Sergio Véjar]], adapted by writer Miguel Angel Garibay and Véjar, is faithful to the Greek text and setting; [[Ofelia Guilmain]] portrays Hecuba, the black&amp;white photography is by Agustín Jimenez.

Cypriot-Greek director [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]] used Euripides' play (in the famous [[Edith Hamilton]] translation) as the basis for his 1971 film ''[[The Trojan Women (film)|The Trojan Women]]''. The movie starred [[United States|American]] actress [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Hecuba, [[Great Britain|British]] actors [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[Brian Blessed]] as Andromache and Talthybius, [[Canada|French-Canadian]] actress [[Geneviève Bujold]] as Cassandra, [[Greece|Greek]] actress [[Irene Papas]] as Helen, and [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], an actor born in [[Northern Ireland]], as Menelaus.

[[David Stuttard]]’s 2001 adaptation, ''Trojan Women'',&lt;ref&gt;Stuttard, David, ''An Introduction to Trojan Women'' (Brighton 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; written in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], has toured widely within the UK and been staged internationally. In an attempt to reposition ''The Trojan Women'' as the third play of a trilogy, Stuttard then reconstructed Euripides’ lost ''Alexandros'' and ''Palamedes'' (in 2005 and 2006 respectively), to form a 'Trojan Trilogy', which was performed in readings at the [[British Museum]] and [[Tristan Bates Theatre]] (2007), and Europe House, Smith Square (2012), London. He has also written a version of the [[satyr play]] ''Sisyphus'' (2008), which rounded off Euripides’ original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/Practitioners/issue1/stuttard.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;davidstuttard.com/Trojan_Trilogy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Femi Osofisan]]'s 2004 play ''[[Women of Owu]]'' sets the story in 1821, after the conquest of the [[Owu kingdom]] by a coalition of other West African states. Although it is set in 19th century Africa, Osofisan has said that the play was also inspired by the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. led coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osofisan|first1=Femi|title=Women of Owu|date=2006|publisher=University Press PLC|location=Ibadan, Nigeria|isbn=9780690263|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another movie based on the play came out in 2004, directed by [[Brad Mays]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nQ1PSLJAdSQC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=%22Brad+MAys%22+Bacchae&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=22GxS7ahKJC6swPQyMWOAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Brad%20MAys%22%20Bacchae&amp;f=false ''Troy: From Homer's Iliad to Hollywood Epic,'' by Martin M.

In anticipation of his soon-to-come [[multimedia]] production of ''[[A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music|A Clockwork Orange]]'', Mays utilized a marginal multimedia approach to the play, opening the piece with a faux [[CNN]] report intended to echo the then-current war in [[Iraq]].

[[Charles L. Mee]] adapted ''The Trojan Women'' to have a more modern, updated outlook on war. He included original interviews with [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and [[Hiroshima]] survivors. His play is called ''Trojan Women: A Love Story''.

''The Women of Troy'', directed by [[Katie Mitchell]], was performed at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in London in 2007/08. The cast included [[Kate Duchêne]] as Hecuba, Sinead Matthews as Cassandra and [[Anastasia Hille]] as Andromache.

''The Trojan Women'', directed by [[Marti Maraden]], was performed at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] at the Tom Patterson Theatre in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada, from May 14 to October 5, 2008 with Canadian actress [[Martha Henry]] as Hecuba.

[[Sheri Tepper]] wove ''The Trojan Women'' into her [[feminist science fiction]] novel ''[[The Gate to Women's Country]]''.

Christine Evans reworks and modernizes the ''Trojan Women'' story in her 2009 play ''Trojan Barbie''. ''Trojan Barbie'' is a postmodern updating, which blends the modern and ancient worlds, as contemporary London doll repair shop owner Lotte is pulled into a Trojan women's prison camp that is located in both ancient Troy and the modern Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=“Trojan Barbie: A Car-Crash Encounter with Euripides’ ‘Trojan Women’” by newest faculty member Christine Evans|url=https://performingarts.georgetown.edu/trojan-barbie|website=Department of Performing Arts|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Zoe Lafferty's version of the play, ''Queens of Syria'', in Arabic with English subtitles, was put on by the [[Young Vic]] before touring Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Masters |first1=Tim |title=Queens of Syria gives modern twist to ancient tale |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36711948 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=6 July 2016 |date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water cure''' is a form of [[torture]] in which the victim is forced to drink large quantities of water in a short time, resulting in [[gastric distension]], [[water intoxication]], and possibly [[death]].&lt;ref name=lens /&gt;&lt;ref name=Korry2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zeller2007 /&gt;

Often the victim has the [[Human mouth|mouth]] forced or wedged open, the [[Human nose|nose]] closed with pincers and a [[funnel]] or strip of cloth forced down the throat. The victim has to drink all the [[water]] (or other [[liquid]]s such as bile or urine) poured into the funnel to avoid [[drowning]]. The stomach fills until near bursting and is sometimes beaten until the victim [[vomiting|vomits]] and the torture begins again.

While this use of water as a form of torture is documented back to at least the 15th century,&lt;ref name=npr /&gt; the first use of the phrase '''water cure''' in this sense is indirectly dated to around 1898, by [[U.S. Army|U.S. soldiers]] in the [[Spanish–American War]],&lt;ref name=wp /&gt;{{efn|The late 19th century expropriation of the term ''water cure'', already in use in the therapeutic sense, to denote the polar opposite of therapy, namely torture, has the hallmark of arising in the sense of irony. This would be in keeping with some of the reactions to water cure therapy and its promotion, which included not only criticism, but also parody and satire.&lt;ref name=HoodSatiricalreview /&gt;&lt;ref name=LarksShakespeareWaterCure /&gt;
}} after the phrase had been introduced to America in the mid-19th century in the therapeutic sense, which was in widespread use.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe1898 /&gt; Indeed, while the torture sense of the phrase ''water cure'' was by 1900–1902 established in the U.S. Army,&lt;ref name=Kramer2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lensp188 /&gt; with a conscious sense of irony,&lt;ref name=Sturtz1907 /&gt; this sense was not in widespread use. ''Webster's'' 1913 dictionary cited only the therapeutic sense.&lt;ref name=Watercuredef1913 /&gt;

== Historical uses ==

=== East-Indies ===
The use of the water cure by the Dutch in the East-Indies is documented by the English merchants of the East India Company after the [[Amboyna massacre]] in February 1623 (stilo veteri). The procedure is described in great detail by the survivors of the incident.&lt;ref name="UIN: BLL01011844448"&gt;{{cite book|title=A True Relation of the late unjust, cruel and barbarous proceedings against the English at Amboyna|year=1624|publisher=John Skinner of the East India Company|location=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The manner of his torture was as follows: First they hoisted him up by the hands with a cord on a large door, where they made him fast upon two staples of iron, fixed on both sides, at the top of the door posts, having his hands one from the other as wide as they could stretch. Being thus made fast, his feet hung some two foot from the ground; which also they stretched asunder as far as they would stretch, and so made them fast beneath unto the door trees on each side. Then they bound a cloth about his neck and face so close, that little or no water could go by. That done, they poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was full, up to the mouth and nostrils, and somewhat higher; so that he could not draw breath, but he must with all suck in the water: which being still continued to be poured in softly, forced all his inward parts, come out of his nose, ears, eyes, and often as it were stifling and choking him, at length took away his breath, and brought him to a swoon or fainting. Then they took him quickly down, and made him vomit up the water. Being a little recovered, they trussed him up again, and poured water as before, taking him down as soon as he seemed to be stifled. In this manner they handled him three or four several times with water, until his body was swollen twice or thrice as big as before, his cheeks like great bladders, and his eyes staring and strutting out beyond his forehead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== France ===
[[File:Marquise de Brinvilliers.jpg|thumb|right|Marquise of Brinvilliers being tortured.]]

Water torture was used extensively and legally by the courts of France from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 17th and 18th centuries.  It was known as being put to "the question", with the '''ordinary question''' involving the forcing of one gallon (eight [[pint]]s or approximately 3.6 [[litre]]s) of water into the stomach and the '''extraordinary question''' involving the forcing of two gallons (sixteen pints or approximately 7.3 litres).

The French poet and criminal [[François Villon]] was subjected to this torture in 1461.&lt;ref name=JanetPierre /&gt; [[Jean Calas]] suffered this torture before being [[Breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]] in 1762.&lt;ref name=Harvey2000 /&gt; The true case of the [[Madame de Brinvilliers|Marquise of Brinvilliers]] was reported in fiction by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in "The Leather Funnel", by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], in ''The Marquise de Brinvilliers''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1175/__P6.HTM ''The Marquise de Brinvilliers'' at Intratext]&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Émile Gaboriau]] in ''Intrigues of a Poisoner''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BoCAAAAQAAJ ''Intrigues of a Poisoner'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
A form of water cure known as the [[Schwedentrunk|Swedish drink]] was used by various international troops against the German population during the [[Thirty Years' War]].

=== Spain ===
Water cure was among the forms of torture used by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The Inquisition at [[Málaga]] subjected the Scottish traveller [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] to this torture, among other methods, in 1620. He described his ordeal in ''Rare Adventures and Painful Peregrinations'' (1632) :&lt;ref name=Hadfield2001 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first and second [measures of water] I gladly received, such was the scorching drought of my tormenting pain, and likewise I had drunk none for three days before. But afterward, at the third charge, perceiving these measures of water to be inflicted upon me as tortures, O strangling tortures! I closed my lips, gainstanding that eager crudelity. Whereat the alcalde enraging, set my teeth asunder with a pair of iron cadges, detaining them there, at every several turn, both mainly and manually; whereupon my hunger-clunged belly waxing great, grew drum-like imbolstered: for it being a suffocating pain, in regard of my head hanging downward, and the water reingorging itself in my throat with a struggling force; it strangled and swallowed up my breath from yowling and groaning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before pouring the water, torturers often inserted an iron prong (known as the ''bostezo'') into a victim's mouth to keep it open, as well as a strip of linen (known as the ''toca'') on which the victim would choke and suffocate while swallowing the water.&lt;ref name=HenryCharlesLea /&gt;

=== United States ===
[[File:Woman's Christian Temperance Union Cartoon.jpg|thumb|275px|This 1902 cartoon from the ''Hawaiian Gazette'' shows a [[WCTU]] activist using the water cure to torture a brewmaster as the [[Anti-Saloon League]] mans the pump]]
The  water cure was brought to the Philippines during Spanish colonial rule, and passed on to Americans by Filipinos in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Stephen Kinzer|title=The True Flag: Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain, and the Birth of American Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tPqdDAAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-62779-217-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tPqdDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=%22water+cure%22+%22spanish+inquisition%22 150]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikiquote|Philippine–American War#Water torture|this topic}}

[[File:Life 05-22-1902.JPG|thumb|right|Cartoon on the May 22, 1902 cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine depicting American application of the water cure while Europeans watch. The caption reads: "Chorus in background: 'Those pious Yankees can't throw stones at us any more.{{'"}}]]

The water cure was among the forms of torture used by American soldiers on [[Philippines|Filipinos]] during the [[Philippine–American War]].&lt;ref name=MilleronTaft /&gt;&lt;ref name=Welch1973 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SecretaryRoot /&gt; President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] privately assured a friend that the water cure was "an old Filipino method of mild torture. Nobody was seriously damaged whereas the Filipinos had inflicted incredible tortures on our people."&lt;ref name=Morison1902 /&gt; The president went further, stating, "Nevertheless, torture is not a thing that we can tolerate." However, a report at the time noted its lethality; "a soldier who was with [[Frederick Funston|General Funston]] had stated that he helped to administer the water cure to one hundred and sixty natives, all but twenty-six of whom died".&lt;ref name=SecretaryRoot /&gt; See the [[Lodge Committee]] for detailed testimony of the use of the water cure.

U.S. Army Major Edwin Glenn was suspended from command for one month and fined $50 for using the water cure in an incident which occurred on November 27, 1900. The Army judge advocate said the charges constituted "resort to torture with a view to extort a confession" and recommended disapproval because "the United States cannot afford to sanction the addition of torture".&lt;ref name=Kramer2008 /&gt;{{efn|A 2008 article on the [[National Public Radio]] website mistakenly asserted that this incident occurred during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name=npr /&gt; However, that war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] on December 10, 1898.}}

Lieutenant Grover Flint during the Philippine–American War:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A man is thrown down on his back and three or four men sit or stand on his arms and legs and hold him down; and either a gun barrel or a rifle barrel or a carbine barrel or a stick as big as a [[belaying pin]],{{spaced ndash}}that is, with an inch circumference,{{spaced ndash}}is simply thrust into his jaws and his jaws are thrust back, and, if possible, a wooden log or stone is put under his head or neck, so he can be held more firmly. In the case of very old men I have seen their teeth fall out,{{spaced ndash}}I mean when it was done a little roughly. He is simply held down and then water is poured onto his face down his throat and nose from a jar; and that is kept up until the man gives some sign or becomes unconscious. And, when he becomes unconscious, he is simply rolled aside and he is allowed to come to. In almost every case the men have been a little roughly handled. They were rolled aside rudely, so that water was expelled. A man suffers tremendously, there is no doubt about it. His sufferings must be that of a man who is drowning, but cannot drown.&lt;ref name=MilleronPhilippines /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''The Forging of the American Empire'' [[Sidney Lens]] recounted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A reporter for the New York Evening Post (April 8, 1902) gave some harrowing details. The native, he said, is thrown on the ground, his arms and legs pinned down, and head partially raised "so as to make pouring in the water an easier matter". If the prisoner tries to keep his mouth closed, his nose is pinched to cut off the air and force him to open his mouth, or a bamboo stick is put in the opening. In this way water is steadily poured in, one, two, three, four, five gallons, until the body becomes "an object frightful to contemplate". In this condition, of course, speech is impossible, so the water is squeezed out of the victim, sometimes naturally, and sometimes{{spaced ndash}}as a young soldier with a smile told the correspondent{{spaced ndash}}"we jump on them to get it out quick." One or two such treatments and the prisoner either talks or dies.&lt;ref name=lens /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Police ====
The use of "[[third degree interrogation]]" techniques in order to compel confession, ranging from "psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture", was widespread in early American policing as late as the 1930s. Author Daniel G. Lassiter classified the water cure as "orchestrated physical abuse", and described the police technique as a "modern day variation of the method of water torture that was popular during the Middle Ages." The technique employed by the police involved either holding the head in water until almost drowning, or laying on the back and forcing water into the mouth or nostrils.&lt;ref name=Lassiter2004 /&gt;{{rp|47}} Such techniques were classified as "'covert' third degree torture" since they left no signs of physical abuse, and became popular after 1910 when the direct application of physical violence in order to force a confession became a media issue and some courts began to deny obviously compelled confessions.&lt;ref name=leo /&gt;{{rp|42}} The publication of this information in 1931 as part of the [[Wickersham Commission]]'s "Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement" led to a decline in the use of third degree police interrogation techniques in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=leo /&gt;{{rp|38}}

=== Japan ===
During [[World War II]], water cure was among the forms of torture used by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] troops (especially the [[Kempeitai]]) in occupied territory. A report from the postwar [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] summarized it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The so-called "water treatment" was commonly used. The victim was bound or otherwise secured in a prone position; and water was forced through his mouth and nostrils into his lungs and stomach until he lost consciousness. Pressure was then applied, sometimes by jumping upon his abdomen to force the water out. The usual practice was to revive the victim and successively repeat the process.&lt;ref name=IntMilTribunal /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chase Nielsen|Chase J. Nielson]], who was captured in the [[Doolittle raid]], testified at the trial of his captors, "I was given several types of torture … I was given what they call the water cure" and it felt "more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death."&lt;ref name=wp /&gt;

=== Philippines ===
The water cure has had a long history of use in during Philippines's colonial history, having been used during the Spanish, American, and Japanese occupations.  After Philippine Independence in 1945, the most notable instances of its use by the Philippine government was by the dictatorship of former President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref name="Marcelo2016"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/579676/torture-victims-tell-sc-of-tales-of-horror-under-marcos-martial-law/story/ |title=ORAL ARGUMENTS ON HERO’S BURIAL: Torture victims tell SC of tales of horror under Marcos’ Martial Law |last=Marcelo |first=Elisabeth |date=21 August 2016 |work=GMA News Online |access-date=2018-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229232303/http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/579676/torture-victims-tell-sc-of-tales-of-horror-under-marcos-martial-law/story/ |archive-date=2017-12-29 |dead-url=No |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCoy2007"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=xNpWEAg2B7UC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=maria+elena+ang+water&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0MUPG2oFlv&amp;sig=hUZep6MuqXET4cwVWPdNWgw2QKA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJvbW3sLbaAhVEnJQKHUlMB3YQ6AEwC3oECAAQWg#v=onepage&amp;q=maria%2520elena%2520ang%2520water&amp;f=false |title=A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror |last=McCoy |first=Alfred |date=2007-04-01 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |isbn=9781429900683 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Marcos Regime ====
The water cure was one of the torture methods most used frequently by the [[History of the Philippines (1965–86)|Marcos Regime in the Philippines from 1965 to 1986,]] whose torturers referred to the practice as NAWASA sessions - a reference to the [[National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority]] which supplied water to the Metro Manila area at the time.&lt;ref name="Garcia2016"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9zbCwAAQBAJ |title=Thirty Years Later&amp;nbsp;...
