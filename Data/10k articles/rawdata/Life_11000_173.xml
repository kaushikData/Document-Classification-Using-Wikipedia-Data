      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4266">'''Aarni Neuvonen''', properly '''Vadim Rozenberg''', also known under the aliases of '''Aarni Rozenberg''' and '''Vadim Petrov''', is the largest ever perpetrator of [[employment fraud]] in [[Estonia]].  He is known for having collected money with promise of overseas jobs from thousands of people and disappearing after having caused over (estimated) 10 million of [[Estonian kroon|EEK]] of damages in 1993.

== Scheme ==
Neuvonen published in newspapers (mostly Russian) large and eye-catching ads on behalf of '''Inter Work Corporation''', supposedly established in 1930s headquartered in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bangkok]], offering jobs in [[hotel]]s, [[pub]]s and [[factory|factories]] in [[South America]], [[Arabia]] and [[Europe]].  Job-seekers were charged 2335 [[Estonian kroon|EEK]] in advance; the fee was supposed to cover costs of "foreign passport" (note that this [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era relic had long before disappeared from Estonian jurisprudence), visa, airline tickets and Estonian [[income tax]].  At that time, the average salary in Estonia was about 1070 EEK, and due to the aftermath of the crash of the [[GOSPLAN]]-governed Soviet economy, [[joblessness]] was around 17%.  (Due to [[GOSPLAN]]'s main interest being in the military-industrial plants in Northern Estonia, which had been manned primarily by [[Russophone]] migrants from [[Soviet Union]] transferred to [[Estonia]] specifically to work there, the high joblessness affected particularly Russophone people.)

Neuvonen also spread rumours that the first batch of jobs, supposedly scheduled to start working in [[Germany]], at industrial plants of [[Kodak]], had already been fulfilled — thus implying that the number of jobs was limited, and enticing victims to [[bribe]] Neuvonen with US$100 (about 1200 EEK at the then-current rates) fee for their positions in the queue to be lifted higher.

After enjoying long queues of jobseekers wanting to pay the fee, Neuvonen announced that the visas, air tickets and job permits would be handed over to everybody on 23 March 1993 in the [[banquette]] hall of the [[Viru hotel]].  However, Neuvonen's office, opened on 10 January 1993, was closed already on 9 February 1993, and documents presented by the jobseekers were found in a [[garbage bin]] next to the office's door.

== Irregularities in licensing ==
In the investigation, it was discovered that on one of the company's supposed offices addresses was [[:wikt:wasteland|wasteland]], and the other only held an electricity transmission substation — both places unsuitable for offices.  Furthermore, three of the people supposedly investing in the company through its [[incorporation agreement]] did not exist.

== Damages ==
Police estimated that at least 3000 people paid Neuvonen the 2335 [[Estonian kroon|EEK]] of advance fee; some analysts have speculated there were up to 5000 victims.  After closure of the office, only 32 000 EEK were recovered from one of the company's [[banking account]]s.

== Later sightings ==
In 1993, Neuvonen, then using the alias of '''Daniil Rosenberg''' was reported to be advertising little-used American and Japanese cars for 1000 USD on [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] TV, defrauding hundreds of people out of an estimated million [[USD]].

In 1994, Neuvonen, then presenting himself as a citizen of [[Norway]], was reported to be offering jobs in Europe to poor people in [[Bulgaria]], defrauding about 400 people out of an estimated million [[USD]].

== Status ==
Neuvonen was never caught, and has been declared [[Declared death in absentia|dead due to disappearance]] by an Estonian court at request of his wife of hurried marriage, whom he had fraudulently sold an [[apartment]] on [[Lasnamäe]].

'''Abd ar-Rahman IV Mortada''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الرحمن المرتضى|ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān al-Murtaḍā}}) was the [[Caliph of Córdoba]] in the [[Umayyad]] dynasty in [[Al-Andalus]], succeeding [[Sulayman ibn al-Hakam]], in 1018. That same year, he was murdered at [[Cadiz]] while fleeing from a battle in which he had been deserted by the very supporters which had brought him into power. His brief reign was similar to that of [[Abd ar-Rahman V|Abd ar-Rahman V Mostadir]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6441">On April 21, 1920, during a miners strike in [[Butte, Montana]]'s copper mines, company guards fired on striking miners picketing near a mine of the [[Anaconda Copper Mining Company]], killing Tom Manning and injuring sixteen others, an event known as the '''Anaconda Road massacre'''. His death went unpunished.

==Strike and massacre==

On April 19, 1920, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) and the [[Metal Mine Workers Industrial Union]] called for a strike in the mines around Butte. They hoped the strike would help secure higher wages, an eight-hour day, and end the use of the [[rustling card]], a system that allowed employers to blacklist employees involved in union organizing, among other goals.&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Murphy | first = Mary | title = Mining Cultures | publisher = University of Illinois Press | date = 1997 | pages = 33 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Fpcb4vjVAk8C | isbn = 978-0-252-06569-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike came at a weak point for the union movement in Butte. World War I had undermined the power of the [[Butte Miners Union]] and the mines around the town were [[open shop]]s.&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;{{cite book | last = Malone | first = Michael P. | author2 = Roeder, Richard B. |author3= Lang, William L. | title = Montana: A History of Two Centuries | publisher = University of Washington Press | date = 1991 | pages = 328 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p-P59FkOPg0C | isbn = 978-0-295-97129-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only six years earlier, in 1914, the Butte Miners Union Hall had been destroyed. Rising copper prices, fatal mining accidents, and recruitment by the IWW had further exacerbated tensions in the town. Three years before the strike, an IWW organizer named [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]] was beaten and hanged from a railroad trestle by unknown assailants. Thus, the strike began in an atmosphere of tension.&lt;ref name="walter"&gt;{{cite book | last = Walter | first = David | title = More Montana Campfire Tales | publisher = Farcountry Press | date = 2002 | pages = 211–224 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=E_EEwRc9vi8C | isbn = 978-1-56037-236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day the strike was called, picketers began blocking roads to mines in the area, including the Anaconda Road. These picketers turned non-striking miners away from the mines. By the second day of the strike, the picketers had succeeded in shutting down nearly all mining in Butte. The same day, a local newspaper called the Butte Daily Bulletin reported that the head of the [[Anaconda Copper Mining Company]] had suggested killings and hangings to help end the strike. On the 21st, the local sheriff deputized the Anaconda mine guards in an attempt to contain the strike.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

That afternoon, a few hundred picketers gathered outside the Anaconda company's Neversweat Mine. The sheriff arrived and apparently attempted to mediate the dispute.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; However, the Anaconda mine guards opened fire on the picketers, although the reason why the shooting began is unclear. Sixteen miners were hit, and one, Tom Manning, was killed. All were shot in the back as they tried to flee.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

Federal troops arrived on the 22nd, ostensibly to prevent further violence.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt; A labor newspaper that wrote about the strike was suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldstein | first = Robert Justin | title =[[Political Repression in Modern America]]| publisher = [[University of Illinois Press]]| date = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-252-06964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, the strike collapsed completely and the miners returned to work.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt; No one was found guilty as a result of the massacre, despite an inquest into the death of Tom Manning. During the inquest, Anaconda employees testified that a shot had been fired at them from a boarding house across the street, something which residents of the boarding house disputed. Cross-examination of witnesses by union attorneys suggested that the Anaconda employees had received coaching to make their stories align. Anaconda attorneys attempted to undermine their accusers by pointing out that some of the miners had recently immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; In the end, the jury declared that Manning had been killed by a bullet but that the bullet had been fired by unknown persons,&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt; and his death is still officially unsolved.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

The strike and massacre were the last major labor conflict in the area until the 1934 passage of the [[National Recovery Act]] allowed outside support to help rebuild the weakened Butte Miners Union.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

==Fictional accounts==
[[Dashiell Hammett]], once a [[Pinkerton Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agent stationed in Butte, Montana—where he (allegedly) turned down an offer to assassinate [[Frank Little (unionist)|Little]]—used some historical background on union troubles and corporate corruption in his novel ''[[Red Harvest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panek|first=LeRoy Lad|title=Reading Early Hammett: A Critical Study of the Fiction Prior to 'The Maltese Falcon'|year=2004|publisher=MacFarland &amp; Company|pages=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjOTWHhEqNcC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Op summarizes the local history as, "The strike lasted eight months. Both sides bled plenty. The wobblies [ [[Industrial Workers of the World]] ] had to do their own bleeding. Old Elihu hired gunmen, strike-breakers, national guardsmen and even parts of the regular army, to do his. When the last skull had been cracked, the last rib kicked in, organized labor in Personville was a used firecracker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Novels of Dashiell Hammet | publisher = Alfred A. Knopf | location = New York | date = October 1965 | page = 7 | first = Dashiell | last = Hammett}}&lt;/ref&gt; His client justifies the violence with, "Son, if I hadn't been a pirate I'd still be working for the Anaconda for wages, and there'd be no Personville Mining Corporation."&lt;ref&gt;Hammet (1965), p 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard de Tramelay''' (died 16 August 1153) was the fourth Grand Master of the [[Knights Templar]].

He was born in the castle of Tramelay near [[Saint-Claude, Jura|Saint-Claude]] in the [[Jura (department)|Jura]]. According to [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]], he succeeded a certain Hugues as Master of the Temple, although this Hugues is otherwise unknown. He was elected Grand Master in June 1151, after the abdication of [[Everard des Barres]], who had returned to [[France]] following the [[Second Crusade]]. King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] granted him the ruined city of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], which Bernard rebuilt for the Templars.

In 1153 the Templars participated in the [[Battle of Ascalon (1153)|Battle of Ascalon]], a fortress at that time controlled by [[Egypt]]. The Templars constructed a siege tower, which was burned down by the Egyptian soldiers inside Ascalon. The wind caught the flames and part of the walls of Ascalon burned down as well.

According to [[William of Tyre]], knights of the Order rushed through the breach without Baldwin's knowledge while Bernard prevented other crusaders from following, as he did not want to share the spoils of the city with the king. Bernard and about forty of his Templars were killed by the larger Egyptian garrison. Their bodies were displayed on the ramparts and their heads were sent to the sultan. Other more modern accounts say that William of Tyre's version may have been distorted, since it may have been based on the defensive accounts given by the army's commanders as to why they did not follow the Templars into the breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Piers Paul |last=Read |title=The Templars |page=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In yet another differing account by a [[Damascus|Damascene]] chronicler in the city, the breach of the wall is mentioned as a precursor to the fall of the city; he makes no mention of the incident with the Templars.

Regardless of which account is believed, Bernard was killed and beheaded during the fighting.

A few days later, Baldwin captured the fortress; shortly thereafter, the Templars elected [[André de Montbard]] as their Grand Master.

'''Boniface''' (1245&amp;ndash;1263) was Count of Savoy from 1253 to 1263, succeeding his father [[Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy|Amadeus IV]]. He never married and thus left no heir.  

==Career==
Boniface was born in [[Chambéry]].  Since he became Count of Savoy at the age of nine, he required a regency. Throughout the decade before his death, Savoy was governed through a joint regency resembling that devised for his grandfather [[Thomas I, Count of Savoy|Tomasso I in 1189]], in which authority was shared between his mother, [[Cecile of Baux|Cécile of Baux]], and one of his uncles, [[Thomas, Count of Flanders|Thomas II of Piedmont]].{{sfn|Cognasso|1971|p=136-139}}  Boniface's other uncles, [[Peter II, Count of Savoy|Peter II]] and [[Philip I, Count of Savoy|Philip I]] disputed this, seeking to divide the County's many properties, but Thomas took it to arbitration per the family treaty of 1234 which had been negotiated by his brother [[William of Savoy|William]] and won out. The uncles were, however granted compensation in return, receiving more properties within the County.{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=227-229}}  When Thomas died in 1259, Cecile continued as regent in Savoy.  Under her regency, Philip and Peter continued their previous work of expanding the control and influence of the County of Savoy.{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=279-291}}

Boniface's campaigns in [[Flanders]] and [[Piedmont]] were not successful.{{sfn|Marie José|1956|p=40}}  In September 1262, [[Rudolf of Geneva]] offered homage to cousin Boniface after yet another round of the war between Peter and their kin in Geneva.{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=303}}  In 1263, Boniface was mortally wounded in battle{{Cn|date=August 2014}} and died, to be succeeded by his uncle Peter.{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=303}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5201">'''Brian James Blacktop'''  (1937&amp;ndash;2007) was a [[New Zealand]] lawyer. He spent his entire 48-year career in the [[Public Trustee (New Zealand)|New Zealand Public Trust Office]]. He was Assistant Public Trustee (1973&amp;ndash;1981) and Deputy Public Trustee (1981-99).&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;Obituary, ''Brian James Blacktop'' 1937-2007, Council Brief, The Monthly newspaper of the Wellington District Law Society, Issue 362, August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Public Trust has established the "Brian Blacktop Award" which offers Public Trust employees an opportunity to get special paid leave and/or financial assistance to do voluntary work in the community "to foster the spirit of those values in Public Trust by remembering Brian and supporting staff to make a meaningful contribution to the wider New Zealand community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publictrust.co.nz/careers-at-public-trust/working-at-public-trust/our-social-responsibility "Careers at Public Trust", ''Public Trust'']; retrieved 19 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Blacktop was educated at [[St Peter's College, Auckland]] where he was dux and head prefect in 1954. From there he went to medical school at [[Otago University]] but soon changed tack, returning to Auckland and in 1959 starting work as a law clerk at the Public Trust Office. He studied law part-time at the [[University of Auckland]]. He graduated in law in 1963 and  was admitted in the same year to the [[Bar (legal)|Bar]] in the [[High Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court of New Zealand]] (now known as the High Court of New Zealand).&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

==Public Trust==
Blacktop was Public Trust district solicitor in [[Takapuna]] from 1965-68, moved to [[Palmerston North]], and then in 1973 to [[Wellington]] where he was appointed head office solicitor. In 1981 he was appointed Assistant Public Trustee, and in 1985 Deputy Public Trustee, a position he held until his retirement in March 1999. He continued working at the Public Trust offering legal support to the chief executive during the Public Trust's transformation from a government department to a [[Crown entity]]. He assisted with the drafting of the Public Trust Act 2001.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

The [[New Zealand Law Commission]] cited that their "work on homicidal heirs [sic.] has been especially helped by consultation with ... Brian Blacktop ...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/other/nzlc/report/R38/R38-Preface.html|work=New Zealand Law Commission|title=R38 report: Preface|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Blacktop and his wife, Margaret, had five children, three daughters, Kathie, Mary and Trish as well as two sons, Maurice (deceased) and David. A devout [[Roman Catholic]], he was active in church and community affairs throughout his life.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Among other commitments, he was on the Board of Trustees of [[Bishop Viard College]]. He was a member of the Tawa [[Rotary Club]] from 1985 and organised and managed the club's [[Hepatitis B]] vaccination programme for [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa's]] school children in 1989. He won the Paul Harris Fellows award from the Tawa Rotary Club in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tawarotary.org.nz/awards/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220085627/http://www.tawarotary.org.nz/awards/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 December 2013|title=Paul Harris Fellows Year 2002|work=Tawa Rotary Club|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blacktop served on the administrative board of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington]] from 1981 to 2006. During that time he oversaw a number of important projects including the creation of the new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Palmerston North|Diocese of Palmerston North]] and the passing of the Roman Catholic Bishops Empowering Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wel-com.org.nz/wel-com-articles/454-|work=Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington|title=Veteran board member bows out|date=n.d.|accessdate=19 December  2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220001538/http://wel-com.org.nz/wel-com-articles/454-|archivedate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4423">:''See also the chariot allegory in the Indian work [[Katha Upanishad]], and another in the story of [[Vajira]].''
{{Platonism}}
[[Plato]], in his dialogue ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (sections 246a–254e), uses the '''Chariot [[Allegory]]''' to explain his view of the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. He does this in the dialogue through the character of [[Socrates]], who uses it in a discussion of the merit of Love as "divine madness".

==Allegory==
Plato paints the picture of a Charioteer ({{lang-el|ἡνίοχος}}) driving a [[chariot]] pulled by two winged horses:

"First the charioteer of the human soul drives a pair, and secondly one of the horses is noble and of noble breed, but the other quite the opposite in breed and character. Therefore in our case the driving is necessarily difficult and troublesome."&lt;ref name="phaedrus"&gt; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhaedrus%3Asection%3D246b ''Phaedrus'', section 246b], Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charioteer represents intellect, reason, or the part of the soul that must guide the soul to truth; one horse represents rational or moral impulse or the positive part of passionate nature (e.g., righteous indignation); while the other represents the soul's irrational passions, appetites, or concupiscent nature. The Charioteer directs the entire chariot/soul, trying to stop the horses from going different ways, and to proceed towards enlightenment.

===Journey===

Plato describes a "great circuit" which souls make as they follow the gods in the path of enlightenment. Those few souls which are fully enlightened are able to see the world of the forms in all its glory. Some souls have difficulty controlling the black horse, even with the help of the white horse. They may bob up into the world of the forms, but at other times enlightenment is hidden from them. If overcome by the black horse or forgetfulness, the soul loses its wings and is pulled down to earth.

Should that happen, the soul is incarnated into one of nine kinds of person, according to how much truth it beheld. In order of decreasing levels of truth seen, the categories are: (1) philosophers, lovers of beauty, men of culture, or those dedicated to love; (2) law-abiding kings or civic leaders; (3) politicians, estate-managers or businessmen; (4) ones who specialize in bodily health; (5) prophets or [[Western esotericism|mystery cult]] participants; (6) poets or imitative artists; (7) craftsmen or farmers; (8) sophists or demagogues; and (9) tyrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=41&amp;fk_files=39488 |title=''Phaedrus'', p 41 |author=[[Plato]] |author2=Jowett, Benjamin |authorlink2=Benjamin Jowett  |publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One need not suppose, of course, that Plato intended this as a literal discussion of [[Reincarnation|metempsychosis or reincarnation]]: perhaps he meant it figuratively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/netshots/republic.htm |title=Plato's ''Republic'' |last=Dunkle |first=Roger |publisher=AbleMedia |accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato does not see the human soul as a sort of patchwork of emotions and concepts; this differs from the views of many philosophers of his time. Instead he views the soul as a sort of [[composite material|composite]], in which many different elements blend together and affect each other. He uses the allegory of the charioteer to explain that love is a reflection of love of the forms, and is thus a "divine madness," a ''[[theia mania]]''.

'''Craig Chandler Price''' (also known as the '''Warwick Slasher''',&lt;ref name="santa09"/&gt; born October 11, 1973) is an American [[serial killer]] who committed his crimes in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]] between the ages of 13 and 15. He was arrested in 1989 for four murders committed in his neighborhood: a woman and her two daughters that year, and the murder of another woman two years earlier.&lt;ref name="hulking"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/CRIME/12/31/iron.man.ap/index.html |title=Hulking boy killer changes justice system |work=[[Associated Press]] via [[CNN.com]] |date=31 December 2007 |accessdate=2008-01-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103152008/http://www.cnn.com/2007/CRIME/12/31/iron.man.ap/index.html |archivedate=2008-01-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an existing criminal record for petty theft.&lt;ref name="hulking" /&gt;

During his incarceration, Price has been charged with a number of additional crimes, including [[contempt of court|criminal contempt]] for refusing a [[psychological evaluation]],&lt;ref name="projo2009"/&gt; [[extortion]] for threatening a corrections officer, [[assault]], and violation of [[probation]] for fights while in prison.&lt;ref name="hulking" /&gt; He was sentenced to an additional 10–25 years, depending on his cooperation with treatment.

==Details of the murders==
Price committed his first murder at the age of 13 in Warwick, Rhode Island on the night of July 27, 1987.&lt;ref name="nyt1993"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00616F9355F0C778DDDA80994DB494D81|title=Rhode Island Is Seeking to Keep a Killer of Four in Jail When He Reaches 21|date=November 14, 1993|journal=The New York Times|place=New York, NY|accessdate=2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price broke into a home that was only two houses away from his own&lt;ref name="spokane"/&gt; whereupon he took a knife from the kitchen and stabbed 27 year old Rebecca Spencer 58 times, killing her.

A little over two years later Price was a 15 year old freshman in high school when he murdered three other neighbors on September 1, 1989. Price, high on [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.projo.com/extra/2004/craigprice/content/part1.htm |title=Into another world |last=Arsenault |first=Mark |date=March 7, 2004 |journal=Providence Journal |place=Providence, RI |accessdate=2011-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206021548/http://www.projo.com/extra/2004/craigprice/content/part1.htm |archivedate=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stabbed 39 year old Joan Heaton 57 times, stabbed her 10 year old daughter Jennifer 62 times, and crushed the skull of Heaton's 8 year old daughter Melissa (as well as inflicting 30 stab wounds). The stabbings were so brutal that the handles broke off the knives he used, the blades staying inside the bodies of the victims.&lt;ref name="nyt1993"/&gt; At the time, the brutality of the murders was mostly unknown due to Price's sealed records. According to law-enforcement officials, Price had no remorse when confessing to the crimes.&lt;ref name="nyt1994"/&gt;
As to the motive, Price himself believes exposure to racism by whites as a young child was a factor in the murders.

==Prison violence==
On July 29, 2009, Craig was involved in a prison fight with another inmate. While trying to break up the fight, one of the correctional officers was stabbed in the finger by a handmade shank in Price's possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/local_wpri_cranston_murderer_craig_price_accused_in_stabbing_20090730_nek |title=Craig Price accused in prison stabbing |last=Krause |first=Nancy |date=July 30, 2009 |publisher=WPRI.com |place=East Providence, RI |accessdate=2011-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928072640/http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/local_wpri_cranston_murderer_craig_price_accused_in_stabbing_20090730_nek |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the prison fight, Price has been transferred to another facility.&lt;ref name="santa09"/&gt; An officer from the [[Rhode Island Department of Corrections]] said Price has been booked twice for fighting since leaving the Adult Correctional Institutions in [[Cranston, Rhode Island|Cranston]]. Price was denied parole in March 2009 and his current release date is in May 2020.&lt;ref name="projo2009"/&gt;

On April 4, 2017 Price was accused of stabbing fellow inmate Joshua Davis, at the Suwannee Correctional Institution in Live Oak, Florida, with a 5" homemade knife. His current Trial Date is set for September 24th, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wpri.com/target-12/craig-price-attempted-murder-trial-pushed-back-to-september/1167596644|title=Craig Price attempted murder trial pushed back to September|last=White|first=Tim|date=2018-03-16|work=WPRI|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crimson Commando''' is the name used by three [[fictional character]]s, which are either a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] or a cyborg appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=September 2013}}
Frank Bohannan first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #215 (March 1987) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Alan Davis]].

The second version only appeared briefly in ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #106 (November 2000) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Leinil Francis Yu]].

The third version appears in ''X-Men'' vol. 3 #40 (March 2013), and was created by [[Seth Peck]], [[Jefte Palo]] and [[Guillermo Mogorron]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Frank Bohannan===
'''Frank Bohannan'''&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #215&lt;/ref&gt; was born somewhere in [[Massachusetts]]. As the Crimson Commando, he was one of a trio of World War II veteran super-heroes recruited to be a member of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], the original government-sponsored mutant team. Earlier, along with his partners, [[Stonewall (comics)|Stonewall]] and [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]], Bohannan had become a vigilante who captured criminals, released them and hunted them in [[Adirondack State Park]] in upstate New York. The trio killed the criminals, both to reduce the criminal element in society and for the enjoyment of hunting them.

The trio captured Pamela Morrison, a drug dealer, and mistaking [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] (the leader of the [[X-Men]]) for a criminal, the trio hunted and captured her as well. The women were set out for the vigilantes to hunt both to their deaths.  The Crimson Commando killed Morrison, but [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] arrived to help Storm. When Storm and Wolverine eventually defeated the trio, Stonewall and Crimson Commando agreed to turn themselves in to law enforcement authorities and confess their vigilantism.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #215-216&lt;/ref&gt; Stonewall, Crimson Commando, and Super Sabre (who had been presumed dead) agreed to join [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], a U.S. government sponsored team of superhumans, in exchange for a commutation of their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #223&lt;/ref&gt;

On his first mission with Freedom Force, he fought the X-Men in Dallas, and battled cavemen transported to Dallas by time-waves created by the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]]. He watched a telecast of the X-Men's deaths in order to defeat the Adversary, and then witnessed the return of [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] to Dallas without the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #225-227&lt;/ref&gt; While still in Dallas, Freedom Force also contended against the [[New Mutants]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #65&lt;/ref&gt;

Crimson Commando was also a part of the Freedom Force mission to attempt capture [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], who defeated Freedom Force.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #30-31&lt;/ref&gt; He also assisted the team's attempt to capture [[Rusty Collins]], which was thwarted by the New Mutants.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #78&lt;/ref&gt; He again fights Rusty Collins and his girlfriend Skids, alongside Freedom Force; this time, they captured Rusty and Skids.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' 86 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; With Freedom Force, he also pursued [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who had escaped federal custody.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #88-89 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Crimson Commando would be gravely wounded during a bungled mission in the [[Middle East]].  Freedom Force was sent to Kuwait City to rescue or kill physicist Reinhold Kurtzmann, but they encountered the Arabic super-team called [[Desert Sword]]. Teammate Super Sabre was killed, while the Crimson Commando's right hand was severed by the "cutting wind" of [[Aminedi]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants Annual'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; Bohannan was seriously wounded,&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] was forced to abandon [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] in the desert to save his life.  Bohannan was evacuated from Kuwait for hospitalization.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor Annual'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyborg X====
The Crimson Commando next appeared having been turned into a cyborg going by the name of Cyborg X.  He had been rebuilt by CARE LABS but a testing accident had caused him to malfunction bringing him into a confrontation with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]. Cyborg X would later assist Spider-Man in battling the [[Sinister Six]] but was believed to have been killed in an explosion at CARE LABS.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erik Larsen]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] had originally turned Crimson Commando into a cyborg in order to include him in a proposed [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] re-launch in the mid-1990s that eventually went to [[Peter David]]. Larsen would later use his design to create [[SuperPatriot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Project: Wideawake====
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:CrimsCommando.jpg|left|thumbnail|Commando]] --&gt;
Now going by only the name Commando, Bohannan next appeared on a mission for [[Project Wideawake]].  He was teamed-up with his former Freedom Force teammate [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] to infiltrate the reclusive [[Empyrean (comics)|Empyrean]]'s headquarters and put his operation out of commission.&lt;ref name="Annual2"&gt;''X-Men Annual #2''&lt;/ref&gt;  They were also ordered by a rogue government official to assassinate [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].

====''House of M'' and afterwards====
Commando appears in the reality-altered [[House of M]] storyline serving as one of Magneto's royal guards. After this and [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] he lost his mutant powers.&lt;ref name="Uncanny539"&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #539&lt;/ref&gt;

Without his powers, Commando begins to die. He kidnaps [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] in an attempt to have her save him. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] rescues her and decapitates Crimson Commando.&lt;ref name="Uncanny539"/&gt;

===Crimson Commando (Brotherhood of Mutants)===
A young, female, African-American version of Crimson Commando appeared very briefly as a member of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2 #106&lt;/ref&gt; Her name was never stated and her powers never exhibited, but [[Chris Claremont]] previously stated there would be a new [[Sabre (Marvel Comics)|Super Sabre]], [[Mastermind (comics)|Mastermind]] and Crimson Commando.

===Crimson Commando (Freedom Force)===
A Human/Cyborg version of Crimson Commando is a member of the [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 3 #40&lt;/ref&gt; His power armor is equipped with two automatic machine guns as hands, and a machine/rail gun mounted on left shoulder.

==Powers and abilities==
Frank Bohannan is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has the ability to achieve the peak of human physical perfection, although just right beneath superhuman levels (similar to the physical enhancements granted by [[Captain America]]'s super-soldier treatments). More specifically, his mutation has kept his body at the very peak of physical perfection a baseline human can achieve without becoming a superhuman, and thus apparently ages at a much slower rate than normal human beings. This also seems to include enhanced resistance to injury, managing to survive having his right hand severed and bleeding continuously for an hour, before being maimed by a [[land mine]].  Although he was on the brink of death, He managed to hang on long enough to receive medical attention and survive.

Frank can carry out actions while submerging his conscious thought processes so deeply within his mind that his mind is shielded from telepathic detection. He also exhibited some degree of super-vision, able to see his super-fast teammate [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]] when the speedster was moving at superhuman velocities.

Bohannan wore a computer and modem device on his wrist, and carried knives, daggers, and conventional handguns as weapons. He is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant and commando fighter, and is also a highly skilled hunter and tracker.

Since becoming a cyborg, the extent of his abilities is largely unknown. One arm was replaced by a large gun, his legs are now metal and he can walk up the side of buildings, and at least one eye was replaced with an optical sensor able to see beyond the range of normal human vision.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
A similarly named character called the '''Commander Crimson''' appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity. '''Sayuri Kyota''' was an ex-agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who joined [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], providing the latter with the former's weapons and secrets.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics Ultimates'' vol. 1 #20&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Ultimates]] attack her Hydra cell, she has confrontations with [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] and against [[Iron Patriot]] before disintegrating from using an [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics Ultimates'' vol. 1 #21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism''''', by [[Chögyam Trungpa]] is a book addressing many common pitfalls of self-deception in seeking spirituality, which the author coins as ''[[Spiritual materialism]]''. It is the transcript of two series of lectures given by Trungpa [[Rinpoche]] in 1970–71.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhala.org/meditation/books2.php Book Corner - Shambhala&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210031919/http://shambhala.org/meditation/books2.php |date=2011-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Psychology Today]]'' Michael J. Formica writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as we cast something into a role, as soon as we put a label on it, as soon as we name it and give it life by virtue of our investment (read: ego), we take away all its power and it is nothing more than an event – it is no longer a spiritual revelation, but simply a material experience. That is spiritual materialism at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/enlightened-living/200812/cutting-through-spiritual-materialism Cutting through Spiritual Materialism | Psychology Today&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Cyatta''''' is a [[genus]] of [[ant]] in the [[subfamily]] [[Myrmicinae]] containing the [[monotypic taxon|single species]] '''''Cyatta abscondita'''''. It is considered the most recent ancestor of all [[fungus-farming ants]] and a [[living fossil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/5408/20131223/ghost-ant-new-species-living-fossil-ancient-fungus-farming-ants.htm| title = The Ghost Ant: New Species is a Living Fossil of Ancient Fungus-Farming Ants |publisher =Nature World News| date=Dec 23, 2013|accessdate = 24 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Cyatta'' is a [[neologism]] constructed in part from the [[Brazil]]ian [[Tupi language]] word ''Cy'', meaning "sister," referring to its status, along with the genus ''[[Kalathomyrmex]]'', as the [[sister clade]] to the remaining genera of the informal [[clade]] Neoattini, to which the genus ''[[Atta (genus)|Atta]]'', the most conspicuous member of the Neoattini, belongs. The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''abscondita'' refers to the exceedingly secretive nature of this species, which, after being recognized from a few rare specimens, proved frustratingly elusive during multiple attempts to locate it in the field.&lt;ref name="Sosa-Calvo_et_al_2013_5"/&gt;

==Discovery history==
In 2003, a single stray worker of ''C. abscondita'' was taken in a pitfall trap as part of an ant survey conducted at the [[Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Serra das Almas]], [[Crateús]], [[Ceará]], Brazil, a relatively undisturbed area of [[Caatinga]], a biome characterized by deciduous thorny woodland vegetation. The specimen was deposited in the [[Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo]] (MZUSP) ant collection, where it was at first associated with the ''[[Mycetophylax]]'' species group, but subsequently recognized as a new neoattine genus. This isolated specimen inspired the first attempt to locate ''C. abscondita'' in the field in [[Serra das Almas]] in 2009. Unfortunately, it was the end of the rainy season and the soil was covered by a dense layer of grass, impairing observations of all small and inconspicuous ants. Visual searching and leaf-litter extraction failed to locate additional specimens, as did subsequent surveys at the same locality.&lt;ref name="Sosa-Calvo_et_al_2013_12"/&gt;

In 2008, two workers were taken in pitfall traps in the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE) Cerrado preserve, near Fazenda Água Limpa (FAL) in [[Brasília]], [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], Brazil. These specimens, deposited in the MZUSP, inspired attempts to locate the species at this locality beginning in 2009. The first such attempt yielded only the collection of a series of stray workers and an unsuccessful nest excavation; however, subsequent visits resulted in the excavations of multiple nests and collections of gynes, larvae, and cultivated fungi.&lt;ref name="Sosa-Calvo_et_al_2013_12"/&gt;

The only known male of the species was collected in 2011 from two nests of ''C. abscondita'' while excavating a nest of ''Mycocepurus goeldii'' in the Broa Preserve, [[Itirapina]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Brazil.&lt;ref name="Sosa-Calvo_et_al_2013_12"/&gt;

The earliest known collection of ''C. abscondita'' was that of a stray worker taken in a [[leaf-litter]] sample in [[Paineiras]], [[Minas Gerais]], in 1999, only recently discovered in the entomological collection at MZUSP and recognized as belonging to this species. Most recently, in 2011, two workers of ''C. abscondita'' were recovered from pitfall traps in fragments of [[Atlantic semi-deciduous forests|semideciduous forests]] in the [[Sales, São Paulo|Sales]] and [[Pindorama]] municipalities in northwestern São Paulo state. This history of discovery indicates that ''C. abscondita'' is rarely collected by traditional methods. The cryptic nature of foragers and of nest entrances makes it almost invisible to traditional hand collecting. The rarity of individuals in pitfall and leaf-litter samples remains puzzling, since the concentrations of nests encountered at FAL and Broa Preserve suggest that it is locally abundant.&lt;ref name="Sosa-Calvo_et_al_2013_12"/&gt;

==Phylogeny==
Results of molecular [[phylogenetic]] analyses incorporating four [[nuclear gene]] sequences from ''Cyatta abscondita'' confirm the previous finding that the tribe Attini is divided by an ancient divergence into two major clades, the Paleoattini and the Neoattini. ''Cyatta abscondita'' occupies a relatively isolated position in the latter clade, distantly related to the monotypic genus ''Kalathomyrmex'', the result of an early divergence in the Neoattini. Its phylogenetic position, nested well within the paraphyletic group of "lower attine ants," strongly supports the hypothesis that ''C. abscondita'' practices "lower attine agriculture".&lt;ref name="Sosa-Calvo_et_al_2013_15"/&gt;

'''Edwin Fitzgerald''' (March 9, 1856 – February 16, 1928),&lt;ref name="Cullen"&gt;Cullen, Frank; Hackman, Florence; and McNeilly, Donald. ''Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America''.  Routledge Press, September 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-93853-8}}. pp. 406–410&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''Eddie Foy''' and '''Eddie Foy Sr.''',  was an American actor, comedian, dancer and [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', February 22, 1928, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
[[File:EarlandGirlFoy.jpg|thumb|left|167px|Poster from ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' (1905)]]
Foy's parents, Richard and Mary Fitzgerald, emigrated to the United States from [[Ireland]] in 1855 and lived first in [[New York City]]'s [[Bowery]] and then in [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhoods, where Eddie was born. Richard Fitzgerald died in an insane asylum in 1862 from [[syphilis]]-induced [[dementia]],&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt; and his widow took her four children (Eddie was second oldest) to [[Chicago]], where she reportedly at one time tended the mentally ill [[Mary Todd Lincoln|widow]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt;

Six-year-old Eddie began performing in the streets and local saloons to support his family. At 15 he changed his name to Foy, and with a partner began dancing in bars, traveling throughout the western United States.&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt; He worked for a time as a [[Supernumerary actor|supernumerary]] in theatrical productions, sharing a stage at times with such leading men of the time as [[Edwin Booth]] and [[Joseph Jefferson]]. With another partner, Jim Thompson, Foy went west again and gained his first professional recognition in mining camps and cow towns. In one such town, [[Dodge City, Kansas]], Foy and his partner lingered for some time and Foy became acquainted with notable citizens [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Bat Masterson]], and [[Doc Holliday]].&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt; In later years, Foy told of an altercation over a girl with fellow actor Charles Chaplin (not the later film star), who was drunkenly taking pot-shots at Foy. The gunfire awakened [[Wyatt Earp]], who disarmed the actor and sent both the players home to sleep it off. Foy is also rumored to have been in [[Tombstone, Arizona]], in October 1881, appearing at the Birdcage Theater when the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] occurred on the 26th of that month.&lt;ref name="Willson1935"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willson|first=Clair Eugene|title=Mimes and miners: a historical study of the theater in Tombstone|year=1935|publisher=University of Arizona|location=Arizona|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Foy married Rose Howland, one of the singing Howland Sisters, who were traveling the same circuit.&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt; Three years later, Foy and troupe relocated to [[Philadelphia]] and joined the Carncross Minstrels. That same year, however, Rose died in childbirth, as did the child she was delivering.&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt; Foy lingered with the troupe for two seasons and then returned to the road. He joined David Henderson's troupe and traveled all around the U.S., dancing, doing comedy, and acting in farces. In San Francisco, still in 1882, he met Lola Sefton and was romantically involved with her for ten years until her death in 1894; the two never married, but had a daughter named Catherine who was raised by Foy's sister, Mary.&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vaudeville old &amp; new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&amp;pg=PA408|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93853-2|page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Chicago==
Foy returned to Chicago in 1888 as the star comedian in variety shows and revues, initially for his own company. He played the variety circuits for years in a series of song and dance acts, eventually rising to musical comedy stardom in such Broadway hits as ''The Strollers'' (1901) and ''Mr. Bluebeard'' (1903). Foy specialized in eccentric routines and costumes, often appearing in drag to hilarious effect.

In 1896, Foy married his third wife, Madeline Morando, a dancer with his company.&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt; She gave him eleven children, of whom seven survived childhood:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eddiefoy.com/FoyFamily.html |title=The Foy Family |author=Foy, Eddie, III |accessdate=January 24, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912160228/http://eddiefoy.com/FoyFamily.html |archivedate=September 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Foy|Bryan]] (1896–1977); Charley (1898–1984); Mary (1901–1987); Madeline (1903–1988); [[Eddie Foy Jr.|Eddie Jr.]] (1905–1983); Richard (1905–1947); and Irving (1908–2003). Eddie Jr.'s son, Eddie III, was a casting director with [[Columbia Pictures]] for over 40 years.

Between 1901 and 1912, Foy played the leading comic roles in a series of musical comedies in New York City and on tour, including ''The Strollers'' (1901), ''The Wild Rose'' (1902), ''Mr. Bluebeard'' (1903), ''Piff! Paff! Pouf!'' (1904), ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' (1905), ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1907), ''Mr Hamlet of Broadway'' (1908/9), ''Up and Down Broadway'' (1910), and ''Over the River'' (1912). It was while on tour with ''Mr. Bluebeard'' that he became a hero of Chicago’s infamous [[Iroquois Theatre Fire]], December 30, 1903. A malfunctioning spotlight set fire to the scenery backstage, and Foy stayed onstage until the last minute, trying to keep the audience from panicking. Survivors later praised Foy for his bravery in trying to keep the crowd calm, even as burning debris fell onto the stage all around him. The theater’s safety features were inadequate, the theater personnel untrained, and some of the exits locked from the outside, and at least 600 people died. Foy escaped by crawling through a sewer.&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt;

==Eddie Foy and The Seven Little Foys==
[[File:Eddiefoyandotherfoys-may10-1919.jpg|thumb|Eddie Foy Sr. and the other Foys, 1919]]
Between 1910 and 1913, he formed a family vaudeville act, "Eddie Foy and The Seven Little Foys", which quickly became a national sensation. While Foy was a stern disciplinarian backstage, he portrayed an indulgent father onstage, and the Foys toured successfully for over a decade, appearing in one motion picture.&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt; His wife Madeline died in 1918. The children began to go their separate ways after Foy married Marie Reilly Coombs in 1923,&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt; but four of the younger children (Charley, Mary, Madeline and Irving) performed together until the mid 1930s.&lt;ref name=Irvingobit/&gt; Foy continued to appear in vaudeville and starred in the hit Broadway comedy ''The Fallen Star'' in 1927. He died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while headlining on the Orpheum circuit in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], at age 71.&lt;ref name="Cullen" /&gt;

The seven children reunited for a 1928 Vitaphone short #2580, "Chips of (sic) the Old Block".  Six of the seven appeared onscreen, doing a portion of their song-and-dance act, and Bryan directed. The film opens with the girls singing and dancing to "I'll Just Roll Along (Havin' My Ups and Downs)" while Bryan plays ukulele. Charley, Eddie Jr., and Irving then perform a comedy routine. Next, Eddie Jr. does an [[eccentric dance]] routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bradley, Edwin M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=648LAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22The+First+Hollywood+Sound+Shorts%22+%22Eddie+Jr.+does+an%22&amp;dq=%22The+First+Hollywood+Sound+Shorts%22+%22Eddie+Jr.+does+an%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sr7RVLjuH4WpgwTEyILIBA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA  |title=The First Hollywood Sound Shorts, 1926-1931 |publisher=McFarland |year=2005 |isbn=978-0786410309 |page=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there's a short song interlude, and the film ends with soft shoe routine in which each has a solo bit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2003/scene/people-news/irving-foy-1117885114/ "Irving Foy: Last of Vaudeville's Seven Little Foys"] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (April 24, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitagraph Short #2580&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Foy headstone.JPG|thumb|left|225px|The headstone of Eddie Foy in [[Holy Sepulchre Cemetery (New Rochelle, NY)|Holy Sepulchre Cemetery]]]]
After the "Seven Little Foys" stopped performing together, they pursued separate careers. Eddie Foy Jr. had a successful acting career on stage and screen. Bryan composed show music, wrote for [[Buster Keaton]], and directed and produced films in Hollywood. Richard continued to operate a theater chain business in Dallas that he had started with Foy.&lt;ref name=Maryobit&gt;Folkart, Burt A. [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-17/news/mn-29386_1 "Mary Foy: One of Last 3 in Zany Family"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (December 17, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Irving wrote and managed cinemas in [[Dallas]] and [[Albuquerque]].&lt;ref name=Irvingobit&gt;Cohen, David S.

The family’s story was filmed in 1955 as ''[[The Seven Little Foys]]'' with [[Bob Hope]] as Foy and [[James Cagney]] as [[George M. Cohan]]; Charley Foy narrated. Eddie Foy Jr. appeared as his father in four films – ''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939), ''[[Lillian Russell (film)|Lillian Russell]]'' (1940), ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), and ''[[Wilson (1944 film)|Wilson]]'' (1944) – as well as in a television version of ''The Seven Little Foys'' with [[Mickey Rooney]] as George M. Cohan (1964). The first stage musical version of ''The Seven Little Foys,'' written by [[Chip Deffaa]], premiered at the Seven Angels Theater in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], in 2007. In 2008, it was revived in New York at the New York International Fringe Festival; the cast included Ryan Foy, Foy's great grandson and grandson of Irving Foy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ryanfoy.com/bio.html |title=Ryan Foy Biography |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121021157/http://www.ryanfoy.com/bio.html |archivedate=2013-01-21 |df= }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.ryanfoy.com/resume.html |title=Ryan Foy Resume |accessdate=June 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121021241/http://www.ryanfoy.com/resume.html |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Foy died at the age of 71 of a [[Myocardial infarction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/eddie-foy "Eddie Foy"], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 17, 1928, accessed October 7, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; His wife died the same year.{{cn|date=October 2018}} All of Foy's children except Bryan are buried with their father at [[Holy Sepulchre Cemetery (New Rochelle, NY)|Holy Sepulchre Cemetery]] in [[New Rochelle, New York]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Epiphanius of Salamis''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἐπιφάνιος}}; c. 310–320 – 403) was bishop of [[Salamis, Cyprus]], at the end of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. He is considered a [[saint]] and a [[Church Father]] by both the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]]es. He gained a reputation as a strong defender of [[orthodoxy]]. He is best known for composing the ''[[Panarion]]'', a very large [[compendium]] of the [[Heresy|heresies]] up to his own time, full of quotations that are often the only surviving fragments of suppressed texts. According to [[Ernst Kitzinger]], he "seems to have been the first cleric to have taken up the matter of Christian religious images as a major issue", and there has been much controversy over how many of the quotations attributed to him by the [[Byzantine Iconoclasts]] were actually by him. Regardless of this he was clearly strongly [[Aniconism in Christianity|against some contemporary uses of images]] in the church.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 92–93, 92 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Epiphanius was born into a Christian Greek family in the small settlement of Besanduk, near [[Eleutheropolis]] (modern-day [[Beit Guvrin, Israel|Beit Guvrin]], Israel),&lt;ref&gt;The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis: Book I (Sects 1–46), By Epiphanius, Epiphanius of Salamis, Translated by Frank Williams, 1987 {{ISBN|90-04-07926-2}} p xi&lt;/ref&gt; and lived as a [[monk]] in Egypt, where he was educated and came into contact with [[Valentinius|Valentinian groups]]. He returned to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] around 333, when he was still a young man, and he founded a monastery at Ad nearby,&lt;ref&gt;The more famous [[Monastery of Epiphanius]] near [[Thebes, Egypt]] was founded by an [[anchorite]] named Epiphanius towards the end of the sixth century; it was explored by an expedition from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1912–14.&lt;/ref&gt; which is often mentioned in the [[polemics]] of [[Jerome]] with [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] and [[Bishop John II of Jerusalem|John, Bishop of Jerusalem]]. He was [[ordained]] a priest, and lived and studied as superior of the monastery in Ad that he founded for thirty years and gained much skill and knowledge in that position. In that position he gained the ability to speak in several tongues, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin]], and was called by Jerome on that account ''Pentaglossis'' ("Five tongued").&lt;ref&gt;''Ruf'' 3.6&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation for learning prompted his nomination and [[consecration]] as Bishop of [[Salamis, Cyprus]],&lt;ref&gt;Salamis was also known as Constantia after [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]].&lt;/ref&gt; in 365 or 367, a post which he held until his death. He was also the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the [[Church of Cyprus]]. He served as bishop for nearly forty years, as well as travelled widely to combat unorthodox beliefs. He was present at a synod in [[Antioch]] (376) where the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] questions were debated against the heresy of [[Apollinarism|Apollinarianism]]. He upheld the position of Bishop [[Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch|Paulinus]], who had the support of Rome, over that of [[Meletius of Antioch]], who was supported by the Eastern Churches. In 382 he was present at the [[Council of Rome]], again upholding the cause of Paulinus.

==Origenist controversy and death==
{{main|Origenist Crises}}
During a visit to Palestine in 394 or 395, while preaching in Jerusalem, he attacked [[Origen]]'s followers and urged the Bishop of [[Jerusalem]], [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John II]], to condemn his writings. He urged John to be careful of the "offence" of images in the churches. He noted that when travelling in Palestine he went into a church to pray and saw a curtain with an image of Christ or a saint which he tore down. He told Bishop John that such images were "opposed . . . to our religion" (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Part 9, Letter LI. From Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394), http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001051.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; This event sowed the seeds of conflict which erupted in the dispute between [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] and [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John]] against [[Jerome]] and Epiphanius. Epiphanius fuelled this conflict by ordaining a priest for Jerome's monastery at Bethlehem, thus trespassing on John's jurisdiction. This dispute continued during the 390s, in particular in the literary works by Rufinus and Jerome attacking one another.

In 399, the dispute took on another dimension, when the Bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus, who had initially supported [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John]], changed his views and started persecuting Origenist monks in Egypt. As a result of this persecution, four of these monks, the so-called Tall Brothers, fled to Palestine, and then travelled to Constantinople, seeking support and spreading the controversy. [[Saint John Chrysostom|John Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople]], gave the monks shelter. Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria saw his chance to use this event to bring down his enemy [[Saint John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]]: in 402 he summoned a council in Constantinople, and invited those supportive of his anti-Origenist views. Epiphanius, by this time nearly 80, was one of those summoned, and began the journey to Constantinople. However, when he realised he was being used as a tool by Theophilus against Chrysostom, who had given refuge to the monks persecuted by Theophilus and who were appealing to the emperor, Epiphanius started back to Salamis, only to die on the way home in 403.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Young with Andrew Teal, ''From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background’’, (2nd edn, 2004), pp202-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==The curtain incident==
Letter LI in Jerome's letters gives Jerome's Latin translation, made at Epiphanius' request, of his letter, originally in Greek from c. 394, "From Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem" (see previous section for wider context).  The final section covers the often quoted incident of the curtain, which unlike other passages attributed to Epiphanius and quoted by the Iconoclasts, is accepted as authentic by modern scholars:&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 92–93 and long note&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
9. Moreover, I have heard that certain persons have this grievance against me: When I accompanied you to the holy place called Bethel, there to join you in celebrating the Collect, after the use of the Church, I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there. Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ’s church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort—opposed as they are to our religion—shall not be hung up in any church of Christ. A man of your uprightness should be careful to remove an occasion of offence unworthy alike of the Church of Christ and of those Christians who are committed to your charge. Beware of Palladius of Galatia—a man once dear to me, but who now sorely needs God’s pity—for he preaches and teaches the heresy of Origen; and see to it that he does not seduce any of those who are intrusted to your keeping into the perverse ways of his erroneous doctrine. I pray that you may fare well in the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LI.html NPNF2-06. Jerome: The Principal Works of St. Jerome, CCEL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Writings==

===''[[Panarion]]''===
His best-known book is the ''[[Panarion]]'' which means "medicine-chest" (also known as ''Adversus Haereses'', "Against Heresies"), presented as a book of antidotes for those bitten by the serpent of heresy. Written between 374 and 377, it forms a handbook for dealing with the arguments of heretics.

It lists, and refutes, 80 [[Heresy#Early Christian heresies|heresies]], some of which are not described in any other surviving documents from the time. Epiphanius begins with the 'four mothers' of pre-Christian heresy – 'barbarism', 'Scythism', 'Hellenism' and 'Judaism' – and then addresses the sixteen pre-Christian heresies that have flowed from them: four philosophical schools (Stoics, Platonists, Pythagoreans and Epicureans), and twelve Jewish sects. There then follows an interlude, telling of the Incarnation of the Word. After this, Epiphanius embarks on his account of the sixty Christian heresies, from assorted gnostics to the various trinitarian heresies of the fourth century, closing with the [[Collyridians]] and [[Messalians]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Louth, 'Palestine', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Young, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p286&lt;/ref&gt;

While Epiphanius often let his zeal come before facts – he admits on one occasion that he writes against the Origenists-based only on hearsay (''Panarion'', Epiphanius 71) – the ''Panarion'' is a valuable source of information on the Christian Church of the fourth century. It is also an important source regarding the early Jewish gospels such as the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]] circulating among the [[Ebionites]] and the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], as well as the followers of [[Cerinthus]] and [[Merinthus]].&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius , ''Panarion'', 30 iii 7&lt;/ref&gt;

One unique feature of the ''Panarion'' is in the way that Epiphanius compares the various heretics to different poisonous beasts, going so far as to describe in detail the animal's characteristics, how it produces its poison, and how to protect oneself from the animal's bite or poison. For example, he describes his enemy [[Origen]] as "a toad noisy from too much moisture which keeps croaking louder and louder." He compares the [[Gnostic]]s to a particularly dreaded snake "with no pangs." The [[Ebionites]], a Christian sect that followed Jewish law, were described by Epiphanius as "a monstrosity with many shapes, who practically formed the snake-like shape of the mythical many-headed Hydra in himself." In all, Epiphanius describes fifty animals, usually one per sect.&lt;ref name="Verheyden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verheyden|first=Joseph|year=2008|title=Epiphanius of Salamis on Beasts and Heretics|journal=Journal of Eastern Christian Studies|volume=60|issue=1–4|pages=143–173|url=http://secure.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=article.php&amp;id=2035279&amp;journal_code=JECS&amp;download=yes|doi=10.2143/jecs.60.1.2035279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of the ''Panarion'' is the access its earlier sections provide to lost works, notably Justin Martyr's work on heresies, the Greek of Irenaeus' ''Against Heresies'', and Hippolytus' ''Syntagma''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Louth, 'Palestine', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Young, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), 286&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Panarion'' was first translated into English in 1987 and 1990.

===Other works===
His earliest known work is the ''Ancoratus'' (the well anchored man), which includes arguments against [[Arianism]] and the teachings of [[Origen]]. Aside from the [[polemics]] by which he is known, Epiphanius wrote a work of biblical [[antiquarian]]ism, called, for one of its sections, ''[[On Weights and Measures (Epiphanius)|On Weights and Measures]]'' (περὶ μέτρων καὶ στάθμων). It was composed in Constantinople for a Persian priest, in 392,&lt;ref&gt;Allen A. Shaw, "On Measures and Weights by Epiphanius" ''National Mathematics Magazine'' '''11'''.1 (October 1936: 3–7).&lt;/ref&gt; and survives in Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian translations (this last is found in ''Shatberd ms 1141'' along with ''Physiologus'' and ''De Gemmis'').&lt;ref&gt;English translation is Dean (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; The first section discusses the canon of the [[Old Testament]] and its versions, the second of measures and weights, and the third, the geography of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The texts appear not to have been given a polish but consist of rough notes and sketches, as Allen A. Shaw, a modern commentator, concluded; nevertheless Epiphanius' work on [[metrology]] was important in the [[history of measurement]].

Another work, ''On the Twelve Gems'' (''De Gemmis''), survives in a number of fragments, the most complete of which is the Georgian.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Young with Andrew Teal, ''From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background’’, (2nd edn, 2004), p201&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter written by Epiphanius to John, Bishop of Jerusalem, in 394 and preserved in Jerome's translation, is discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;''Ep'' 51, available at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LI.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection of [[homily|homilies]] traditionally ascribed to a "Saint Epiphanius, bishop" are dated in the late fifth or sixth century and are not connected with Epiphanius of Salamis by modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Alvar Erikson, ''Sancti Epiphani Episcopi Interpretatio Evangelorum'' (Lund) 1938, following Dom Morin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such was Epiphanius's reputation for learning that the ''[[Physiologus]]'', the principal source of medieval bestiaries, came to be widely falsely attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Young with Andrew Teal, ''From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background’’, (2nd edn, 2004), p202&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Etienne Vermeersch''' (born May 2, 1934 in [[Sint-Michiels]] (nowadays part of [[Bruges]])) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] (moral) [[philosopher]], [[skeptic]], [[opinion]] maker and [[debater]]. He is one of the founding fathers of the [[abortion]] and [[Euthanasia and the law|euthanasia law]] in Belgium. He is also former Vice-[[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[Ghent University]].

Vermeersch became an [[atheist]] after five years with the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits). Later he became a philosophical [[materialist]]. In the 1990s there was some commotion in the Belgian media when Vermeersch wrote a [[Rationality|rational]]-[[scientific]] article entitled 'Why the [[Christian God]] cannot exist'.

In January 2008, Vermeersch was chosen by hundred prominent [[Flemings]] as the most influential intellectual of [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/de-invloedrijkste-intellectuelen-van-vlaanderen/site72-section24-article11901.html#commentspost|title=De grootste intellectuelen van Vlaanderen|language=Dutch|journal=[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]]|date= January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Etienne Vermeersch has an MA in [[classical philology]] and in [[philosophy]]. In 1965 he obtained his PhD on the philosophical implications of [[information theory]] and [[cybernetics]] at Ghent University, Belgium. He became a professor at Ghent University in 1967 and taught introductory courses in philosophy and in the [[philosophy of science]], as well as courses in 20th-century philosophy and in [[philosophical anthropology]].

He is working on the foundations of the [[social sciences]], on the philosophical aspects of research into informatics, on [[artificial intelligence]], and on general social and ethical problems, mainly with regard to [[bioethics]], [[environmental philosophy]], and cultural philosophy.

He was a vice rector at Ghent University from 1993 until 1997. He was, among others, a member of the Flemish Board for Scientific Policy, of the governmental board of the [[Flanders|Flemish]] Institute for [[Biotechnology]], of the Environmental Board of [[Flanders]], and of the Federal Board for Scientific Policy. He was also president of the Advisory Committee of [[Bioethics]].

Etienne Vermeersch has published about 80 articles, about 10 lemmas in the (Flemish) Encyclopaedia of World Literature, many op-ed articles in newspapers and journals, three syllabi, and six books, among which ''An Epistemological Introduction to the Science of Man'' (1967), ''Current Philosophy'' (1970), and the bestseller ''The Panda's Eyes: An Environmentally Philosophical Essay'' (1988). At his retirement the book ''From [[Antigone]] to [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]]'' (1997) was published, an edited volume containing articles spanning his entire career.

Professor Vermeersch is also a major Belgian skeptic. He is a founding member of [[SKEPP]] ('Research Society for Critical Evaluation of [[Pseudoscience]] and the [[Paranormal]]'). He has been lecturing and publishing on this topic for more than 40 years.

Vermeersch states the overpopulation of the earth as the most profound problem in the world and relates it to the problem of overconsumption. He supports the human birth control of [[Taiwan]] since 1967 and later [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/2461/De-Gedachte/article/detail/1234890/2011/03/12/Wanhopig-op-weg-naar-10-miljard.dhtml|title=Wanhopig op weg naar 10 miljard|language=Dutch|newspaper=[[De Morgen]]|date= March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of January 2005 he survived a second [[heart attack]]. He remains active as a prominent intellectual in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].

'''Félix Uresti Gómez''' (Gómez Farías, [[Coahuila]]; July 1,&amp;nbsp;1887 — Carrizal, [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] 21 June 1923) was a Mexican revolutionary holding the rank of General and leading Mexican forces at [[Carrizal, Chihuahua]] on June 21, 1916.

His life was spent between Gomez Farias, [[Coahuila]], where he was born, had his house and now his grave, and San Salvador, [[Zacatecas]], where his uncle Marcos Uresti and his grandfather Jeronimo Uresti lived. In this city he had his first school lessons, later he started to work in the mines. In 1913 he aligned with the forces of [[Venustiano Carranza]] and was commissioned a general officer. In October 1914 the revolutionary movement suffered additional internal divisions, but he remained faithful to the Carrancista faction.

On June 21, 1916 Gomez was leading a force of 400 Mexican soldiers tasked with repelling a US Army cavalry detachment composed of soldiers from Troops "C" and "K" of the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th US Cavalry]] at the town of Carrizal, Chihuahua.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Prieto, The Mexican Expedition, 1916-1917, (Washington DC: Department of the Army, 2016), 46&lt;/ref&gt; His orders were to prevent the Americans from moving any direction but north—an action contrary to the cavalry detachment's orders. The Americans, [[buffalo soldier]]s under [[General John J. Pershing]], had entered Mexican territory on the so-called Punitive Expedition in pursuit of [[Pancho Villa]] following his attack on [[Columbus, New Mexico]]. An attempt to peacefully pass through Carrizal in violation of Gomez's orders, resulted in a gun battle that saw the deaths of Gomez along with 79 other Mexican soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Finley, “Buffalo Soldiers to the Rescue,” Huachuca Illustrated, Vol. 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; All the American officers present were killed and the surviving enlisted soldiers taken prisoner and held until they were repatriated several months later.&lt;ref&gt;Prieto, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

For his role in this battle, the Mexican government named Gomez the "Hero of [[Battle of Carrizal|Carrizal]]."

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Gameplay of ''Pokémon''}}
The gameplay of the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' video game series]] involves the catching and training of a variety of fictional creatures called "Pokémon" and using them to battle other Trainers. Each successive [[Pokémon#Generations|generation]] of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pokémon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere in the franchise before being introduced to the games; double battles appeared in the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]] long before appearing in the games, and [[#Pokémon Abilities|Pokémon Abilities]] are similar to the Pokémon Powers introduced in the ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'', which also introduced [[#Shiny Pokémon|Shiny Pokémon]], different colors of that type of the original Pokémon.

== Game structure ==
Each of the games in the handheld ''Pokémon'' RPG series, from 
the [[Pokémon Red and Blue|first games]] in 1996 to the [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|latest ones]] in 2017, takes place in a particular fictional region of the Pokémon world, and begins with the player receiving a [[#Starter Pokémon|Starter Pokémon]] from that region's Pokémon Professor. By traveling around the world, [[#Catching Pokémon|catching]] and [[Pokémon evolution|evolving]] Pokémon, and defeating other Trainers in [[#Pokémon battles|battle]], the player increases the size and strength of his or her Pokémon collection. A major subplot of each game is to defeat a [[criminal organization]] trying to take over the world through the misuse of Pokémon. These organizations include [[Team Rocket]], [[Team Magma]] and [[Team Aqua]], [[Team Galactic]], [[Team Plasma]], [[Team Flare]], and [[Team Skull]]/[[Aether Foundation]].

Various facilities can be found throughout the Pokémon world such as Pokémon Centers, Poké Marts, and Gyms. At a Pokémon Center, the player can have their Pokémon healed for free and access the PC, where players can organize their collection of Pokémon, store and withdraw items, and have their Pokédex rated. Prior to ''X'' and ''Y'', this is also where players can link up with other game cartridges or cards to battle or [[#Pokémon trades|trade]] with other players. Poké Marts are shops where players can buy [[#Items|items]] with the money they win during battles; certain cities may have specialized shops, like a pharmacy or a department store. Periodically, a town will contain a [[#Pokémon Gyms|Pokémon Gym]], which houses a powerful Trainer known as a [[Gym Leader]]. Victory against him/her grants the player a Gym Badge and typically advances the plot. After collecting eight Gym Badges, the player may challenge the region's [[Elite Four]] and Champion; defeating the Champion finishes the main story. Gyms are absent in ''Sun'' and ''Moon'', being replaced by trials which serve a similar purpose. As the name implies, instead of a straightforward battle, the player undergoes a trial. Upon completion the player receives a Z-crystal, a crystal which grants a Pokémon access to an extremely powerful move.

Completing the main storyline opens up other features in the games; this is primarily done by allowing passage into otherwise inaccessible places. Afterward, the game remains virtually open-ended, with the ultimate goal of the player being to obtain at least one member of each of the different species of Pokémon, thus completing the [[Pokédex]]. With the exception of the first generation and second generation, once all species of regional Pokémon are caught, the player may then update his Pokédex to the National Pokédex, with the new mission of catching all Pokémon from the previous series (aside from several event-exclusive Pokémon such as [[Jirachi]] and [[Volcanion]]). The number of Pokémon increases with each game generation, starting from 151 in the first generation to 807 as of ''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon''.

One of the reoccurring aspects of the ''Pokémon'' series of role-playing games is the choice of one of three different Pokémon at the start of the player's adventures. These trios are often labeled "starter Pokémon". The starter Pokémon, in chronological order of first appearance, are Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip, Turtwig, Chimchar, Piplup, Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott, Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie, Rowlet, Litten and Popplio.  Players have the option to choose one of three different [[#Pokémon types|types]] of Pokémon: a Grass type, a Fire type, and a Water type, though many starter Pokémon have an additional type or gain one by evolution.&lt;ref name=spy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html |title=Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire |last=Padilla |first=Raymond |publisher=GameSpy |access-date=2006-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002205143/http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html |archive-date=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Pokémon are supposedly indigenous to their regions, yet otherwise unattainable except through trading with another game, leading to their rarity. Many games include a rival character, who receives the Pokémon whose type is advantageous against the player's starter Pokémon.

The exception to this concept is ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'', in which players are given a [[Pikachu]], the Electric-type Mouse Pokémon famously serving as the mascot of the Pokémon media franchise, who walks along behind them.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Craig. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060929235010/http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162045p1.html Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition]. IGN. Retrieved 2006-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The rival Trainer receives an [[Eevee]], a Normal-type Pokémon. The Eevee will evolve into one of its three different evolved states depending on how well the player fares in battles with the rival in the beginning of the game.

=== Pokémon Gyms ===
{{nihongo|Pokémon Gyms|ポケモンジム|Pokémon Jimu}} are buildings situated throughout the Pokémon world, where Pokémon Trainers can train or compete to qualify for Pokémon League competitions. Although the internal organizations of Pokémon Gyms may vary, all specialize in one certain type of Pokémon, and all are manned by a {{nihongo4|[[Gym Leader]]|ジムリーダー|Jimu Rīdā}}, a formidable Trainer that acts as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. Pokémon Gyms can be found in most towns and cities in the Pokémon world.

When an official Gym Leader is defeated, the challenger wins a {{nihongo4|Badge|バッジ|Bajji}}, which serves as proof of a Trainer's skill and is a key part of advancing the plot. Victory also earns the challenger a [[Technical and Hidden Machines|Technical Machine]], which allows the player to teach his or her Pokémon a certain move. It also usually enables the player to utilize the overworld effects of one of the various Hidden Machines, such as the ability to cross bodies of water with the move Surf or the ability to remove some trees from paths with the move Cut. As the player collects Gym Badges, the maximum level at which traded Pokémon obey their commands increases.

After a player defeats the eight Gym Leaders, he or she can travel through Victory Road, which is often the final route, and then proceed to the Pokémon League and challenge the {{nihongo4|[[Elite Four]]|四天王|Shitennō}} and the region's Pokémon League {{nihongo4|Champion|チャンピオン|Champion}}. Defeating the Champion is considered to be the goal of the game.

=== Island Trials ===
In ''Sun'', ''Moon'', ''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'', there are no Gyms or Gym Leaders. The player is instead given various "trials" by characters known as Trial Captains. Though a similar concept, a trial is not necessarily a battle. A trial usually presents the player with a task that must complete to summon a Totem Pokémon, a more powerful version of a certain species of Pokémon. Once the player has summoned and defeated the Totem Pokémon, they receive a Z-Crystal, an item that allows Pokémon to use extremely powerful moves. Completing all of the trials on an island allows the player to challenge the island's "kahuna" in a standard Pokémon battle. The player can challenge the recently built Pokémon League after they have completed all four Grand Trials. After defeating the Elite Four, the player must then defend their title as Alola's First Champion by defeating a challenger.

== Pokémon battles ==
[[File:Pokémon FireRed first battle.png|left|frame|In a battle scene in ''[[Pokémon FireRed Version]]'', the Pokémon at the top right of the screen is the opponent's; the bottom left is the player's. The player's options are shown at the bottom right.]]

Battles between Pokémon are the central game mechanic of the ''Pokémon'' games. They are used to train Pokémon to become stronger, as competitions, and to reach certain objectives within the game. Battling can also be done between players by connecting two games.

''Pokémon'' uses a [[turn-based]] system. When the player challenges a Trainer or encounters a wild Pokémon, the screen changes to a battle scene with the player's Pokémon, the opposing Pokémon, their respective [[Health (gaming)|HP]] bars, and an option menu. At any time, the player may carry up to six Pokémon in his or her active party; the first Pokémon in the lineup is automatically sent into battle. At the start of each turn, both sides can choose to [[#Pokémon moves|attack]], use an [[#Items|item]], switch the Pokémon for another in their party, or attempt to flee from battle (against a wild Pokémon). If both sides attack, the one who goes first is determined by [[#Stats|Speed]], although some moves, items, and effects can override this. If either side chooses any other option, that action is performed before the attacks.

Each Pokémon uses moves to reduce their opponent's HP to zero, at which point the Pokémon {{nihongo4|faints|ひんし|hinshi}} and is unable to battle. (In the Pokémon world, Pokémon never die as a result of battling.) If the player's Pokémon wins, it receives [[experience point]]s; when enough have accumulated, the Pokémon's level increases. If the player's Pokémon faints, he/she may use another Pokémon; in battles against wild Pokémon, the player may attempt to flee instead. If all of a player's Pokémon have fainted, the player loses the battle. This causes the player to lose some money and return to the last Pokémon Center he or she visited.&lt;ref&gt;''Pokémon Diamond Version'' instruction booklet. p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] introduced {{nihongo4|Double Battles|ダブルバトル|Daburu Batoru}}, in which the opposing teams battle with two Pokémon at a time. Though the basic mechanics remain the same, moves may have multiple targets, and some affect the ally as well as the opponents. Additionally, some [[#Pokémon Abilities|Abilities]] work only in Double Battles. {{nihongo4|Multi Battles|マルチバトル|Maruchi Batoru}} were also introduced, with four Trainers in teams of two. The third-generation games only included Double Battles against other Trainers, but [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] introduced Double Battles with wild Pokémon under certain circumstances.

''Black'' and ''White'' also introduced Triple Battles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02.html|title=バトル {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rotation Battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-02.html|title=ローテーションバトル {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{nihongo4|Triple Battles|トリプルバトル|Toripuru Batoru}}, both teams send out three Pokémon at once, with all three battling simultaneously. In {{nihongo4|Rotation Battles|ローテーションバトル|Rōtēshon Batoru}}, both sides send out three Pokémon at once, but only use one at a time. The Pokémon which is battling can be switched out with the other two without using up a turn.

[[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']] introduced three new battling mechanics. {{nihongo4|Sky Battles|スカイバトル|Sukai Batoru}} are performed against hard-to-find Sky Trainers and can only be performed with Flying-type Pokémon or those with the Levitate Ability. These are also stated to be particularly difficult. {{nihongo4|Horde Encounters|群れバトル|Mure Batoru|"Group Battle"}} are battles where five wild Pokémon attack at once, encouraging the use of moves that hit multiple targets to make things easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/new_battles/ |title=New Ways to Battle! |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/battle/02.html |title=「スカイバトル」と「群れバトル」｜『ポケットモンスター Ｘ』『ポケットモンスター Ｙ』公式サイト |publisher=Pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4421350/pokemon-x-and-ys-horde-battles-and-sky-battles-revealed |title=Pokemon X and Y's Horde Battles and Sky Battles revealed |publisher=Polygon |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo4|Inverse Battles|さかさバトル|Sakasa Batoru|"Reverse Battle"}} are like normal battles, but the entire [[#Pokémon types|type]] chart is inverted. This means that an attack which would normally deal double damage instead deals half damage, and vice versa.

''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'' also introduce a new battle type, the SOS Battle. In these battles, the opposing Pokémon may call for an allies to assist them, making the battle two-on-one against the player.

In Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu and Pokémon Let’s Go Eevee, it appears that if you have two joy cons, a friend can join in and fight with you against trainers. This makes it a Two on One battle against the CPU.

[[File:Pokemon Type Chart.svg|thumb|275px|This chart shows the current eighteen Pokémon types (as of ''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'') and their strengths, weaknesses, and immunities against one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/_ui/img/_en/art/Type-Matchup_chart_EN.pdf|title=Type Matchup Chart}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A Pokémon's {{nihongo4|type|タイプ|taipu}} is an elemental attribute determining the strengths and weaknesses of each Pokémon and its moves. Pokémon take double damage from attacking moves of types they are weak to and half damage from moves they resist. These type matchups offset one another in [[rock–paper–scissors]]-style relationships. The game's primary example of this elemental relationship is that between the Grass, Fire, and Water types: a Grass-type Pokémon is weak to Fire but resists Water, Fire is weak to Water but resists Grass, and Water is weak to Grass but resists Fire. Some Pokémon types grant full immunity to certain attack types; for instance, Ghost types take no damage from Normal- or Fighting-type moves. These weaknesses, resistances, and immunities can be combined if a Pokémon has two types. For example, a Ground/Flying-type Pokémon would be immune to Electric moves, as its weakness as a Flying Type is negated by its Ground Type; however, such a Pokémon takes quadruple damage from Ice moves, as both Ground and Flying are weak to Ice. Some Pokémon Abilities can change these interactions, such as Levitate making Pokémon immune to Ground-type moves.

In the original ''Red'', ''Green'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'' games, there are a total of 15 Pokémon types, including all those listed above as examples, as well as Poison, Psychic, Bug, Rock, and Dragon. The Dark and Steel types were added in ''Gold'' and ''Silver''. ''X'' and ''Y'' introduced the Fairy type, bringing the total to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/why-game-freak-introduced-the-fairy-type-in-pokemon-512779904|title=Why Game Freak Introduced The Fairy Type In Pokemon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types have special properties unrelated to the damage chart; for example, Grass-type Pokémon are unaffected by spore- and powder-based status moves, and Electric types are immune to being paralyzed.

The console RPGs ''Colosseum'' and ''XD'' featured a unique move type known as Shadow, but it does not appear outside these games. Shadow Pokémon can be considered to be of this type, but they still retain their regular typing as well. In ''Pokémon XD'', Shadow moves are super effective against non-Shadow Pokémon and not very effective against Shadow Pokémon.

=== Pokémon moves ===
Like the characters in many [[role-playing video game]]s, Pokémon are able to learn a wide variety of {{nihongo4|moves|技|waza}}. These moves may inflict damage, induce status problems, restore health, or perform actions that in some way affect the battle. The general strength of and resistance to these moves are determined by the various [[#Stats|statistics]] a particular Pokémon has. All moves have a type, {{nihongo4|power|威力|Iryoku}}, accuracy, and number of Power Points (PP). The moves that one Pokémon may learn are different from another depending on the species of Pokémon; even those that [[#Pokémon evolution|evolve]] from others do not necessarily learn all the same moves that their predecessors learn. Each Pokémon may only know a total of four moves at any one time. Moves may be learned through leveling up, using [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|TMs and HMs]], [[#Pokémon breeding|breeding]], and move tutors ([[Non-player character|NPC]]s that teach moves).

Each move is classified as one of the 18 [[#Pokémon types|Pokémon types]]. The effectiveness of a move is dependent on how susceptible the target Pokémon's type is to the move's type. Phrases associated with this aspect are "It's super effective!" (damage is at least doubled), "It's not very effective…" (damage is at least halved), and "It doesn't affect [defending Pokémon]..." (damage and all effects are negated). A Pokémon with the same type as the move it uses will receive a 50% bonus to its damage, referred to as a "Same-Type Attack Bonus" (STAB) in game [[jargon]]. Moves are further defined as "physical" or "special"; physical moves are generally those that would make physical contact, such as punches or bites, while special moves generally involve elemental control, such as breathing fire or manipulating the wind. Prior to the ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' games, moves' status of being either physical or special depended on the type, rather than on the individual move. There are also "status" moves, which deal no direct damage and often inflict status changes on the defending or attacking Pokémon. Damage-inflicting moves remove a certain number of [[Health (gaming)|Health Points]] from the target Pokémon based on the types of the move and its target, and on the statistics of the two Pokémon. The damage can also be affected by [[#Items|items]] held by either Pokémon or by their [[#Pokémon Abilities|Abilities]].

Each move has a specific {{nihongo4|accuracy|命中|Meichū}}, which determines the chance of hitting the target Pokémon assuming no changes to user's [[#Stats|accuracy]] or the target's evasiveness. Very powerful moves often have below-average accuracy. Moves with standard 100% accuracy ratings are susceptible to changes in accuracy and evasiveness, but specific never-miss moves such as Aerial Ace bypass both and always land.

The PP (Power Points) of a move indicate how many times a Pokémon may use that move. As with accuracy, a powerful move is often offset by having a low number of PP. Once a Pokémon uses up all the PP for a certain move, it can no longer use that move. If a Pokémon expends all the PP for all of its moves, it then resorts to a move called Struggle, which damages the user as well as the target. Depleted PP can be restored by using certain items or by visiting a Pokémon Center.

Many moves have effects beyond inflicting damage. A common secondary effects is a chance to induce a certain {{nihongo4|[[status effect]]|状態異常|jōtai ijō}} on the target: {{nihongo4|paralysis|まひ|Mahi}}, {{nihongo4|burn|やけど|Yakedo}}, {{nihongo4|freeze|こおり|Kōri}}, {{nihongo4|poison|どく|Doku}}, or {{nihongo4|sleep|ねむり|Nemuri}}; each negatively affects how the afflicted Pokémon performs in battle. For example, many Electric-type moves have small chances of Paralyzing the target. Some moves have negative side-effects for the user, such as forcing the player to wait a turn before or after use, or causing recoil damage. A few moves, such as Splash, deal no damage and have no effect whatsoever except when used as a Z-Move.

=== Z-Moves ===
Once per battle, if a Pokémon holds a Z-Crystal, it can use an upgraded version of one of its moves. This upgraded move is called a Z-Move. Z-Moves based on attacking moves tend to have much higher power than normal; those based on status moves usually incur a benefit on the user before executing the move. The player cannot execute more than one Z-Move per battle.

=== Moves outside of battles ===
Certain moves can also be used in the overworld in order to bypass obstacles (e.g. small trees), quickly travel between previously-visited locations, escape dungeons, or heal Pokémon. Usually, Pokémon will learn these moves with the use of the [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|HM]] items and will be able to use them in the aforementioned ways after certain Badges are obtained.

=== Pokémon abilities ===
Pokémon {{nihongo4|abilities|特性|Tokusei}} are special attributes which were introduced in [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]. Specific species of Pokémon have one to three possible Abilities, with individual Pokémon exhibiting one Ability each. Unlike the moves a Pokémon knows, its Ability cannot normally change (except sometimes during evolution, and by using the rare item Ability Capsule, which was introduced in [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']]).

Most Pokémon use their Abilities in battle. Abilities can strengthen a Pokémon's own statistics or weaken a foe, inflict [[status effect]]s such as paralysis or poisoning, or perform other effects. For instance, a [[Bulbasaur]] uses its Overgrow Ability to power up its Grass-Type attacks when it has low HP, and when [[Arbok]] is sent into battle, it will use its Intimidate Ability to lower the opposing Pokémon's Attack statistic. Some Abilities also grant immunities or resistances, such as [[Lapras]]'s Water Absorb restoring its own HP when hit by Water-type attacks. Not all Abilities are helpful and may be implemented to hinder a Pokémon. For example, [[Slaking (Pokémon)|Slaking]], which would otherwise be extraordinarily powerful, has the Truant Ability, which only allows it to attack every other turn.

Some Abilities have effects outside of Pokémon battles. For example, Pokémon with the Pickup Ability, like [[Meowth]], will sometimes retrieve items off the ground. A Pokémon with the Ability Intimidate, mentioned above, will cause the player to encounter lower-level wild Pokémon less often.&lt;ref&gt;Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&amp;nbsp;277&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'' introduced Hidden Abilities, which initially could only be found on Pokémon primarily acquired from the Internet-based Pokémon Global Link, either through the Pokémon Dream World feature or through promotional releases. There are also rare instances of Pokémon with their Hidden Abilities available in the main game, either as a special encounter or as an in-game Trade with an NPC. ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' introduced the game mechanic of {{nihongo4|Hidden Grottoes|隠し穴|Kakushi Ana}}, areas where the player has a chance to find a Pokémon that has its Hidden Ability. Subsequent games introduced more means of obtaining Pokémon with Hidden Abilities; for instance, Pokémon encountered in Horde Battles have a small chance of having their Hidden Ability.

== Stats ==
All Pokémon have six {{nihongo4|[[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]]|能力|Nōryoku|"Attribute"}} (colloquially called "stats") which affect their performance in battle. These are HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. These statistics can be temporarily modified during battle by Abilities, items, and moves.
* '''HP''' (short for Health Points): &lt;!-- the official Pokémon Emerald website says it's "Health Points" in Tucker's trivia; can we add this as a citation? --&gt; A Pokémon faints when its HP reaches zero, and it cannot be used in battle again until it is revived at a Pokémon Center, or with a special item. However, they can still use moves in the field.
* {{nihongo4|'''Attack'''|こうげき|Kōgeki}}: Determines the strength of a Pokémon's physical [[#Pokémon moves|attacks]].
* {{nihongo4|'''Defense'''|ぼうぎょ|Bōgyo}}: Determines the Pokémon's resilience to physical attacks.
* {{nihongo4|'''Special Attack'''|とくこう|Tokukō}}: Similar to Attack, determines the power of a Pokémon's special attacks. Commonly abbreviated as Sp. Atk.
* {{nihongo4|'''Special Defense'''|とくぼう|Tokubō}}: Similar to Defense, determines the Pokémon's resilience to special attacks. Commonly abbreviated as Sp. Def.
* {{nihongo4|'''Speed'''|すばやさ|Subayasa}}: After battle commands are entered, the Speed statistics of the participating Pokémon are compared. With some exceptions, Pokémon with higher Speed make their moves before those with lower Speed.

There are also two other statistics, {{nihongo4|Accuracy|命中率|Meichūritsu}} and {{nihongo4|Evasiveness|回避率|Kaihiritsu}}, which are not affected when Pokémon level up. No Pokémon has innately higher Accuracy or Evasiveness than any other, but they can be modified during battle like other statistics. Increasing Accuracy makes a move more likely to hit, while increasing Evasiveness makes the opponent's move more likely to miss. A Pokémon's Accuracy, the opponent's Evasiveness, and the accuracy value of a given move affect the probability that the move will hit. Evasiveness was called "Evade" in the first generation and "Evasion" in the second.

In ''Pokémon Red'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'', the Special Attack and the Special Defense stat were a single stat, named the "Special" stat, which determined both power with and resistance against special attacks.

When Pokémon level up, their statistics increase, as determined by the Pokémon's base stat values, effort values, Pokémon Nature, and individual values. These variables working in tandem provide each individual Pokémon with its own unique stats.

=== Base stat values ===
{{nihongo4|Base stat values|種族値|shuzokuchi}}, known officially as species strengths, determine the natural statistical strengths of the various Pokémon species. Every species is assigned a number in each stat; the higher the number, the higher the stat can potentially be. While these values may greatly vary between species, they are the same for each member of that species. It is the difference among species which explains why all [[List of generation I Pokémon#Aerodactyl|Aerodactyl]] will have a higher Speed than any [[Snorlax]] of the same level; however, it is the combination of other factors that causes some Snorlax to be faster than others. Adding up all the base stat values for a certain species generates the base stat total, which players use to determine approximately how strong that species is.

=== Effort values ===
{{nihongo4|Effort values|努力値|doryokuchi|EVs}} are hidden values that affect the strengths of a Pokémon in particular statistical areas. Differing effort value levels between two Pokémon can create a significant difference in the two Pokémon's statistical strengths. When a Pokémon battles and defeats an opponent, they gain experience points, also known as EXP, and also receive a number and type of EVs according to the defeated Pokémon's species. Every defeated Pokémon gives at least one EV to each of the Pokémon that fought it. Certain factors, like holding the Macho Brace item, can increase the rate at which EVs are gained in battle. In [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], a condition known as {{nihongo4|Pokérus|ポケルス|Pokerusu}} was introduced that has a small chance of appearing on a player's Pokémon after a battle with a wild Pokémon. Pokérus doubles the rate at which EVs are obtained permanently, and will be contagious for a certain number of days, allowing it to spread to the player's other Pokémon. In addition, consuming certain items can increase a Pokémon's EVs, and certain Berries decrease EVs while increasing a Pokémon's friendship value. There is a limit on the number of EVs Pokémon can have, both for each individual stats and combined across all stats, which prevents stats from increasing indefinitely. The total limit allows for maximum Effort Values in two stats simultaneously.

In the first- and second-generation games, a similar system usually referred to Stat Experience or Stat Exp. was used. As with Effort Values, there is a limit to how much Stat Exp. a Pokémon can have in each stat; however, unlike Effort Values, there is no limit to the total Stat Exp. a Pokémon can have across all stats, meaning that a Pokémon can have maximum Stat Exp. in every stat. Also of note is that, in order for Pokémon from the first generation (where there was only one Special stat) and the second generation (where there are both Special Attack and Special Defense stats) to be forward and backward compatible for trading, Stat Exp. was not tracked separately for Special Attack and Special Defense in the second generation games. Instead, the Special Stat Exp. value was used to calculate both Special Attack and Special Defense.

In [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']], a minigame known as {{nihongo4|Super Training|スパトレ|Supatore}} is introduced that allows players to more accurately manage the effort values. The player can do this by playing a [[Association football|soccer]]-like minigame, which also rewards the player with training bags to continue the training passively. The Pokémon's effort values can also be viewed in the Super Training interface, which includes an "Effort-o-Meter" to allow the player to see the maximum capability of increasing the Pokémon's effort values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/super_training/ |title=Super Training |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/system/05.html |title=ポケモンを特訓だ！ 新たなポケモンの育て方、「スパトレ」！｜『ポケットモンスター Ｘ』『ポケットモンスター Ｙ』公式サイト |publisher=Pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], a graph of a Pokémon's EVs along with its base stats can be seen by pressing the Y button while viewing the summary of a Pokémon. A sparkling stat shows that the Pokémon had obtained the maximum number of EVs for the stat. Pokémon can gain EVs passively through a feature called "Poké Pelago".

=== Pokémon Natures ===
Pokémon {{nihongo4|Natures|性格|Seikaku}} were first introduced in ''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Each Pokémon has a Nature, randomly assigned when it is generated, which cannot be changed. A Pokémon's Nature affects the rate at which some of its stats increase: out of the twenty-five possible Natures, twenty will increase one stat's growth rate but decrease another's. The other five modify the same stat in both increases and decreases, and thus the Pokémon's overall growth is unaffected. Natures also determine which flavor of [[#Pokémon Contests|Pokéblocks or Poffins]] that Pokémon likes and dislikes.

=== Individual values ===
{{nihongo4|Individual values|個体値|kotaichi}} or IVs are a hidden value for each statistic which determine a Pokémon's maximum potential. These values are randomly generated along with each Pokémon when it is encountered or bred, and set in stone for the rest of the game. These hidden values are why even Pokémon that seem identical and have been raised the same way may have different stats. IVs range from 0 to 31, and their Generations I and II predecessors, "determinant values", ranged from 0 to 15.

== Items ==
Items can be found in the world, given to the player by NPCs, or bought at shops for in-game currency.

=== Recovery items ===
Many items received in the game are used to heal Pokémon during and outside of battles, much like a Pokémon Center does. Potions and drinks restore HP. A range of items cure various status conditions, such as Antidotes for poisoning and Awakenings for sleep. Revives restore a Pokémon back to health after it has lost all of its HP. Ethers and Elixirs restore the PP of a Pokémon's moves to varying degrees.

=== Technical and Hidden Machines ===
{{nihongo4|Technical Machines|わざマシン|Waza Mashin}} and {{nihongo4|Hidden Machines|ひでんマシン|Hiden Mashin}}, commonly abbreviated as TMs and HMs, can be used to teach moves to Pokémon, including some moves that they would otherwise not learn by increasing in level. TMs are commonly found in the field, in shops, and as rewards for defeating a Gym Leader. Up until the fifth generation, a TM could only be used once. HMs are more rare, but can be used as many times as desired. HMs are often vital to game progression as they have important effects outside of battle, allowing the player to traverse certain obstacles. For example, Pokémon who learn the HM move Surf can transport the protagonist over water, which is necessary to reach island locations. These effects are usually accessible only after defeating a particular Gym Leader. When a Pokémon learns an HM move, the move cannot be deleted or replaced unless the player uses the services of an NPC known as the Move Deleter. Some Pokémon can learn TMs or HMS that their pre-evolutions or evolutions can't. Two prime examples are Kirlia, who can learn Dazzling Gleam and Swords Dance, with both of its evolutions learning one but not the other; and Gyarados, who can learn Surf when its pre-evolution can't.

=== Key items ===
Key items are rarer than regular items and are usually given to the player rather than found. These include [[fishing rod]]s which are used to find water-dwelling Pokémon, a bicycle which allows the protagonist to move around faster, a dowsing machine, and keys which open locked doors leading to important areas. These items cannot be thrown away, sold, or given to a Pokémon.

=== Held items ===
Starting with [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], each Pokémon is able to hold a single item. Items carried by Pokémon can have a range of effects. Some, like Berries, are consumed after one use and boost HP or stats. Others persistently boost move power, defense, Speed, and more. Just like moves, some items hinder the user to compensate their power; for instance, the Life Orb boosts the damage of all of the holder's attacks, but hurts it after each successful attack. Others items solely harm the user except in rare situations, such as the Toxic Orb which badly poisons it. [[Pokémon X and Y|Pokémon ''X'' and ''Y'']] introduced Mega Stones used to [[Gameplay of Pokemon#Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] members of the stone's species, and [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Sun'' and ''Moon'']] introduced Z-Crystals, which give the holder access to an especially powerful once-per-battle Z-Move depending on the crystal's relevant base move. Items like the Razor Claw and Razor Fang [[#Pokémon evolution|evolve]] a Pokémon when held while a condition is met. Most items, including [[#Poké Ball|Poké Ball]]s and [[Gameplay of Pokemon#Items|Potions]], can be ''held'' but have no effect on their own when held. Items can be moved between, removed from, and neutralized on Pokemon through moves like Trick, Knock Off, and Embargo respectively, or consumed to damage the opponent through the attacks Fling and Natural Gift. Some items, such as Hidden Machines and Key Items, cannot be held.

== Catching Pokémon ==
[[File:Pokéball.png|thumb|left|150px|The standard Poké Ball is a well-known icon of the ''Pokémon'' franchise.]]
Because each player begins the game with only one starter Pokémon, catching is one of the most fundamental aspects of Pokémon, and the primary method of recruiting new Pokémon to the player's party.

In a battle against a wild Pokémon, the player may, instead of defeating it, attempt to catch it by using one of many different types of [[#Poké Ball|Poké Ball]]s. The odds of success vary, but are increased if the target Pokémon's HP is low, if the target is affected by a status-altering effect like sleep or paralysis, and if a stronger or specially-suited Poké Ball is used.

If the catch is successful, the caught Pokémon's data is added to the [[#Pokédex|Pokédex]], the player may give the Pokémon a nickname, and the Pokémon is added to the player's party. However, if the player's party is filled to its maximum of six Pokémon, the caught Pokémon is instead sent to a storage box accessible at Pokémon Centers. In the first- and second-generation games, if the current PC box is full, the player will be unable to catch any new Pokémon until he or she accesses a PC and switches to a different box. In more recent games, new Pokémon are automatically transferred to the next available box.

=== Poké Ball ===
The {{nihongo4|'''Poké Ball'''|モンスターボール|Monsutābōru|"Monster Ball"}} is a spherical device used by Pokémon Trainers to catch wild Pokémon and store them in the player's inventory when not active. Upon contact, the balls draw a Pokémon inside and then close automatically. Wild Pokémon are able to resist and break free; however, weakened Pokémon and those with status conditions are less able to struggle and therefore more easily caught. [[Legendary Pokémon]] are much more capable of resisting being caught, and will often require many Poké Balls or more powerful Poké Balls in order to catch them. If the player attempts to catch a non-player character's Pokémon, the opponent will block the Ball to prevent its theft.

As depicted in the anime and manga series, the Poké Ball, when not in use, is the size of a [[golf ball]] and, with a press of the central button, enlarges to the size of a [[baseball]]. The Pokémon is released for battle by throwing the ball; when retrieving a Pokémon, a beam of red light converts the Pokémon into energy to reclaim it. Poké Balls are explained as being incredibly comfortable for Pokémon, so much that they would willingly enter one without any sort of encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hilliard |first1=Kyle |last2=Masuda |first2=Junichi |date=December 2012 |title=Pokémon's Burning Questions |journal=[[Game Informer]] |issue=236 |pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pokémon [[Voltorb]], [[Electrode (Pokémon)|Electrode]], [[Foongus]], and [[Amoonguss]] are often mistaken for Poké Balls, due to their shape and color schemes which highly resemble Poké Balls.

Various types of Poké Balls exist. Introduced in [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']], are, in order of progressing strength, the Poké Ball, {{nihongo4|Great Ball|スーパーボール|Sūpā Bōru|"Super Ball"}}, {{nihongo4|Ultra Ball|ハイパーボール|Haipā Bōru|"Hyper Ball"}}, and the {{nihongo4|Master Ball|マスターボール|Masutā Bōru}}. The Master Ball always succeeds against any Pokémon that can be caught, and of which typically only one is available in the game. In [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'']], [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], there are fruits called '''Apricorns''', which, when given to Kurt in Azalea Town, make one of seven special types of Poké Balls, depending on the Apricorn's color. The seven kinds of Poké Balls Kurt can make (and the seven color Apricorns they are made out of) are Level (Red), Moon (Yellow), Lure (Blue), Friend (Green), Love (Pink), Fast (White), and Heavy (Black). Beginning in [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'', ''Sapphire'', and ''Emerald'']], other specialized balls appear, including the Timer Ball, which becomes more effective as the number of turns in the current battle rises, and the Net Ball, which has a better chance of catching Water and Bug-type Pokémon, among others. In addition, in several games there exists an area called the Safari Zone in which only Safari Balls can be used; these cannot be obtained or used elsewhere in the game. ''[[Pokémon Sun and Moon]]'' introduced the Beast Ball, which is designed for capturing Ultra Beasts and is much more effective at capturing them than standard Poké Balls. There is also a special kind of Poké Ball known as the Cherish Ball; Pokémon in Cherish Balls can only be obtained through special distribution events.

In the [[Nintendo GameCube]] RPGs, ''[[Pokémon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]]'', the player is able to catch non-player characters' Pokémon through the use of the Snag Machine, which turns Poké Balls into Snag Balls. Snag Balls are capable of catching any Pokémon (with the same strength limitations as the standard Poké, Great, Ultra, and Master Balls), and they are developed by the antagonists to steal Pokémon where they are not common in the wild. Snag Balls can also be used by the player to catch the specific Shadow Pokémon who have been tainted by the antagonist group and that the player is required to purify for game completion.

Poké Balls have appeared in every installment of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, releasing a Pokémon to assist the player who grabbed it. ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' also introduces the Master Ball, which almost always releases a legendary Pokémon, with a small chance of releasing Goldeen instead.

[[UGO.com]] listed the Poké Ball eighteenth on their list of "Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups" citing how everybody runs to get it in the [[Super Smash Bros.]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |title=Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups - UGO.com |publisher=[[UGO.com]] |author=Chris Littler |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019184843/http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pokédex ===
The {{nihongo4|'''Pokédex'''|[[:ja:ポケモン図鑑|ポケモン図鑑]]|Pokémon Zukan|lit. "Pokémon Encyclopedia"}} is an [[electronics|electronic]] device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon. The name ''Pokédex'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Pokémon '' and ''index''.&lt;ref&gt;Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;/ref&gt; In the video games, whenever a Pokémon is first caught, its height, weight, species type, and a short description will be added to a player's Pokédex. Each region has its own Pokédex, which differ in appearance, species of Pokémon catalogued, and functions such as the ability to sort the list of Pokémon based on [[alphabetical order]] or display the Pokémon's size compared to the player character. The "National Pokédex" allows Pokémon from all regions to be catalogued. The Nintendo 3DS application ''[[Pokédex 3D Pro]]'' features all of the Pokémon with all of its forms and each one has its own animation.

== Pokémon evolution ==
[[File:Pokemon evolution.png|right|thumb|150px|A series of screenshots depicting an [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Abra evolving into a Kadabra]] in ''Pokémon Emerald''.]]

{{nihongo4|Evolution|進化|shinka}} is a sudden change in form of a Pokémon, more akin to a [[metamorphosis]] than actual [[evolution]], and is usually accompanied by an increase in [[#Stats|stat]] values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pokémon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pokémon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pokémon's [[#Friendship|friendship]], the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pokémon levels up, having a separate specific Pokémon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pokémon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.

The player can choose to halt evolution at any time before the animation is finished by simply by pressing the B button, unless the evolution was intentionally initiated by using an evolutionary stone on the Pokémon. Pokémon whose evolutions are canceled will attempt to evolve again after the condition for evolution is met again. Preventing evolution for a time can be useful, as many Pokémon learn moves sooner in their unevolved form than in their evolved form.

The ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'' introduced the idea of numerical stages for referring to different points in a Pokémon's evolution. This has translated into colloquial usage among fans of the games. All Pokémon can be placed at one of four evolutionary stages (though no existing Pokémon line includes more than three out of the four stages): Basic Pokémon, Stage 1 Pokémon which evolve from Basic Pokémon, Stage 2 Pokémon which evolve from Stage 1 Pokémon, and [[#Pokémon breeding|Baby Pokémon]] which are acquired by breeding certain Basic or Stage 1 Pokémon and hatching their Eggs. A Pokémon higher up on this evolutionary scale is sometimes called an evolved form of the previous stages; likewise, a Pokémon lower down on the scale is said to be a pre-evolved form of later Pokémon in the chain.

=== Leveling up ===
This is the most common method of evolution across all Pokémon generations, and involves Pokémon acquiring experience points through battling other Pokémon. For example, Caterpie evolves into Metapod when it reaches any level at or above 7, and Metapod evolves into Butterfree at or above level 10.

=== Evolutionary stones ===
Evolutionary stones are items which can be found throughout the games. Some Pokémon can have particular evolutionary stones used on them, and doing so will cause the Pokémon to evolve. Initially five evolutionary stones were introduced into the game, the Water, Thunder, Leaf, Moon and Fire stones. Later generations introduced more kinds, bringing the total to ten in Generation VII.

=== Trading ===
Some Pokémon, like  [[Machoke]]  and [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Kadabra]], evolve when [[#Pokémon trades|traded]] between players. Additional evolutionary requirements can also exist; for instance, [[Seadra]] evolves into [[Kingdra]] only if it holds a Dragon Scale when traded, and [[Shelmet]] and [[Karrablast]] only evolve when traded for each other.

=== Friendship ===
A Pokémon's {{nihongo4|friendship|なつき度|Natsuki-do|lit. "Degree of Emotional Attachment"; nicknamed "Happiness" by players}} is an attribute that can rise or fall based upon several conditions and events. This aspect, introduced in ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'', was what determined Pikachu's stat growth and affected the outcome of certain NPC events (such as receiving Bulbasaur in Cerulean City). In [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] it is a means to evolve several Pokémon. When Pokémon like [[Chansey]] or [[Golbat]] level up and have very high Friendship, they will evolve.

In addition to its use in certain evolutions, there are two moves base their power on the Pokémon's friendship value—Return and Frustration.

=== Affection ===
In [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']], a feature known as {{nihongo4|'''Pokémon-Amie'''|ポケパルレ|Pokeparure|"PokéParler"}} was introduced; in [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'']], the feature is known as '''Pokémon Refresh'''. It allows players to more directly interact with and care for Pokémon in a manner similar to some [[digital pet]] games. This minigame utilizes the touchscreen to allow players to pet their Pokémon and feed them sweets to raise their affection value. In battle, Pokémon with high Affection may turn to their Trainer to await orders and express emotions. Additionally, they can receive certain benefits such as an increased chance to land [[critical hit]]s if their affection has reached a high enough value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/pokemon_amie/ |title=At Play with Pokémon-Amie! |publisher=pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/system/01.html |script-title=ja:かわいがって絆を深める、「ポケパルレ」!｜『ポケットモンスター Ｘ』『ポケットモンスター Ｙ』公式サイト |publisher=pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-09-05|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eevee must have high affection and must know a Fairy-type move to evolve into Sylveon.

=== Mega Evolution ===
{{For|the concept in biology|Megaevolution}}
{{nihongo4|Mega Evolution|メガシンカ|Mega Shinka}} is a mechanic introduced in [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']], which further increases the abilities of specific Pokémon. If the player character possesses an item called the {{nihongo4|Key Stone|キーストーン|Kī Sutōn}}, and a Pokémon is holding a {{nihongo4|Mega Stone|メガストーン|Mega Sutōn}} that corresponds to its species with the exception of [[Rayquaza]], which only needs the move Dragon Ascent and must not be holding a Z-Crystal, that Pokémon will be able to Mega Evolve during battle. The player cannot perform more than one Mega Evolution per battle. Only some Pokémon species have corresponding Mega Stones, so only those Pokémon are capable of Mega Evolution. Unlike normal evolution, this transformation is temporary, and the Pokémon will revert to its normal form after the battle. Mega Evolved Pokémon have higher stats than their normal forms, and may also have a different type or Ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/archive/09-04-2013/ |title=Pokémon Direct 9.04.2013 |publisher=Nintendo.com |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mewtwo]] was the first known example of a Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution, with Mega Mewtwo Y appearing in a special episode of the [[Pokémon (anime)|television series]] and the film ''[[Pokémon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened]]''. Two Pokémon, [[Charizard]] and [[Mewtwo]], have multiple Mega Evolved forms, and the one they can Mega Evolve into is dependent on which Mega Stone they hold; for instance, if Mewtwo holds a Mewtwonite Y, it will Mega Evolve into Mega Mewtwo Y.

=== Primal Reversion ===

{{See also|Atavism}}

{{nihongo4|Primal Reversion|ゲンシカイキ|Genshi Kaiki}} is a mechanic introduced in [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pokémon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-ca/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/primal-groudon-and-primal-kyogre|title=Omega Alpha|work=pokemonrubysapphire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two Pokémon, [[Groudon]] and [[Kyogre]], are capable of Primal Reversion. These Pokémon will undergo Primal Reversion automatically if they hold the Red Orb or Blue Orb (respectively) when sent into battle. Like Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion increases the Pokémon's stats and changes their Abilities; however, Primal Reversion has been called the reverse of Mega Evolution, since the Pokémon reverts to its older, primal form, rather than a more advanced form. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion can be performed more than once per battle.

=== Bond Phenomenon ===
Bond Phenomenon (キズナ現象 ''Bond Phenomenon'') is a mechanic that debuted in the anime's ''XY series'' and was introduced into the core series games in ''[[Pokémon Sun and Moon]]''. The only Pokémon capable of this transformation is Greninja with the Battle Bond Ability. Greninja will undergo a transformation into Ash-Greninja if it knocks out a Pokémon during battle, giving it an appearance similar to [[Ash Ketchum]], increased stats, and a stronger Water Shuriken. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion, and Ultra Burst, Bond Phenomenon does not require a corresponding item.

=== Ultra Burst ===
Ultra Burst (ウルトラバースト ''Ultra Burst'') is a mechanic introduced in ''[[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]]''. Only [[List of generation VII Pokémon#Necrozma|Necrozma]] in either its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings form is capable of Ultra Burst. Necrozma may undergo Ultra Burst when it is holding the Ultranecrozium Z Z-Crystal, which will allow it to transform into Ultra Necrozma. Then, if it knows Photon Geyser, will be able to use the Z-Move Light that Burns the Sky on the next turn. Like Mega Evolution, Bond Phenomenon, and Primal Reversion, Ultra Burst increases Necrozma's stats and is a temporary transformation.

== Rare Pokémon ==

=== Legendary Pokémon ===
{{nihongo4|"Legendary Pokémon"|伝説のポケモン|Densetsu no Pokémon}} is a [[technical terminology|term of art]]. A Legendary Pokémon is not simply an individual Pokémon about which legends are written; rather, a species is considered Legendary if it has been designated as such by [[The Pokémon Company]]. Since the ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' versions of the games (with the exception of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''), the main series' game package features one Legendary Pokémon, usually the Pokémon most involved in the main storyline of that game. In most cases, Legendary Pokémon are exceptionally powerful, difficult to catch, and unable to [[#Pokémon evolution|evolve]] (with the exception of the [[List of generation VII Pokémon#Type: Null|Type: Null]] and [[List of generation VII Pokémon#Cosmog|Cosmog]] evolutionary lines), and no known Legendary Pokémon is capable of [[#Pokémon breeding|breeding]]. Certain Legendary Pokémon colloquially termed "runners" or "roaming Pokémon" randomly move around the world map and flee from battle, making them even harder to obtain.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

=== Mythical Pokémon ===
{{nihongo4|"Mythical Pokémon"|幻のポケモン|Maboroshi no Pokémon}} is a separate group of Pokémon. The term is commonly associated with Pokémon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, requiring an external mechanic to obtain them; however, some Mythical Pokémon have been made obtainable in later releases. These Pokémon are usually placed at the end of their respective games' Pokédex and can only be obtained through distribution events set up by Nintendo. The first of these Mythical Pokémon was [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]], who was programmed into the ''Red'' and ''Green'' games as a secret character by [[Shigeki Morimoto]] without any knowledge of the other members of the development team, and was not announced until several months after the games' release in a special promotion. Since then, the games have continued to feature Pokémon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, but the programming that allow the player to catch them within the games can be activated by special items (or other Pokémon) distributed by Nintendo. The first of these such items was the GS Ball in ''Crystal'', which was distributed to players in Japan through the mobile phone connector, allowing them to encounter [[Celebi (Pokémon)|Celebi]]. Like Legendary Pokémon, Mythical Pokémon are generally extremely powerful and difficult to catch, are usually not part of an evolutionary line (with the exception of [[Meltan]] and [[Melmetal]]), and cannot breed (with the exception of [[Manaphy]]).

=== Shiny Pokémon ===
[[File:ShinyZubatEncounter.JPG|thumb|left|The player finds a green Zubat in ''Pokémon FireRed Version''.]]

'''Shiny Pokémon''' were first introduced in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Gold'' and ''Silver'']] as a way to demonstrate the new color-capabilities of the [[Game Boy Color]] system. These are Pokémon which have a different coloration than normal; in earlier games, this was done by means of a [[palette swap]]. Encountering a Shiny Pokémon is extremely rare; the probability under normal conditions is 1 in 8,192 (1 in 4,096 from the sixth generation onwards)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/one-mans-five-year-quest-to-find-a-shiny-pokemon-1603763304|title=One Man's Five-Year Quest To Find A Shiny Pokémon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are some major exceptions to this rule, such as the red [[Gyarados]] present in ''Pokémon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'', ''HeartGold'', and ''SoulSilver'', and the black [[Haxorus]], the blue/yellow [[Gible]], and the pink [[Dratini]] present in [[Pokémon Black 2 and White 2|''Pokémon Black 2'' and ''White 2'']]. 

There are various ways of increasing the chance of getting a Shiny Pokémon. In second-generation games, breeding a Shiny Pokémon with a regular Pokémon has a higher chance (1 in 64) of producing a Shiny Pokémon. In ''Diamond'', ''Pearl'', ''Platinum'', ''X'', and ''Y'', the Poké Radar can be used to "chain" Pokémon of the same species, improving the odds of a Shiny Pokémon with each link (up to 40 links, when the odds are 1 in 200). Since Generation IV, [[#Pokémon breeding|breeding]] Pokémon that originated in games of two different languages results in Eggs with a 1 in 1,638 (Generation IV games) or 1 in 1365 (Black and White onwards) chance to contain a Shiny Pokémon; this method of increasing odds has been dubbed the "Masuda method" after developer [[Junichi Masuda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-to-get-a-shiny-pokemon-in-pokemon-x-and-y |title=How to Get a Shiny Pokemon In Pokemon X and Y |last=Khaw |first=Cassandra |publisher=USgamer |access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an item introduced in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called the Shiny Charm increases the probability of finding Shiny Pokémon. However, this item is only accessible long after completing the game, as the player must have completed the National Pokédex (excluding Mythical Pokémon). Beginning in ''Black'' and ''White'', certain Pokémon in each game are 'Shiny-locked', meaning the player cannot obtain a Shiny variant of these Pokémon in normal gameplay.

[[Pokémon Sun and Moon|Pokémon ''Sun'' and ''Moon'']]'s SOS Battle mechanic created a new way to "hunt" for Shiny Pokemon. If a wild Pokemon calls allies to help (requiring the Adrenaline Orb in the games' [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|sequels]]) and the ally is continually of the same species in a "chain", the chance that it calls a Shiny Pokemon rises up to a base of 13 in 4096 after the 30th is called, as do the chances of Hidden Ability and perfect [[Gameplay of Pokemon#Stats|IVs]], though they are capped at four perfect IVs maximum. In their [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|sequels']] Ultra Warp Ride [[minigame]], by successfully traveling more [[Light-year|light-years]] through the wormhole on Lunala (Ultra Sun) or Solgaleo (Ultra Moon) and entering wormholes with more rings, the player can increase the chance of finding Shiny Pokemon in the Ultra Space Wilds. Generation 7 also introduced an upgrade to the "Masuda method" referred to as "Swap Breeding"; the game is continually saved and soft-reset until a fast-hatching, dummy Pokemon (such as Magikarp) is hatched shiny within the first thirty attempts, and shininess (among other values) is transplanted to the new Pokemon hatched in the same position as the dummy was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/guides/2018/6/8/17409856/shiny-pokemon-guide|title=How to build an army of competitive shiny Pokémon|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', they have slightly above-average stats, but this is because Pokémon's Shininess is determined by their [[#Individual values|determinant values]] in those games. In the [[Pokémon (video games)#Game Boy Advance era|third generation]] and onward, however, Shininess is determined by another value, and Shiny Pokémon are not stronger than any other Pokémon in battle. Most fans consider Shiny Pokémon to be collectors' items because of their rarity.

The term "Shiny" was initially a term invented by the ''Pokémon'' fan community due to the flash of stars that appear when such a Pokémon enters a battle, implying a sheen or crystalline property to the colors of the Pokémon. The term "Shiny Pokémon" was later officially acknowledged in [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'']], but it has been used in the anime and in a few strategy guides before this.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The term {{nihongo3|"shining"|光る|hikaru}} was also a widely used slang term in Japan; Ken Sugimori uses ''hikaru'' in the title of a piece of artwork featuring a Shiny Charizard. The alternate term {{nihongo4|"Alt. Color"|色違い|Iro Chigai}} appears among the options the player can choose when filling out forms in the third generation of games.

Shiny Pokémon have appeared in the anime, including the aforementioned red Gyarados and a Noctowl that protagonist Ash Ketchum catches and is then featured throughout several seasons. A pink Butterfree was also featured in an episode of the first season of the anime, but this alternate coloration is not what appears in the subsequent video games where the Shiny feature has been implemented.

== Connectivity ==

=== Pokémon trades ===
[[File:Game Boy(RTSide).png|thumb|right|The game link port is located above the volume control on the original [[Game Boy]] handheld system.]]

Players have the ability to trade their Pokémon with one another by connecting two compatible games. Trading is an important aspect to the ''Pokémon'' games, being the crux upon which much of the franchise is based. This is because the slogan, and consequently the goal, "Gotta catch 'em All," is logistically impossible without trading. Each game released in a [[Pokémon (video games)#Generations|generation]] has certain Pokémon that are exclusive to that version. For example, in ''Pokémon Red'' players can catch the Pokémon [[Ekans]] and its evolved form, Arbok, while both are absent in the wild in both ''Pokémon Blue'' and ''Pokémon Yellow''. Other Pokémon are only available when offered up as a choice. The most obvious example is the choice between three [[#Starter Pokémon|starter Pokémon]] at the beginning of the game; the only way to get the other two is by trading. Some [[Non-player character|NPC]]s offer to trade Pokémon with the player, allowing them to acquire Pokémon otherwise unavailable without connecting to another game. For example, the only way to get a [[Jynx]] in ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' (other than trading with another game cartridge) is through an in-game trade. The other way that trading is made instrumental in gameplay is that some Pokémon, like [[Haunter]] and [[Machoke]], only [[#Pokémon evolution|evolve]] into their final forms when traded.

Trading between games on the Game Boy and related systems is accomplished through a [[Game Link cable]] that attaches to ports found on all [[Game Boy line|Game Boy incarnations]]. The size of the ports varies between consoles, so several hybrid cables have been created that allow, for example, linking between the original [[Game Boy]] and the [[Game Boy Color]]. [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']] include a special wireless dongle which plugs into the game link port for local wireless communication. On the [[Nintendo DS]], DS Wireless Communications is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&amp;nbsp;240–245&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] also introduced the Global Trade Station/System (or GTS), a place where people all around the world may trade Pokémon using the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. In the GTS hall, the player can input their own location and pinpoint the locations of other players they have interacted with. The Nintendo WFC records this data when they trade successfully with someone over the GTS or in their Pal Pad.&lt;ref&gt;Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&amp;nbsp;254&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Nintendo 3DS family|Nintendo 3DS line]], two successors to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection were implemented in each generation. In the Player Search System in [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X &amp; Y'']] and ''[[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]]'', the function is simply called Trade, while in [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'']] in the Festival Plaza, the function is called Link Trade. The second successor is called Wonder Trade; players choose a Pokémon to trade and are randomly paired with another player around the world.

== Mystery Gift ==
Mystery Gift, a means by which players can receive items from other people, was introduced in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] and has appeared in every handheld ''Pokémon'' game since. To use Mystery Gift, the feature must first be activated in a specific way.

In ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', if two players line up the infrared ports on their [[Game Boy Color]] units and activate Mystery Gift from the intro menu, each will receive an item. This process also sends a record of each player's party Pokémon to the other player's game for a daily event in Viridian City in which they can battle the other player's Pokémon (controlled by the computer). Players can use Mystery Gift an unlimited number of times, but only once per day for each person. In addition, a player of ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]'' with a ''Gold'', ''Silver'', or ''Crystal'' cartridge plugged into the [[Transfer Pak]] can use Mystery Gift with a girl in [[Pokémon regions#Stadium regions|White City]]. A Mystery Gift can also be received by connecting with a [[Pokémon Pikachu#Versions|Pocket Pikachu 2 GS]].

In [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], Mystery Gift is replaced with Mystery Event. This feature utilizes the now defunct [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] accessory. Using special [[Nintendo e-Reader#e-Reader cards|e-cards]], the player could obtain special items such as rare Berries or the Eon Ticket. In [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'']], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''LeafGreen'']], and [[Pokémon Emerald|''Emerald'']], Mystery Gift is a means to obtain special items at Nintendo's promotional events through the use of the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter|Wireless Adapter]], which allow the player to catch otherwise unobtainable Pokémon, such as [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]] and [[Deoxys]].

[[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] expanded Mystery Gift to include a variety of transferring options. After enabling Mystery Gift, players may obtain items via wireless or [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], and may also transfer them to friends. Wireless connection also allows the player to transfer items from ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]''. Currently, Mystery Gift via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|Nintendo WFC]] has only been implemented in ''[[Pokémon Platinum]]'' and [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']]. However, this was changed when the shiny Pichu was distributed to all version games via WFC. Also, with the creation of the Pokéwalker, in [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], came another way to Mystery Gift. By pressing the connect button on two Pokéwalkers and pointing them at each other, both Pokéwalkers will receive an item, which the player will receive upon connecting with his or her game. Beginning with ''[[Pokémon X and Y]]'', an option to receive Mystery Gifts by single-use serial code or password over [[Nintendo Network]] was added. Single-use codes are given out in participating retailers and via the Pokémon Global Link and are usually region locked. Wireless and infrared events are no longer region locked, allowing any region console to receive events distributed by those methods.

=== Pokémon Bank ===
{{nihongo4|'''Pokémon Bank'''|ポケモンバンク|Pokémon Banku}} is an application which allows players to store up to 3,000 Pokémon in an online [[cloud storage]] service. Players can deposit and withdraw Pokémon from both physical and downloaded versions of compatible games, allowing players to exchange Pokémon between the two versions without the need for a second system. Additionally, an application called {{nihongo4|Poké Transporter|ポケムーバー|Poke Mūbā|"Poké Mover"}} allows players to upload Pokémon from ''Pokémon Black'', ''White'', ''Black 2'', and ''White 2'' to the Pokémon Bank, after which they can be imported into newer games. The service requires an annual fee, and there are plans to continue to utilize it for future Pokémon titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/strategy/|title=Pokémon Bank|work=pokemonxy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intended for release on December 27, 2013, Pokémon Bank was postponed due to unforeseen traffic levels on the [[Nintendo Network]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.es/Noticias/2013/diciembre/Banco-Pokemon-y-Poke-Trasladador-845138.html|title=Banco Pokémon y Poké Trasladador|work=Nintendo of Europe GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pokémon Bank was fully released on the [[Nintendo eShop]] on January 22, 2014 in Japan, February 4, 2014 in Europe, and February 5, 2014 in North America.

As of an update released on January 24, 2016, [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] have also gained compatibility with Pokémon Bank. The update allows players to send their Pokémon from their core sixth generation games to ''Sun'' and ''Moon'', though when transferred, they cannot return to the older games. Additionally, the Poké Transporter was also updated to allow players to transfer Pokémon caught in the [[Virtual Console]] editions of [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'', ''Blue'']], and ''[[Pokémon Yellow|Yellow]]'' to ''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon''. The update also added a new in-app National Pokédex, presumably to make up for the lack of one in Sun and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Pokémon Sun and Moon Officially Announced|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/26/pokemon-sun-and-moon-officially-announced|website=IGN|publisher=IGN|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/pokemon-bank-getting-national-pokedex-feature-with-sun-and-moon-support-20456791/|title=Pokemon Bank getting National Poked feature with Sun and Moon support - SlashGear|website=www.slashgear.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Pokemon Bank Now Compatible With Sun and Moon|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/25/pokemon-bank-now-compatible-with-sun-and-moon|website=IGN|accessdate=January 25, 2017|date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2017, coinciding with the release of ''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'', it was announced that the games would support ''Pokémon Bank'' later the same month. The update, which came three days later, also added compatibility with the Virtual Console versions of ''[[Pokémon Gold and Silver]]'' as well as ''[[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]'' (which was not re-released until January 26, 2018) to the Poké Transporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/17/pokmon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-will-get-pokmon-bank-compatibility-update-late-november/|title=Pokémon Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon Will Get Pokémon Bank Compatibility Update In Late November|website=Siliconera|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pokémon breeding ==
Pokémon breeding was introduced in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]. Pokémon can be bred in-game at a {{nihongo4|Pokémon Day Care|育て屋|Sodateya}}. These are businesses generally run by an elderly person or couple, which raise Trainers' Pokémon for a fee. If two compatible Pokémon are left there, they will eventually produce a Pokémon {{nihongo4|Egg|タマゴ|tamago}}, which the Trainer can pick up for free. After being carried by the Trainer for some distance, the Egg will hatch into a young Pokémon, usually of the lowest stage in its mother's [[#Pokémon evolution|evolutionary line]].

Some Pokémon have pre-evolutions that are usually only obtainable by hatching them from Eggs. Known as "baby Pokémon", these Pokémon are unable to breed but have evolutions that can breed baby Pokémon. For most baby Pokémon introduced after ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', the parent can only produce these Pokémon when holding a certain item.&lt;ref name="PBreeding"&gt;Marcus, p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compatibility ===
Compatibility is usually restricted to one male and one female. In addition, Pokémon species are assigned to {{nihongo4|Egg Groups|タマゴグループ|Tamago Gurūpu}}, which determines their breeding compatibility with other species. Pokémon may belong to up to two Egg Groups; in order to breed, they must share at least one Egg Group. Nearly all Pokémon species, even those that are all-male or genderless, are able to breed with the shape-shifting Pokémon [[Ditto (Pokémon)|Ditto]]. The Egg produced will yield a hatchling from the non-Ditto Pokémon's evolutionary line. Two Ditto cannot breed to produce another Ditto.

A select group of species cannot breed at all, which includes all Legendary Pokémon, all Ultra Beasts, most Mythical Pokémon, Nidorina and Nidoqueen (but not Nidoran♀), Unown, and all "baby" Pokémon. This is called the "Undiscovered" Egg Group. Although some Legendary Pokémon (such as Heatran and Cresselia) have genders, they still cannot breed. An unusual circumstance involves the relation of the Mythical Pokémon Manaphy and Phione; both can breed with Ditto to create an Egg which hatches into Phione, yet Phione does not evolve into Manaphy. Manaphy itself is obtained from an Egg from ''[[Pokémon Ranger]]'' games, but it will never breed to produce another Manaphy Egg.

=== Inheritance ===
Pokémon hatched from Eggs can {{nihongo4|inherit|遺伝|iden}} stats from their parents. Three of the Pokémon's [[#Individual values|individual values]] are inherited from one or the other of its parents, and the other three IVs are generated randomly.&lt;ref name="Hbreeding2"&gt;Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moves can also be inherited through breeding. Moves that a newly hatched Pokémon begins with are divided into three categories: learned moves, inherited moves, and hereditary moves or "Egg Moves". Learned moves are moves that the Pokémon would have naturally at its starting level; inherited moves are those that the Pokémon would be able to learn at later levels or through TMs; and {{nihongo4|Egg Moves|タマゴわざ|Tamago Waza}}, inherited from the father (or either parent beginning in ''Pokémon X'' and ''Y''), are those that the Pokémon would not be able to learn normally. The Pokémon can learn the move on this occasion as it receives the move from a parent of a different species. Upon birth, the young Pokémon's move slots are filled with learned moves. However, if there are any inherited moves or Egg Moves available for the Pokémon to learn, they replace the learned moves.&lt;ref name="Hbreeding2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Battle facilities ==
{{redirect|Battle Frontier|the season of the [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]]|List of Pokémon: Battle Frontier episodes}}
In addition to the Pokémon Gyms and other battles to advance the plot, side games and post-game areas have been introduced in subsequent editions of the ''Pokémon'' games that extend the gameplay.

First introduced in ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]'', the {{nihongo4|Battle Tower|バトルタワー|Batoru Tawā}} is a game feature accessible outside of the main storyline where the player faces several Trainers in succession with a limited set of their Pokémon and receive prizes in the form of otherwise rare items. The Japanese version of ''Crystal'' which had a [[mobile phone]] adapter allowed for players to challenge other players to Battle Tower fights. The next Battle Towers appear in [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], which is similar to the ''Crystal'' Battle Tower, and in [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], which has a boss character and a point system similar to the Battle Frontiers.

The {{nihongo4|Battle Frontier|バトルフロンティア|Batoru Furontia}} was introduced in ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]'', replacing the Battle Tower as found in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games. In addition to having its own Battle Tower with the same rules as the previous ones, the Battle Frontier adds several other game mechanics that make [[#Pokémon battles|battles]] unique in the end game. Examples include the Battle Palace's prohibition on choosing what moves the Pokémon uses and the Battle Factory's random rental Pokémon. Instead of prizes, the player is awarded Battle Points (BP) which can be traded for rare items or TMs. The ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' Battle Tower uses this same system, and it is replaced by a Battle Frontier in ''[[Pokémon Platinum]]''. The [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] games also have a Battle Frontier, identical to that of the ''Platinum'' version, where the Battle Tower was found in ''Crystal''. After a series of battles in each venue, players encounter {{nihongo4|[[Frontier Brains]]|フロンティアブレーン|Furontia Burēn}} who are challenged in the same fashion as all other battles, and the player will either earn a {{nihongo4|Symbol|シンボル|Shinboru|''Emerald''}} or a {{nihongo4|Commemorative Print|きねんプリント|Kinen Purinto|''Platinum'', ''HeartGold'', ''SoulSilver''}} for winning. The Frontier Brains can be challenged a second time to more advanced versions of the Symbols or Prints (advancing from Silver to Gold). The Frontier Brains have very powerful Pokémon, often including [[#Legendary Pokémon|Legendary Pokémon]], making a victory even more difficult than in the main storyline.

''Emerald'' also features {{nihongo4|Battle Tents|バトルテント|Batoru Tento}}, which allow the player to encounter some of the unique battle mechanics of three of the Battle Frontier venues. Rather than Battle Points, the player is awarded with an item that is rare or expensive.

The {{nihongo4|Battle Subway|バトルサブウェイ|Batoru Sabuwei}} is unique to the [[Pokémon Black and White|''Black'' and ''White'']] games and serves as the games' Battle Tower, taking on the form of a [[Rapid transit|subway]] to match the games' [[New York City]]-styled setting. In the same vein as the Battle Tower in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' and the various Battle Frontiers, players earn BP and after a certain number of battles they challenge one or both of the two Subway Bosses ({{nihongo4|Subway Masters|サブウェイマスター|Sabuwei Masutā}} in Japan), depending on what type of battles (Single, Double, or Multi) the player was competing in.

The Battle Subway returns in [[Pokémon Black 2 and White 2|''Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], but it is joined by two new sets of areas. The first one introduced in the games is the {{nihongo4|Pokémon World Tournament|ポケモンワールドトーナメント|Pokémon Wārudo Tōnamento}}, wherein the player participates in a tournament-style setting with various NPC Trainers, set to a particular theme of a level limit, using randomly assigned teams, or using teams downloaded from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, to earn BP. The more advanced side of the Pokémon World Tournament is a tournament-style setting in battling the Gym Leaders and Pokémon League Champions from all over the Pokémon World, enabling players to challenge characters such as Brock and Misty from ''Red'' and ''Blue'', Volkner from ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Lance from ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', or Steven from ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Also introduced in the games are the {{nihongo4|Black Tower|黒の摩天楼|Kuro no Matenrō}} in ''Black 2''{{'}}s Black City and the {{nihongo4|White Treehollow|白の樹洞|Shiro no Judō}} in ''White 2''{{'}}s White Forest. In these facilities, the player must battle a series of Trainers without using items, and only relying on Doctor or Nurse Trainers to restore their team's health. At the end, the player challenges the leader and later is awarded a rare Pokémon for succeeding.

The {{nihongo4|Battle Maison|バトルハウス|Batoru Hausu|"Battle House"}} is introduced in [[Pokémon X and Y|''X'' and ''Y'']], and can only be accessed after the player completes the main story. Similar to the Battle Frontier and the Battle Subway, there are different types of battling methods to choose from: single, double, triple, rotation, and multi battles. Then the player is drawn to a tournament where he/she is challenged to numerous battles with random Trainers. After winning a battle the player receives one BP (battle point) which can later be used to by items, vitamins, and TMs. After winning 21 battles the player must battle the strongest Trainer or referred to as the Battle Chatelaine. It depends on what battle style you choose. If the player beats 50 Trainers, they have the chance to battle one of the Battle Chatelaines again. Only this time do they use legendary Pokémon (e.g. Zapdos, Moltres, Articuno). Another similar feature is the {{nihongo4|Battle Chateau|バトルシャトー|Batoru Shatō}}, where the player advances through a ranking system based on the [[French nobility]] system after battling increasingly difficult Trainers, including being able to battle the Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and Champion in the same system.

In ''Pokémon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'', the Battle Maison returns, but the Battle Frontier, which was featured in the original ''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games, is hinted to be in production. The Battle Maison is very similar to the one in ''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'', but TMs (Technical Machines) cannot be bought; they are replaced by other items.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The {{nihongo4|Battle Royal|バトルロイヤル|Battle Royal}} is introduced in [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], which involves four Trainers all battling each other at the same time. After becoming Champion, the player is given access to the {{nihongo4|Battle Tree|バトルツリー|Battle Tree}} on Poni Island. The Battle Tree is similar to the Battle Maison, Battle Subway, and Battle Towers from the previous generations. On the 20th battle of normal challenges and 50th battle of Super challenges, a powerful Trainer known as a Battle Legend will be challenged.

== Pokémon Competitions ==
In addition to battling, several Pokémon competitions have been introduced throughout the series to provide an alternate set of mini-games.

=== Pokémon Contests ===
{{nihongo4|Pokémon Contests|ポケモンコンテスト|Pokémon Kontesuto}} are competitions of skill among Pokémon Trainers and their Pokémon partners. Pokémon Contests are different from [[Pokémon battle]]s, testing talent rather than power. They were introduced in [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] and later appeared in ''[[Pokémon Emerald|Emerald]]'', [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], ''[[Pokémon Platinum|Platinum]]'', [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Omega Ruby'', and ''Alpha Sapphire'']].

There are five categories that a Pokémon can be entered into: Beauty, Cute, Cool, Tough, and Smart. In addition, there are four ranks of contests: Normal, Super, Hyper, and Master Rank. To enter, a Trainer must go to the contest hall that holds contests of the appropriate rank, and in ranks higher than Normal, the participating Pokémon must have won the contest of the selected category in the previous rank. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Contests are renamed Super Contests, and the four ranks are named Normal, Great, Ultra, and Master.&lt;ref&gt;Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&amp;nbsp;227&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first round (called "Visual Competition" in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'') the Pokémon is shown to the audience, who then vote on their favorite. Pokémon will gain more points here if they have good condition in the selected category, which can be increased by using Pokéblocks. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Pokéblocks are replaced by Poffins, and the player can also use the stylus to dress up their Pokémon in certain {{nihongo4|Accessories|アクセサリー|Akusesarī}} to fit the theme of the contest.&lt;ref&gt;Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&amp;nbsp;229–233&lt;/ref&gt;

The second round, called "Dance Competition", was introduced in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl''. The participating Pokémon join in a dance routine. The leading Pokémon gets rated based on following the rhythm, and the rest of the Pokémon have to mimic the leader's steps. All four participants take turns to be the leader.&lt;ref&gt;Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&amp;nbsp;234&lt;/ref&gt;

The final round ("Acting Competition") comprises a few rounds, and the Pokémon are ordered in sequence based on their performance in the previous round. Each round, the player chooses one Pokémon move to perform before the judge, and in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' players also choose which of three judges to appeal to. Each move has a category, appeal value, and effect. Using a good combination will gain the Pokémon more appeal points, but using the same move twice consecutively will be less effective. Moves can have many effects, such as "jamming" previous Pokémon to reduce their appeal, or randomizing the order of appeals in the next round.&lt;ref&gt;Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&amp;nbsp;235–236&lt;/ref&gt; After appeals are concluded, the results are shown, and the Pokémon with the most total points wins a ribbon.&lt;ref&gt;Official Pokémon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&amp;nbsp;237&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pokéblocks and Poffins ====
Pokéblocks ({{nihongo4|Polock|ポロック|Porokku}}), introduced in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', are [[candy]]-like treats used to increase the contest condition and Loyalty of Pokémon. Pokéblocks are created from Berries in the "Berry Blender" minigame, which can be played by two to four human or computer-controlled players. The types of berries blended by all participants affect the category and effectiveness of the resulting Pokéblock. Pokéblocks are also used in the games' Safari Zone to attract wild Pokémon.

{{nihongo4|Poffins|ポフィン|Pofin}}, a type of baked goods, were introduced in [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] as replacements for Pokéblocks. Poffins are made by adding a Berry to some batter in a pot, and stirring it with a stylus using the [[Nintendo DS]]'s touch screen. Poffins can be mixed only with human partners and can be done solo or with two to four players wirelessly.

=== Pokéathlon ===
In [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], the contest minigame is replaced with an athletic competition called the {{nihongo4|Pokéathlon|ポケスロン|Pokesuron}}. The competitions range from [[track and field]] events such as [[hurdling]] or a [[relay race]] to a [[snowball fight]] and a game resembling [[pachinko]].

A Pokémon's stats may be increased by consuming {{nihongo4|"Aprijuice"|ボンドリンク|Bon Dorinku|"Bon Drink"}} made from fruits known as Apricorns that the player can find throughout the world. By putting a number of Apricorns in a [[blender]] and making the player character run a certain number of steps, the Apricorns are mixed into a [[milkshake]]-like blend. The process can be repeated multiple times, each time adding more Apricorns to the mixture and running to blend them. The number of times this is done, along with the variety of Apricorns used, affects the type and effectiveness of the resulting Aprijuice. Aprijuice will increase one of five additional statistics that only exist for the Pokéathlon which consist of Speed (unique from the standard Speed statistic), Power, Skill, Jump, and Stamina.

=== Pokémon Musicals ===
In [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'']], the contest minigame is replaced by the {{nihongo4|Pokémon Musicals|ポケモンミュージカル|Pokémon Myūjikaru}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system03.html|title=ポケモンミュージカル {{!}} 『ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト』公式サイト|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than grooming Pokémon with Pokéblocks, Poffins, or Aprijuice, the player's Pokémon is only dressed in Accessories which can be waved around on stage when the Pokémon dances to various pieces of music; the player does not control the Pokémon during this time, other than Appealing with special props. If the audience likes the performance, they give more props to the player in person post-performance. The player can, in fact, control the camera angle during the performance.

=== Pokéstar Studios ===
Another minigame is added in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called {{nihongo4|Pokéstar Studios|ポケウッド|Pokeuddo|"Pokéwood"}}. The player joins the cast of a movie and participates in a mock battle with a [[chroma key]] opponent, all while picking line options that match the script of the film and completing an objective within a particular set of turns. Depending on how well the player performs according to the script (or if the player introduced a twist to the intended ending), he or she receives items from the film premiere's audience and unlocks more movies to participate in.

&lt;!-- This article is primarily a big list of ghost stories, and offers little analysis of the tradition or its development.--&gt;
[[File:Whistle and I'll come to you illustration.jpg|thumb|300px|Illustration by James McBryde for [[M. R. James]]'s story "Oh, Whistle, And I'll Come To You, My Lad".]]
A '''ghost story''' may be any piece of [[fiction]], or [[drama]], that includes a [[ghost]], or simply takes as a [[premise]] the possibility of ghosts or characters' belief in them.&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Darrell Schweitzer]]|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Greenwood|year=2005|pages=338–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;"Ghost Stories" in [[Margaret Drabble]] (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|9780198614531}} (p. 404-5).&lt;/ref&gt; The "ghost" may appear of its own accord or be summoned by [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Linked to the ghost is the idea of "hauntings", where a supernatural entity is tied to a place, object or person.&lt;ref name="DS" /&gt; Ghost stories are commonly examples of [[ghostlore]].

Colloquially, the term "ghost story" can refer to any kind of scary story. In a narrower sense, the ghost story has been developed as a [[short story]] format, within [[genre fiction]]. It is a form of [[supernatural fiction]] and specifically of [[weird fiction]], and is often a [[horror story]].

While ghost stories are often explicitly meant to be scary, they have been written to serve all sorts of purposes, from comedy to [[morality tale]]s. Ghosts often appear in the narrative as sentinels or [[prophet]]s of things to come. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.&lt;ref name="DS" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Pyle pirates ghost.jpg|thumb|The ghost of a pirate, from [[Howard Pyle]]'s ''Book of Pirates'' (1903)]]

A widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. [[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology|author= J. Gordon Melton|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=0-8103-5487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.&lt;ref name="DS" /&gt;

In 1929, five key features of the [[English people|English]] ghost story were identified in "Some Remarks on Ghost Stories" by [[M. R. James]]. As summarized by Frank Coffman for a course in popular imaginative literature, they were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coffman |first1=Frank |url=http://ednet.rvc.cc.il.us/~fcoffman/103/Horror103/MRJamesRemarks.html |title=Excerpts From "Some Remarks on Ghost Stories" |accessdate=20 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214004925/http://ednet.rvc.cc.il.us/~fcoffman/103/Horror103/MRJamesRemarks.html |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The pretense of truth
* "A pleasing terror"
* No gratuitous bloodshed or sex
* No "explanation of the machinery"
* Setting: "those of the writer's (and reader's) own day"

The introduction of [[pulp magazines]] in the early 1900s created new avenues for ghost stories to be published, and they also began to appear in publications such as ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carpenter, Lynette|author2=Kolmar, Wendy K.|title=Ghost Stories by British and American Women: A Selected, Annotated Bibliography|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early examples ===
Ghosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Finucane, R. C.|title=Appearances of the Dead: A Cultural History of Ghosts|publisher=Prometheus Books|year= 1984|isbn= 0879752386|pages=4, 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirits of the dead appear in literature as early as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', which features a journey to the [[underworld]] and the hero encountering the ghosts of the dead,&lt;ref name="DS" /&gt; as well as the [[Old Testament]] in which the [[Witch of Endor]] calls the spirit of the prophet [[Samuel]].&lt;ref name="DS" /&gt;

The play ''[[Mostellaria]]'', by the Roman playwright [[Plautus]], is the earliest known work to feature a haunted dwelling, and is sometimes translated as ''The Haunted House''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=D.

Ghosts often appeared in the tragedies of the Roman writer [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], who would later influence the revival of tragedy on the [[Renaissance]] stage, particularly [[Thomas Kyd]] and [[Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braund|first1=Susanna|editor1-last=Buckley|editor1-first=Emma|editor2-last=Dinter|editor2-first=Martin T.|title=Haunted by Horror: The Ghost of Seneca in Renaissance Drama|journal=A Companion to the Neronian Age|date=28 March 2013|doi=10.1002/9781118316771.ch24|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118316771.ch24/summary|accessdate=17 August 2014|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English Renaissance Theatre ===
{{main article|English Renaissance theatre}}
[[File:Henry Fuseli rendering of Hamlet and his father's Ghost.JPG|thumb|left|"[[Hamlet]] and his father's ghost" by [[Henry Fuseli]] (1780s drawing). The ghost is wearing stylised [[plate armour]] in 17th-century style, including a [[morion (helmet)|morion]] type helmet and [[tassets]]. Depicting ghosts as wearing armour, to suggest a sense of antiquity, was common in [[Elizabethan theatre]].]]

In the mid-16th century, the works of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were rediscovered by [[Italian humanists]], and they became the models for the revival of [[tragedy]]. Seneca's influence is particularly evident in [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', both of which share a revenge theme, a corpse-strewn climax, and ghosts among the cast. The ghosts in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' also resemble the Senecan model, while the ghost in ''[[Hamlet]]'' plays a more complex role.&lt;ref name="DS" /&gt; The [[King Hamlet|shade of Hamlet's murdered father]] in ''Hamlet'' has become one of the more recognizable ghosts in [[English literature]]. In another of Shakespeare’s works, ''[[Macbeth]]'', the murdered [[Banquo]] returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graves|first1=Zachary|title=Ghosts the complete guide to the supernatural|date=2011|publisher=Canary Press|location=Eastbourne, UK|isbn=9781908698124|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8ZKCunDWV0C&amp;pg=PT182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English Renaissance theatre, ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armour. Armour, being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity.&lt;ref name="AK" /&gt; The sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 1800s because an armoured ghost had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or lifts, and eventually became clichéd stage elements and objects of ridicule. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in ''Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory'', point out, "In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'." An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that "at the historical point at which ghosts themselves become increasingly implausible, at least to an educated elite, to believe in them at all it seems to be necessary to assert their immateriality, their invisibility. [...] The drapery of ghosts must now, indeed, be as spiritual as the ghosts themselves. This is a striking departure both from the ghosts of the Renaissance stage and from the Greek and Roman theatrical ghosts upon which that stage drew. The most prominent feature of Renaissance ghosts is precisely their gross materiality. They appear to us conspicuously clothed." &lt;ref name="AK"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Ann Rosalind |last2=Stallybrass |first2=Peter |date=2000 |title=Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=78AWIDTV4ZUC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=248 |isbn=0521786630 |accessdate=August 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Border ballads ===

Ghosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly the “[[Border ballads|Border Ballads]]” of the turbulent [[border country]] between England and Scotland. Ballads of this type include ''[[The Unquiet Grave]]'', ''[[The Wife of Usher's Well]]'', and ''[[Sweet William's Ghost]]'', which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children. In the ballad ''[[King Henry (song)|King Henry]]'', a particularly ravenous ghost devours the king’s horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed. The king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Helen Child Sargent |author2=George Lyman Kittredge |title=English and Scottish Popular Ballads edited from the Collection by Francis James Child|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|year=1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romantic era ===
{{See also|Gothic fiction}}
[[File:A Ghost Story.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of a woman telling a ghost story.]]
One of the key early appearances by ghosts was ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' by [[Horace Walpole]] in 1764, considered to be the first [[gothic novel]].&lt;ref name="NK"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Newman, Kim (ed.)|title=BFI Companion to Horror|publisher=Cassell|location=London|year=1996|isbn=030433216X|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, although the ghost story shares the use of the supernatural with the Gothic novel, the two forms differ. Ghost stories, unlike Gothic fiction, usually take place in a time and location near to the audience of the story.

The modern short story emerged in Germany in the early decades of the 19th century. [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]]'s ''The Beggar Woman of Locarno'', published in 1810, and several other works from the period lay claim to being the first ghost short stories of a modern type. [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s ghost stories include "The Elementary Spirit" and "The Mines of Falun".&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;Andrew Barger, "Introduction:All Ghosts are Grey" in Barger (editor),''The Best Ghost Stories 1800–1849: A Classic Ghost Anthology''. Bottletree Books LLC, 2011. {{ISBN|1-933747-33-1}}, (pp. 7-12)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian equivalent of the ghost story is the ''[[:ru:быличка|bylichka]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Davidson. ''Russian Literature and Its Demons''. Berghahn Books, 2000. {{ISBN|9781571817587}}. Page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Notables examples of the genre from the 1830s include [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]]'s ''[[Viy (story)|Viy]]'' and [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (story)|The Queen of Spades]]'', although there were scores of other stories from lesser known writers, produced primarily as [[Christmas fiction]]. The [[Vosges]] mountain range is the setting for most ghost stories by the French writing team of [[Erckmann-Chatrian]].

One of the earliest writers of ghost stories in English was Sir [[Walter Scott]]. His ghost stories, "Wandering Willie's Tale" (1824, first published as part of ''[[Redgauntlet]]'') and ''The Tapestried Chamber'' (1828) eschewed the "Gothic" style of writing and helped set an example for later writers in the genre.

=== "Golden Age of the Ghost Story" ===

Historian of the ghost story [[Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|Jack Sullivan]] has noted that many literary critics argue a "Golden Age of the Ghost Story" existed between the decline of the Gothic novel in  the 1830s and the start of the First World War.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jack Sullivan|title="Golden Age of the Ghost Story" in [[The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural]]|publisher=Viking Press|year=1986|isbn= 0-670-80902-0|pages=174–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan argues that the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Sheridan Le Fanu]] inaugurated this "Golden Age".&lt;ref name="js" /&gt;

Irish author Sheridan Le Fanu was one of the most influential writers of ghost stories.. Le Fanu's collections, such as ''[[In a Glass Darkly]]'' (1872) and ''[[The Purcell Papers]]'' (1880), helped popularise the short story as a medium for ghost fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. L. Campbell, Sr., "J. S. Le Fanu", in [[E. F. Bleiler]], ed.|title=Supernatural Fiction Writers|location=New York|publisher= Scribner's|year=1985|isbn=0-684-17808-7|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlotte Riddell]], who wrote fiction as Mrs. J. H. Riddell, created ghost stories which were noted for adept use of the [[haunted house]] theme.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Campbell, Sr., "Mrs. J. H. Riddell", in Bleiler, ed., ''Supernatural Fiction Writers''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scrooges third visitor-John Leech,1843.jpg|right|thumb|upright|19th-century [[etching]] by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] of the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] as depicted in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'']]
The "classic" ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as [[M. R. James]], [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], [[Violet Hunt]], and [[Henry James]]. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, “Malevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, ‘the stony grin of unearthly malice', pursuing forms in darkness, and 'long-drawn, distant screams', are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded...”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=James, M. R.|title=Some Remarks on Ghost Stories|publisher=The Bookman|date=December 1929|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous literary apparitions from the [[Victorian period]] are the ghosts of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', in which [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague [[Jacob Marley]], and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come. In a precursor to ''A Christmas Carol'' Dickens published "[[The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barger|first1=Andrew|title=Middle Unearthed: The Best Fantasy Short Stories 1800-1849|date=2015|publisher=Bottletree Books LLC|isbn=978-1-933747-53-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens also wrote "[[The Signal-Man]]", another work featuring a ghost.

==== Jamesian style ====

[[David Langford]] has described British author [[M. R. James]] as writing "the 20th century's most influential canon of ghost stories".&lt;ref&gt;David Langford, "James, Montague Rhodes", in [[David Pringle]], ed., ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers'' (London: St. James Press, 1998). {{ISBN|1-55862-206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; James perfected a method of story-telling which has since become known as Jamesian, which involved abandoning many of the traditional Gothic elements of his predecessors. The classic Jamesian tale usually includes the following elements:

:# a characterful setting in an English village, seaside town or country estate; an ancient town in France, Denmark or Sweden; or a venerable abbey or university.
:# a nondescript and rather naive gentleman-scholar as protagonist (often of a reserved nature).
:# the discovery of an old book or other antiquarian object that somehow unlocks, calls down the wrath, or at least attracts the unwelcome attention of a supernatural menace, usually from beyond the grave.

According to James, the story must "put the reader into the position of saying to himself, 'If I'm not very careful, something of this kind may happen to me!'"&lt;ref name=joshi&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0VxZ13zOtt8C&amp;pg=PT217 James, M.R., "Preface to ''More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary'']". In Joshi, S.T., ed. (2005). ''Count Magnus and Other Ghost Stories: The Complete Ghost Stories of M.R. James, Volume 1'', pt. 217. Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; He also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion, letting his reader fill in the blanks, and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief. He summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology ''Ghosts and Marvels'' ([[Oxford University Press|Oxford]], 1924): "Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are, to me, the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo. ... Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage."

He also noted: "Another requisite, in my opinion, is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious: amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends, but I have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story."&lt;ref name=joshi/&gt;

Despite his suggestion (in the essay "Stories I Have Tried to Write") that writers employ reticence in their work, many of James's tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Punter|first1=David|title=The literature of terror: a history of Gothic fictions from 1765 to the present day |chapter=The modern gothic|date=2003|publisher=Longman|location=London|isbn=0582290554|page=86|quote=Although James conjures up strange beasts and supernatural manifestations, the shock effect of his stories is usually strongest when he is dealing in physical mutilation and abnormality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th Century American writers ===

Influenced by British and German examples, American writers began to produce their own ghost stories. [[Washington Irving]]'s [[short story]] ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820), based on an earlier German folktale, features a [[Headless Horseman]]. It has been adapted for film and television many times, such as ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', a successful 1999 feature film.&lt;ref name="sleepyhollow"&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sleepyhollow.htm Sleepy Hollow] at [[Box Office Mojo]]. Retrieved 29 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving also wrote "The Adventure of the German Student"&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt; and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote some stories which contain ghosts, such as "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]" and "Morella".&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt;

In the later 19th century, mainstream American writers such as [[Edith Wharton]], [[Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman|Mary E. Wilkins Freeman]]&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Fisher, "Transitions from Victorian to Modern: The Supernatural Stories of Mary Wilkins Freeman and Edith Wharton" in: Robillard, Douglas, ed. ''American Supernatural Fiction: From Edith Wharton to the Weird Tales Writers''. New York: Garland, 1996. (pp. 3-42). {{ISBN|0-8153-1735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[F. Marion Crawford]]&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Robillard, "The Wandering Ghosts of F. Marion Crawford" in: Robillard, Douglas, ed. ''American Supernatural Fiction: From Edith Wharton to the Weird Tales Writers''. New York: Garland, 1996. (pp. 43-58). {{ISBN|0-8153-1735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; all wrote ghost fiction. [[Henry James]] also wrote ghost stories, including the famous ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.&lt;ref name="DS" /&gt; ''The Turn of the Screw'' has also appeared in a number of adaptations, notably the film ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' and [[Benjamin Britten]]'s opera ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]''.

The introduction of [[pulp magazines]] in the early 1900s created new avenues for ghost stories to be published, and they also began to appear in publications such as ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis"/&gt;

=== Comedies and operas ===
[[Oscar Telgmann]]'s opera ''[[Leo, the Royal Cadet]]'' (1885) includes ''Judge's Song'' about a ghost at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in Kingston, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cameron, George Frederick |date=1889|url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_06551 |title=Leo, the Royal cadet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oscar Wilde]]'s comic short story "[[The Canterville Ghost]]" (1887) has been adapted for film and television on several occasions.

In the United States, prior to and during the [[First World War]], folklorists [[Olive Dame Campbell]] and [[Cecil Sharp]] collected ballads from the people of the Appalachian Mountains, which included ghostly themes such as "[[The Cruel Ship's Carpenter]]", "[[The Suffolk Miracle]]", "[[The Unquiet Grave]]" and "[[The Wife of Usher's Well]]". The theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover. These songs were variants of traditional British ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the Anglo-Scottish border region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Campbell, Olive Dame &amp; Sharp, Cecil James |title=English Folk Songs From The Southern Appalachians|publisher= G. Putnam's Sons|location= New York|date= 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological horror ===

In the [[Edwardian era]], [[Algernon Blackwood]] (who combined the ghost story with nature [[mysticism]]),&lt;ref name="js" /&gt; [[Oliver Onions]] (whose ghost stories drew on [[psychological horror]]),&lt;ref name="js" /&gt; and [[William Hope Hodgson]] (whose ghost tales also contained elements of the [[Nautical fiction|sea story]] and [[science fiction]]) helped move the ghost story in new directions.&lt;ref name="js" /&gt;

=== Kaidan ===
{{main article|Kaidan}}

The popularity of the game, as well as the acquisition of a [[printing press]], led to the creation of a literary genre called ''Kaidanshu.'' Kaidan are not always horror stories, they can "be funny, or strange, or just telling about an odd thing that happened one time".&lt;ref name=kai&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Kaidan|url=http://hyakumonogatari.com/what-are-kaidan/|website=Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lafcadio Hearn]] published ''[[Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things]]'' in 1904 as a collection of Japanese ghost stories collected by [[Lafcadio Hearn]], and later made into a film.&lt;ref&gt;"Kwaidan", by [[Brian Stableford]], in [[Frank N. Magill]], ed., ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983, {{ISBN|0-89356-450-8}} (pp. 859-860).&lt;/ref&gt; The book "is seen as the first introduction of Japanese superstition to European and American audiences."&lt;ref name=kaidan/&gt;

===Modern era (1920 onward)===
''[[Ghost Stories (magazine)|Ghost Stories]]'' magazine, which contained almost nothing but ghost stories, was published from 1926 to 1932.

Beginning in the 1940s, [[Fritz Leiber]] wrote ghost tales set in modern industrial settings, such as "Smoke Ghost" (1941) and "A Bit of the Dark World" (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Brooks |last=Landon |title=The Short fiction of Leiber |editor-first=Frank N. |editor-last=Magill |work=Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature, Vol 4 |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Salem Press, Inc |year=1983 |isbn=0-89356-450-8 |pages=1611–1615 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shirley Jackson]] made an important contribution to ghost fiction with her novel ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'' (1959).&lt;ref name="DS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Jack |last=Sullivan |title=Shirley Jackson |editor=Bleiler |work=Supernatural Fiction Writers |pages=1031–1036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Gray Ghost.jpg|thumb|The Gray Ghost (1917).]]
During the late 1890s the depiction of ghost and supernatural events appear in films. With the advent of motion pictures and television, screen depictions of ghosts became common, and spanned a variety of genres. The works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions, as well as adaptations of other playwrights and novelists. One of the well known short films was ''[[The Haunted Castle (1896 film)|Haunted Castle]]'' directed by [[Georges Méliès]] in 1896. It is also considered as the first silent short film depicting ghost and supernatural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Babbis|first1=Maurice|title=The True Origin of the Horror Film|url=http://pages.emerson.edu/organizations/fas/latent_image/issues/1990-05/horror.htm|website=Emerson.edu|publisher=Emerson College|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the second World War, sentimental depictions of ghosts were more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film ''[[The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]'', which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968–70 [[The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir (TV series)|TV series]].&lt;ref name="NK" /&gt; Genuine [[psychological horror]] films from this period include 1944's ''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]]'', and 1945's ''[[Dead of Night]]''. The film ''[[Blithe Spirit (film)|Blithe Spirit]]'', based on a [[Blithe Spirit (play)|play]] by [[Noël Coward]], was also produced in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Blithe Spirit|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6a573b6a|publisher=British film institute|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1963 saw one of the first major adaptations of a ghost novel, ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'', based on the well known novel ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]''.&lt;ref name="NK"/&gt;

The 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989's ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', the 1990 film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', and the 1993 comedy ''[[Heart and Souls]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DE1339F93BA3575BC0A965958260|title=FILM; When It Comes to the Hereafter, Romance and Sentiment Rule|last=Chanko|first=Kenneth M.|date=August 8, 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the horror genre, 1980's ''[[The Fog]]'', and the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence.&lt;ref name="NK"/&gt; The 1990s saw a return to classic "gothic" ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999's ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]''. The 1990s also saw a lighthearted adaptation of the children's character ''[[Casper the Friendly Ghost]]'', originally popular in cartoon form in the 1950s and early 1960s, in the feature film ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]''.

[[Asian cinema]] has also produced [[horror film]]s about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film ''[[Ring (film)|Ringu]]'' (remade in the US as ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' in 2002), and the Pang brothers' 2002 film ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E1D61330F93BA35755C0A9659C8B63|title=Why Asian Ghost Stories Are the Best |last=Rafferty|first=Terence|date=June 8, 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian ghost movies]] are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia and other parts of the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film ''[[Chandramukhi]]'' have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages.&lt;ref name=behind&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-articles/movies-06/24-09-07-rajini.html|title=The Bus Conductor Turned Superstar Who Took the Right Bus to Demi|author=Mohamed, Shoaib |date=September 24, 2007|work=Behindwoods|accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the films are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts, and usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore. In some cases the Indian films are remakes of western films, such as ''[[Anjaane (2005 film)|Anjaane]]'', based on [[Alejandro Amenábar]]'s ghost story ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]''.&lt;ref name=anjaane&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/review/7199/index.html|work=Indiafm.com|title=Anjaane – The Unknown|date=December 30, 2005|accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|''' Gōtarō Ogawa '''|小川郷太郎| Ogawa Gōtarō |extra=9 June 1876 – 1 April 1945}} was an economist, educator, politician and cabinet minister in the pre-war [[Empire of Japan]].

==Background==
Ogawa was born in [[Satoshō, Okayama]] as the son of Murayama Kikuzo, but was adopted into a prominent family of doctors in [[Okayama, Okayama|Okayama]]. He graduated from [[Tokyo Imperial University]]’s Law School in 1903 with honors, from the Department of Political Science, and obtained a post at the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]]. However, the following year, he was recruited by [[Kyoto Imperial University]], which had just established a Department of Economics, and was sent to Europe for six years to study [[public finance]] in Germany and Austria. On his return, he worked at Kyoto Imperial University as a professor of economics, specializing on the economic effects of war. In 1917, he was awarded a doctorate in law.

Ogawa then entered politics, winning a seat in the [[House of Representatives of Japan]] in the [[Japanese general election, 1917|1917 general election]], and was subsequently re-elected to the same seat in the Okayama constituency a total of eight times. Initially with the ''[[Shinseikai]],'' he later assisted in the formation of the ''[[Seiyu Hontō]]'' political party, subsequently serving as president of its policy research committee, and joined the ''[[Rikken Minseitō]]'' when the ''Seiyu Hontō'' merged with the ''[[Kenseikai]]''.

Ogawa left Kyoto Imperial University in 1924 to accept the post of dean of [[Takushoku University]]. In 1929, he served as parliamentary under-secretary for Finance under the [[Osachi Hamaguchi|Hamaguchi]] administration.

In 1936, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Kōki Hirota]] asked that Ogawa accept the post of [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Japan)|Minister of Commerce and Industry]]. In this position, he opposed many of the ministry bureaucrats who were pushing towards increased state control over the economy, and forced a number, including [[Nobusuke Kishi]], to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Iguchi, ''Unfinished Business''. Page 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 he served in the second [[Fumimaro Konoe|Konoe administration]] as [[Japanese Government Railway|Railway Minister]]. After the start of [[World War II]], in 1943, he took charge of the committee of internal affairs of the ''[[Taisei Yokusankai]].'' However, later in 1943, he was invited to the nominally independent [[State of Burma]] by President [[Ba Maw]] as a special advisor on economics and finance.  He spent the remainder of the war years in Burma, attempting to set the country on a secure footing through financial consolidation.

On April 1, 1945, while attempting to return to Japan, Ogawa was killed as a passenger on the [[MV Awa Maru (1943)|''Awa Maru'']], which was sunk by the US submarine {{USS|Queenfish|SS-393}} in the [[East China Sea]] despite its status as a [[hospital ship]] under Red Cross protection. In 1968, he was posthumously awarded with the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], 3rd class.

In [[philosophy]], '''intelligibility''' is what can be comprehended by the [[human mind]] in contrast to sense perception.  The intelligible method is thought thinking itself, or the human mind reflecting on itself.  [[Plato]] referred to the intelligible realm of [[mathematics]], [[Intelligible form|forms]], [[first principles]], logical [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], and the [[dialectical method]].  The intelligible realm of thought thinking about thought does not necessarily require any visual images, sensual impressions, and material causes for the contents of mind.  [[René Descartes|Descartes]] referred to this method of thought thinking about itself, without the possible illusions of the senses.  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] made similar claims about [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] knowledge.  A priori knowledge is claimed to be independent of the content of experience.

==Usage==
The [[object (philosophy)|objects]] or concepts that have intelligibility may be called '''intelligible'''. Some possible examples are [[number]]s and the logical [[law of non-contradiction]].

There may be a distinction between everything that is intelligible and everything that is visible, called the ''intelligible world'' and the ''visible world'' in e.g. the [[analogy of the divided line]] as written by [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.cua.edu/hoffmann/courses/201_1068/Plato&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] is generally regarded as being only partially intelligible. The Absolute is the idea of an unconditional [[reality]] which [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcend]]s limited, conditional, everyday [[existence]]. It is sometimes used as a term for [[God]] or the [[Divine]]. Other similar concepts are [[The One (Neoplatonism)|The One]] and [[First Cause]].

'''Invasive urothelial carcinoma''' is a type of [[transitional cell carcinoma]]. It is a type of [[cancer]] that develops in the urinary system:  the [[kidney]], [[urinary bladder]], and accessory organs. Transitional cell carcinoma is the most common type of [[bladder cancer]] and cancer of the [[ureter]], [[urethra]], [[renal pelvis]], the [[ureter]]s, the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], and parts of the [[urethra]] and [[urachus]].&lt;ref name="Andersson-134"&gt;Andersson, 2011: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jnfQ5VbxJ_AC&amp;pg=PA134 p. 134]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amornpan|first1=Ajjimaporn|last2=Botsford|first2=Tom|last3=Garrett|first3=Scott H|last4=Sens|first4=Mary Ann|last5=Zhou|first5=Xu Dong|last6=Dunlevy|first6=Jane R|last7=Sens|first7=Donald A|last8=Somji|first8=Seema|date=2012-07-04|title=ZIP8 expression in human proximal tubule cells, human urothelial cells transformed by Cd+2 and As+3 and in specimens of normal human urothelium and urothelial cancer|journal=Cancer Cell Int.|volume=12|issue=16|doi=10.1186/1475-2867-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It originates from tissue lining the inner surface of these hollow organs - [[transitional epithelium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|two/000017251|transitional cell carcinoma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20677|title=Definition of Carcinoma|deadurl=no|accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The invading tumors can extend from the kidney collecting system to the bladder.&lt;ref&gt;Selvaraj V, Govindarajan P, Deepak M, Sivaraj M.

Carcinoma (from the Greek ''karkinos'', or "crab", and ''-oma'', "growth") is a type of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lemoine|first1=Nigel Kirkham, Nicholas R.|title=Progress in pathology.|date=2001|publisher=Greenwich Medical Media|location=London|isbn=9781841100500|page=52|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xiHcyr-BHeQC&amp;pg=PT61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carcinoma is a cancer that begins in a tissue that lines the inner or outer surfaces of the body, and that generally arises from cells originating in the [[endoderm]]al or [[ectoderm]]al germ layer during [[embryogenesis]].

==Symptoms==
Symptoms vary between individuals and can be dependent upon the stage of growth of the carcinoma. Presence of the carcinoma can lead to be asymptomatic [[blood]] in the [[urine]] ([[hematuria]]),  Hematuria can be visible or detected microscopically. Visible hematuria is when urine  appears red or brown and can be seen with the naked eye. Other symptoms are not specific. Other inflammatory conditions that affect the bladder and kidney can create similar symptoms. Early detection facilitates curing the disease. Other symptoms can involve:

*pain or burning on urination
*the sensation of not being able to completely empty the bladder
*the sensation of needing to urinate more often or more frequently than normal

These symptoms are general and also indicate less serious problems.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7601">[[File:James-white-financier-1927.jpg|thumb|right|James White in the 1920s]]
'''James White''' (17 May 1877&amp;nbsp;– 29 June 1927) was an English financier, property developer and speculator. From a working-class family in [[Lancashire]], he worked at a number of jobs before becoming well known in the years before the First World War as a boxing promoter. From that, he moved into property and other transactions, making large sums of money in major deals. He became a racehorse owner and theatre proprietor.

White finally overreached himself financially, and being unable to meet his huge liabilities, committed suicide at the age of 50.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
White was born in [[Rochdale]], [[Lancashire]],  the son of Thomas White,  a bricklayer, and his wife, Catherine, ''née'' Mullroy. He was educated at St John's Roman Catholic School, Rochdale.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Corley, T. A. B. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47876 "White, James (1877–1927)"], '' Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 24 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of his early career; it is on record that he worked in a cotton mill, and White said in 1925 that when he was 19, he and three others bought a circus in Rochdale, and that he later leased a theatre in [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]] in the adjoining county of [[Derbyshire]].&lt;ref name=op&gt;"O.P. Club Dinner to Mr. James White". ''The Times'', 16 February 1925, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, when he was 21, White married Annie Fetton, a worker in the wool industry. In 1900 he went to South Africa to work as a labourer on the railways, returning less than a year later. He became a builder and later bought and sold property and  arranged finance for purchasers. In 1908 he suffered a financial failure and was declared bankrupt, although he ultimately paid all his debts in full.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' records that Annie White died at an unknown date and White married a second time, having a son and three daughters with his second wife, Doris.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In fact his first wife divorced him in 1921, a Chancery Court case later establishing that White settled £60,000 to fund an annuity for her.&lt;ref&gt; [[The Scotsman]], 18 November 1927; p.5, columns F &amp; G&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Financial success===
White moved to London and turned his hand to promoting boxing matches. In 1911 he attracted public notice when a much-publicised match under his management was banned because one of the boxers was black.&lt;ref&gt;"The Johnson-Wells Match. Negotiations Broken Off." ''[[The Times]]'', 22 September 1911, p. 6. The two boxers were [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[Bombardier Billy Wells]].&lt;/ref&gt; White threatened to stage the match in Paris to escape the ban.&lt;ref&gt;"The Boxing Match. Abandonment In England. Proposed Transfer To Paris." ''The Times'', 29 September 1911, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The enormous public interest in the controversy propelled White to the attention of businessmen, politicians and press barons;  his influence as a broker of deals grew steadily. In the words of the ODNB, "White possessed the kind of charisma that disarmed critics. With deep-blue eyes, an engaging smile, and a Lancastrian breeziness, he impressed those willing to fall under his spell."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; The conductor [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]], whose financial fortunes became entangled with those of White, described him as "one of that group of financial wizards who appeared and vanished like comets in the sky of the business world during the period 1910–1930".&lt;ref&gt;Beecham, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham's dealings with White came about through Beecham's father, [[Sir Joseph Beecham, 1st Baronet|Sir Joseph]]. In 1914 White persuaded Beecham senior to underwrite the purchase of the Covent Garden estate and market in London. The transaction was incomplete when the First World War broke out in 1914 and public share issues for non-essential purposes were prohibited.  Two years later, with the deal still in limbo, White was on the verge of resolving all outstanding funding problems when Sir Joseph died suddenly, leaving a financial tangle that had to be settled by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham, pp. 142 and 181–185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, White was appointed financial adviser to  [[Dunlop Rubber]] and persuaded the company to set up an American subsidiary, which failed. He also speculated in the Lancashire cotton industry during a brief trade boom, to the detriment of the industry.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  After the war he returned to property dealing, and was at first highly successful, buying and profitably reselling large holdings in central London and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also bought a controlling interest in [[Daly's Theatre]], where, he said, "he had used every resource to keep up the standard laid down by the late Mr. [[George Edwardes]]".&lt;ref name=op/&gt;

White was a lifelong gambler, and spend a large fortune on racehorses, owing stables and entering runners, with some success, for major races.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; His best horse was probably [[Irish Elegance]], winner of the [[Royal Hunt Cup]] and the [[Portland Handicap]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="Mortimer"&gt;Mortimer et al, p. 654&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War, he organised entertainments for the American servicemen passing through London, and at troop camps throughout the UK.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 30 June 1927, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Together with other donors, he ensured that boxing rings and supplies of boxing gloves were available to almost all Allied soldiers on active service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45540666 "Boom in Great Britain"], [[The Barrier Miner]], 29 November 1919, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial disaster and suicide===
In 1927, White overstretched himself financially, and found himself hundreds of thousands of pounds short of the money he needed to meet two concurrent contractual commitments.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He committed suicide by poisoning himself at his house near [[Swindon]]. He left a note for the [[coroner]], "Go easy with me, old man. I am dead from prussic acid. No need to cut any deeper. – Jimmy."  The coroner's [[inquest]] found that White was insane at the time of his suicide.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. James White's Death. Verdict at Inquest." ''The Times'', 2 July 1927, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Such was White's popularity that more than 5,000 spectators and mourners attended his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;"Happenings of the Week: News from Home and Abroad", ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 9 July 1927, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; However, the financial magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' commented that by trusting White, "many people in many countries have lost far more than they can afford."&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', 2 July 1927, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Among the biggest losers were White's wife and children, who were left penniless.&lt;ref&gt;"Court of Appeal. James White's Estate: Grant of Administration Refused", ''The Times'', 15 July 1927, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Walter Rodford''' (7 July 1941 – 20 January 2018) was an English musician, who played [[bass guitar]] for several British rock groups. He was a founding member of [[Argent (band)|Argent]], which was led by his cousin [[Rod Argent]], and performed with them from their formation in 1969 until they disbanded in 1976. He was the bass guitarist for [[The Kinks]] from 1978 until they disbanded in 1996. In 2004, he joined the reunited [[The Zombies|Zombies]], whom he had been closely associated with since the early 1960s, and remained a member until his death in 2018. He was also a member of [[The Swinging Blue Jeans]] and [[The Kast Off Kinks]].

==Early years==
Rodford was born on 7 July 1941, in [[St Albans]], [[Hertfordshire]], England. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was a member of the Bluetones, the biggest band in St Albans at the time. Although he did not become a band member at this stage, Rodford was instrumental in helping his younger cousin [[Rod Argent]] form the Zombies in 1964. Rodford later joined the Mike Cotton Sound as a bass guitarist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/leisure/music/11070453.Jim_Rodford__bassist_with_The_Zombies__The_Kinks_and_Argent__talks_about_early_days_of_The_Pioneer_Club|title=Jim Rodford, bassist with The Zombies, The Kinks and Argent, talks about early days of The Pioneer Club|date=12 March 2014|newspaper=Times|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
[[File:Ray Davies - Jim Rodford with The Kinks 1979.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Rodford performing in Mannheim, Germany in 1979 with The Kinks. [[Ray Davies]] (L) and Rodford]]Along with Rod Argent, Rodford was one of the founding members of Argent. When Rod Argent quit the band, the remaining three members (Rodford, [[Bob Henrit]], and [[John Verity]]) formed the short-lived band Phoenix. Eventually, Rodford joined the Kinks as a bass guitarist in 1978 and played with them until their final disintegration in 1996.&lt;ref name=AllMusic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jim-rodford-mn0000093577|title=Jim Rodford|author=Eder, Bruce|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1999–2001 Rodford appeared in a band that ex-[[The Animals|Animals]] guitarist [[Hilton Valentine]] formed, The Animals II, which also featured former Animals drummer [[John Steel (drummer)|John Steel]], and keyboardist [[Dave Rowberry]]. Rodford continued with this band (which changed its working name to "The Animals and Friends" after Valentine left) until joining Argent and [[Colin Blunstone]] in the revival of the Zombies.&lt;ref name=AllMusic /&gt;

Rodford never played with the Zombies in the 1960s, despite having been closely involved with them. However, he began to play the bass guitar with the band's reincarnation in the early years of the 21st century, with his son Steve on drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kinks.buttkereit.info/news/news_e/021202.html|title=I Brought Balance|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Rodford joined the Kast Off Kinks, on the retirement of [[John Dalton (musician)|John Dalton]], whom he had followed into the Kinks after Andy Pyle. In 2009, Jim Rodford regularly played in "The Rodford Files" along with his sons Steve Rodford (Blunstone/Argent band) on drums and Russ Rodford on guitar, plus Derik Timms (mOOn Dogs) on guitar, lap steel, slide and vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kastoffkinks.co.uk/html/jim.html|title=Kast Off Kinks|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the original line-up of Argent reformed and resumed playing in concert. They mounted a short tour including gigs in Frome, Southampton, Wolverhampton, Leamington Spa and London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Marillion, Argent To Play High Voltage Festival|journal=Classic Rock Magazine|date=15 December 2009|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708164938/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/marillion-argent-to-play-high-voltage-festival/|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARGENT At High Voltage 2010|url=https://www.recordheaven.net/index.cfm?x=browseLabel&amp;ID=1477&amp;iID=100514&amp;sc=&amp;ob=tl&amp;so=ASC&amp;pp=50&amp;pn=1&amp;showList=false|website=Record Heaven|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2018, Rodford died after he fell down stairs at his home in [[St Albans]].

==Personal life==
Rodford met his wife, Jean, at the Pioneer Club, St Albans, in the early days of his music career. They have two sons, Steve, a drummer, Russell a guitarist and a daughter, Paula. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageuk.org.uk/BrandPartnerGlobal/hertfordshireVPP/agematters%20spring%202012.pdf|title= Special Feature – Still rocking the world with The Zombies and Argent: Meet Jim Rodford and family|date=Spring 2012|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodford died after a fall on 20 January 2018, at age 76, just a few days after returning from America after playing a few gigs with The Zombies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestclassicbands.com/jim-rodford-obituary-1-20-18/|title=Jim Rodford, of Argent, Kinks, Zombies Fame, Dies|date=11 August 2015|website=Bestclassicbands.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jim-rodford-kinks-and-argent-bassist-dead-at-76-w515670|title=Jim Rodford, Kinks and Argent Bassist, Dead at 76|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Steve is currently the drummer for [[The Zombies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krakow|first1=Steve|title=Colin Blunstone of the Zombies on fake bands, fake names, and how he’s kept his amazing voice|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2018/03/15/colin-blunstone-of-the-zombies-on-fake-bands-fake-names-and-how-hes-kept-his-amazing-voice|website=www.chicagoreader.com|publisher=The Chicago Reader|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
=== Early life (1971–1998)===
Kim Jong-nam was born 10 May 1971 in [[Pyongyang]], North Korea, to [[Song Hye-rim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/15/who-was-kim-jong-nam/ |title=Who was Kim Jong Nam? |author=Anna Fifield |date=15 February 2017 |publisher=The Washington Post |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306033453/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/15/who-was-kim-jong-nam/ |archivedate=6 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of three women known to have had children with Kim Jong-il. Because Kim Jong-il aimed to keep his affair with Song a secret due to the disapproval of his father [[Kim Il-sung]], he initially kept Jong-nam out of school, instead sending him to live with Song's older sister [[Song Hye-rang]], who tutored him at home.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,460254-1,00.html |work=Time |title=Secret Lives |last=Lee |first=Adriana S |date=23 June 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408095913/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C460254-1%2C00.html |archivedate=8 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea Leadership Watch says he left North Korea to visit his grandmother in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], and spent his childhood at international schools in both [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] and [[Switzerland]] until returning to his home country in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fifield |first1=Anna |title=N.

Kim was reported to have had a personality similar to that of his father, and was described by his aunt as being "hot-tempered, sensitive, and gifted in the arts".&lt;ref name="Martin2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bradley K. Martin |title=Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMnf95z_x44C&amp;pg=PA697 |date=10 January 2006 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-32322-6 |page=697 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217101731/https://books.google.com/books?id=QMnf95z_x44C&amp;pg=PA697 |archivedate=17 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His aunt also said in 2000 that he "[did] not wish to succeed his father".&lt;ref name="Martin2006"/&gt; Like Kim Jong-il, he was interested in film: he wrote scripts and short films from a young age.&lt;ref name="Martin2006"/&gt; His father also created a small [[movie set]] for him to use.&lt;ref name="Martin2006"/&gt;

Kim made several clandestine visits to Japan, starting as early as 1995.&lt;ref name="Martin2006"/&gt;

=== 1998–2001: Heir apparent ===
In 1998, Kim was appointed to a senior position in the [[Ministry of Public Security (North Korea)|Ministry of Public Security]] of North Korea, as a future leader.&lt;ref name="T_profile"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryall |first=Julian |title=Profile: Who was Kim Jong-nam, the exiled half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/14/profile-kim-jong-nam-exiled-half-brother-north-korean-dictator/ |accessdate=14 February 2017 |work=The Telegraph |date=14 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214164214/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/14/profile-kim-jong-nam-exiled-half-brother-north-korean-dictator/ |archivedate=14 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also reported to have been appointed head of the North Korean Computer Committee, in charge of developing an information technology (IT) industry. In January 2001, he accompanied his father to [[Shanghai]], where he had talks with Chinese officials on the IT industry.&lt;ref name="T_profile" /&gt;

=== 2001: Tokyo Disneyland incident ===
In May 2001, Kim was arrested in Japan on arrival at [[Narita International Airport]], accompanied by two women and a four-year-old boy identified as his son. He was travelling on a forged [[Dominican Republic passport]] using a Chinese alias, Pang Xiong.&lt;ref name="NYT Feb 15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/4/9/2/n648488p.htm |title={{asiantitle|金正日夫人去世使继承人问题又增悬疑|||a}} |language=Chinese |publisher=The Epoch Times |date=2 September 2004 |accessdate=28 October 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131230508/http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/4/9/2/n648488p.htm |archivedate=31 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/FI02Dg01.html|title=Death of Kim's consort: Dynastic implications|author=David Scofield|publisher=Asia Times Online|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being detained he was deported to China,&lt;ref name="WP_story"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor |first1=Adam |title=The sad story of Kim Jong Chul, the North Korean leader's brother and Eric Clapton megafan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/22/the-sad-story-of-kim-jong-chul-the-north-korean-leaders-brother-and-eric-clapton-megafan/ |accessdate=14 February 2017 |work=The Washington Post |date=22 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215033829/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/22/the-sad-story-of-kim-jong-chul-the-north-korean-leaders-brother-and-eric-clapton-megafan/ |archivedate=15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he said he was travelling to Japan to visit [[Tokyo Disney Resort|Tokyo Disneyland]].&lt;ref name="T_profile" /&gt; The incident caused his father to cancel a planned visit to China due to the embarrassment it caused him.&lt;ref name="T_profile" /&gt;

=== 2001–2005: Loss of favour ===
Until the Tokyo incident, Kim was expected to become leader of the country after his father. In February 2003, the [[Korean People's Army]] began a propaganda campaign under the slogan "The Respected Mother is the Most Faithful and Loyal Subject to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander." This was interpreted as praise of [[Ko Yong-hui|Ko Young-hee]], such that the campaign was designed to promote [[Kim Jong-chul]] or Kim Jong-un, her sons.&lt;ref name="NYT Feb 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Queerty1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen |first1=Dan |title=The Maybe-Gay Son of Kim Jong-Il Definitely Won't Be North Korea's Next Leader |url=https://www.queerty.com/the-maybe-gay-son-of-kim-jong-il-who-definitely-wont-be-north-koreas-next-leader-20111219 |website=Queerty |accessdate=14 February 2017 |date=19 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215021612/https://www.queerty.com/the-maybe-gay-son-of-kim-jong-il-who-definitely-wont-be-north-koreas-next-leader-20111219 |archivedate=15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the loyalty of the army is the real foundation of the Kim family's continuing hold on power in North Korea, this was a serious development for Kim Jong-nam's prospects.&lt;ref name="NYT Feb 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Choe /&gt; In late 2003, it was reported that Kim Jong-nam was living in [[Macau]], lending strength to this belief.&lt;ref name="NYT Feb 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THC1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loh |first1=Andrew |title=Kim Jong-un's half-brother takes refuge in S'pore and Malaysia |url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/01/24/kim-jong-uns-half-brother-takes-refuge-in-spore-and-malaysia/ |work=The Global Citizen |accessdate=14 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215020640/http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/01/24/kim-jong-uns-half-brother-takes-refuge-in-spore-and-malaysia/ |archivedate=15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Jong-un was left in charge while his father was on a state visit to China.&lt;ref name=Choe /&gt; Outsider observers also believed [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|North Korea's sinking of a South Korean ship]] in March 2010 was part of [[Kim Jong-il]]'s attempt to secure succession for the youngest Kim.&lt;ref name="Choe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Choe |first=Sang-Hun |title=Succession May Be Behind N.

Kim's loss of favour was thought to have been caused by the Tokyo incident.&lt;ref name="NYT Feb 15"/&gt; Kim, however, said he fell out of favour because he had become an advocate for reform.&lt;ref name=Chosun&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Jong-nam Says N.Korean Regime Won't Last Long |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/01/17/2012011701790.html |accessdate=17 January 2012 |newspaper=Chosun Ilbo (English Edition) |date=17 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119211617/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/01/17/2012011701790.html |archivedate=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an email to the editor of the ''[[Tokyo Shimbun]]'', Kim wrote that after being educated in Switzerland, he "insisted on reform and market-opening", leading his father to decide that he had turned "into a capitalist".&lt;ref name=Chosun/&gt; Kim at this time has also been described as "the closest [North Korea] ever had to an international playboy",&lt;ref name="GQ"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamer |first1=Nimrod |title=Kim Jong-nam was North Korea's only international playboy |url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/kim-jong-nam-assassinated |accessdate=2 March 2017 |work=British GQ |date=14 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303042731/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/kim-jong-nam-assassinated |archivedate=3 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained a reputation for "gambling and drinking and arranging the occasional business deal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan |first1=Kelvin |last2=Sullivan |first2=Tim |title=The strange life, and sudden death, of North Korean exile Kim Jong Nam |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/02/28/the-strange-life-and-sudden-death-of-north-korean-exile-kim-jong-nam.html |accessdate=2 March 2017 |work=The Toronto Star |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=28 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302112252/https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/02/28/the-strange-life-and-sudden-death-of-north-korean-exile-kim-jong-nam.html |archivedate=2 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only member of the Kim family to ever speak directly to media outside of North Korea.&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt;

It was believed that Kim Jong-nam had friendly ties to China. Outside analysts considered him as a possible candidate to replace Kim Jong-un if the North Korean leadership imploded and China, traditionally an ally, sought a replacement in its client state.&lt;ref name="NYT Feb 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Feb 18, 2017"/&gt;

=== 2005–2017: Rise of Kim Jong-un ===
The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' reported that Kim Jong-nam, while travelling to see his brother Kim Jong-chul in [[Munich]], survived an assassination attempt at the [[Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport|Budapest Ferihegy International Airport]] in July 2006. According to South Korean reports, the Hungarian government protested against the incident to the North Korean embassy in Vienna, requesting there be no recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yoshihiro |first=Makino |title=Was Kim Jong Nam in sights of his paranoid half-brother? |url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201702150052.html |accessdate=20 February 2017 |agency= |publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=14 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219213903/http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201702150052.html |archivedate=19 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Eric Clapton miatt járt Pesten az észak-koreai diktátor megölt testvére |url=http://www.borsonline.hu/aktualis/eric-clapton-miatt-jart-pesten-az-eszak-koreai-diktator-megolt-testvere/127205 |accessdate=20 February 2017 |language=Hungarian |publisher=Bors |date=16 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221010445/http://www.borsonline.hu/aktualis/eric-clapton-miatt-jart-pesten-az-eszak-koreai-diktator-megolt-testvere/127205 |archivedate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' on 1 February 2007, that Kim Jong-nam had been living incognito with his family in [[Macau]], for some three years, and that this was a cause of some embarrassment to both the Macanese and Chinese governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toy |first1=Mary-Anne |title=Kim's playboy son parties in Macau |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/kims-playboy-son-parties-in-macau/2007/02/01/1169919474231.html |accessdate=14 February 2017 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=2 February 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215020501/http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/kims-playboy-son-parties-in-macau/2007/02/01/1169919474231.html |archivedate=15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alfano |first=Seanc |title=Report: Kim Jong Il's Son Living In Macau |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-kim-jong-ils-son-living-in-macau/ |accessdate=14 February 2017 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=CBS News |date=1 February 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215024651/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-kim-jong-ils-son-living-in-macau/ |archivedate=15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korean television and the ''South China Morning Post'' reported in 2007 that Kim Jong-nam had a Portuguese passport. However, Portuguese authorities and the Portuguese consul in Macau, Pedro Moitinho de Almeida, stated that if Kim had such a document it would be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/ultima-hora/filho-de-kim-jong-il-com-passaporte-portugues|title=Filho de Kim Jong-il com passaporte português|language=Portuguese|publisher=CM|date=1 February 2007|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Kim Jong-nam said he had "no interest" in taking power in North Korea after his father, stating that it is only for his father to decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Jong-Il's eldest son has 'no interest' in leadership |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/kim-jongils-eldest-son-has-no-interest-in-leadership-20090125-7p9v.html |accessdate=15 February 2017 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 January 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215021140/http://www.smh.com.au/world/kim-jongils-eldest-son-has-no-interest-in-leadership-20090125-7p9v.html |archivedate=15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Kim Jong-nam gave a brief interview to the [[Associated Press]] in Macau while waiting for a hotel elevator.&lt;ref name="seattle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2012048945_apasskoreashipsinks.html |title=NKorean leader's son gives interview |author1=William Foreman |author2=Hyung Jin-kim |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=6 June 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622074319/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2012048945_apasskoreashipsinks.html |archivedate=22 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he had "no plans" to defect to Europe, as the press had recently rumoured.&lt;ref name="seattle" /&gt; Kim Jong-nam lived in an apartment on the southern tip of Macau's [[Coloane Island]] until 2007.&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt; An anonymous South Korean official reported in October 2010 that Kim Jong-nam had not lived in Macau for "months", and shuttled between China and "another country".&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt;

On 1 January 2012, it was reported that Kim Jong-nam secretly flew to Pyongyang from Macau on 17 December 2011, after learning about his father's death that day and was presumed to have accompanied Kim Jong-un when paying his last respects to their father. He left after a few days to return to Macau and was not in attendance at the funeral to avoid speculation about the succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/kims-eldest-in-secret-visit-to-see-body/story-e6frfkyi-1226234297219 |title=Kim's eldest in 'secret visit' to see body |work=Agence France-Presse |date=1 January 2012 |accessdate=20 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102075057/http://www.news.com.au/world/kims-eldest-in-secret-visit-to-see-body/story-e6frfkyi-1226234297219 |archivedate= 2 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2012, Kim Jong-nam was seen in Beijing waiting for an [[Air China]] flight to Macau. Kim confirmed his identity to a group of South Koreans which included a professor at [[Incheon University]], and told them he usually travels alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/01/16/2012011601009.html |title=Kim Jong-nam Resurfaces in Beijing |work=The Chosun Ilbo |date=16 January 2012 |accessdate=20 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301121137/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/01/16/2012011601009.html |archivedate=1 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book released in 2012 titled ''My Father, Kim Jong Il, and Me'' by Japanese journalist [[Yōji Gomi]] who had interviewed Kim Jong-nam on numerous occasions, Kim Jong-nam said he expected the leadership of Kim Jong-un to fail, citing that he was too inexperienced and young. He also stated, "Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/17/world/asia/north-korea-kim-other-son/index.html |title=Kim Jong Il's other son expects North Korean regime to fail, journalist says |author=Kyung Lah |publisher=CNN |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=20 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227232053/http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/17/world/asia/north-korea-kim-other-son/index.html |archivedate=27 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Jong-un wanted his half brother killed, Mr. Lee said, and there was an assassination attempt against him in 2012. Mr. Kim was so afraid of assassins that he begged for his life in a letter to his half brother in 2012. “Please withdraw the order to punish me and my family,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in the letter. “We have nowhere to hide.

Wheater's Functional Histology: A Text and Atlas. 6th ed. Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; It is specifically arranged around the nucleus, and is a type of [[lipochrome]].

==Formation and turnover==
It appears to be the product of the [[oxidation]] of [[unsaturated fatty acid]]s and may be symptomatic of membrane damage, or damage to [[mitochondria]] and [[lysosome]]s. Aside from a large lipid content, lipofuscin is known to contain sugars and metals, including [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[aluminum]], [[iron]], [[copper]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name=gaugler&gt;Chris Gaugler, "[http://wwwchem.csustan.edu/chem4400/SJBR/lipofus.htm Lipofuscin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715160509/http://wwwchem.csustan.edu/chem4400/SJBR/lipofus.htm |date=2007-07-15 }}", ''Stanislaus Journal of Biochemical Reviews'' May 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Lipofuscin is also accepted as consisting of oxidized proteins (30–70%) as well as lipids (20–50%).&lt;ref name="Double"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Double |first1=KL |last2=Dedov |first2=VN |last3=Fedorow |first3=H |last4=Kettle |first4=E |last5=Halliday |first5=GM |last6=Garner |first6=B |last7=Brunk |first7=UT |title=The comparative biology of neuromelanin and lipofuscin in the human brain. |journal=Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS |date=June 2008 |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=1669-82 |doi=10.1007/s00018-008-7581-9 |pmid=18278576}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The accumulation of lipofuscin-like material may be the result of an imbalance between formation and disposal mechanisms: Such accumulation can be induced in rats by administering a [[protease]] inhibitor ([[leupeptin]]); after a period of three months, the levels of the lipofuscin-like material return to normal, indicating the action of a significant disposal mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katz | first1 = ML | last2 = Rice | first2 = LM | last3 = Gao | first3 = CL | year = 1999 | title = Reversible accumulation of lipofuscin-like inclusions in the retinal pigment epithelium | url = http://www.iovs.org/cgi/content/abstract/40/1/175 | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 175–181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this result is controversial, as it is questionable if the [[leupeptin]]-induced material is true lipofuscin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Terman | first1 = Alexei | last2 = Brunk | first2 = Ulf T. | year = 1999 | title = Is Lipofuscin Eliminated from Cells? | url = http://www.iovs.org/cgi/content/full/40/10/2463 | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 2463–2464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = Sallyanne | last2 = Ellis | first2 = Steven | year = 1999 | title = Lipofuscin Turnover | url = http://www.iovs.org/cgi/content/full/40/8/1887 | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1887–1888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists evidence that "true lipofuscin" is not degradable ''in vitro'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Terman, A, Brunk, UT |year=1998|title=On the degradability and exocytosis of ceroid/lipofuscin in cultured rat cardiac myocytes |journal=Mech Ageing Dev|volume=100 |pages=145–156 | pmid= 9541135|doi=10.1016/S0047-6374(97)00129-2|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Terman | first1 = A | last2 = Brunk | first2 = UT | year = 1998 | title = Ceroid/lipofuscin formation in cultured human fibroblasts: the role of oxidative stress and lysosomal proteolysis | url = | journal = Mech Ageing Dev | volume = 104 | issue = | pages = 277–291 | pmid = 9818731 | doi=10.1016/s0047-6374(98)00073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elleder | first1 = M | last2 = Drahota | first2 = Z | last3 = Lisá | first3 = V | last4 = Mares | first4 = V | last5 = Mandys | first5 = V | last6 = Müller | first6 = J | last7 = Palmer | first7 = DN | year = 1995 | title = Tissue culture loading test with storage granules from animal models of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (Batten disease): testing their lysosomal degradability by normal and Batten cells | url = | journal = Am J Med Genet | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 213–221 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.1320570220 | pmid = 7668332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whether this holds ''in vivo'' over longer time periods is not clear.

==Relation to diseases==
[[File:Cardiac myocyte showing lipofuscin pigment.jpg|thumbnail|[[Micrograph]] of heart muscle showing lipofuscin pigment, [[H&amp;E stain]]]]
Lipofuscin accumulation is a major risk factor implicated in [[macular degeneration]], a degenerative disease of the eye,&lt;ref&gt;John Lacey, "[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-05/hms-hms052306.php Harvard Medical signs agreement with Merck to develop potential therapy for macular degeneration]", 23-May-2006&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Stargardt disease]], an inherited juvenile form of macular degeneration.

Abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin known as ''lipofuscinosis''&lt;ref name="Dorland's"/&gt; is associated with a family of [[neurodegenerative disorder]]s – [[neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis|neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses]], the most common of these is [[Batten disease]].

Pathological accumulation of lipofuscin is implicated in [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], certain [[lysosomal disease]]s, [[acromegaly]], denervation [[atrophy]], [[lipid]] [[myopathy]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Joakim Allaire |author2=François Maltais |author3=Pierre LeBlanc |author4=Pierre-Michel Simard |author5=François Whittom |author6=Jean-François Doyon |author7=Clermont Simard |author8=Jean Jobin |year=2002 |title=Lipofuscin accumulation in the vastus lateralis muscle in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=[[Muscle and Nerve]] |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=383–389 |doi=10.1002/mus.10039}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[centronuclear myopathy]]. Accumulation of lipofuscin in the colon is the cause of the condition [[melanosis coli]].

==Possible therapies==
[[Calorie restricted diet|Calorie restriction]],&lt;ref name=gaugler /&gt; [[vitamin E]],&lt;ref name=gaugler /&gt; and increased [[glutathione]] appear to reduce or halt the production of lipofuscin.

The [[nootropic drug]] [[piracetam]] appears to significantly reduce accumulation of lipofuscin in the brain tissue of rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paula-Barbosa | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1991 | title = The effects of Piracetam on lipofuscin of the rat cerebellar and hippocampa; neurons after long-term alcohol treatment and withdrawal | journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 834–838 | doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1991.tb00610.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possible treatments:

*[[Dimethylethanolamine]]  {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Wet [[macular degeneration]] can be treated using selective [[photothermolysis]] where a pulsed unfocused [[laser]] predominantly heats and kills lipofuscin-rich cells, leaving untouched healthy cells to multiply and fill in the gaps.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  The technique is also used as a skin treatment to remove [[Tattoo removal|tattoos]], [[liverspots]], and in general make skin appear younger.  This ability to selectively target lipofuscin has opened up research opportunities in the field of [[anti-aging medicine]].

A tetrahydropyridoether can remove lipofuscin from retinal pigment epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Julien | first1 = S | last2 = Schraermeyer | first2 = U | date = Oct 2012 | title = Lipofuscin can be removed from the retinal pigment epithelium of monkeys | url = | journal = Neurobiol Aging | volume = 33 | issue = 10| pages = 2390–7 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2011.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This opens up a new therapy option for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, for which there is currently no treatment. The drug has now been granted [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/orphans/2013/12/human_orphan_001287.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d12b orphan drug designation for the treatment of Stargardt disease] by the European Medicines Agency.

==Other uses==
Lipofuscin quantification is used for age determination in various [[crustacean]]s such as [[lobster]]s and [[spiny lobster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ingebrigt Uglem, Mark Belchier  |author2=Terje Svåsand  |lastauthoramp=yes|year=2005 |title=Age determination of European lobsters (''Homarus gammarus'' L.) by histological quantification of lipofuscin |journal=[[Journal of Crustacean Biology]] |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=95–99 |jstor=1549930 |doi=10.1651/c-2448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kerry E. Maxwell |author2=Thomas R. Matthews |author3=Matt R. J. Sheehy |author4=Rodney D. Bertelsen |author5=Charles D. Derby |year= 2007|title=Neurolipofuscin is a measure of age in ''Panulirus argus'', the Caribbean spiny lobster, in Florida |journal=[[The Biological Bulletin]] |volume=213 |issue=1 |pages=55–66 |url=http://www.biolbull.org/content/213/1/55.full |jstor=25066618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these animals lack bony parts, they cannot be aged in the same way as bony fish, in which annual increments in the ear-bones or otoliths are commonly used. Age determination of fish and shellfish is a fundamental step in generating basic biological data such as growth curves, and is needed for many stock assessment methods. Several studies have indicated that quantifying the amount of lipofuscin present in the eye-stalks of various crustaceans can give an index of their age. This method has not yet been widely applied in fisheries management mainly due to problems in relating lipofuscin levels in wild-caught animals with accumulation curves derived from aquarium-reared animals.

'''Modesty''', sometimes known as '''demureness''', is a mode of dress and deportment which intends to avoid the encouraging of [[sexual attraction]] in others. The word "modesty" comes from the Latin word ''[[wikt:modestus|modestus]]'' which means "keeping within measure".&lt;ref name="Jennett, Sheila 2001"&gt;Jennett, Sheila. The Oxford companion to the body. Eds. Colin Blakemore, and Sheila Jennett. Vol. 7. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Standards of modesty are culturally and context dependent and vary widely. In this use, it may be considered inappropriate or immodest to reveal certain parts of the body. In some societies, modesty may involve women covering their bodies completely and not talking to men who are not immediate family members; in others, a fairly revealing but [[One-piece swimsuit|one-piece bathing costume]] is considered modest when other women wear [[bikini]]s. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of modesty is also considered to be public indecency, and [[public nudity]] is generally illegal in most of the world and regarded as [[indecent exposure]]. For example, [[Stephen Gough]] a lone man attempting to walk naked from south to north Britain was repeatedly imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3182771.stm|title=Naked rambler vows to walk on|author=|date=26 August 2003|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nudity is at times tolerated in some societies; for example, during a [[World Naked Bike Ride]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2012/jun/10/world-naked-bike-ride-pictures Guardian newspaper: World Naked Bike Ride – in pictures, 10 June 2012] While most of the riders are naked, all the photographs in this series obscure details by strategically places handlebars.&lt;/ref&gt;

In semi-public contexts standards of modesty vary. Nudity may be acceptable in public single-sex [[changing room]]s at [[swimming bath]]s, for example, or for mass [[medical examination]] of men for [[military service]]. In private, standards again depend upon the circumstances. A person who would never disrobe in the presence of a [[physician]] of the opposite sex in a social context might unquestioningly do so for a medical examination; others might allow examination, but only by a person of the same sex.

==Body==
[[File:1868-skirt-lengths-girl-ages-Harpers-Bazar.gif|thumb|upright=0.72|1868 diagram from ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' showing proper girls' skirt lengths increasing as they grow up.]]

Standards of modesty discourage or forbid exposure of parts of the [[Human body|body]], varying between societies, which may include areas of [[skin]], the [[hair]], [[undergarments]], and [[intimate parts]].  The standards may also require obscuring the shape of the body or parts of it by wearing non-[[form-fitting clothing]]. There are also customs regarding the changing of clothes (such as on a [[beach]] with no enclosed facilities), and the closing or locking of the door when changing or taking a [[shower]].

Standards of modesty vary by culture or generation and vary depending on who is exposed, which parts of the body are exposed, the duration of the exposure, the context, and other variables.  The categories of persons who could see another's body could include:
* a spouse or partner,
* a [[friendship|friend]] or [[family]] member of the same sex,
* strangers of the same sex

The context would include matters such as whether it is in one's own home, at another family member's home, at a friend's home, at a semi-public place, at a [[beach]], [[swimming pool]] (including whether such venues are considered [[dress code|clothes-optional]]), [[changing room]]s or other public places. For instance, wearing a [[bathing suit]] at the beach would not be considered immodest, while it likely would be in a street or an office.

Excessive modesty is called [[prude|prudishness]]. As a medical condition, it is also called [[gymnophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12335|title=Definition of Gymnophobia|last=|first=|date=|website=MedicineNet.com|publisher=MedicineNet.com|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive ''immodesty'' is called [[exhibitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypersexualdisorders.com/hypersexual-disorders/dsm-5-understanding-exhibitionistic-disorder/|title=DSM 5: Understanding Exhibitionistic Disorder|last=|first=|date=21 June 2013|website=Hypersexual Disorders|publisher=Elements Behavioral Health|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modesty in medical settings==
{{main|Modesty in medical settings}}

At times of public or private [[emergency]], expectations of modest dress may be suspended if necessary. For example, during suspected [[anthrax]] attacks in 1998 and 2001 in the [[United States]], groups of people had to strip to their underwear in tents set up in parking lots and other public places for hosing down by fire departments.&lt;ref name="archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com"&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=nude25&amp;date=20020525|title=We'd rather die than take our clothes off, disaster planners say|author=Dru Sefton|date=25 May 2002|newspaper=Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, even in an emergency situation, some people are unable to abandon their need to hide their bodies, even at the risk of their life.&lt;ref name="archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com"/&gt; This may apply to decontamination after a chemical or biological attack, where removal of contaminated clothing is important, or escaping from a night-time fire without time to dress.

==In dress==
[[File:Immodest ukrainians bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Three [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] men, wearing [[Trunks (clothing)|trunks]] and [[Swim briefs|briefs]], attract attention for immodesty relative to the local norm in [[Cox's Bazar|Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh]].]]

Most discussion of modesty involves clothing. The criteria for acceptable modesty and [[Indecent exposure|decency]] have relaxed continuously in much of the world since the nineteenth century, with [[Little black dress|shorter]], [[Form-fitting garment|form-fitting]], and more revealing clothing and [[swimsuit]]s, more for women than men. Most people wear clothes that they consider not to be unacceptably immodest for their religion, culture, generation, occasion, and the people present. Some wear clothes which they consider immodest, due to [[exhibitionism]], the desire to create an [[erotic]] impact, or for [[publicity]].

===Generally accepted Western norms===
Appropriate modesty depends on context and place. For example, in [[sex segregation|single-sex]] [[Change room|public changing rooms]], nudity is often acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/16/britons-bad-being-naked-victoria-coren Why are Britons so bad at being naked?] Sarah Ditum, The Guardian, United Kingdom (16 January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lisboa 2012 - People - XXX (7672031984).jpg|thumb|The definition of modest clothing varies vastly between cultures. The photograph shows a girl in a  [[microskirt]] in Portugal.]]
In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much body exposure is acceptable in public.&lt;ref&gt;Salmansohn, Karen. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html The Power of Cleavage]". ''The Huffington Post'', October 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] depends on social, cultural and regional context. Women's [[swimsuit]]s and [[bikini]]s commonly may reveal the tops and sides of the breasts, or they may be topless as is common on the beaches of [[French Riviera]]. Displaying cleavage is considered permissible in many settings, and is even a sign of elegance and sophistication on many formal social occasions, but it may be considered inappropriate in settings such as workplaces, churches and schools. Showing the [[nipple]]s or [[areolae]] is almost always considered [[toplessness]] or partial [[nudity]]. However, in some circumstances partial breast exposure may be officially sanctioned in church as in 2014, newly elected Pope Francis drew world-wide commentary when he encouraged mothers to breastfeed in church if their babies were hungry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/12/pope-mothers-breastfeeding-children-sistine-chapel|title=Pope Francis encourages mothers to breastfeed - even in the Sistine Chapel|first=Lizzy|last=Davies|date=12 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In private homes, the standards of modesty apply selectively. For instance, nudity among close family members in the home can take place, especially in the [[bedroom]] and [[bathroom]], and wearing of undergarments only in the home is common.

In many cultures it is not acceptable to bare the [[buttocks]] in public; [[Mooning|deliberately doing so]] is sometimes intended as an insult. In [[Public place|public]], Western standards of decency expect people to cover their [[genitalia]], and women to cover their [[breast]]s. In the early twenty-first century, public [[breastfeeding]] has become increasingly acceptable, sometimes protected by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx |title=Breastfeeding Laws |work=Breastfeeding State Laws |publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures, United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Barack Obama's health care bill from 2010 provides additional support to nursing mothers, requiring employers to provide a private and shielded space for employees to use in order to nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/09/breast.feeding.society/|title=Breastfeeding rooms hidden in health care law - CNN.com|last=CNN|first=By  Elizabeth Landau,|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s it has become more common for young and/or fashionable women in Western societies to wear clothing that bared the midriff, "short shorts," backless tops, sheer and other styles considered to be immodest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osisa.org/buwa/regional/fashion-feminists-how-fashion-and-dress-shape-women%E2%80%99s-identities|title=Fashion for Feminists: How fashion and dress shape women’s identities|author=Varyanne Sika|date=10 January 2014|work=Open Society Initiative of Southern Africa (OSISA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences===
[[File:Femmes-Amish.jpg|thumb|Modesty in dress is a relative cultural concept, even in the West, as seen above in the [[plain dress]] of [[Amish]] women on an American beach in 2007.]]
Men and women are subject to different standards of modesty in dress. While both men and women, in Western culture, are generally expected to keep their genitals covered at all times, women are also expected to keep their breasts covered. Some body parts are normally more covered by men than women—e.g., the [[midriff]] and the upper part of the back. Organizations such as the [http://www.tera.ca Topfree Equal Rights Association] advocate for gender equality regarding display of the body. In 1992 New York State's highest court accepted [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] arguments and struck down the provision in New York's ''Exposure of the Person'' statute that made it illegal for women to bare their chests where men were permitted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I92_0160.htm|title=Santorelli &amp; Schloss v. State of New York|author=|date=7 July 1992|publisher=Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional indigenous ==
Traditional indigenous cultures, such as some African and traditional Australian [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] cultures, are more relaxed on issues of clothing, though how much clothing is expected varies greatly, from nothing for some women, to everything except the [[glans penis]] for men of some tribes. In some African cultures, body painting is considered to be body coverage, and is considered by many an attire.

Modesty doesn't have to be related to having more clothes especially in the case of natives tribes. Some feel exposed when seen in certain clothes even though normal attire is much more revealing. Having ear or lip stoppers is seen as modest with the opposite being true as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/308591733/The-dominant-idea-that-clothing-is-necessary-for-reasons-of-modesty-is-a-cultural-premise-It-s-an|title=The dominant idea that clothing is necessary for reasons of modesty is a cultural premise.

==Religious traditions==
[[File:Buddhist Monks - Angkor Wat - Cambodia.JPG|thumb|Modesty in dress for Buddhist Monks visiting the Hindu-Buddhist temple complex [[Angkor Wat]], Cambodia]]
{{See also|Religion and sexuality}}

Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's [[human sexuality|sexuality]] in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc.  Besides other aspects of sexuality, these moral codes seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to [[sexual interest]] and to influence people's behaviour and practices which could arouse such interest, or which overstate a person's sexuality. These religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.

===Buddhism===
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
Modesty in dress is important in Buddhism. The Sekhiya rules of Buddhist Monastic code, for example, provide guidelines on proper clothing as well as recommended ways of dressing for monks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.dhammadana.org/sangha/vinaya/227/75sk.htm The 75 sekhiyas] Buddhism Dhamma Dana (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I will not go [sit] with robes hitched up in inhabited areas: a training to be observed.|Code 9.10, Sekhiya Rule|&lt;ref name="Buddhist Monastic Code I"/&gt;}}

The 'robes hitched up' phrase above refers to lifting one's 1 or 2 piece cloth robe, thereby exposing either side or both sides of one's body to other human beings in an inhabited area. Such exhibitionism is not recommended to monks. Beyond monks, the Buddhist belief is that modesty has a purifying quality to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Thomas (2002), The History of Buddhist Thought, Dover Publications, {{ISBN|978-0486421049}}, pp 163, 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

[[File:Te_Deum_Elizarovo_Guslitsa_8484.jpg|thumb|Women seen in modest dress outside a [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church|Russian Orthodox Christian, Old-Rite]] church.]]

According to the New Testament, ({{Bibleverse|1 Peter|3:3-4|KJV}}) Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

({{Bibleverse|1 Timothy|2:9|KJV}}) In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.

Many Trinitarian Christians consider modesty extremely important,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.christianaction.org.za/articles_ca/2004-3-ModestyTheUndressingOfOurYouth.htm Modesty:  The Undressing of Our Youth], by Lenora Hammond.&lt;/ref&gt; though considerable differences of opinion exist about its requirements and purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therebelution.com/modestysurvey/ The Modesty Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129185312/http://www.therebelution.com/modestysurvey/ |date=2009-01-29 }}: An anonymous discussion among Christians concerning various aspects of modesty.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anabaptists====
{{further|Plain people}}
Many [[Anabaptist]] Christians, such as [[Amish]] groups and some [[Mennonite]] groups like [[Conservative Mennonites]], are known for their adherence to [[plain dress]], a modest fashion style. The [[Hutterite|Hutterites]] and the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], both Christian intentional communities of the Anabaptist tradition, wear modest clothing (often plain dress), and the women wear [[Christian headcovering]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholicism====
[[File:Vatican-tourists-queuing-at-St-Peter-6598.jpg|thumb|A placard informs tourists about the minimum dress standards required to enter [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Vatican]]
Catholics are expected to dress modestly; it is recognised that the forms taken by modesty vary from one culture to another.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc.htm] Para. [http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a9.htm#II 2521-2524].&lt;/ref&gt; The wearing of a [[Christian headcovering]] at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was for the first time mandated as a universal rule for the [[Latin Rite]] by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|Code of Canon Law of 1917]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jgray.org/codes/cic17lat.html |title=1917 Codex Iuris Canonici |work= Canon 1262, Section 2}} (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; abrogated by the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2.HTM |title=Canon 6 §1 of the Code of Canon Law }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that, there have never been any "official" guidelines issued by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. But from time to time the Church hierarchy, and some popes, have given opinions on various matters; although these guidelines are not binding, they are often followed.&lt;ref&gt;See all the following citations, which all expound at least partly upon such guidelines.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pope Pius XII]] stated that women should cover their upper arms and shoulders, that their skirts should cover at least as far as the knee, and the neckline should not reveal anything.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.theuniversityconcourse.com/article/1819.html Modesty and beauty - the lost connection] by Regina Schmiedicke&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Giuseppe Siri|Giuseppe Cardinal Siri of Genoa]] stated that [[trousers]] were unacceptable dress for [[women]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/rhodes/3543/nodress.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+12:55:36 Notification Concerning Men's Dress Worn by Women] by Giuseppe Cardinal Siri (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many traditional Catholics have attempted to further expand on this latter standard.&lt;ref&gt;See G. K. Chesterton, [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=39813 ''What's Wrong with the World''], Part III, Chap. V, for an early attempt (1910); see also [http://gorpub.freeshell.org/cr.html#praise In Praise of the Skirt], for a more contemporary one (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Catholics have attempted to form cohesive theories of modesty. Sometimes this is from a sociological perspective,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; while at other times it takes a more systematic, [[Thomism|Thomistic]] approach, combined with the writings of the [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorpub.freeshell.org/books.html#modesty The Modesty Handbook] (describing the nature of modesty from a Catholic perspective, based on St. Thomas Aquinas and the Church Fathers).&lt;/ref&gt;  Approaches arguing primarily from traditional practices and traditional authorities, such as the Saints, can also be found.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://sicutincaelo.org/b03_twsg.html Those Who Serve God Should Not Follow the Fashions] by Robert T. Hart (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1913, it became fashionable for dresses to be worn with a modest round or V-shaped neckline. In the [[German Empire]], for example, all [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, Alison. ''Victorian and Edwardian Fashion. A Photographic Survey''. Mineola, N.Y.: Dover Publications, 1981. Reprint of 1963 edition. {{ISBN|0-486-24205-6}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] has been active from 1933 in monitoring morally objectionable content in films. It has condemned a number of films including several on account of the clothing worn. For example, [[list of films condemned by the Legion of Decency|the Legion has condemned]] the display of [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] in ''[[The Outlaw]]'' (1941) and in ''[[The French Line]]'' (1954).

Clothing such as "short shorts and short skirts, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and clothing that does not cover the shoulders or is low-cut in the front or the back"&lt;ref name="lds_modesty_guidelines"&gt;[http://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/dress-and-appearance "Dress and Appearance"], ''[[For the Strength of Youth]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; are discouraged. Men and women are also encouraged to avoid extremes in clothing or hairstyles. Rules on modesty also include women being asked to wear no more than one pair of earrings.&lt;ref name="lds_modesty_guidelines" /&gt; Women are generally expected to wear skirts or dresses for church services. Most LDS members do not wear sleeveless shirts or shorts that do not reach the knee.

The church-funded university, [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), requires students and tenants of BYU housing to sign an agreement to live according to these standards of modesty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honorcode.byu.edu The Brigham Young University Honor Code], which includes "Dress and Grooming Standards," agreement to which is required for application.&lt;/ref&gt;

The premise and concepts of modesty have evolved under Hinduism. During Vedic times,{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|p=28–30}} both women and men wore at least two pieces of draped dress that was largely undifferentiated, voluntary and flexible. Stitched clothes such as skirts and bodices were also common in the Vedic period. However, modesty was not determined by the precepts of religion, but by local traditions, social codes, profession, circumstances and occasion. The multiple pieces of draped dress for women evolved into a single length of draped cloth among Indian Hindus, now called [[sari]];{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|p=28–30}} but remained two or more pieces in Southeast Asian Hindus. For men, the draped dress reduced to one piece now called by various names such as [[dhoti]], ''lungi'', ''pancha'', ''laacha'' and other names among Indian Hindus, and ''kamben'' among Balinese Hindu.

The Hindu belief, suggests [[Christopher Bayly]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]], D.H.A. Kolff, ''Two Colonial Empires: Comparative Essays on the History of India and Indonesia in the Nineteenth Century'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-9024732746}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that modesty through appropriate dress has the energy to transmit spirit and substance in a social discourse, the dress serves as a means of expression or celebration, with some dressing elements such as saffron threads or white dress worn by men as moral, transformative and a means to identify and communicate one’s social role in a gathering, or one's state of life such as mourning in days or weeks after the passing away of a loved one.

The canons of modesty for Hindus in South Asia underwent significant changes with the arrival of Islam in the 12th century. The Islamic rulers imposed a dress code in public places for Hindu [[dhimmis]], per their Islamic mores of modesty.{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|p=28–30}} The ''sari'' worn by Hindu women extended to provide a veil, as well as a complete cover of her navel and legs. In the early 18th century, Tryambakayajvan—a court official in south central India—issued an edict called ''Stridharmapaddhati''. The ruling outlined required dress code for orthodox Hindus in that region.&lt;ref&gt;Lesile, J. (Editor) (1992), ''Roles and Rituals for Hindu Women'', Motilal Banarsidass Publications&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stridharmapaddhati'' laced social trends with Hindu religion to place new rules on modesty for women, but gave much freedom to men.

The concept of modesty evolved again during colonial times when the British administration required Indians to wear dresses to help identify and segregate the local native populations. Bernard Cohn,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Cohn (1987), ''An Anthropologist Among the Historians and Other Essays'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195618754}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ross, ''Clothing: A Global History'', Cambridge, {{ISBN|978-0-7456-3186-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; remark that dress during colonial era became part of a wider issue in India about respect, honor and modesty, with the dress code intentionally aimed by the administration to reflect the nature of relationship between the British ruler and the Indian ruled. The British colonial empire, encouraged and sometimes required Indians to dress in an 'oriental manner', to help define and enforce a sense of modesty, identify roles and a person's relative social status.{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|p=12–59}}&lt;ref&gt;see Bernard Cohn, "Cloth, Clothes and Colonialism: India in the 19th Century", and Susan Bean, "Gandhi and Khadi: The Fabric of Independence"; both in Weiner and Schneider (editors), ''Cloth and Human Experience'', Smithsonian Institution Press (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Among Indonesian Hindus, the accepted practice of toplessness among teenage Hindu girls changed during the Dutch colonial rule, with women now wearing a blouse or colorful cloth.

====Temples====
[[File:South Indian Temple Tamil1.jpg|thumb|Women dressed in ''sari'', heading into a South Indian Hindu Temple.]]
Inside most Hindu temples, there is an expectation of modesty rather than sexual allurement. Men and women typically wear traditional dress during religious ceremonies and rituals in a temple, with women wearing ''sari'' or regional Indian dress.&lt;ref&gt;Nye, M. (1995). ''A Place for Our Gods: The Construction of an Edinburgh Hindu Temple Community'' (Vol. 8). Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; In Indonesia and Cambodia, Hindu temple visitors are often requested to wrap their waist with traditional single piece cloth called ''kamben'', ''wastra'' or ''sarung'', with or without ''saput''.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein and Connor (1999), ''Staying Local in the Global Village: Bali in the Twentieth Century'', University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824821173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current trends====
Hindus have diverse views on modesty, with significant regional and local variations. Among orthodox Hindu populations, sexually revealing dress or any sexual behavior in public or before strangers is considered immodest, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, the dress of deities and other symbolism in Hindu temples,&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, M. (1994). "Sexuality in the Indian subcontinent". ''Sexual and Marital Therapy'', 9(1), pp 57–69&lt;/ref&gt; the discussion of dress and eroticism in ancient Hindu literature,&lt;ref&gt;McConnachie, J. (2008), ''The Book of Love: The Story of the Kamasutra'', Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, R. (2000). "The erotics of the wet sari in Hindi films". South Asia: ''Journal of South Asian Studies'', 23(2), pp 143–160&lt;/ref&gt; and art works of Hinduism&lt;ref&gt;Ichaporia, N. (1983). "Tourism at Khajuraho an Indian enigma?" ''Annals of Tourism Research'', 10(1), 75–92&lt;/ref&gt; can be explicit, celebrating eroticism and human sexuality.

In general, a disregard of modesty can be confusing or distressing, in particular to traditional Hindu women. Even in health care context, some Hindu women may express reluctance to undress for examination. If undressing is necessary, the patient may prefer to be treated by a doctor or nurse of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/publications/cr_diversity/hinduism.pdf Culture and Religion Information Sheet: Hinduism] Government of Western Australia (July 2012), page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
[[File:Kalkan market 2.JPG|thumb|A headscarf]]
{{See also|Awrah|List of types of sartorial hijab}}
Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of decency and modesty. In many authentic [[hadith]]s, it has been quoted that "modesty is a part of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | title=Hadith 20 :: Modesty is from Faith | publisher=40hadithnawawi.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modesty is verily required in the interaction between members of the opposite sex and in some case between the members of same sex also. Dress code is part of that overall teaching.

====Women====

"And tell the believing women to cast down their glances and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women." -Quran 24:31.

“O Prophet! Say to your wives, your daughters, and the women of the believers that: they should let down upon themselves their jalabib.” -Quran 33:59. Jalabib is an Arabic word meaning "loose outer garment".

In some Muslim societies, women wear the [[niqab]], a veil that covers the whole face except the eyes, or the full [[burqa]], a full-body covering garment that occasionally does cover the eyes. Wearing these garments is common in some, but not all, countries with a predominantly Muslim population.

[[File:Kufihat.jpg|thumb|A taqiyah cap]]
Though by some scholars these expressions of modesty are interpreted as mandatory, most countries do not enforce modesty by law. However, a few countries, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], Afghanistan and Iran, enforce specified standards of dress for women.

====Men====

"Tell the believing men to cast down their glances and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is [well] acquainted with what they do." -Quran 24:30

Most scholars agree that men are required to cover everything from the navel to the knees; some men choose also to wear the traditional Islamic cap [[Taqiyah (cap)|(taqiyah)]], similar to but larger than the Jewish [[yarmulke]] or [[kippah]]. The taqiyah may vary in shape, size and color, with differences according to tradition, region, and personal taste.

===Judaism===
Modesty in [[Judaism]], called [[Tzniut]] ({{lang-he-n|צניעות}}), is important beyond aspects of clothing. It extends to behaviour in public and in private, and depends on the context.

====Women====
[[File:Women praying in the Western Wall tunnels by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Three styles of hair covering common among married Observant Jewish women. From right to left: snood, fall, and hat.]]

[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Ultra-Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] Jewish women usually wear skirts to their knees, with blouses covering the collarbone and sleeves coming to or covering elbows.&lt;ref name="Patheos"&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Modesty-Not-Just-for-Women?offset=0&amp;max=1 "Modesty: Not Only A Woman's Burden"], ''[[Patheos]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[See-through clothing|See-through materials]] may not be used and clothes are expected not to be [[Form-fitting garment|tight-fitting]], provocative, loud in color, or display texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modestworld.com/laws.html The Laws of Jewish Modesty]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510043220/http://www.modestworld.com/laws.html |date=May 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules are relaxed to allow for color and text in less strict communities. Some modern Orthodox communities allow the collarbone to be shown (so long as cleavage is amply covered), and sleeves not to reach the elbow. There are many different opinions on these issues. Some communities apply these standards to girls as young as three. Less strict [[Conservative Judaism]] recommends modest dress, but this is not broadly observed. Less restrictive branches of Judaism tend to adopt the fashions of the society in which they live.

It is the custom for an observant married [[Orthodox Jewish]] woman to cover her hair in public, and sometimes at home. The hair covering may be a scarf, hat, [[Snood (headgear)|snood]] called a [[Tichel]], or a [[Wig (hair)|wig]] called a [[Sheitel]].

Women who do not follow all the regulations in everyday life, often do so during religious observances in a [[synagogue]] or elsewhere.

====Men====
[[File:Praying at Belzer Rebbe's grave.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Jewish man praying at a grave, Israel]]
Standards of modesty also apply to men.  While some men will wear shorts and short-sleeve shirts, however strictly orthodox men will not. More modern Orthodox Jewish Men will be more lax in their dress when surrounded by other men (if it is not in a religious environment). Modesty for men most often translates to covering the torso and legs with loose clothing. Different groups of Orthodox Jews have different dress norms. But most have men dress in black suits, white dress shirts, and a Black hat (along with religious clothing).

===Cross-cultural and non-religious===

Some individuals adopt modesty standards of other groups or standards of previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianundercover.wordpress.com/about/|title=Canadian Undercover: Bio|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example includes the [[Noahidism|Noahides]] who follow Jewish laws but are not themselves Jewish.

==In the arts==
[[File:Cupidon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cupidon (1875)|Cupidon]] (French for [[Cupid]]), painting by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1875; the tip of the boy god's right wing covers his genitals.]]
[[File:Modesty,_marble,_1833,_Jean-Louis_Jaley_(3).jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|''Modesty'', marble statue of a partly-draped woman by [[Jean-Louis Jaley]], 1875.]]
Standards of modesty in art have varied at different times and in different places. [[depictions of nudity|Nudity and various types of behavior were sometimes depicted]], sometime not. In many cases where society did not allow nudity or immodest dress, nudity was accepted in art. Where nudity in art was not acceptable, full nudity was not displayed; otherwise nude subjects had their intimate parts hidden by apparently accidental draped fabric, flowers, other people, a [[fig leaf]], etc. In films, very brief nudity was accepted. Some nude artworks had fig leaves added when standards became less permissive.

In a given society, the criteria varied according to the circumstances; for example artworks on public display were more restrained than those for private display to adults.

Nudity in art was sometimes suggested without actual depiction by:
* something seemingly by chance covering the parts of the body which should modestly be covered
*[[nudity in film|in film]]:
** showing a supposedly nude person from the waist or shoulders up
** maneuvering (turning, having objects in front) and [[Film editing|editing]] in such a way that no genitals are seen
** showing nudity from a distance, or from the back only, although other characters are nearby and/or would also see frontal nudity
** showing nudity very briefly

In [[cartoon]]s, even in cases where the genital area is not covered with clothing, genitals are often simply not drawn, as is the case in [[Family Guy]] and other [[animated sitcom]]s. In the film ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]'', showing [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] cattle of both sexes walking on two legs, instead of either showing [[Bull#Reproductive anatomy|genitals of male cattle]] or not showing them, the concept of a "male cow" was used, with an [[udder]]. In ''[[Underdog (film)|Underdog]]'' a partly animated anthropomorphized dog is shown with penis when a real dog is filmed, and without penis in the animated parts.

Paintings are sometimes changed because of changed modesty standards, and later sometimes changed back. During the [[Counter-Reformation]] there was a "fig-leaf campaign" aiming to cover all representations of human genitals in paintings and sculptures that started with Michelangelo's works. Works covered in this way include the marble statue of ''[[Cristo della Minerva]]'' (church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], Rome) which was covered by added drapery, as it remains today, and the statue of the naked child Jesus in ''[[Madonna of Bruges]]'' (The [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges|Church of Our Lady]] in [[Bruges]], Belgium) remained covered for several decades. Also, the plaster copy of the David in the [[Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum)]] in London, has a fig leaf in a box at the back of the statue. It was there to be placed over the statue's genitals so that they would not upset visiting female royalty. The statue of Achilles at [[Hyde Park Corner]] now has an incongruous figleaf permanently attached, after it was stolen several times. 
{{See also|Expulsion from the Garden of Eden}}

Many fairytales and other related media feature women from or ethnic origin from [[Western Europe]] and [[Northern Europe]] to be demure due to their typically soft features. Famous examples include [[Snow White]], [[Cinderella]], [[Sleeping Beauty]], [[Beauty and the Beast]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], [[Wendy Darling]] from [[Peter Pan]], [[Maid Marian]] from [[Robin Hood]], [[Christine Daaé]] from [[The Phantom of the Opera]], [[Ophelia]] from [[Hamlet]], and [[Dorothy Gale]] from [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6319">&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Aliens.jpg|right|thumb|The Advocacy, leaders of the Mor-Taxan forces invading Earth]] --&gt;
'''Mor-Taxans''' are the [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] inhabitants of the fictional planet [[Mor-Tax]], in the first season of the ''[[War of the Worlds (TV series)|War of the Worlds]]'' television series. They are loosely based on the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martians]] from the 1953 film version of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.

==Social classes==
Mor-Taxan society is divided into three functional [[caste]]s: [[ruling class]], [[military]], and [[scientist]]s.
The ruling class is represented on [[Earth]] by a triad called the Advocacy who oversee the invasion while their leaders known as the Council (never seen on screen) remain on Mor-Tax to supervise evacuation from their dying planet. The lower class belong mainly to so-called 'field units' who are undercover in human society while most of the scientists stay in Advocacy headquarters at [[Nevada]] desert to provide medical and engineering service.

A quote from the show which illustrates this class system is: ''There are thousands of us...but we are ruled by the three.'' (Quinn to Blackwood)

==Culture==
Apparently, Mor-Taxans love art, as evidence by renegade Quinn, whose works are very valuable among humans.

==Technology==
The Mor-Taxans possess some advanced technology; including old remains from previous invasions, and some devices which they created from parts found on Earth.  Examples include:
* Healing device
* [[spacecraft|Spaceship]]s
* Hand Beam Weapon
* Environmental [[Radiation suit|Anti-radiation Suits]]

==Language and communication==
[[Image:Mor-Taxan.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The best on-screen image of a Mor-Taxan Alien.]]

The Mor-Taxans employ two known means of communication. One is verbal or phonetic, and is mainly a [[spoken language]], though occasionally they emit more bestial and guttural sounds. The nature of their language is distinctly alien, but at times the observant listener can hear pieces of a human language. For example, in one episode, as the aliens are talking about our [[sun]] (via subtitles), the word ''sol'' or ''solar'' can be heard in correspondence. In other, ''[[craft]]'' is audible when discussing a ship. While this fictional language sounds inspired in part of [[languages of Africa|African]] origin, what real human languages were amalgamated in it are unknown. It is of note, that when the aliens talk in human host bodies, there seems to be little distinction between their voices, both among each other and from those in their natural state. However, whereas their voices are mostly heard in more a high pitch, there are times when an aliens' voice is lower. The reasons for this, either within the show or behind-the-scenes, are unknown.

Another method often used is the use of [[radio transmission]]s. To the human ear, they are heard simply as a pulsating noise. An explained aspect to this is that this is the same sounds heard when they are seen standing back-to-back in threes in what seems to be a trance. The show never explains what exactly they are doing, but the [[novelization]] refers to it as a "communion of consciousness." Though it's unclear if the book is [[canon (fiction)|canon]], the show itself reflects little to refute this. The reference of their collective nature and mindset, and even their crude [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities support this theory. However, the strongest case is in their means of operating their ships. [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Dr. Clayton Forrester]] speculated that they use brainwave impulses and in one scene we see three aliens operating a ship, without apparent physical guidance, sitting in their common triangle formation, emitting the same pulsating sounds. To further the possible organic nature, there is evidence the aliens can understand the broadcasts as if they were a simple language. To this extent, in one episode, they are used in some way for the benefit of their unhatched young. Norton Drake, the member of the Blackwood Project who receives and studies the signals, even goes as far as to refer to them as "[[baby talk]]."

|- 
| ''The decay process of a Mor-Taxan body is an exothermic reaction, their flesh becoming a horrible steamy mass of decomposing alien tissue.''
|}

==Physical characteristics==
* Mor-Taxans have a total of three arms. Two of these are attached to their body much like those on the human body, but their third arm is largely unseen as it appears to be hidden in their chest. It appears to be rarely employed in any of their activity, though it proves useful when one has taken over a human body, its sudden burst through the chest of their host catching targets off guard.
* Structurally, the aliens are like jellyfish rather than mammals. They are able to "melt" into human bodies via a combination of osmosis and cell phase-matching. This process effectively kills the human cells but allows the alien access to their memories. Once one such alien is killed, an exothermic reaction causes the cells to boil, leaving a decaying radioactive puddle of human &amp; alien biomatter. Once an alien leaves its host body, the same reaction occurs to the discarded tissue.

The melting into humans seems to be reversible. The Advocacy is seen in human bodies, then after discovery of environmental suits they somehow returned to their original form and in the episodes "To Heal the Leper" and "The Angel of Death" they melted into humans twice. This ability is somehow connected with immunology or alien genetics. Quinn, who is immune to Earth bacteria, is also imprisoned in a human body.

'''Moss Man''' is a [[fictional character]] from the popular [[Masters of the Universe]] (MOTU) franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Battle of the Fun Factories
|work= Time|date=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960379-2,00.html
|accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his name indicates, he is a man made of [[moss]], whose power is to [[camouflage]] into foliage and other green areas (making him a useful [[spy]]), as well as control all [[plant|plant life]]. He lives in the Evergreen Forest in harmony among the [[animal]]s and plants.

==Character history==
===1980s===
===Original figure===
The Moss Man figure was first released in 1985, as part of the line's fourth wave of figures. 

The figure is a green repaint of the [[Beast Man]] action figure, covered with fuzzy "moss" [[Flocking (texture)|flocking]], with the fangs painted over, and a pine scent added to the body. He has a brown [[Mace (club)|mace]] that is a recast of a weapon from the original [[Castle Grayskull]] playset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 8 Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures|work=Mania.com|date=2010-04-08|url= http://www.mania.com/8-crazy-masters-universe-figures_article_117840.html|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his added scent, he can in some ways be considered a Heroic counterpart to the Evil Warrior [[Stinkor]], released in the same wave, who also had an added scent. 

Examples of the Moss Man figure can be found both with hollow, 'squeezable' heads, as was common for earlier figures in the line, as well as more solid rubber heads, which became more common in the later days of the line.

===Filmation cartoon series===
Given that the accompanying cartoon series was drawing to a close at the time his toy was released, Moss Man's role in the cartoon is minimal and he appears in only two episodes: "Here, There, [[Skeletor]]s Everywhere" and "The Ancient Mirror of Avathar". The former portrays him as a [[spy]] who can secretly observe danger by turning into a plant. The latter shows him using his abilities to rescue others by turning his arms into [[vine]]s, as well as [[communication|communicating]] with plants. He also has a non-speaking [[cameo appearance]] with a number of other lesser-seen characters in ''[[He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special]]'', where he appears in the background at [[Prince Adam]] and [[Princess Adora]]'s birthday party.

===2002 series===
Moss Man features in the 2002 relaunch of Masters of the Universe as part of the cartoon series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wPa5DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA457&amp;dq=moss+man+masters+of+the+universe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicyqznxY_dAhUIB8AKHTjsCdoQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=moss+man+masters+of+the+universe&amp;f=false|title=He-Man and the Masters of the Universe|first1=Val|last1=Staples|first2=James|last2=Eatock|first3=Josh|last3=DeLioncourt|first4=Danielle|last4=Gelehrter|date=28 August 2018|publisher=Dark Horse Comics|accessdate=28 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not part of the new toy line, because it was cancelled before his figure could be released, although a limited edition figure was given away as a [[Mattel]] exclusive. As with the original figure, this was a repaint of the line's Beast Man figure, this time replacing the mace with a club that came with the line's [[Mekaneck]] figure. 

The cartoon series depicts him as one of the most powerful beings on [[Eternia]], possibly even more powerful than [[He-Man]] himself. He is introduced in the episode "[[Orko (character)|Orko]]'s Garden", in which he is an [[urban legend]]; an Eternian equivalent of the [[Green Man]]. He seems to be a kind of [[spirit]] who [[farm]]ed and looked after the Eternian [[forestry]] and kept it in harmony. His rival in this episode is [[Evilseed]], an evil counterpart who wants the plant world to overcome the human world. Moss Man's incredible powers help He-Man save the day, his power over all forms of [[vegetation]] able to overcome just about any obstacle. In a subsequent episode, "The Last Stand", he uses his abilities to save all the Masters from [[Skeletor]]'s strongest trap yet. Given that he is so powerful, his appearances are sparse; only coming to the Masters' aid in times of desperation. 

===Masters of the Universe Classics===
Moss Man was released on March 15 as the March 2010 Figure of the Month for the [[Masters of the Universe#Masters of the Universe Classics 2008-|Masters of the Universe Classics]] line of action figures.  The figure includes two distinct head sculpts, one looking more like his 200x counterpart and the other like his 1980's Beast Man head (painted green &amp; [[flocking (texture)|flocked]]). Originally, Mattel had reported that they had problems with the flocking - with the line's increased articulation, the flocking had caused some of the joins to cease. However, the final production figure was released with most of the body covered in "moss" flocking. 

A variant of the figure with flocked ears was also released in small, limited quantities.

[[File:One day at a time schneider 1976.JPG|thumb|Pat Harrington Jr. on ''[[One Day at a Time]]'' (1976) ]]
'''Daniel Patrick Harrington Jr.''' (August 13, 1929 &amp;ndash; January 6, 2016) was an American voice, stage, and television actor, best known for his role as building superintendent "Dwayne Schneider" on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[One Day at a Time]]''. His father, [[Pat Harrington Sr.]], was also an actor.

==Early life==
Harrington was born in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Manhattan]] on August 13, 1929.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pat Harrington Jr., Schneider of TV's 'One Day at a Time,' dies at 86|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/pat-harrington-jr-schneider-of-tvs-one-day-at-a-time-dies-at-86/2016/01/07/fb8cf232-b54c-11e5-9388-466021d971de_story.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 7, 2016|first=Adam|last=Bernstein|authorlink=Margalit Fox|page=B7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was a song and dance man who worked in [[vaudeville]] and performed on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage. Harrington attended a Catholic military school, La Salle Military Academy in Oakdale, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Photograph|url=https://archivesspace.manhattan.edu/repositories/3/archival_objects/54180|website=ArchiveSpace|publisher=Manhattan College Archives|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Pat Harrington Jr., ‘Schneider’ of TV’s ‘One Day at a Time,’ dies at 86|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/pat-harrington-jr-schneider-of-tvs-one-day-at-a-time-dies-at-86/2016/01/07/fb8cf232-b54c-11e5-9388-466021d971de_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2016-01-07|accessdate=2016-01-10|issn=0190-8286|first=Adam|last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; then graduated from [[Fordham University]] in 1950 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and subsequently received a [[master's degree]] in political philosophy, also from Fordham. During the [[Korean War]], Harrington served as an intelligence officer with the [[United States Air Force]], where he achieved the rank of [[first lieutenant]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Following in his father's footsteps, he pursued a career in entertainment after graduating from college and completing military service. He took a job at [[NBC]] in New York City. He then began acting on stage and toured [[North America]] with a number of plays, eventually performing on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

==Career==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
Harrington became famous in the 1950s as a member of [[Steve Allen]]'s television comedy troupe, the "Men on the Street" (which also included [[Don Knotts]], [[Tom Poston]] and [[Louis Nye]]). He made many appearances as the comedic [[Italy|Italian]] immigrant "Guido Panzini" on ''[[The Tonight Show|The Jack Paar Show]]'' in the mid-1950s. In the 1959-60 season, he played the recurring role of Pat Hannigan in eleven episodes of [[Danny Thomas]]'s CBS-TV sitcom, ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]''.

In a 1965 episode of ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' ("The Bow-Wow Affair"), Harrington reprised his role as "Guido Panzini" (who he also played in the February 8, 1966 episode of ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' and in the May 2, 1983 episode of ''[[One Day at a Time]]''). That same year he appeared in an episode of ''[[Mr. Novak]]'', starring [[James Franciscus]]. He also  guest-starred on two episodes of ''[[The Munsters]]''.

In 1967, he appeared in the [[Elvis Presley]] film ''[[Easy Come, Easy Go (1967 film)|Easy Come, Easy Go]]''.  He also parodied ''[[Get Smart]]'' in an episode of ''[[F Troop]]'', in which he played [[espionage|secret agent]] "B Wise". From 1971 to 1974, he appeared in eleven episodes as [[District Attorney]] Charlie Giannetta of the ABC legal drama ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'', starring [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]] in the title role.

Harrington worked as a [[voice acting|voice actor]]. He voiced "[[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer/the Atom]]" and "[[Speedy (Roy Harper)|Roy Harper/Speedy]]" on ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' in 1967. From 1965-69, Harrington portrayed the voices of both [[The Inspector]] (a character inspired by [[Inspector Clouseau|Inspector Jacques Clouseau]]) and his Spanish Gendarmes sidekick Deux Deux in all of the original 34 animated episodes of the character's eponymous series which were created by Mirisch Films and [[DePatie-Freleng]] and released via [[United Artists]]. They were later shown as part of the Pink Panther cartoon TV show. Another cartoon voice he did was that of Jon's father on ''A Garfield Christmas Special''.

In 1974, he appeared with [[Peter Falk]] and [[Robert Conrad]] in the ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' episode ''[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 4|An Exercise in Fatality]]''. Harrington was well known for his role as [[wikt:affable|affable]] building superintendent "Dwayne Schneider" on the 1975–1984 television sitcom ''[[One Day at a Time]]''. He won both an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor – Comedy Series|Emmy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]] for his work on this series. In 1979, Harrington appeared as a celebrity guest star/game show contestant on ''[[Password Plus]]''. He reprised his role as Schneider in a series of commercials in the late 1980s for [[Trak Auto|Trak Auto Parts]] after the show ended. He appeared in an episode of ''[[The King of Queens]]'' in 2006. In 2012, he also appeared as a guest star on ''[[Hot In Cleveland]]''.

'''Pope Urban VI''' ({{lang-la|Urbanus VI}}; c. 1318 – 15 October 1389), born '''Bartolomeo Prignano''' ({{IPA-it|bartoloˈmɛːo priɲˈɲaːno}}), was [[Pope]] from 8 April 1378 to his death in 1389. He is so far the last pope to be elected from outside the [[College of Cardinals]]. His reign, which began shortly after the end of the [[Avignon Papacy]], was marked by immense conflict between rival factions as part of the [[Western Schism]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Itri]], Prignano was a devout [[monk]] and learned [[casuist]], trained at [[Avignon]].  On 21 March 1364 he was consecrated [[Archbishop of Acerenza]] in the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. He became [[Archbishop of Bari]] in 1377.

Prignano had developed a reputation for simplicity and frugality and a head for business when acting Vice-Chancellor. He also demonstrated a penchant for learning, and, according to Cristoforo di Piacenza,&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to his master, [[House of Gonzaga|Lodovico Gonzaga]] of Mantua; (Pastor 121, who adds "He was quickly and thoroughly undeceived!").&lt;/ref&gt; he was without ''famiglia''{{clarify|date=December 2014}} in an age of [[nepotism]], although once in the papal chair he elevated [[list of cardinal-nephews|four cardinal-nephews]] and sought to place one of them in control of Naples. His great faults undid his virtues: [[Ludwig von Pastor]] summed up his character: "He lacked Christian gentleness and charity. He was naturally arbitrary and extremely violent and imprudent, and when he came to deal with the burning ecclesiastical question of the day, that of reform, the consequences were disastrous."&lt;ref&gt;Pastor 122; on the urgency of reforms, see the contemporary letters of [[Catherine of Siena]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election as Pope==
On the death of [[Pope Gregory XI]] (27 March 1378), a [[Rome|Roman]] mob surrounded the papal [[Papal conclave, 1378|conclave]] to demand a Roman pope. The cardinals being under some haste and great pressure to avoid the return of the Papal seat to [[Avignon]], Prignano was unanimously chosen Pope on 8 April 1378 as acceptable to the disunited&lt;ref&gt;Pastor 118.&lt;/ref&gt; majority of French [[Catholic cardinal|cardinals]], taking the name Urban VI. Not being a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]], he was not well known. Immediately following the conclave, most of the cardinals fled Rome before the mob could learn that not a Roman (though not a Frenchman either), but a subject of Queen [[Joan I of Naples]], had been chosen.

Though the coronation was carried out in scrupulous detail, leaving no doubt as to the legitimacy of the new pontiff,&lt;ref&gt;Pastor 119f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Schimmelpfennig (translated by James Sievert), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=05HtCjTpAFsC The Papacy]'' ({{ISBN|0-231-07515-4}}), p. 220. Quote: "The next day, after Prignano had called upon them to do so, most of the cardinals came back to the palace and enthroned him. Prignano gave himself the name of Urban VI. The cardinals presented him with the customary petitions, and then took part in worship services being held not for the new pope but in celebration of Holy Week, before the new pontiff was crowned on Easter Sunday, April 18. The cardinals stayed at his court for the next three months, assisting him with liturgical functions. The curia that had remained in Rome likewise seemed to have acknowledged him."&lt;/ref&gt; the French were not particularly happy with this move and began immediately to conspire against this Pope. Urban VI did himself no favors; whereas the cardinals had expected him pliant, he was considered arrogant and angry by many of his contemporaries. [[Dietrich of Nieheim]] reported the opinion of the cardinals that his elevation had turned his head,&lt;ref&gt;Pastor 122.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Froissart]], [[Leonardo Aretino]], Tommaso de Acerno&lt;ref&gt;Tomasso de Acerno, ''De creatione Urbani VI opusculum.''&lt;/ref&gt; and St. [[Antoninus of Florence]] recorded similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Drawn together by [[Alfred von Reumont]] (ii, 1024), Pastor notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crisis of control==
Immediately following his election, Urban began preaching intemperately to the cardinals (some of whom thought the delirium of power had made Urban mad and unfit for rule), insisting that the business of the Curia should be carried on without gratuities and gifts, forbidding the cardinals to accept annuities from rulers and other lay persons, condemning the luxury of their lives and retinues, and the multiplication of [[benefice]]s and bishoprics in their hands. Nor would he remove again to Avignon, thus alienating King [[Charles V of France]].

The cardinals were mortally offended. Five months after his election, the French cardinals met at [[Anagni]], inviting Urban, who realized he would be seized, and perhaps slain. In his absence, they issued a manifesto of grievances on 9 August which declared his election invalid since they had been cowed by the mob into electing an Italian. Letters to the missing Italian cardinals followed on 20 August declaring the papal throne vacant (''[[sede vacante]]''). Then at [[Fondi]], secretly supported by the king of France,&lt;ref&gt;Pastor 127; {{cite book |first=W. |last=Ullmann |title=The Origins of the Great Schism |location=London |year=1948 |pages=54 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the French cardinals proceeded to elect [[Robert of Geneva]] as Pope on 20 September. Robert, a militant cleric who had succeeded [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]] as commander of the papal troops, took the name [[antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]], beginning the [[Western Schism]], which divided Catholic Christendom until 1417.

Urban was declared [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the French [[antipope]] and was called "the [[Antichrist]]", while [[Catherine of Siena]], defending Pope Urban, called the cardinals "devils in human form." [[Coluccio Salutati]] identified the political nature of the withdrawal: "Who does not see," the Chancellor openly addressed the French cardinals, "that you seek not the true pope, but opt solely for a Gallic pontiff."&lt;ref&gt;"Quis non videt vos non verum Papam quærere, sed solum Pontificem natione Gallicum exoptare" (quoted Pastor 131 note).&lt;/ref&gt; Opening rounds of argument were embodied in [[John of Legnano]]'s defense of the election, ''De fletu ecclesiæ,'' written and incrementally revised between 1378 and 1380, which Urban caused to be distributed in multiple copies, and in the numerous rebuttals that soon appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John P. |last=McCall |title=Chaucer and John of Legnano |journal=Speculum |volume=40 |issue=3 |year=1965 |pages=484–489 [p. 487] |jstor=2850921 |doi= 10.2307/2850921}} Notes 38 surviving manuscripts of ''De fletu'' in full or in part, and three responses from French cardinals as wekll as Jean LeFevre's ''De planctu bonorum'' ("The plaint of Bologna", 1379), which played on the title and gave a point-by-point rebuttal.&lt;/ref&gt; Events overtook the rhetoric, however; 26 new cardinals were created in a single day, and by an arbitrary alienation of the estates and property of the church, funds were raised for open war.&lt;ref&gt;The reduced and disordered finances at Rome, most of the records being retained at Avignon and most of the experienced members of the papal camera and treasury having followed Clement, is discussed by {{cite book |first=Jean |last=Favier |title=Les Finances Pontificales a L'Epoque Du Grand Schisme D'Occident, 1378–1409 |location=Paris |publisher= |year=1966 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of May 1379 Clement went to Avignon, where he was more than ever at the mercy of the king of France. [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou]], was granted a phantom kingdom of Adria to be carved out of papal Emilia and Romagna, if he could unseat the pope at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of the Eight Saints==
Meanwhile, the [[War of the Eight Saints]], carried on with spates of unprecedented cruelty to civilians, was draining the resources of Florence, though the city ignored the [[interdict]] placed upon it by Gregory, declared its churches open, and sold ecclesiastical property for 100,000 florins to finance the war. Bologna had submitted to the Church in August 1377, and Florence signed a treaty at [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]] on 28 July 1378 at a cost of 200,000 florins indemnity extorted by Urban for the restitution of church properties, receiving in return the papal favor and the lifting of the disregarded interdict.

Urban's erstwhile patroness, Queen Joan I of Naples, deserted him in the late summer of 1378,&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Fodale, ''La politica napoletana di Urbano VI'' (Rome: Sciascia) 1976, treats the convoluted career of Urban's most important political course as invariably rational— in the face of the contemporary accounts — with copious quotes from original sources.&lt;/ref&gt; in part because her former archbishop had become her [[Feudalism|feudal suzerain]]. Urban now lost sight of the larger issues and began to commit a series of errors. He turned upon his powerful neighbor Joan, excommunicated her as an obstinate partisan of Clement, and permitted a crusade to be preached against her. Soon her enemy and cousin, the "crafty and ambitious"&lt;ref name="Pastor 136"&gt;Pastor 136.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles II of Hungary|Charles of Durazzo]], representing the Sicilian Angevin line, was made sovereign over the [[Kingdom of Naples]] on 1 June 1381, and was crowned by Urban. Joan's authority was declared forfeit, and Charles murdered her in 1382.  "In return for these favours, Charles had to promise to hand over [[Capua]], [[Caserta]], [[Aversa]], [[Nocera Inferiore|Nocera]], and [[Amalfi]] to the pope's nephew,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1378.htm], [[Francesco Moricotti Prignano]], of Vico, near Pisa; he was made a cardinal (18 September 1378) and called the "Cardinal of Pisa;" appointed governor of Campagna, 21 April 1380; Urban's constant assistant, he died in 1394.&lt;/ref&gt; a thoroughly worthless and immoral man."&lt;ref name="Pastor 136"/&gt;
Once ensconced at Naples, Charles found his new kingdom invaded by Louis of Anjou and [[Amadeus VI of Savoy]]; hard-pressed, he reneged on his promises. In Rome, the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] was besieged and taken, and Urban was forced to flee. In the fall of 1383 he was determined to go to Naples and press Charles in person. There he found himself virtually a prisoner. After a first reconciliation, with the death of Louis (20 September 1384), Charles found himself freer to resist Urban's feudal pretensions, and relations took a turn for the worse. Urban was shut up in [[Nocera Inferiore|Nocera]], from the walls of which he daily fulminated his [[anathema]]s against his besiegers, with [[bell, book and candle]]; a price was set on his head.

[[File:Assedio di UrbanoVI.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Urbano VI at Nocera's Castel, from ''Croniche'' of [[Giovanni Sercambi]] ]]

Rescued by two Neapolitan barons who had sided for Louis, [[Raimondo Del Balzo Orsini|Raimondello Orsini]] and Tommaso di Sanseverino, after six months of siege he succeeded in making his escape to [[Genoa]] with six galleys sent him by [[doge of Genoa|doge]] [[Antoniotto Adorno]]. Several among his cardinals who had been shut up in [[Nocera Inferiore|Nocera]] with him were determined to make a stand, proposing that the Pope, due to incapacity and obstinacy, be put in the charge of one of the cardinals. Urban had them seized, tortured and put to death, "a crime unheard of through the centuries" the chronicler [[Egidio da Viterbo]] remarked.&lt;ref&gt;"scelus nullo antea sæculo auditum" (Egidio da Viterbo, ''Historia viginti sæculorum'') noted Pastor 137 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban's support had dwindled to the northern Italian states, Portugal, England,&lt;ref&gt;In England [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] lost no time in confiscating properties of the French cardinals, and subsequently Richard alone responded to Urban's call for a crusade against Clement in France. (Pastor 134).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], who brought with him the support of most of the princes and abbots of Germany.

On the death of Charles of Naples on 24 February 1386, Urban moved to [[Lucca]] in December of the same year. The Kingdom of Naples was contended between a party favouring his son [[Ladislaus of Naples|Ladislaus]] and [[Louis II of Anjou]]. Urban contrived to take advantage of the anarchy which had ensued (as well as of the presence of the feeble [[Maria, Queen of Sicily|Maria]] as [[Kingdom of Sicily|Queen of Sicily]]) to seize Naples for his nephew [[Francesco Moricotti Prignani]]. In the meantime he was able to have [[Viterbo]] and [[Perugia]] return to the Papal control.

==Injury and death==
In August 1388 Urban moved from Perugia with thousands of troops. To raise funds he had proclaimed a [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee]] to be held in 1390. At the time of the proclamation, only 38 years had elapsed since the previous Jubilee, which was celebrated under [[Pope Clement VI|Clement VI]].&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, Herbert. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08531c.htm "Holy Year of Jubilee"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' Volume 8, 1910. Retrieved on 9 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; During the march, Urban fell from his mule at [[Narni]] and had to recover in early October in Rome, where he was able to oust the communal rule of the ''banderesi'' and restore the Papal authority. He died soon afterwards, likely of injuries caused by the fall, but not without rumors of poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia, "Pope Urban VI".&lt;/ref&gt;  It is noteworthy that during the reconstruction of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], Urban's remains were almost dumped out to be destroyed so his sarcophagus could be used to water horses. The sarcophagus was saved only when church historian [[Giacomo Grimaldi]] arrived and, realizing its importance, ordered it preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reardon|first=Wendy|title=The Death of The Popes|publisher=McFarland Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that planets with complex life, like [[Earth]], are exceptionally rare]]
In [[planetary astronomy]] and [[astrobiology]], the '''Rare Earth hypothesis''' argues that the [[origin of life]] and the [[evolution of biological complexity]] such as [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]], [[multicellular organism]]s on [[Earth]] (and, subsequently, [[human intelligence]]) required an improbable combination of [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] and [[geology|geological]] events and circumstances.

According to the hypothesis, complex [[extraterrestrial life]] is an improbable phenomenon and likely to be rare. The term "Rare Earth" originates from ''[[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe]]'' (2000), a book by [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]], a geologist and paleontologist, and [[Donald E. Brownlee]], an astronomer and astrobiologist, both faculty members at the [[University of Washington]].

A contrary view was argued in the 1970s and 1980s by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], among others. It holds that Earth is a typical [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planet]] in a typical [[planetary system]], located in a non-exceptional region of a common [[barred-spiral galaxy]]. Given the [[principle of mediocrity]] (in the same vein as the [[Copernican principle]]), it is probable that we are typical, and the universe teems with complex life. However, Ward and Brownlee argue that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as the Earth, the [[Solar System]], and our [[Milky Way|galactic]] region are rare.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Requirements for complex life==
{{Life timeline}}
The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the [[evolution of biological complexity]] requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a [[galactic habitable zone]], a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the [[circumstellar habitable zone]], a right-sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a gas giant guardian like Jupiter and a large [[natural satellite]], conditions needed to ensure the planet has a [[magnetosphere]] and [[plate tectonics]], the chemistry of the [[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and oceans, the role of "evolutionary pumps" such as massive [[glaciation]] and rare [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the [[eukaryote]] [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[sexual reproduction]] and the [[Cambrian explosion]] of [[animal]], [[plant]], and [[fungi]] [[phylum|phyla]]. The [[evolution of human intelligence]] may have required yet further events, which are extremely unlikely to have happened were it not for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago removing [[dinosaurs]] as the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.

In order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The [[universe]] is so vast that it could contain many Earth-like planets. But if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of [[light year]]s. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species evolving on such planets, which would solve the [[Fermi paradox]]: "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right location in the right kind of galaxy===
''Rare Earth'' suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, are "dead zones" unable to support complex life. Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the [[galactic habitable zone]], primarily characterized by distance from the [[Galactic Center]]. As that distance increases:
# Star [[metallicity]] declines. Metals (which in astronomy means all elements other than hydrogen and helium) are necessary to the formation of [[terrestrial planets]].
# The [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] radiation from the [[Supermassive black hole|black hole]] at the galactic center, and from nearby [[neutron star]]s, becomes less intense. Thus the early universe, and present-day galactic regions where stellar density is high and [[supernova]]e are common, will be dead zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gravitational perturbation of planets and [[planetesimals]] by nearby stars becomes less likely as the density of stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the Galactic Center or a spiral arm, the less likely it is to be struck by a large [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] which could [[extinction|extinguish]] all complex life on a planet.

Item #1 rules out the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. Hence a galaxy's habitable zone may be a ring sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.

Also, a habitable planetary system must maintain its favorable location long enough for complex life to evolve. A star with an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (elliptic or hyperbolic) galactic orbit will pass through some spiral arms, unfavorable regions of high star density; thus a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular, with a close synchronization between the orbital velocity of the star and of the spiral arms. This further restricts the galactic habitable zone within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center. Lineweaver et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lineweaver |first1=Charles H. |last2=Fenner |first2=Yeshe |last3=Gibson |first3=Brad K. |date=2004 |title=The Galactic Habitable Zone and the Age Distribution of Complex Life in the Milky Way |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/GHZ/GHZ_astroph.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5654 |pages=59–62 |doi=10.1126/science.1092322 |pmid=14704421 |arxiv=astro-ph/0401024 |bibcode=2004Sci...303...59L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712034717/http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/GHZ/GHZ_astroph.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; calculate this zone to be a ring 7 to 9 [[parsec|kiloparsecs]] in radius, including no more than 10% of the stars in the [[Milky Way]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 20 to 40 billion stars. Gonzalez, et al.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{harvnb|Gonzalez|Brownlee|Ward|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; would halve these numbers; they estimate that at most 5% of stars in the Milky Way fall in the galactic habitable zone.

Approximately 77% of observed galaxies are spiral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loveday, J. |date=February 1996 |title=The APM Bright Galaxy Catalogue |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=278 |issue=4 |pages=1025–1048 |bibcode=1996MNRAS.278.1025L |arxiv=astro-ph/9603040 |doi=10.1093/mnras/278.4.1025}}&lt;/ref&gt; two-thirds of all spiral galaxies are barred, and more than half, like the Milky Way, exhibit multiple arms.&lt;ref name="mihalas1968"&gt;{{Cite book |author=D. Mihalas |date=1968 |title=Galactic Astronomy |publisher=W. H. Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-0326-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rare Earth, our own galaxy is unusually quiet and dim (see below), representing just 7% of its kind.&lt;ref name="HammerPuech2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hammer |first1=F. |last2=Puech |first2=M. |last3=Chemin |first3=L. |last4=Flores |first4=H. |last5=Lehnert |first5=M.

Our galaxy also appears unusually favorable in suffering fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, which can cause more supernovae and other disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibling Rivalry |date=31 March 2012 |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328586.500-milky-way-mysteries-andromeda-our-sibling-rival.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Milky Way's central [[black hole]] seems to have neither too much nor too little activity.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with [[Galactic year|a period of 226 Ma]] (million years), closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in [[gravitationally aligned orbits]], so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/55-our-solar-system/the-sun/the-sun-in-the-milky-way/207-how-often-does-the-sun-pass-through-a-spiral-arm-in-the-milky-way-intermediate How often does the Sun pass through a spiral arm in the Milky Way?], Karen Masters, ''Curious About Astronomy''&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbiting at the right distance from the right type of star===
[[File:Estimated extent of the Solar Systems habitable zone.png|thumb|According to the hypothesis, Earth has an improbable orbit in the very narrow habitable zone (dark green) around the Sun.]]
The terrestrial example suggests that complex life requires liquid water, requiring an orbital distance neither too close nor too far from the central star, another scale of [[habitable zone]] or [[Goldilocks Principle]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hart, M.H. |title=Habitable Zones Around Main Sequence Stars |journal=Icarus |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=351–7 |date=January 1979 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(79)90141-6 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103579901416 |bibcode=1979Icar...37..351H}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The habitable zone varies with the star's type and age.

For advanced life, the star must also be highly stable, which is typical of middle star life, about 4.6 billion years old. Proper [[metallicity]] and size are also important to stability. The Sun has a low 0.1% [[solar luminosity|luminosity]] variation. To date no [[Solar analog#Solar twin|solar twin]] star twin, with an exact match of the sun's luminosity variation, has been found, though some come close. The star must have no stellar companions, as in [[Binary star|binary systems]], which would disrupt the orbits of planets. Estimates suggest 50% or more of all star systems are binary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/08jan_sunclimate/ NASA, Science News, Solar Variability and Terrestrial Climate, 8 January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astro.unl.edu"&gt;[http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/stellarprops/stellarlum.html University of Nebraska-Lincoln astronomy education group, Stellar Luminosity Calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nap.edu"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/13519/the-effects-of-solar-variability-on-earths-climate-a-workshop National Center for Atmospheric Research, The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate, 2012 Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/06/05/most-of-earths-twins-arent-identical-or-even-close/ Most of Earth’s twins aren’t identical, or even close!, by Ethan on 5 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The habitable zone for a main sequence star very gradually moves out over its lifespan until it becomes a white dwarf and the habitable zone vanishes.

The liquid water and other gases available in the habitable zone bring the benefit of [[Greenhouse effect|greenhouse warming]]. Even though the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains a water vapor concentration from 0% (in arid regions) to 4% (in rain forest and ocean regions) and – as of February 2018 – only 408.05{{cn|date=February 2018}} parts per million of {{CO2}}, these small amounts suffice to raise the average surface temperature by about 40&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the dominant contribution being due to water vapor, which together with clouds makes up between 66% and 85% of Earth's greenhouse effect, with {{CO2}} contributing between 9% and 26% of the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Schmidt |title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing? |date=6 April 2005 |publisher=RealClimate |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocky planets must orbit within the habitable zone for life to form. Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as [[Sirius]] or [[Vega]] is wide, hot stars also emit much more [[ultraviolet radiation]] that [[ionize]]s any planetary [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. They may become [[red giant]]s before advanced life [[Evolution|evolve]]s on their planets.
These considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see [[stellar classification]]) as homes to evolved [[metazoan life]].

Small [[red dwarf]] stars conversely have small [[habitable zone]]s wherein planets are in [[tidal lock]], with one very hot side always facing the star and another very cold side; and they are also at increased risk of solar flares (see [[Aurelia and Blue Moon#Aurelia|Aurelia]]). Life therefore cannot arise in such systems. Rare Earth proponents claim that only stars from F7 to K1 types are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9%&lt;ref name="RECONS1"&gt;[http://joy.chara.gsu.edu/RECONS/TOP100.posted.htm] The One Hundred Nearest Star Systems, Research Consortium on Nearby Stars.&lt;/ref&gt; of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.

Such aged stars as [[red giant]]s and [[white dwarf]]s are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at a much greater distance [[Red giant#Prospects for habitability|may become habitable]]).

An energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will likely prevent life (e.g., as [[Cepheid variable]]s). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate it and cause a [[greenhouse effect]] that prevents the oceans from reforming.

All known life requires the complex chemistry of [[metallicity|metallic]] elements. The [[absorption spectrum]] of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in [[supernova]] explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large [[spiral galaxy|spirals]], and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs{{vague|date=March 2017}} of the larger spiral galaxies—where radiation also happens to be weak.&lt;ref name="Ward 2000 15–33"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=15–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the right arrangement of planets===
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of the Sun and planets of the Solar System and the sequence of planets. Rare Earth argues that without such an arrangement, in particular the presence of the massive gas giant Jupiter (fifth planet from the Sun and the largest), complex life on Earth would not have arisen.]]
Rare Earth proponents argue that a planetary system capable of sustaining complex life must be structured more or less like the Solar System, with small and rocky inner planets and outer gas giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/08/070827-jupiter-comets_2.html |first=Anne |last=Minard |date=27 August 2007 |title=Jupiter Both an Impact Source and Shield for Earth |accessdate=14 January 2014 |quote=without the long, peaceful periods offered by Jupiter's shield, intelligent life on Earth would never have been able to take hold.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the protection of 'celestial vacuum cleaner' planets with strong gravitational pull, a planet would be subject to more catastrophic asteroid collisions.

Observations of exo-planets have shown that arrangements of planets similar to our Solar System are rare. Most planetary systems have super Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas our Solar System's inner region has only a few small rocky planets and none inside Mercury's orbit. Only 10% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable nearly circular orbits distant from their star. [[Konstantin Batygin]] and colleagues argue that these features can be explained if, early in the history of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn drifted towards the Sun, sending showers of planetesimals towards the super-Earths which sent them spiralling into the Sun, and ferrying icy building blocks into the terrestrial region of the Solar System which provided the building blocks for the rocky planets. The two giant planets then drifted out again to their present position. However, in the view of Batygin and his colleagues: "The concatenation of chance events required for this delicate choreography suggest that small, Earth-like rocky planets – and perhaps life itself – could be rare throughout the cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;Batygin et al., pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===A continuously stable orbit===
Rare Earth argues that a gas giant must not be too close to a body where life is developing. Close placement of gas giant(s) could disrupt the orbit of a potential life-bearing planet, either directly or by drifting into the habitable zone.

Newtonian dynamics can produce [[n-body problem#Three-body problem|chaotic planetary orbits]], especially in a system having [[Jovian planets|large planets]] at high [[orbital eccentricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astro.ku.dk/~tobiash/posters/Tobias_final_new.pdf |format=PDF |title=Chaos and Planet-Particle Dynamics within the Habitable Zone of Extrasolar Planetary Systems (A qualitative numerical stability study) |accessdate=31 October 2007 |last=Hinse |first=T.C. |publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |quote=Main simulation results observed: [1] The presence of high-order mean-motion resonances for large values of giant planet eccentricity [2] Chaos dominated dynamics within the habitable zone(s) at large values of giant planet mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for stable orbits rules out [[Extrasolar planet|stars with systems of planets]] that contain large planets with orbits close to the host star (called "[[hot Jupiters]]"). It is believed that hot Jupiters have migrated inwards to their current orbits. In the process, they would have catastrophically disrupted the orbits of any planets in the habitable zone.&lt;ref&gt;"Once you realize that most of the known extrasolar planets have highly eccentric orbits (like the planets in Upsilon Andromedae), you begin to wonder if there might be something special about our solar system" (UCBerkeleyNews quoting Extra solar planetary researcher Eric Ford.) {{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/04/13_planet.shtml |first=Robert |last=Sanders |date=13 April 2005 |title=Wayward planet knocks extrasolar planets for a loop |accessdate=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To exacerbate matters, hot Jupiters are much more common orbiting F and G class stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm Sol Company, Stars and Habitable Planets, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628175616/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A terrestrial planet of the right size===
[[File:Size planets comparison.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|left|Planets of the Solar System to scale. Rare Earth argues that complex life cannot exist on large gaseous planets like Jupiter and Saturn (top row) or Uranus and Neptune (top middle) or smaller planets such as Mars and Mercury]]
It is argued that life requires terrestrial planets like Earth and as gas giants lack such a surface, that complex life cannot arise there.&lt;ref&gt;Ward &amp; Brownlee pg 220&lt;/ref&gt;

A planet that is too small cannot hold much atmosphere, making surface temperature low and variable and oceans impossible. A small planet will also tend to have a rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and [[plate tectonics]] may be brief or entirely absent. A planet that is too large will retain too dense an atmosphere like [[Venus]]. Although Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, its surface atmospheric pressure is 92 times that of Earth, and surface temperature of 735 K (462&amp;nbsp;°C; 863&amp;nbsp;°F). Earth had a similar early atmosphere to Venus, but may have lost it in the [[Giant-impact hypothesis|giant impact event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lissauer|1999}}, as summarized by {{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|p=92}}; also see {{harvnb|Comins|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With plate tectonics===

Rare Earth proponents argue that [[plate tectonics]] and a strong [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field]] are essential for  [[biodiversity]], [[global temperature regulation]], and the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lack of [[mountain chain]]s elsewhere in the Solar System is direct evidence that Earth is the only body with plate tectonics, and thus the only nearby body capable of supporting life.&lt;ref&gt; {{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics depend on the right chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat from [[radioactive decay]]. Continents must be made of less dense [[felsic]] rocks that "float" on underlying denser [[mafic]] rock. Taylor&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; emphasizes that tectonic [[subduction]] zones require the lubrication of oceans of water. Plate tectonics also provides a means of [[Biogeochemical cycle|biochemical cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/4076-plate-tectonics-essential-alien-life.html Plate Tectonics Could Be Essential for Alien Life], By Lee Pullen, Astrobiology Magazine, February 19, 2009, SPACE.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics and as a result [[continental drift]] and the creation of separate land masses would create diversified [[ecosystem]]s and [[biodiversity]], one of the strongest defences against extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Ward, R. D. &amp; Brownlee, D.}} 2000. ''[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geophys/platelif.html Plate tectonics essential for complex evolution]'' - [[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth]] - [[Copernicus Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of species diversification and later competition on Earth's continents is the [[Great American Interchange]]. North and Middle America drifted into [[South America]] at around 3.5 to 3 Ma. The [[fauna]] of South America evolved separately for about 30 million years, since [[Antarctica]] separated. Many species were subsequently wiped out in mainly South America by competing [[North America|Northern American]] animals.

===A large moon===
[[File:Porto Covo February 2009-2.jpg|thumb|left|Tide pools resulting from tidal interaction of the Moon are said to have promoted the evolution of complex life.]]
The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]), or only tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids ([[Mars]]).

The [[Giant-impact hypothesis|Giant-impact theory]] hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a [[Mars]]-sized body, dubbed [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its [[axial tilt]]  (inclination) and velocity of rotation.&lt;ref name=Taylor98&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes [[photosynthesis]] viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rotation-summer-solstice/ scientificamerican.com, Fact or Fiction: The Days (and Nights) Are Getting Longer, By Adam Hadhazy, 14 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rare Earth'' hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]). A planet with a large tilt will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In this view, the Earth's tilt is "just right". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the [[precession|variation in tilt]] would be [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], probably making complex life forms on land impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Earth had no Moon, the ocean [[tide]]s resulting solely from the Sun's gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to [[tidal pool]]s, which may be essential for the formation of [[macromolecule|complex life]], though this is far from certain.&lt;ref&gt;A formal description of the hypothesis is given in: {{Cite journal |last=Lathe |first=Richard |date=March 2004 |title=Fast tidal cycling and the origin of life |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=168 |issue=1 |pages=18–22 |quote=tidal cycling, resembling the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mechanism, could only replicate and amplify DNA-like polymers. This mechanism suggests constraints on the evolution of extra-terrestrial life. |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2003.10.018 |bibcode=2004Icar..168...18L |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910350300383X}} It is taught less formally here: {{Cite web |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec25.html |title=Origin of Life |accessdate=31 October 2007 |first=James |last=Schombert |publisher=University of Oregon |quote=with the vastness of the Earth's oceans it is statistically very improbable that these early proteins would ever link up. The solution is that the huge tides from the Moon produced inland tidal pools, which would fill and evaporate on a regular basis to produce high concentrations of amino acids.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large satellite also increases the likelihood of [[plate tectonics]] through the effect of [[tidal force]]s on the planet's crust.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the [[continental crust]] would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for [[oceanic crust]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It is possible that the large scale [[mantle convection]] needed to drive plate tectonics could not have emerged in the absence of crustal inhomogeneity. A further theory indicates that such a large moon may also contribute to maintaining a planet's magnetic shield by continually acting upon a metallic planetary core as dynamo, thus protecting the surface of the planet from charged particles and cosmic rays, and helping to ensure the atmosphere is not stripped over time by solar winds.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|right|Earth's atmosphere]]

===Atmosphere===
A terrestrial planet of the right size is needed to retain an atmosphere, like Earth and Venus. On Earth, once the giant impact of [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] thinned [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], other events were needed to make the atmosphere capable of sustaining life. The [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] reseeded Earth with water lost after the impact of Theia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/27969-earth-water-from-asteroids-not-comets.html Space.com, Most of Earth's Water Came from Asteroids, Not Comets, By Charles Q.

===One or more evolutionary triggers for complex life===
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates the ''twofold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation]]
Regardless of whether planets with similar physical attributes to the Earth are rare or not, some argue that life usually remains simple bacteria. Biochemist [[Nick Lane]] argues that simple cells ([[prokaryote]]s) emerged soon after Earth's formation, but since almost half the planet's life had passed before they evolved into complex ones ([[eukaryote]]s) all of whom share a [[common ancestor]], this event can only have happened once. In some views, [[prokaryote]]s lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available; two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into [[mitochondria]] that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is that mitochondria evolution was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria-containing organisms appeared soon after the first traces of atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, W. &amp; Mentel, M. (2010)[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-mitochondria-14232356# The Origin of Mitochondria. Nature Education] 3(9):58&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution and persistence of [[evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]] is another mystery in biology. The purpose of [[sexual reproduction]] is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to [[asexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mating type]]s (types of [[gamete]]s, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of [[anisogamy]] (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy.&lt;ref&gt;T. Togashi, P. Cox (Eds.) ''The Evolution of Anisogamy''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 2011, p. 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 25 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary [[mating system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Czárán |first1=T.L. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=R.F. |year=2006 |title=Evolution of sexual asymmetry |url=|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=4 |issue=|pages=34–46 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-34|pmid=15383154 |pmc=524165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism. [[Charles Darwin]] was the first to suggest that [[sexual selection]] drives [[speciation]]; without it, complex life would probably not have evolved.

===The right time in evolution===
[[File:Timeline evolution of life.svg|left|thumb|Timeline of evolution; [[History of writing|human writings]] exists for only 0.000218% of Earth's history.]] 
While life on Earth is regarded to have spawned relatively early in the planet's history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~ulm/papers/ECh7.pdf 800 million years for complex organ evolution] - [[Heidelberg University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years and radio communication reaching space has existed for less than 100 years. Relative to the age of the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a short time, in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes, and large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic mass extinction]], caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] ago. About 65 million years ago, the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (~65.5 Ma) on the [[Yucatán peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.

If there were intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations able to make contact with distant Earth, they would have to live in the same 12Ka period of the 800Ma evolution of life.

==Rare Earth equation==
The following discussion is adapted from Cramer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cramer|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rare Earth equation is Ward and Brownlee's [[riposte]] to the [[Drake equation]]. It calculates &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way having complex life forms, as:
[[File:Pikaia gracilens B.jpg|thumb|upright|According to Rare Earth, the Cambrian explosion that saw extreme diversification of [[chordata]] from simple forms like Pikaia (pictured) was an improbable event]]
:&lt;math&gt;N=N^* \cdot n_e \cdot f_g \cdot f_p \cdot f_{pm} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot f_l \cdot f_m \cdot f_j \cdot f_{me}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=271–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
* ''N*'' is the number of stars in the [[Milky Way]]. This number is not well-estimated, because the Milky Way's mass is not well estimated, with little information about the number of small stars. ''N*'' is at least 100 billion, and may be as high as 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.
* &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the average number of planets in a star's habitable zone. This zone is fairly narrow, because constrained by the requirement that the average planetary temperature be consistent with water remaining liquid throughout the time required for complex life to evolve. Thus &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;=1 is a likely upper bound.
We assume &lt;math&gt;N^* \cdot n_e=5\cdot10^{11}&lt;/math&gt;. The Rare Earth hypothesis can then be viewed as asserting that the product of the other nine Rare Earth equation factors listed below, which are all fractions, is no greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; and could plausibly be as small as 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. In the latter case, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; could be as small as 0 or 1. Ward and Brownlee do not actually calculate the value of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, because the numerical values of quite a few of the factors below can only be conjectured. They cannot be estimated simply because [[Anthropic principle|we have but one data point]]: the Earth, a rocky planet orbiting a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G2]] star in a quiet suburb of a large [[barred spiral galaxy]], and the home of the only intelligent species we know, namely ourselves.
* &lt;math&gt;f_g&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the galactic habitable zone (Ward, Brownlee, and Gonzalez estimate this factor as 0.1&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt;).
* &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the [[Milky Way]] with planets.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{pm}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets that are rocky ("metallic") rather than gaseous.
* &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets where microbial life arises. Ward and Brownlee believe this fraction is unlikely to be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets where complex life evolves. For 80% of the time since microbial life first appeared on the Earth, there was only bacterial life. Hence Ward and Brownlee argue that this fraction may be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_l&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the total lifespan of a planet during which complex life is present. Complex life cannot endure indefinitely, because the energy put out by the sort of star that allows complex life to emerge gradually rises, and the central star eventually becomes a [[red giant]], engulfing all planets in the planetary habitable zone. Also, given enough time, a catastrophic extinction of all complex life becomes ever more likely.
* &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets with a large moon. If the [[giant impact theory]] of the Moon's origin is correct, this fraction is small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planetary systems with large Jovian planets. This fraction could be large.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{me}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets with a sufficiently low number of extinction events. Ward and Brownlee argue that the low number of such events the Earth has experienced since the [[Cambrian explosion]] may be unusual, in which case this fraction would be small.

The Rare Earth equation, unlike the [[Drake equation]], does not factor the probability that complex life evolves into [[intelligence|intelligent life]] that discovers technology (Ward and Brownlee are not [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]]). Barrow and Tipler&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}} Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; review the consensus among such biologists that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian [[chordate]]s, e.g., ''[[Pikaia]]'' to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', was a highly improbable event. For example, the large [[brain]]s of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive [[metabolism]], a long [[gestation period]], and a childhood lasting more than 25% of the average total life span. Other improbable features of humans include:
*Being one of a handful of extant [[bipedal]] land (non-avian) [[vertebrate]]. Combined with an unusual [[eye–hand coordination]], this permits dextrous manipulations of the physical environment with the [[hand]]s;
*A [[vocal folds|vocal apparatus]] far more expressive{{citation needed|reason=What about dolphins? Their ability to communicate complex ideas is indisputable. Also, dolphins clearly have culture.|date=August 2016}} than that of any other mammal, enabling [[speech]]. Speech makes it possible for humans to interact cooperatively, to share knowledge, and to acquire a culture;
*The capability of formulating [[abstraction]]s to a degree permitting the invention of [[mathematics]], and the discovery of [[science]] and [[technology]]. Only recently did humans acquire anything like their current scientific and technological sophistication.

==Advocates==
Writers who support the Rare Earth hypothesis:
* [[Stuart Ross Taylor]],&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; a specialist on the Solar System, firmly believes in the hypothesis. Taylor concludes that the Solar System is probably unusual, because it resulted from so many chance factors and events.
* Stephen Webb,&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"/&gt; a physicist, mainly presents and rejects candidate solutions for the [[Fermi paradox]]. The Rare Earth hypothesis emerges as one of the few solutions left standing by the end of the book.
* [[Simon Conway Morris]], a [[paleontologist]], endorses the Rare Earth hypothesis in chapter 5 of his ''Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|loc=Ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites Ward and Brownlee's book with approval.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Morris, 2003, p. 344, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]] (1986. 3.2, 8.7, 9), [[cosmologist]]s, vigorously defend the hypothesis that humans are likely to be the only intelligent life in the [[Milky Way]], and perhaps the entire universe. But this hypothesis is not central to their book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', a thorough study of the [[anthropic principle]] and of how the laws of physics are peculiarly suited to enable the emergence of complexity in nature.
* [[Ray Kurzweil]], a computer pioneer and self-proclaimed [[Singularitarian]], argues in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that the coming [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] requires that Earth be the first planet on which sentient, technology-using life evolved. Although other Earth-like planets could exist, Earth must be the most evolutionarily advanced, because otherwise we would have seen evidence that another culture had experienced the [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] and expanded to harness the full computational capacity of the physical universe.

=={{anchor|Criticism}}Criticism==
Cases against the Rare Earth Hypothesis take various forms.

===Anthropic reasoning===
The hypothesis concludes, more or less, that complex life is rare because it can evolve only on the surface of an Earth-like planet or on a suitable satellite of a planet. Some biologists, such as [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], believe this assumption too restrictive and unimaginative; they see it as a form of [[begging the question|circular reasoning]].

According to [[David Darling (astronomer)|David Darling]], the Rare Earth hypothesis is neither [[hypothesis]] nor [[prediction]], but merely a description of how life arose on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view Ward and Brownlee have done nothing more than select the factors that best suit their case.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What matters is not whether there's anything unusual about the Earth; there's going to be something [[idiosyncratic]] about every planet in space. What matters is whether any of Earth's circumstances are not only unusual but also essential for complex life. So far we've seen nothing to suggest there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics also argue that there is a link between the Rare Earth Hypothesis and the [[creationist]] ideas of [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Kendrick. 'Was the 'Rare Earth' Hypothesis Influenced by a Creationist?' The Skeptical Inquirer. 1 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exoplanets around main sequence stars are being discovered in large numbers===
{{see also|Estimated frequency of Earth-like planets}}
An increasing number of [[extrasolar planet]] discoveries are being made with {{Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} planets in {{Extrasolar planet counts|system_count}} planetary systems known as of {{Extrasolar planet counts|asof}}.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare Earth proponents argue life cannot arise outside Sun-like systems.

===Plate tectonics may not be unique to Earth or a requirement for complex life===

Ward and Brownlee argue that for complex life to evolve (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;), [[tectonics]] must be present to generate [[biogeochemical cycles]], and predicted that such geological features would not be found outside of Earth, pointing to a lack of observable mountain ranges and [[orogenic|subduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no scientific consensus on the evolution of plate tectonics on Earth.

NASA scientists Hartman and McKay argue that plate tectonics may in fact slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it).&lt;ref&gt;Hartman H, McKay CP "Oxygenic photosynthesis and the oxidation state of Mars." Planet Space Sci. 1995 Jan-Feb;43(1-2):123-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen from the effects of complex life's emergence, rather than the other way around as the Rare Earth might suggest. The action of lichens on rock may have contributed to the formation of subduction zones in the presence of water.&lt;ref name=Choi2014&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Does a Planet Need Life to Create Continents?

====A magnetic field may not be a requirement====
The importance of Earth's magnetic field to the development of complex life has been disputed. Kasting argues that the atmosphere provides sufficient protection against cosmic rays even during times of magnetic pole reversal and atmosphere loss by sputtering.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Kasting also dismisses the role of the magnetic field in the evolution of eukaryotes, citing the age of the oldest known [[magnetofossils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|2001|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A large moon may neither be rare nor necessary===
The requirement of a large moon (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt;) has also been challenged. Even if it were required, such an occurrence may not be as unique as predicted by the Rare Earth Hypothesis. Recent work by [[Edward Belbruno]] and [[J. Richard Gott]] of Princeton University suggests that giant impactors such as those that may have formed the [[Moon]] can indeed form in planetary [[trojan points]] ({{L4}} or {{L5}} [[Lagrangian point]]) which means that similar circumstances may occur in other planetary systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=E. |last=Belbruno |author2=J. Richard Gott III |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=1724–45 |date=2005 |title=Where Did The Moon Come From? |arxiv=astro-ph/0405372 |doi=10.1086/427539 |bibcode=2005AJ....129.1724B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Collision between two planetary bodies (artist concept).]]

Rare Earth's assertion that the Moon's stabilization of Earth's obliquity and spin is a requirement for complex life has been questioned. Kasting argues that a moonless Earth would still possess habitats with climates suitable for complex life and questions whether the spin rate of a moonless Earth can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Although the [[giant impact theory]] posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth's rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly "[[Tidal deceleration#Tidal deceleration|stolen]]" much of this speed to reduce Earth's solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth's solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes (the same as Mars's solar day); in 1 billion years, 30 hours 23 minutes. Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like Earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) causes high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) cause the day and night temperatures to be too extreme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/earth/what-would-happen-if-our-planet-became-tidally-locked-130202.htm discovery.com What If Earth Became Tidally Locked? 2 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Rare Earth proponents argue that the Earth's plate tectonics would probably not exist if not for the tidal forces of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Ward &amp; Brownlee 2000, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nick |first=Hoffman |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-01x1.html |title=The Moon And Plate Tectonics: Why We Are Alone |work=Space Daily |date=11 June 2001 |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that the Moon's tidal influence initiated or sustained Earth's plate tectonics remains unproven, though at least one study implies a temporal correlation to the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref name="TurnerRushmer2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=S. |last2=Rushmer |first2=T. |last3=Reagan |first3=M. |last4=Moyen |first4=J.-F. |title=Heading down early on?

Kasting argues that a large moon is not required to initiate plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt;

===Complex life may arise in alternative habitats===
[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Complex life may exist in environments similar to [[black smoker]]s on Earth.]]
{{see also|Hypothetical types of biochemistry}}
Rare Earth proponents argue that simple life may be common, though complex life requires specific environmental conditions to arise. Critics consider life could arise on a [[natural satellite|moon]] of a gas giant, though this is less likely if life requires volcanicity. The moon must have stresses to induce tidal heating, but not so dramatic as seen on Jupiter's Io. However, the moon is within the gas giant's intense radiation belts, sterilizing any biodiversity before it can get established. [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] disputes this, hypothesizing alternative biochemistries for alien life.&lt;ref name="Schulze-MakuchIrwin2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dirk Schulze-Makuch |author2=Louis Neal Irwin |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdjoTGAvrkkC&amp;pg=PA1 |date=2 October 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-540-76816-6 |pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Rare Earth proponents argue that only microbial extremophiles could exist in subsurface habitats beyond Earth, some argue that complex life can also arise in these environments. Examples of extremophile animals such as the ''[[Hesiocaeca methanicola]]'', an animal that inhabits ocean floor [[methane clathrate]]s substances more commonly found in the outer Solar System, the [[tardigrade]]s which can survive in the vacuum of space&lt;ref name="NYT-20150907"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dean |first=Cornelia |title=The Tardigrade: Practically Invisible, Indestructible ‘Water Bears’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/science/the-tardigrade-water-bear.html |date=7 September 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Halicephalobus mephisto]]'' which exists in crushing pressure, scorching temperatures and extremely low oxygen levels 3.6 kilometres deep in the Earth's crust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110601-deepest-worm-earth-devil-science-animals-life/ |title=New "Devil Worm" Is Deepest-Living Animal Species evolved to withstand heat and crushing pressure |last1=Mosher |first1=Dave |date=2 June 2011 |website=National Geographic News |publisher=|access-date=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes cited by critics as complex life capable of thriving in "alien" environments.

The '''Reavers''' are a [[fiction]]al [[team]] of criminal [[cyborg]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The most significant team of Reavers were dedicated to the destruction of the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[X-Men]], and a number of them especially wanted to take revenge on one particular X-Man, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. The name was originally used by a gang of [[Australia]]n cyborgs. The name later referred to a group under the leadership of [[Donald Pierce]], consisting of the three survivors from the original Reavers along with other cyborgs.

These Reavers should not be confused with the Reavers of the planet Arcturus IV, who exist in the future of the alternate reality [[Earth-691]] and are involved in the histories of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] members [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] and [[Aleta Ogord|Aleta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Presents'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The Reavers first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #229 and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Marc Silvestri]].

==Fictional group history==

===Looters===
The first group of cyborgs calling themselves the Reavers operated out of an underground complex beneath the [[ghost town]] of Cooterman's Creek in North Central Australia. The Reavers acted as a commando-style team of thieves, with apparently dozens of members. Their base was inexplicably equipped with advanced computers and a sub-basement and tunnel system. The Reavers coerced the mutant teleporter [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]] to teleport them from Australia to locations around the world to conduct their robberies. Informed of the Reavers' existence by [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], the X-Men defeat the Reavers in battle and expel them from their base, which they then co-opt for their own use. The X-Men destroy some of the Reavers and force most of the rest to enter the mystical [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] to meet unrevealed fates. Only [[Pretty Boy (comics)|Pretty Boy]], [[Skullbuster]], and [[Bonebreaker]] escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #229 (May 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Pierce's Reavers===
The Reavers are reassembled under the leadership of Donald Pierce, who reorganizes the team as an assassination squadron to undertake para-military style commando operations, dedicated to taking vengeance on the X-Men in particular and eliminating mutants in general. Pierce combines the three survivors of the original Reavers with [[Lady Deathstrike]] and the three former Hellfire Club mercenaries Cole, [[Angelo Macon|Macon]], and Reese.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #247-249&lt;/ref&gt; No explanation is given for why Pretty Boy, Skullbuster, and Bonebreaker came to be involved with the group, aside from Pierce claiming to have created the original Reavers.&lt;ref name="UK251"&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #251 (November 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Deathstrike's reasons for joining the Reavers are even more unclear, as she professes a lack of interest in their goal of eliminating mutants.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #249 (October 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the X-Men are away from their Australian base, the Reavers retake the ghost town and wait for the team to come back. However, on their return the X-Men escape the Reavers through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]]. Only Wolverine, who is on a leave of absence in [[Madripoor]], remains. Once he returns, they capture him, and proceed to torture and [[crucify]] him.&lt;ref name="UK251"/&gt; Wolverine escapes the Reavers with the aid of [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. The Reavers then attack the [[Muir Island]] Mutant Research Center, theorizing that it is Wolverine's most likely destination. They fight [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] and [[Moira MacTaggart]]'s alternate X-Men team, and kill [[Stonewall (comics)|Stonewall]] and [[Sunder (comics)|Sunder]]. During the assault on Muir Island, Skullbuster is rendered inoperative by sniper fire from [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #252-255&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Pierce rescues a gravely wounded pilot named [[Skullbuster#Cylla Markham Skullbuster II|Cylla Markham]], who agrees to be converted into a cyborg.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #261&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, Bonebreaker, Reese, and Pretty Boy are dispatched to a New York warehouse after [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]], an associate of the [[Punisher]], in a self-confessed mistake, infiltrates their computer system. The temporary absence of Gateway gives Punisher and Microchip enough time to evacuate and set up resistance. The warehouse is destroyed, but the two escape through the sewer.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher'', volume 2, #33&lt;/ref&gt; The Reavers face off against the Punisher again. In the firefight, the Reavers kill Microchip's cousin. The Punisher sets off auto-destruct charges which cause heavy damage to the three Reavers, particularly Bonebreaker, whose cybernetic lower body is demolished. The Reavers retreat.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher'', volume 2, #34&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reavers then successfully attack the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]]'s company, Frost Technotics.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #262&lt;/ref&gt; They capture [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who has returned from inside the Siege Perilous, although Rogue is then rescued by a recreation of [[Ms. Marvel]]. Donald Pierce transforms Cylla Markham into the new Skullbuster (although she usually goes by the name Cylla).&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #269&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Deathstrike later seeks Wolverine in Madripoor and Vancouver. Pierce creates an android named [[Elsie-Dee]] and a Wolverine android double named "[[Albert (comics)|Albert]]" to kill Wolverine. The attempt fails, however, when Elsie-Dee rebels against her programming.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #35-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upstarts and humans===
As part of the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]' game, [[Trevor Fitzroy]] dispatches his own [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] to the Reavers' Australian hideout to kill Pierce and anyone else they find there. In the ensuing battle, only Pierce, Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape the massacre, Pierce seemingly only making it as far as the Hellfire Club before he is "killed".&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #281-282&lt;/ref&gt; Cylla later resurfaces, allying herself with [[Bloodscream]] in an attempt to murder Wolverine.  However, Bloodscream betrays her and sucks the life from her, killing her.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most Reavers somehow survive their supposed deaths. They later return to battle the [[X-Treme X-Men]] on behalf of the [[Shadow King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Chris Claremont]]|penciller=[[Salvador Larroca]]|story=Queen of Shadows|title=[[X-Treme X-Men]] 2001 Annual|issue=|date=2001|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Pierce puts together a new group of Reavers, composed of young anti-[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] humans (with the exception of [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], who at the time was unaware that he was a mutant).&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #5 (November 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; They are defeated by [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], Elixir, and a handful of young mutants.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #6 (December 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The group later breaks Pierce out of prison, but with Elixir as bait, they are lured into an ambush and captured by the same five mutants who stopped Pierce when he first betrayed the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #13 (August 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Messiah Complex===
[[Image:The New Reavers.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The latest incarnation of the Reavers in Messiah Complex by [[Humberto Ramos]].]]
The Reavers return to play a role in the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]] event, under the leadership of Lady Deathstrike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/articles/827/827571p7.html IGN: X-Men: Messiah Complex - Day Thirteen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Judging from the design of their costumes, as well as their rhetoric in battle, these newest Reavers are simply existing members of the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] upgraded with cybernetics rather than classic members of the team.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Deployed as an elite commando unit designed to eliminate organized mutant resistance, the Reavers manage to track down and confront Cable in Alberta, Canada before being attacked by the new X-Force.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #44-46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing battle, Deathstrike and the Reavers are all terminated by Wolverine's strike team, but not before killing the mutant [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] and injuring [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. To this date only Deathstrike's fate was revealed and it remains to be seen whether the Purifiers will be able to upgrade more of their fighters with Reaver technology to replace the ones lost in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #504&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cable and X-Force===
The Reavers play a small role in ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'' - Volume 4. Pretty Boy, Bonebreaker, Skullbuster (female), and Skullbuster (male) are quickly dispatched by Hope Summers and Cable before being able to deploy an ICBM.{{issue|date=April 2016}}

===Hunt for Wolverine===
Donald Pierce later leads a new group of Reavers, composed of Star and Shine whom together go by the Starshine moniker, Pretty Boy, Skullbuster (Cylla Markham) and Bonebreaker. They were able to find the place where the X-Men had hidden Wolverine's metal-encased body until they were found by an X-Men. During the battle, Wolverine's adamantium shell was broken and to the Reavers surprise it was empty. The X-Men eventually defeated the Reavers and delivered them to Alpha Flight. Only Starshine was able to evade capture and contacted Lady Deathstrike about their findings.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunt for Wolverine'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Capitol Building at night Jan 2006.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[United States Capitol]], one of many places in Washington said to be haunted]]
There are a number of reportedly haunted locations in [[Washington, D.C.]] The city is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the United States, and was founded (pursuant to an [[Act of Congress]]) on July 16, 1790. The City of Washington was originally a separate municipality within the Territory of Columbia until an act of Congress in 1871 effectively merged George Town, the City of Washington, and the Territory of Columbia into a single entity called the District of Columbia. Washington, D.C., has been the site of military battles, deadly duels, assassinations, untimely deaths, and associated tragedies.
{{Paranormal |state=collapsed}}
Washington's haunted history is so well known that some of its haunted locations were featured in a 2006 documentary, ''America's Haunted Houses,'' on the [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E cable network]]. Novelist [[Dan Brown]] mentioned them prominently in his 2009 novel, ''[[The Lost Symbol]]''. Notable purportedly haunted locations include the [[United States Capitol]], [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]], the [[White House]], [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] and nearby buildings, [[Independence Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Independence Avenue SW]], [[The Octagon House]], [[Chinatown, Washington, D.C.|Chinatown]], the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]], [[Hay–Adams Hotel]], [[Woodrow Wilson House (Washington, D.C.)|Woodrow Wilson House]], [[Omni Shoreham Hotel]], and many others.

The [[United States Capitol]] is reputedly haunted by many past representatives of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and government officials, officers who served during the [[American Revolutionary War]], workers who died during its construction and a "demon black cat" that is said to make appearances just before national tragedies or changes in Presidential administration. A very high number of apparitions of deceased [[Presidents of the United States|American presidents]] have been reported in the White House, the most famous of which is [[Abraham Lincoln]], reported even by later presidents such as [[Harry S. Truman]], and apparitions of presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[John Tyler]] have all been witnessed, as have the spirits of many [[First Lady of the United States|First Ladies]].

The President's Park, Lafayette Park, and nearby buildings are reported to be home to ghosts such as [[Philip Barton Key II]] and [[Stephen Decatur]] who died there following pistol duels. The Octagon is supposedly one of the most haunted buildings in D.C., with sightings of its past occupants and African American slaves who once worked there. [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|The National Theatre]] is said to be haunted by the ghost of actor John McCullough, who was murdered in the 1880s by a fellow thespian. Hay–Adams Hotel is claimed to be host to the ghost of [[Marian Hooper Adams|Marian "Clover" Hooper Adams]], the wife of [[Henry Brooks Adams]], the celebrated 19th-century American journalist, historian and novelist, who was the grandson of [[John Quincy Adams]], and the Woodrow Wilson House  is allegedly haunted by former president [[Woodrow Wilson]] himself who spent his final years in illness there before dying in his bedroom in 1924.  Houses in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] area of the city are reported to be haunted by figures from colonial times, including slaves, merchants and children. Staff and guests of the Omni Shoreham Hotel have told of stories of faint voices, cold breezes, and doors slamming shut and opening and televisions and lights turning on and off of their own accord.

==Capitol Hill==

===The Capitol===
The [[United States Capitol]] is considered one of the most haunted buildings in Washington.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wvxJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false French, Joseph Lewis.

''Ghosts: Washington's Most Famous Ghost Stories.'' Arlington, Va.: The Washington Book Trading Co., 1988. {{ISBN|978-0-91516807-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several spirits are said to haunt the Capitol due to tragedies associated with its construction. One such ghost is said to be that of a worker who died after a fall during the construction of the rotunda, and who now is occasionally seen floating beneath the dome carrying a tray of woodworking tools.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt; Another spirit is allegedly a [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]] who died (crushed to death beneath a wall which collapsed, or murdered by a co-worker) and is seen in the Old Senate chambers or passing through a wall in the basement beneath the Senate.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;Norman, Michael and Scott, Beth.

[[File:National Statuary Hall Collection.jpg|thumb|National Statuary Hall, said to be haunted by a number of former members of Congress]]
Many politicians with strong personalities and a powerful attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Joseph Gurney Cannon|Joseph Cannon]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Illinois|Ill.]] and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. [[Champ Clark]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Missouri|Mo.]] and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] after midnight and, after a loud rap from a [[gavel]], resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt; Members of the [[United States Capitol Police]] have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]]) [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] sitting at a desk in [[National Statuary Hall]], although it has not been used as a legislative chamber since 1857.&lt;ref name="GhostTown" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bardes, Barbara A.; Shelley, Mack C.; and [[Steffen Schmidt|Schmidt, Steffen W.]] ''American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials.'' 15th ed. Florence, Ky.: Cengage Learning, 2008. {{ISBN|0-495-57170-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the [[United States Capitol Historical Society]], says he has seen the ghost of former Representative [[Wilbur Mills]] (D-[[Arkansas|Ark.]]) near Mills' former office late at night.&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;[http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_5/ath/36682-1.html Jordan, Elizabeth. "Ghosts Wander the Hill."] ''[[Roll Call]].'' July 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]], although not a politician, was a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Major (United States)|Major]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] who served with [[George Washington]] at [[Valley Forge]].&lt;ref name="Jusserand"&gt;Jusserand, Jean Jules.

Washington, D.C.: George Washington University, 2002. OCLC 51037796&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="Jusserand" /&gt; Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him.&lt;ref name="Jusserand" /&gt; L'Enfant spent much of the rest of his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825.&lt;ref name="Jusserand" /&gt; Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked under his arm.&lt;ref name="Fishbait"&gt;Miller, William and Leighton, Frances Spatz.

The Capitol has also been witness to murder and death. Rep. [[William P. Taulbee]] had been a congressman from [[Kentucky]] from 1884 to 1888.&lt;ref name="Clerk"&gt;[http://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/35553 Office of the Clerk.

Not all Capitol hauntings are related to people who worked there. The "[[Demon Cat]]" is alleged to prowl the halls of Congress, and make appearances just before a national tragedy or change in Presidential administration.&lt;ref name="Rainbolt"&gt;Rainbolt, Dusty.

A few eyewitnesses have claimed that whenever an individual [[Lying in state|lies in state]] in the Capitol Rotunda, a World War I [[doughboy]] momentarily appears, salutes, then disappears.&lt;ref name="Hauck" /&gt; A second apparition, which eyewitnesses say is the ghost of an American Revolutionary War soldier, has also appeared at the Washington Tomb.

===Capitol Hill===
[[File:SilentDrillPlatoon-1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Commandant's House at the Marine Corps Barracks, allegedly haunted by the ghost of the first Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps]]
[[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] is one of the largest and most densely populated neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. It is bounded by F Street NE on the north and [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Southeast/Southwest Freeway]] on the south. The U.S. Capitol marks its western boundary, while the [[Anacostia River]] is its eastern limit. Although Capitol Hill has been home to many of the city's powerful, its hauntings appear to be few. One ghost, however, is said to haunt First Street NE. [[Joseph Holt]] was [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|Judge Advocate General]] of the [[United States Army]] from 1862 to 1875.&lt;ref name="Holt"&gt;"Holt, Joseph (1804–1894)."

Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2001. {{ISBN|1-57607-030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presided over the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators]].&lt;ref name="Holt" /&gt; During the trials, accused conspirators Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]] (who treated [[John Wilkes Booth]]'s broken leg) and [[Mary Surratt]] (at whose downtown [[Mary E. Surratt Boarding House|boarding house]] the conspirators met) were held at the [[Old Capitol Prison]] opposite the U.S. Capitol (the modern day [[United States Supreme Court Building]] stands on the site today).&lt;ref&gt;Green, Constance M.

Capitol Hill's other hauntings are associated with the two military installations in that part of the city. At the official residence of the Commandant of the [[Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.|Marine Corps Barracks and Parade Ground]] on 8th Street SE, there are stories which talk about rustling papers, the sound of a man pacing, and the appearance of the ghostly image of [[Samuel Nicholas]], the first [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name="Caggiula"&gt;Caggiula, Samuel M.; Brackett, Beverly; and King, Gilbert.

''Round-Shot to Rockets: A History of the Washington Navy Yard and U.S. Naval Gun Factory.'' Annapolis: United States Naval Institute, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents and press reports also tell stories about "Old Howard," a cantankerous former U.S. Marine who lived in the 1860s in a two-story house between G and I Streets SE who now haunts it, harassing the occupants and acting much like a [[poltergeist]].&lt;ref name="Hauck" /&gt;

==White House and President's Park==

===White House===
[[File:WHClintonEastroom.jpg|thumb|The East Room of the White House, where Abigail Adams once hung her laundry and where her spirit may still appear]]
The [[White House]] is the oldest building on [[President's Park]]. An integral part of the planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800.&lt;ref name="Whitcomb"&gt;Whitcomb, Claire.

====Abraham Lincoln====
[[File:Abraham Lincoln head on shoulders photo portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Abraham Lincoln]]
{{main|Lincoln's Ghost}}
The White House's most famous alleged apparition is that of Abraham Lincoln. [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House.&lt;ref name="Pederson" /&gt; Mrs. Roosevelt also said that the family dog, [[Fala (dog)|Fala]], would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost.&lt;ref name="Ogden" /&gt; President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s press secretary, [[James Hagerty]],&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt; and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady [[Lady Bird Johnson]],&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the [[Lincoln Bedroom]].&lt;ref name="Ogden" /&gt; As reputable an eyewitness as [[Lillian Rogers Parks]] admitted in her autobiography ''[[My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House]]'' that she had heard them.&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;Parks, Lillian Rogers. ''My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House.'' New York: Fleet Publishing Corp., 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Truman]], daughter of President [[Harry S. Truman]], said she heard a specter rapping at the door of the Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom.&lt;ref name="Thomsen" /&gt; Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Grace Coolidge]], who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the [[Yellow Oval Room]] staring out at the Potomac.&lt;ref name="Ogden" /&gt; [[Winston Churchill]],&lt;ref&gt;Garber, Marjorie B. ''Profiling Shakespeare.'' Florence, Ky.: Routledge, 2008. {{ISBN|0-415-96446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Roosevelt,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Merrill D. ''Lincoln in American Memory.'' Reprint ed. New York: Oxford University Press US, 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-509645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maureen Reagan]] and her husband&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Maureen. ''First Father, First Daughter: A Memoir.'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2001. {{ISBN|0-316-73636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt administration]] claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit,&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt; Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] of [[The Netherlands]] heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted).&lt;ref name="Belanger"&gt;Belanger, Jeff. ''The World's Most Haunted Places: From the Secret Files of Ghostvillage.com.'' New York: Career Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-56414-764-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on.&lt;ref name="Ogden" /&gt; The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).&lt;ref name="Pederson"&gt;Pederson, William D. and Williams, Frank J. ''Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln: Competing Perspectives on Two Great Presidencies.'' Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7656-1034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackman"&gt;[[W.

New York: Three Rivers Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-609-80021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last sighting of Lincoln's ghost was in the early 1980s, when Tony Savoy, White House operations foreman, came into the White House and saw Lincoln sitting in a chair at the top of some stairs.&lt;ref name="Belanger" /&gt;

[[File:WILLIE.JPG|thumb|150px|[[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie Lincoln]], who died in the White House during his father's presidency.]]
Abraham Lincoln is not the only Lincoln ghost witnesses claim to have seen in the White House. [[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie Lincoln]], Abraham Lincoln's 11-year-old son, died in the White House of [[typhoid]] on February 20, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Herbert Donald|Donald, David Herbert]]. ''Lincoln.'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 1995. {{ISBN|0-684-80846-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willie Lincoln's ghost was first seen in the White House by staff members of the [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant administration]] in the 1870s, but has appeared as recently as the 1960s (President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s college-age daughter, [[Lynda Bird Johnson Robb]], saw the ghost and claims to have talked to him).&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;

====Other presidents====
Other presidents, as well as First Ladies, are also said to haunt the White House. Witnesses in the past two centuries have reported that [[Thomas Jefferson]] can be heard playing his violin in the Yellow Oval Room.&lt;ref name="Caggiula" /&gt; President [[Andrew Jackson]] is said to be seen lying on what is thought to be his old bed &lt;ref&gt;Levy, Leonard Williams and Fisher, Louis. ''Encyclopedia of the American Presidency.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994. {{ISBN|0-13-275983-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Queens' Bedroom]] (also known as the Rose Room), and his guttural laugh has been heard in the White House since the beginning of the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Apkarian" /&gt; First Lady press secretary Liz Carpenter heard the laugh and swore it was Jackson's,&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt; and [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] claimed to have heard the stomping and swearing of an invisible presence which she claimed was the uncouth Jackson.&lt;ref name="Leaf"&gt;Leaf, Jesse. ''The Everything Family Guide to Washington D.C.: All the Best Hotels, Restaurants, Sites, and Attractions.'' 3rd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: Everything Books, 2007. {{ISBN|1-59869-287-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; White House seamstress Lillian Rogers Parks said she was sewing in the Queen's Bedroom and felt a presence, cold air, and then a hand on the back of her chair.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt; She quickly left the room, and for the rest of her time in the White House she refused to enter the room again without at least one other person accompanying her.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt; The spirit of [[William Henry Harrison]], it is claimed, haunts the attic,&lt;ref name="Blackman" /&gt; and President [[John Tyler]] allegedly haunts the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]].&lt;ref name="Hauck" /&gt; First Lady [[Frances Folsom Cleveland Preston|Frances Folsom Cleveland]], who was married to President [[Grover Cleveland]] in the White House's Blue Room in 1886,&lt;ref&gt;Robar, Stephen F. ''Frances Clara Folsom Cleveland.'' New York: Nova Publishers, 2004. {{ISBN|1-59454-150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is widely claimed to haunt the room where she was married and was seen there after her death in 1947.&lt;ref name="Parks" /&gt;

====Non-residents====
The White House is also said to be visited by three specters who did not live there. The first is that of David Burns, who owned the ground on which the White House stands before selling it to the federal government in May 1791, and whose spirit has been seen in Oval Office.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; A reporter told a security guard during the Truman administration that, while standing in the Yellow Oval Room, he heard a faint ghostly voice which said, "I'm Mr. Burns."&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt; The second spirit is allegedly that of a British soldier dressed in a [[Red coat (military uniform)|uniform]] from the [[War of 1812]] and carrying a torch.&lt;ref name="Belanger" /&gt; In August 1814, a combined British land and naval force captured Washington, D.C., and [[Burning of Washington|set fire]] to the White House, [[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]], Capitol, and other buildings in retaliation for the American looting of [[York, Upper Canada]] (now the city of [[Toronto]]) and the burning of the [[Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada]] after the [[Battle of York]] in 1813.&lt;ref name="Burning"&gt;Hickey, Donald R. ''The War of 1812: The Forgotten Conflict.'' Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-252-06059-8}}; Pitch, Anthony S. ''The Burning of Washington.'' Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-55750-425-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fires were put out only when a [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] and [[tornado]] passed through Washington the following day, extinguishing the blazes.&lt;ref name="Burning" /&gt; The soldier is claimed to be one of those who burned the White House, or who lost his life the following day in the storm. Another shade alleged to visit the White House is the ghost of Anna Surratt, daughter of convicted Lincoln assassination co-conspirator [[Mary Surratt]], who forced her way into the White House the night before her mother's execution and unsuccessfully begged for her mother's life.&lt;ref name="Chamlee" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Laura Carter.

''The Darkest Dawn: Lincoln, Booth, and the Great American Tragedy.'' Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-253-21889-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed by some White House staff that Anna's ghost returns to the White House every July 6, silently banging on the front door to seek entrance and continue her futile pleas for her mother's life.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

===President's Park and nearby buildings===
[[File:Decatur House north side.jpg|thumb|left|Decatur House on Lafayette Square, showing the bricked-up window out of which the ghost of Stephen Decatur is said to stare]]
[[President's Park]], better known as [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]], may have its own spectral resident.

[[Decatur House]] (748 Jackson Place NW) is allegedly haunted by the ghost of [[Stephen Decatur]]. In 1820, Commodore [[James Barron]] challenged Commodore Decatur to a [[duel]] over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair|''Chesapeake-Leopard'' Affair]] of 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Decatur had served on the court-martial that had found Barron guilty of unpreparedness, and had barred him from a command for the next five years. See: De Kay, James Tertius. ''A Rage for Glory: The Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur, USN.'' New York: Free Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7432-4245-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach.&lt;ref name="DeKay"&gt;De Kay, ''A Rage for Glory: The Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur, USN,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22.&lt;ref name="DeKay" /&gt; A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving the back door of the house with a box of dueling pistols.&lt;ref name="Ogden"&gt;Ogden, Tom.

After the burning of the White House in the War of 1812, President James and Dolley Madison lived there from September 1814 to October 1815, and Madison signed the [[Treaty of Ghent]] (which ended the war) there in February 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Irvin.

Colonel Tayloe and his daughter quarreled on the second floor landing over the girl's relationship with a British officer stationed in the city. When the daughter turned in anger to go down the stairs, she fell down the stairs (or over the railing; stories differ) and died. Her specter is allegedly seen crumpled at the bottom of the steps or on the stairs near the second floor landing, and sometimes exhibits itself as the light of a candle moving up the staircase.&lt;ref name="Floyd"&gt;Floyd, Randall. ''In the Realm of Ghosts and Hauntings.'' Augusta, Ga.: Harbor House, 2002. {{ISBN|1-891799-06-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other death, stories claim, occurred in 1817 or shortly thereafter. Another of Colonel Tayloe's daughters eloped with a young man, incurring her father's wrath. When she returned home to reconcile with her father, they argued on the third-floor landing. This daughter, too, fell to her death down the stairs (or over the railing), and her shade is alleged to haunt the third floor landing and stairs between the second and third floors.&lt;ref name="Apkarian" /&gt;

The Octagon is also believed by some to be haunted by the spirits of African American slaves who once lived there.&lt;ref name="Landmarks" /&gt; When the house held bells to summon servants, the spirits of the dead slaves would announce their presence by ringing these bells loudly.&lt;ref name="Lockwood"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hoQ-AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Lockwood, Mary Smith. ''Historic Homes in Washington: Its Noted Men and Women.''] New York: Belford Company, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General [[George D. Ramsay]], Chief of Ordnance for the [[United States Army]] and commander of the [[Fort Lesley J. McNair|Washington Arsenal]] in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the bells in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Fuzhou|Foo Chow]], [[China]]), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the bells from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4wklAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Gouverneur, Marian. ''As I Remember: Recollections of American Society During the Nineteenth Century.''] New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious ringing of the bells had been reported in 1874&lt;ref name="Clemmer"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=88gLAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Clemmer, Mary.

Other spirits are also said to remain at The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the fireplace in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied by the smell of lilacs, her favorite flower.&lt;ref&gt;''Let's Go Washington.'' New York: Macmillan, 2003. {{ISBN|0-312-32001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream.&lt;ref name="Evelyn"&gt;Evelyn, Douglas E.; Dickson, Paul; and Ackerman, S.J.

Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night.&lt;ref name="Evelyn" /&gt; A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in,&lt;ref name="Ogden" /&gt; and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests.&lt;ref name="Hauck" /&gt; He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.&lt;ref name="Floyd" /&gt;

===Independence Avenue SW===
[[File:Orville Wright Federal Building (3363883616).jpg|thumb|left|Wilbur Wright FAA HQ - probable site for Yellow House slave pen]]
The spirits of slaves are also said to haunt a portion of [[Independence Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Independence Avenue SW]], the site of two of the city's largest and most notorious slave markets.

At least three other sites in downtown D.C. are also reputed to be haunted. The [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] (1321 Pennsylvania Avenue NW) opened at its current location on December 7, 1835, although the old building was torn down and replaced with the current structure in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Douglas Bennett; Meersman, Roger L.; and Murphy, Donn B. ''Stage for a Nation: The National Theatre, 150 Years.'' Lanham, Md.: Publisher University Press of America, 1985. {{ISBN|0-8191-5021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some claim the theater is haunted by the ghost of actor John McCullough, who was murdered in the 1880s by a fellow thespian where the modern stage is located today.&lt;ref&gt;Wurman, Richard Saul. ''Washington, DC Access.'' 3d ed. New York: Access Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-06-277039-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spook was first sighted by Frederic Bond, a comic actor and friend of McCullough's, in September 1896. Bond was on the stage late at night reviewing preparations for the next day's performance when he felt a spectral presence that terrified him. He then saw a ghostly figure dressed in the traditional garb of the Shakespearean character [[Hamlet]]. Recognizing the spirit, he shouted McCullough's name and the ghost vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Mark and Sceurman, Mark.

Built in 1887 in order to process pensions for Civil War veterans, widows, and orphans (such pensions consumed a quarter of the federal budget at the time), the "Pension Building" (as it was originally known) contains 15 [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]] made of brick and plaster and painted to imitate black [[onyx]].&lt;ref&gt;Moeller, Gerard and Weeks, Christopher.

The [[Hay–Adams Hotel]] may also be host to the ghost of [[Marian Hooper Adams|Marian "Clover" Hooper Adams]].

One of the most important buildings in the [[Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.|Dupont Circle]] neighborhood is the [[Walsh Mansion]] (now the Embassy of Indonesia) located at 2020 [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue NW]]. [[Thomas Walsh (miner)|Thomas J.

[[File:M Street Bridge.JPG|thumb|left|M Street Bridge]]
Bridges in Georgetown may also be the sites of ghostly activity. Two specters are said to haunt the site of the [[M Street Bridge]]. [[M Street (Washington, D.C.)|M Street NW]] was known on the Georgetown side as "Bridge Street" before the [[Georgetown street renaming|street renaming of 1895]].&lt;ref name="DCGovernment"&gt;Tindall, William. ''Origin and Government of the District of Columbia.'' Committee on the District of Columbia. House of Representatives. United States Congress.

''Washington, D.C.: A Guide to the Nation's Capital.'' Washington, D.C.: Federal Writers' Project, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Bridge, a sturdier structure, was built over Rock Creek in 1802.&lt;ref name="Myer" /&gt; However, from the early 19th century to the early 20th century, Georgetown residents claimed to see a silent stagecoach race down Bridge Street on starless nights, and then disappear in the center of the new span.&lt;ref name="Peter"&gt;Peter, Grace Dunlop. ''A Portrait of Old George Town.'' Richmond, Va.: Garrett &amp; Massie, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; Another apparition said to haunt the bridge was that of a [[Drummer|drummer boy]] who allegedly had been knocked off the bridge (during the [[American Revolutionary War]] or in the early 19th century after the bridge had been rebuilt) by a gust of wind and drowned in Rock Creek.&lt;ref name="Taggart"&gt;Taggart, Hugh T. "Old Georgetown." ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, D.C.'' 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; On quiet nights, witnesses claimed to hear soft drumming which got louder near the center of the span but disappeared once the spot where the boy drowned was reached.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt; The image of a headless man (whose origins are shrouded in mystery) is said to sometimes haunt the Georgetown side of the [[K Street Bridge|K Street NW bridge]] over Rock Creek as well.&lt;ref name="Taggart" /&gt;

'''SS [[Royal Mail Ship|(RMS)]] {{lang|gv|Ellan Vannin}}''' (the [[Manx language|Manx]] name for the [[Isle of Man]]) was built as an iron [[paddle steamer]] in 1860 at Meadowside, [[Glasgow]] for the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]]. She was originally named ''Mona's Isle'' - the second ship in the Company's history to be so named. She served for 23 years under that name before being rebuilt, re-engined and renamed in 1883. As ''Ellan Vannin'' she served for a further 26 years before being lost in a storm on 3 December 1909 in [[Liverpool Bay]].

==''Mona's Isle''==
''Mona's Isle'' was built by Tod and McGregor Ltd, [[Glasgow]], at a cost of £10,673. She entered service with the Steam Packet Fleet in June 1860.

''Mona's Isle'' is important in the history of the line, as she was the first vessel to be fitted with [[marine oscillating steam engine|oscillating engine]]s, which were also manufactured by Tod and McGregor Ltd. Until 1860 the Company had always used the [[side-lever engine]] so favoured by [[Robert Napier and Sons]]. The oscillating engines possessed a number of advantages over the side-lever, as it occupied less space and had fewer working parts. A further enhancement was the addition of improved feathering floats which were fitted to the paddle wheels.

There was no requirement for a [[connecting rod]], and the upper end of the [[piston rod]] was fitted with a [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] which worked directly on to the [[crankpin]]. The [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] was placed vertically under the [[crankshaft]] and could pivot through a small arc, permitting the rod to follow the movement of the crank. The plant produced {{convert|600|ihp|abbr=on}} which gave her a speed of approximately 12 knots.

When launched, ''Mona's Isle'' measured 339 [[gross register ton]]s (grt). .

After 23 years service, ''Mona's Isle'' was laid up at [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] and subsequently was taken under tow to Barrow by the [[SS Fenella (1881)|''Fenella'']] in order to undergo her rebuild, on Friday 19 January 1883.&lt;ref&gt;''The Isle of Man Examiner.'' Saturday 20 January 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ellan Vannin''==
Rebuilt in 1883, her size was increased to 375 gross register tons and her speed to {{convert|12.5|kn|km/h|lk=in}}. She was renamed {{lang|gv|Ellan Vannin}} (the [[Manx language|Manx translation]] for ''Mona's Isle'') on 16 November 1883, following her conversion to a propeller-driven ship. ''Ellan Vannin'' was a twin-screw vessel driven by a two-cylinder [[compound steam engine]] made by Westray, Copeland and Co. at [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]]. Her boiler pressure was raised to {{convert|80|psi}}.

She was capable of carrying 300 passengers and normally had a crew of 14. ''Ellan Vannin'' primarily operated out of [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] to [[Whitehaven]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Scotland]]. She gave 26 years more service, and became the main mail carrier out of Ramsey.
In December 1891, she completed a special [[wikt:overhauling|overhaul]] at the [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering|Naval Construction Works]] at Barrow, costing £2,913.
[[File:Capt. James Teare of the RMS Ellan Vannin..JPG|thumb|left|[[James Teare (sea captain)|Captain James Teare.]]]]
By 1909 she was the smallest and oldest ship in the Steam Packet Fleet. ''Ellan Vannin'' was considered an exceptionally fine vessel in bad weather, carrying out the daily mail contract when other vessels were safe in harbour.

Indeed, [[Storm|stormy weather]] appeared to be no deterrent to her, and it is reported that when up to 12 [[ocean liner]]s had been taking shelter in [[Ramsey Bay]], ''Ellan Vannin'' steamed through them as she made passage to [[Whitehaven]] and returned in the evening, the completion of her voyage being heralded by the ships sheltering in the bay sounding their whistles.&lt;ref name="Man Steam Packet Company 1973 p.10"&gt;Ships of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry, 1973) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ellan Vannin'' became looked upon as a ''[[mascot]]'' of the Steam Packet fleet,&lt;ref name="Man Steam Packet Company 1973 p.10"&gt;Ships of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry, 1973) p.10&lt;/ref&gt; and known by [[Manx people|Manx sailors]] as the ''Li'l Daisy.''

==Loss==
[[File:GetImage256CP6ZX.png|thumb|right|Headline in the ''Ramsey Courier,'' Saturday 10 December 1909.]]On 3 December 1909, ''Ellan Vannin'' left her home port of Ramsey at 01:13hrs, under the command of her [[Master mariner|Master]], 37 year old [[James Teare (sea captain)|Captain James Teare]], who had some 18 years of experience working his way through the company to the position of Master.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During the summer of 1909 Teare was in command of the [[SS King Orry (1871)|''King Orry'']]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and had only joined the ''Ellan Vannin'' the day before her ill-fated voyage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Captain Teare was married with four children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''Ellan Vannin'' was carrying 15 passengers and 21 crew as well as mail and 60 tonnes of cargo which included approximately 60 sheep.

The weather on departure was moderate and although the [[barometric pressure]] was falling the captain did not expect a significant deterioration in the weather. The wind direction on departure was from the northwest meaning the ''Ellan Vannin'' would have a following sea during her passage – something which would have caused her master no particular concern.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Isle of Man Examiner.'' December 4th, 1909, (p.9)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the weather rapidly worsened and by 06:35hrs, when the ship arrived at the [[River Mersey|Mersey]] Bar [[Lightvessel|lightship]], the wind had risen to a [[Beaufort scale|Hurricane Force 12]], and waves were reported to be exceeding {{convert|24|ft|m|0}} in height.&lt;ref name="Man Steam Packet Company 1973 p.10"&gt;Ships of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry, 1973) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong consensus at the time&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; was that with a following sea the ''Ellan Vannin'' had made good time to the Bar Lightship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Upon reaching the Bar her course would have been changed from approximately 130 degrees to 080 degrees as she entered the approach channel to the river. This would have caused her to take the sea on her port beam with the result that she got sufficiently off her course to strike a sandbank&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; thereby causing her to [[Shipwrecking|founder]]  between the Bar lightship and the Q1 buoy, sinking in the Mersey approach channel (at {{Coord|53|32|0|N|3|17|0|W|display=inline,title}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?5054| title=SS Ellan Vannin [+1909]| publisher=Wreck site| accessdate=6 October 2013| registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed she was [[Broach (sailing)|broached]] by a large wave, which overwhelmed the ship. She was swept by heavy seas and filled, sinking by the stern with the loss of all passengers and crew.

News of the disaster reached [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] on the Friday evening, and the directors sat in almost continuous session until Monday. Communication was by telegram and information was difficult to ascertain. [[File:Life belt from RMS Ellan Vannin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lifebuoy]] from RMS ''Ellan Vannin.'']]At approximately 19:00hrs&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; a telegram was received which reported that the crew of the [[Formby]] Lightship had seen lifebuoys, bags of turnips, several dead sheep and a piano floating near the lightship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was also reported that the crew of the lightship had picked up a mail bag which was destined for the [[Birkenhead]] Post Office and which was found to contain letters despatched from Ramsey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
The following morning the company offices in Douglas received a telegram from Liverpool stating that one of the ''Ellan Vannin's'' lifeboats had been washed ashore at [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]] with its cover on and its working gear inside.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also washed ashore were parts of the ship's bridge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On Saturday morning [[SS Tynwald (1891)|''Tynwald'']] departed Douglas in order to replace the [[SS Fenella (1881)|''Fenella'']] on the Douglas – Liverpool service, with the ''Fenella'' in turn taking the sailing to Ramsey which should have been undertaken by the ''Ellan Vannin''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

It was five days after the ship went down that the first bodies were recovered. In January 1910, Teare's body was found washed ashore on [[Ainsdale]] beach in [[Southport]]. It was subsequently returned to the Isle of Man for burial.

==Aftermath==
The [[Board of Trade]] inquiry found that the [[Sea captain|captain]] was not to blame for the disaster and the cause was [[extreme weather]]. The official inquiry referred to waves {{convert|24|ft|0}} high and declared the ship to have been in good condition and fully [[seaworthy]]. After the [[Shipwreck (accident)|foundering]], her masts broke the surface. Divers inspecting the ship found damage to the bows and that the lifeboat davits had been swung out ready for lowering. Soon after the disaster the [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Board]] destroyed the [[Shipwreck|wreck]] using explosives, as it was causing a hazard to shipping in the channel.

A disaster fund was established for those who were dependants of the deceased, the Steam Packet contributed £1,000 to this fund. It was set up by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' at writer [[Hall Caine]]’s instigation. Caine headed the list of  contributors and  wrote a poem ''The Loss of the Ellan Vannin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=343.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew of 21 included one woman, a Mrs. Collister, of [[Crosby, Isle of Man]], who left one child. The 20 men were survived by 18 widows and 70 children. All but two of the crew lived on the Isle of Man. Five of the passengers came from off Island, the rest from the north of the Island.
The last [[beneficiary]] of the fund was a Miss Benson of Ramsey, the daughter of one of the crew. She was 20 at the time of the disaster and was in very poor health. It was most unlikely that she would be the last to benefit from the fund, but she was, dying in 1974 at the age of 85.

Although the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] has a tradition of reusing ship names, they have never reused the name {{lang|gv|Ellan Vannin}}.

A song written by Hughie Jones of [[The Spinners (UK band)|The Spinners]] commemorates the disaster.

===Crew===
Second in command to Capt. Teare was 45 year old [[Chief mate|First Officer]] John Craine of Leigh Terrace, Douglas, who like Capt. Teare had worked his way up through the company. During the previous summer Craine had served on the [[SS Mona (1889)|''Mona'']]. [[Second mate|Second Officer]] was John Kinley of Surby, [[Port Erin]], who had previously served on the [[SS Fenella (1881)|''Fenella'']]. William Kelly, of Mill St, Castletown, although sailing as deck crew was a [[Licensed mariner]] who had served as [[Second mate|Second Officer]] on the [[SS Tynwald (1891)|''Tynwald'']] during the summer. Kelly's brother was also in the employ of the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] and was also serving on the ''Ellan Vannin'' leaving the ship only a day or so before the sailing.&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Man Examiner.''

'''Serhiy Fedorovich Tkach''' ({{lang-uk|Сергій Федорович Ткач}}, {{lang-ru|Серге́й Фёдорович Ткач}}; September 15, 1952 – November 4, 2018) was a Soviet and later Ukrainian [[serial killer]], convicted for the killing of 37 women and girls in [[Ukraine]] from 1980 to 2005.

==Background==
Serhiy Fedorovich Tkach (also spelled Sergey) was born on 15 September 1952 in [[Kiselyovsk]], [[Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]]. He served in the [[Soviet Army]], and according to neighbours he claimed to be a [[veteran]] of the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]]. Tkach worked as a police [[criminal investigator]] in [[Kemerovo Oblast]], where he was recommended for admission to a [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] school until he was caught [[falsifying evidence]] and forced to resign. Afterwards Tkach worked numerous different jobs before moving to the [[Ukraine SSR]] in 1982, where he began working again as a police criminal investigator in the [[Dnipropetrovsk]] region.

==Murders==
In 1984, young women and girls began to noticeably disappear across [[Kharkiv Oblast]], [[Zaporizhia Oblast]], [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[Crimea]] in eastern Ukraine, near where Tkach lived and worked. He targeted [[Female human|female]] victims, aged between 8 and 18, who would be [[raped]], [[suffocated]], and after they were dead performed [[necrophilic]] acts on their bodies.&lt;ref name=teleg/&gt; Tkach used his police knowledge to mislead others investigating his killings, such as choosing victims near [[railway]] lines recently treated with tar to throw [[police dogs]] off his scent.

==Arrest, conviction, and imprisonment==
In August 2005, Tkach attended the funeral of one of his victims, where children who were also attending claimed to have seen him with the victim shortly before her death. Tkach was arrested at his home in [[Polohy]] and admitted to his crimes, claiming to have killed over 100 people until his arrest, and demanded the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref name=teleg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/3933579/Man-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-murdering-36-women.html|first=Miriam|last=Elder|date=24 Dec 2008|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|title=Man sentenced to life in prison for murdering 36 women|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7798753.stm |title=BBC News: Serial killer jailed in Ukraine |accessdate=2008-12-24|work=bbc.co.uk | date=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a one-year trial, in 2008 a tribunal in Dnipropetrovsk sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]] for the murder of 37 women and girls over more than two decades.&lt;ref name=teleg/&gt; Over the years 15 men were wrongly jailed for some of the murders of which Tkach was found guilty, one of whom committed [[suicide]], and another was not released until March 2012.&lt;ref name=teleg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/125954/ Innocent Man Spends 7 Years In Prison], [[Kyiv Post]] (12 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 [[Netflix]] documentary titled 'Inside the World's Toughest Prisons' revealed that Tkach has fathered a child while in prison with a woman in her twenties who became infatuated with him after reading an interview in the media. She went on to marry Tkach who is allowed conjugal visits according to human rights provisions.

==Death==
Serhiy Tkach died in the Prison No. 8 of [[Zhytomyr]], where he served his sentence, on November 4, 2018, at 7 p.m. local time. The cause of death was [[heart failure]]. Tkach was buried on November 7 by the prison staff as none of his relatives had claimed the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Появились подробности смерти "пологовского маньяка" - одного из самых жестоких серийных убийц Украины|url=https://www.unian.net/society/10329870-poyavilis-podrobnosti-smerti-pologovskogo-manyaka-odnogo-iz-samyh-zhestokih-seriynyh-ubiyc-ukrainy.html|work=[[UNIAN]]|date=November 8, 2018|accessdate=November 8, 2018|lang=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], '''solenocytes''' are [[flagellate]]d [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s associated with [[excretion]], [[osmoregulation]] and [[ionoregulation]] in many non-chordates and in some [[chordate]]s under the sub-phylum [[Cephalochordate|Cephalochordata]] of the sub-group [[Protochordata]].

These are the cells which form subtypes of [[Protonephridium]] along with the other type i.e. [[Flame cell|Flame Cells]]. Flame cells can be distinguished from solenocytes as the former is usually [[ciliate]]d whereas the latter is flagellated.

An example of organisms in which excretion is performed by Solenocytic protonephridia is Genus ''[[Branchiostoma]].''

[[File:Zvezda toilet.jpg|thumb|right|Zero Gravity Toilet on the [[International Space Station]] in the [[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda Service Module]] ]]

A '''space toilet''', or '''zero gravity toilet'''  is a [[toilet]] that can be used in a [[Weightlessness|weightless]] environment. In the absence of weight, the collection and retention of liquid and solid waste is directed by use of air flow. Since the air used to direct the waste is returned to the cabin, it is filtered beforehand to control odor and cleanse bacteria. In older systems, waste water is vented into space, and any solids are compressed and stored for removal upon landing.  More modern systems expose solid waste to [[Vacuum (outer space)#Outer space|vacuum]] pressures to kill bacteria, which prevents odor problems and kills [[pathogens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gigapan: Space Shuttle Discovery Toilet|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/space-panorama/gigapan-discovery-toilet/|work=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
When humans travel into space, the absence of [[gravity]] causes fluids to distribute uniformly around their bodies. Their [[kidneys]] detect the fluid movement and a physiological reaction causes the humans to need to relieve themselves within two hours of departure from [[Earth]]. As a result, the space toilet has been the first device activated on shuttle flights, after astronauts unbuckle themselves.&lt;ref name="walker20050317"&gt;{{cite interview

There are four basic parts in a space toilet: the liquid waste vacuum tube, the vacuum chamber, the waste storage drawers, and the solid waste collection bags. The liquid waste vacuum tube is a 2 to {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=on}} long rubber or plastic hose that is attached to the vacuum chamber and connected to a fan that provides suction. At the end of the tube there is a detachable urine receptacle, which come in different versions for male and female astronauts. The male urine receptacle is a plastic funnel two to three inches in width and about four inches deep. A male astronaut urinates directly into the funnel from a distance of two or three inches away.  The female funnel is oval and is two inches by four inches wide at the rim.  Near the funnel's rim are small holes or slits that allow air movement to prevent excessive suction.  The vacuum chamber is a cylinder about {{convert|1|ft|m|adj=on}} deep and six inches wide with clips on the rim where waste collection bags may be attached and a fan that provides suction.  Urine is pumped into and stored in waste storage drawers.  Solid waste is stored in a detachable bag made of a special fabric that lets gas (but not liquid or solid) escape, a feature that allows the fan at the back of the vacuum chamber to pull the waste into the bag.  When the astronaut is finished, he or she then twists the bag and places it in a waste storage drawer. Samples of urine and solid waste are frozen and taken to Earth for testing.

=== Space Shuttle Waste Collection System ===
[[Image:STS-46 WCS Maintenance.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mission Specialist Claude Nicollier reviews the repair manual for the WCS on STS-46]]

The         toilet used on the [[Space Shuttle]] is called the '''Waste Collection System''' (WCS). In addition to air flow, it also uses rotating fans to distribute solid waste for in-flight storage. Solid waste is distributed in a cylindrical container which is then exposed to vacuum to dry the waste.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Liquid waste is vented to space. During [[STS-46]], one of the fans malfunctioned, and crew member [[Claude Nicollier]] was required to perform in-flight maintenance (IFM).  An earlier, complete failure, on the eight-day [[STS-3]] test flight, forced its two-man crew ([[Jack Lousma]] and [[Gordon Fullerton]]) to use a fecal containment device (FCD) for waste elimination and disposal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

=== International Space Station ===

There are two toilets on the [[International Space Station]], located in the [[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]] and [[Tranquility (ISS module)|''Tranquility'']] modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; They use a fan-driven suction system similar to the [[Space Shuttle]] WCS. Liquid waste is collected in {{convert|20|l|USgal|adj=on}} containers. Solid waste is collected in individual micro-perforated bags which are stored in an aluminum container.&lt;ref name="ISS_Toilet_NASA"&gt;{{cite web

An additional '''Waste and Hygiene Compartment''' is part of the [[Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility]] module launched in 2010.

On May 21, 2008, the gas liquid separator pump failed on the 7-year-old toilet in Zvezda, although the solid waste portion was still functioning.  The crew attempted to replace various parts, but was unable to repair the malfunctioning part.  In the interim, they used a manual mode for urine collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7425180.stm |title= Toilet trouble for space station |work=BBC News | date=May 29, 2008 | accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crew had other options: to use the toilet on the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] transport module (which only has capacity for a few days of use) or to use urine-collection bags as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24841375/ |title= Space station struggles with balky toilet}}&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement pump was sent from Russia in a [[Diplomatic bag|diplomatic pouch]] so that [[Space Shuttle Discovery]] could take it to the station as part of mission [[STS-124]] on June 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/[[Russian Federation|Russian]] [[Space Station]] [[Mir]]'s toilet also used a system similar to the WCS.&lt;ref name="ISS_Toilet_Use"&gt;{{cite web | last = Shuttleworth | first = Mark | title = Toilet Training | url = http://www.firstafricaninspace.com/home/mission/logs/1/20020209.shtml | work = First African in Space | date = February 9, 2002 | accessdate =December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] had an onboard toilet facility since its introduction in 1967 (due to the additional space in the Orbital Module), all [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] spacecraft required astronauts to urinate in a so-called "relief tube" in which the contents were dumped into space (an example would be the urine dump scene in the movie ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''), while fecal matter was collected in specially-designed bags.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Häuplik-Meusburger: ''Architecture for astronauts : an activity-based approach.''

The Skylab toilet, which was designed and built by the Fairchild Republic Corp. on Long Island, was primarily a medical system to collect and return to Earth samples of urine, feces and vomit so that calcium balance in astronauts could be studied.

Even with the facilities, astronauts and cosmonauts for both launch systems employ pre-launch bowel clearing and [[Low residue diet|low-residue diets]] to minimize the need for [[defecation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/low-residue-diet.html |title=Low Residue Diet |publisher=Buzzle.com |date=December 15, 2011 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soyuz toilet has been used on a return mission from [[Mir]].&lt;ref name="ISS_Toilet_Use"/&gt;

A '''sprite''' is a [[supernatural]] entity. They are often depicted as [[fairy]]-like creatures or as an ethereal entity.&lt;ref name=BriggsFairies&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Katharine M. |authorlink=Katharine Mary Briggs |title=A Dictionary of Fairies|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex|year=1976|page=381|isbn=978-0-14-004753-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "sprite" is derived from the [[Latin]] "spiritus" (spirit), via the French "[[wiktionary:esprit|esprit]]".  Variations on the term include "spright" and the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] "[[spriggan]]". The term is chiefly used in regard to elves and fairies in [[European folklore]], and in [[modern English]] is rarely used in reference to [[spirit]]s.

There are examples of sprites and similar entities in literature, one of which is the air spirit Ariel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|title=The Genesis of Ariel|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|volume=2|issue=3|pages=205–210| doi = 10.2307/2866652 |jstor=2866652|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''.

== Belief in sprites ==
[[File:Knut Ekwall Fisherman and The Siren.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Knut Ekwall]]'s ''The Fisherman and The Siren'', a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] pulls a fisherman underwater.]]

The belief in diminutive beings such as sprites, [[elf|elves]], [[fairy|fairies]], etc. has been common in many parts of the world, and might to some extent still be found within neo-spiritual and religious movements such as "[[neo-druidism]]" and [[Ásatrú]].

In some elemental magics, the sprite is often believed to be the elemental of air (see also [[sylph]]).

== Water sprite ==
{{For|the plant species|Ceratopteris thalictroides}}

A water sprite (also called a water fairy or water faery) is a general term for an [[elemental]] [[spirit]] associated with [[water]], according to alchemist [[Paracelsus]]. Water sprites are said to be able to breathe water or air and sometimes can fly. They are mostly harmless unless threatened.

These creatures exist in [[mythology]] of various groups. [[Ancient Greeks]] knew [[Nymph|water nymphs]] in several types such as [[naiads]] (or ''nyads''), which were divine entities that tended to be fixed in one place&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Handbook of Greek Mythology.|last=Rose|first=Herbert|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Co.|year=1959|isbn=978-0-525-47041-0|location=New York|pages=173|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so differed from gods or physical creatures. [[Slavic mythology]] knows them as [[vila (fairy)|vilas]].

Water sprites differ from [[Matter|corporeal beings]], such as [[selkies]] and [[mermaid]]s, as they are not purely physical and are more akin to local deities than animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of English Folklore|last=Simpson|first=Jacqueline|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0198607663|location=Oxford|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank'''" is episode 88 of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. It originally aired on February 23, 1962 on [[CBS]].

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|Time, the mid-twenties. Place, the Midwest, the southernmost section of the Midwest. We were just witnessing a funeral, a funeral that didn't come off exactly as planned, due to a slight fallout from the Twilight Zone.}}

==Plot== 
In the mid-1920s in a small rural town in the "southernmost section of the Midwest," a man, Jeff Myrtlebank, returns to life at his own funeral, causing the grievers to flee the church. The townspeople believe that the man must be possessed by a [[haint]] (a wandering demon), even though the town doctor declares it was more than likely a medical condition that imitated death; his heart stopped days prior after fighting [[influenza]]. Jeff seems normal enough, yet he has changed: he has suddenly become a hard worker with exceptional strength, yet consistently eats less since his return.

Discussing the puzzle, his mother says she is real concerned at how he's behaving: "He's different. Not like he was at all,... And the way he goes at that hard work. Why, he was never that friendly with work before." His father agrees with her. "I recollect worrying many times that he leaned just a shade tow'rd this side of shiftlessness." "Not lazy, exactly, but..." his mother says, and his father completes her sentence with, "No, no, just uninterested." The townsfolk and doctor discuss it further, where the doctor reveals that not only did Jeff's heart completely stop, but that he did not respond in any way to a sharp pin prick. Everyone seems as interested in what transpired during the days Jeff was dead as in how he came back to life.

When he goes to visit his girlfriend Comfort, he takes a bouquet of roses, but the roses are all dead. Afraid, Comfort will not let him touch her after she sees them. As he leaves, her older brother confronts him and tells him to never come back, and they fight. Myrtlebank defeats him readily, punching him in his jaw. This is the first time that Myrtlebank has ever done so, after losing many past fights, and that gains Comfort's sympathy. "Poor Jeff," she says. "He hasn't got anybody."

After the fight, the townsfolk gather and start saying they need to take care of this evil amongst them. Comfort races off to warn Myrtlebank and to avow her love for him. He proposes to her, but before she can respond to his proposal, angry townspeople arrive to confront the demon they believe is possessing Jeff. They demand that he leave. He insists that Comfort answer his proposal first, and she tells him yes, and that she is willing to go anywhere to be with him. Myrtlebank then makes an inspired speech in which he tells them that they are wrong and have nothing to fear from him. He also slyly threatens that if they are right, it might be in their best interests to be nice to him. They nervously accept the wisdom of this, and promise to attend Jeff and Comfort's wedding.

After they leave, Comfort asks him, "You couldn't really do all that, could you?" He says he hated lying to them, but when something comes up, "You gotta cope with it." As he speaks, he pulls out a pipe and a match, which lights by itself. When Comfort asks how he lit the match, he laughs and says, "Comfort, honey, first thing you got to learn is not to imagine things." He puts his arm around her shoulders to take her inside. As they walk toward the house, the fence gate closes behind them on its own.

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|Jeff and Comfort are still alive today, and their only son is a United States senator. He's noted as an uncommonly shrewd politician, and some believe he must have gotten his education in the Twilight Zone.}}

'''Transdisciplinarity''' connotes a research strategy that crosses many [[Discipline (academia)|disciplinary]] boundaries to create a [[Holism|holistic]] approach. It applies to research efforts focused on problems that cross the boundaries of two or more disciplines, such as research on effective [[information system]]s for [[biomedical research]] (see [[bioinformatics]]), and can refer to concepts or methods that were originally developed by one discipline, but are now used by several others, such as [[ethnography]], a field research method originally developed in [[anthropology]] but now widely used by other disciplines.
The Belmont Forum &lt;ref&gt;http://www.belmontforum.org&lt;/ref&gt; elaborated that a transdisciplinary approach is enabling inputs and scoping across scientific and non-scientific stakeholder communities and facilitating a systemic way of addressing a challenge. This includes initiatives that support the capacity building required for the successful transdisciplinary formulation and implementation of research actions.

==Usage==
Transdisciplinarity has two common meanings:

===German usage===
In German-speaking countries, ''Transdisziplinarität'' refers to the integration of diverse forms of research, and includes specific methods for relating knowledge in problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;Mittelstrass 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 conference held at the [[University of Göttingen]] showcased the diverse meanings of multi-, inter- and transdisciplinarity and made suggestions for converging them without eliminating present usages.&lt;ref&gt;Brand/Schaller/Völker 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

When the very nature of a problem is under dispute, transdisciplinarity can help determine the most relevant problems and research questions involved.&lt;ref&gt;(Funtowicz &amp; Ravetz 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; A first type of question concerns the cause of the present problems and their future development (system knowledge). Another concerns which values and norms can be used to form goals of the problem-solving process (target knowledge). A third relates to how a problematic situation can be transformed and improved (transformation knowledge). Transdisciplinarity requires adequate addressing of the complexity of problems and the diversity of perceptions of them, that abstract and case-specific knowledge are linked, and that practices promote the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch Hadorn et al. 2008, Jaeger &amp; Scheringer 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Transdisciplinarity arises when participating experts interact in an open discussion and dialogue, giving equal weight to each perspective and relating them to each other. This is difficult because of the overwhelming amount of information involved, and because of incommensurability of specialized languages in each field of expertise. To excel under these conditions, researchers need not only in-depth knowledge and know-how of the disciplines involved, but skills in moderation, mediation, association and transfer.

===Wider usage===
Transdisciplinarity is also used to signify a unity of knowledge beyond disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Piaget]] introduced this usage of the term in 1970, and in 1987, the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (CIRET) adopted the Charter of Transdisciplinarity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inters.org/Freitas-Morin-Nicolescu-Transdisciplinarity Charter of Transdisciplinarity]&lt;/ref&gt; at the 1st World Congress of Transdisciplinarity, Convento da Arrabida, Portugal, November 1994.

In the CIRET approach, transdisciplinarity is radically distinct from [[interdisciplinarity]]. Interdisciplinarity, like pluridisciplinarity, concerns the transfer of methods from one discipline to another, allowing research to spill over disciplinary boundaries, but staying within the framework of disciplinary research.

As the prefix "trans" indicates, transdisciplinarity concerns that which is at once between the disciplines, across the different disciplines, and beyond each individual discipline. Its goal is the understanding of the present world, of which one of the imperatives is the overarching unity of knowledge.

Another critical defining characteristic of transdisciplinary research is the inclusion of stakeholders in defining research objectives and strategies in order to better incorporate the diffusion of learning produced by the research. Collaboration between stakeholders is deemed essential&amp;nbsp;– not merely at an academic or disciplinary collaboration level, but through active collaboration with people affected by the research and community-based stakeholders. In such a way, transdisciplinary collaboration becomes uniquely capable of engaging with different ways of knowing the world, generating new knowledge, and helping stakeholders understand and incorporate the results or lessons learned by the research.&lt;ref&gt;Wickson, F., Carew, A.L. &amp; Russell, A.W. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Transdisciplinarity is defined by [[Basarab Nicolescu]] through three methodological postulates: the existence of levels of Reality, the logic of the included middle, and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Transdisciplinarity&amp;nbsp;– Theory and Practice (Ed.), Hampton Press, Cresskill, NJ, USA, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of several levels of Reality the space between disciplines and beyond disciplines is full of information. Disciplinary research concerns, at most, one and the same level of Reality ; moreover, in most cases, it only concerns fragments of one level of Reality. On the contrary, transdisciplinarity concerns the dynamics engendered by the action of several levels of Reality at once. The discovery of these dynamics necessarily passes through disciplinary knowledge. While not a new discipline or a new superdiscipline, transdisciplinarity is nourished by disciplinary research; in turn, disciplinary research is clarified by transdisciplinary knowledge in a new, fertile way. In this sense, disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are not antagonistic but complementary. As in the case of disciplinarity, transdisciplinary research is not antagonistic but complementary to multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity research.

According to Nicolescu, transdisciplinarity is nevertheless radically distinct from multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity because of its goal, the understanding of the present world, which cannot be accomplished in the framework of disciplinary research.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The goal of multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity always remains within the framework of disciplinary research. If transdisciplinarity is often confused with interdisciplinarity or multidisciplinarity (and by the same token, we note that interdisciplinarity is often confused with multidisciplinarity) this is explained in large part by the fact that all three overflow disciplinary boundaries. Advocates maintain this confusion hides the huge potential of transdisciplinarity.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010). Theme-based research in the transdisciplinary field of educational linguistics. In F.M. Hult (Ed.), ''Directions and prospects for educational linguistics'' (pp. 19-32). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, transdisciplinarity is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new applied researches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Big History]] represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. According to Collado,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bioethics as a transdisciplinary science of complexity: a coevolutive introduction from the Big History |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the transdisciplinary methodology applied in the field of [[Big History]] seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos, and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. In abstract, the teaching of [[Big History]] in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] implies a transdisciplinary vision that integrates and unifies diverse epistemes that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, including ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach.

==Arts and humanities==
Transdisciplinarity can be found in the arts and humanities. For example, the [[Planetary Collegium]] seeks "the development of transdisciplinary discourse in the convergence of art, science, technology and consciousness research." The [http://www.plasticites-sciences-arts.org/plasticities-sciences-arts/ Plasticities Sciences Arts] (PSA) research group also develops transdisiciplinary approaches regarding humanities and fundamental sciences relationships as well as the Art &amp; Science field.

==Global education==
Transdisciplinarity can be also found in Global Education. For example, [[Global Education Magazine]], an international journal supported by [[UNESCO]] and [[UNHCR]]:
"transdisciplinarity represents the capable germ to promote an endogenous development of the evolutionary spirit of internal critical consciousness, where religion and science are complementary. Respect, solidarity and cooperation should be global standards for the entire human development with no boundaries. This requires a radical change in the ontological models of sustainable development, global education and world-society. We must rely on the recognition of a plurality of models, cultures and socio-economical diversification. As well as biodiversity is the way for the emergence of new species, cultural diversity represents the creative potential of world-society." &lt;ref&gt;Transdisciplinary Education as Ethic of the Diversity Reform in the World-Society of the 21st Century, article published by Javier Collado on June 20th: World Refugee Day in Global Education Magazine, {{ISSN|2255-033X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human sciences==
The range of transdisciplinarity becomes clear when the four central questions of biological research ((1) ''[[Causality|causation]]'', (2) ''[[ontogeny]],'' (3) [[adaptation]], (4) [[phylogeny]] [after [[Niko Tinbergen]] 1963, see also [[Tinbergen's four questions]], cf. [[Aristotle]]: Causality / Four Major Causes]) are graphed against distinct levels of analysis (e.g. [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], ''[[individual]], [[Group (sociology)|group]]''; [cf. "Laws about the Levels of Complexity" of [[Nicolai Hartmann]] 1940/1964, see also [[Rupert Riedl]] 1984]):&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from Medicus 2005, with the authors permission&lt;/ref&gt;

In this "scheme of transdisciplinarity", all anthropological disciplines (paragraph C in the table of the pdf-file below), their questions (paragraph A: see pdf-file) and results (paragraph B: see pdf-file) can be intertwined and allocated with each other for examples how these aspects go into those little boxes in the matrix, see e.g. the table {{cite web|title=The Framework of Anthropological Research|url=http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/4BQ_E.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707071403/http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/4BQ_E.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-07|df=}} This chart includes all realms of anthropological research (no one is excluded). It is the starting point for a systematical order for all human sciences, and also a source for a consistent networking and structuring of their results. This "bio-psycho-social" orientation framework is the basis for the development of the "Fundamental Theory of Human Sciences" and for a transdisciplinary consensus. (In this tabulated orientation matrix the questions and reference levels in ''italics'' are also the subject of the humanities.). Niko Tinbergen was familiar with both conceptual categories (i.e. the four central questions of biological research and the levels of analysis), the tabulation was made by [[Gerhard Medicus]]. Certainly, a humanist perspective always involves a transdisciplinary focus. A good and classic example of mixing very different sciences was the work developed by Leibniz in seventeenth-eighteenth centuries in order to create a universal system of justice.&lt;ref&gt;See José Andrés-Gallego, 42. "Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz's Universal (Chinese) Dream": Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 29(2) (2015): 118-132: http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trigger''' (originally named '''Golden Cloud''', July 4, 1934 – July 3, 1965) was a {{hands|15.3}} [[palomino]] horse made famous in American [[Western (genre)|Western]] films with his owner and rider, [[cowboy]] star [[Roy Rogers]].

==Pedigree==
Trigger was born in San Diego, California.  Though often mistaken for a [[Tennessee Walking Horse]], his sire was a [[Thoroughbred]] and his dam a [[grade horse|grade]] (unregistered) mare who, like Trigger, was a [[palomino]]. Movie director William Witney, who directed Roy and Trigger in many of their movies, claimed a slightly different lineage, that his [[sire]] was a "registered" Palomino [[stallion (horse)|stallion]], though no known Palomino registry existed at the time of Trigger's birth, and his dam was by a [[Thoroughbred]] and out of a "[[draft horse|cold-blood]]" mare.&lt;ref&gt;Witney, William. ''"Trigger Remembered"''.&lt;/ref&gt; Horses other than Golden Cloud also portrayed "Trigger" over the years, none of which was related to Golden Cloud, the two most prominent of which were palominos known as "Little Trigger" and "Trigger Jr." (who was a Tennessee Walking Horse listed as "Allen's Gold Zephyr" in the Tennessee Walking Horse registry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More Than One Trigger?|url=http://www.royrogersworld.com/Trigger.htm|publisher=RoyRogersWorld.com|accessdate=May 21, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191020/http://www.royrogersworld.com/Trigger.htm|archivedate=October 29, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Trigger remained a [[stallion]] his entire life, he was never bred and has no descendants.  On the other hand, Roy Rogers used "Trigger Jr."/"Allen's Golden Zephyr" at stud for many years, and the horse named "Triggerson" that actor [[Val Kilmer]] led on stage as a tribute to Rogers and his cowboy peers during the [[Academy Awards]] show in March 1999 was reportedly a grandson of "Trigger Jr."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dortch|first=Joel "Dutch"|title=Trigger: "The Smartest Horse in the Movies"|url=http://www.happytrails.org/trigger.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613175637/http://www.happytrails.org/trigger.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 13, 2007|publisher=Roy Rogers Estate|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
[[File:Roy Rogers and Trigger.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Publicity photo of Roy Rogers and Trigger]]
Golden Cloud made an early appearance as the mount of [[Maid Marian]], played by [[Olivia de Havilland]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938). A short while later, when Roy Rogers was preparing to make his first movie in a starring role, he was offered a choice of five rented "movie" horses to ride and chose Golden Cloud. Rogers bought him eventually in 1943 and renamed him Trigger for his quickness of both foot and mind.  Trigger learned 150 trick cues and could walk 50 feet (15 meters) on his hind legs (according to sources close to Roy Rogers). They were said to have run out of places to cue Trigger. Trigger became such a ham that as soon as he heard applause he would start bowing and ruin that trick. He could sit in a chair, sign his name "X" with a pencil, lie down for a nap and cover himself with a blanket. Roger's most carefully guarded trade secret was to get Trigger housebroken.  "Spending as much time as he does in hotels, theaters, and hospitals, this ability comes in might handy and it's conceded by most trainers to be Trigger's greatest accomplishment." —Glenn Randall, wrangler with Hudkins Stables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller Davis |first1=Elise |title=The Answer is God |date=1955 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Co |location=New York, USA |lccn=55009539 |page=50, 42 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His horse was so important to Rogers that when he purchased a "Best Wishes for the New Year" advertisement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', he signed it "Roy Rogers and Trigger".&lt;ref name="variety19490105"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=1949-01-05 |title=Best Wishes for the New Year |url=https://archive.org/stream/variety173-1949-01#page/n75/mode/2up |magazine=Variety |type=advertisement |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trigger was ridden by Rogers in many of his motion pictures, becoming much loved by the youthful audience that saw him on film and in Rogers' 1950s [[The Roy Rogers Show|television series]] with his wife [[Dale Evans]], who rode her trusty [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]] Quarter Horse [[Buttermilk (horse)|Buttermilk]].

Trigger became the most famous horse in film entertainment, even having his own [[Dell Comics|Dell]] [[comic book]] recounting his exploits.

Roy Rogers made many personal appearances with Trigger in tow. More than once Rogers escorted Trigger up 3-4 flights of stairs at hospitals to visit with sick children, according to his autobiography "Happy Trails."

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Roy Rogers Prints at the Chinese Theatre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Roy Rogers and Trigger prints on the sidewalk in front of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]]]]

After the original Trigger (Golden Cloud) died in 1965 at Rogers' new ranch in [[Apple Valley, California]], Rogers arranged for Everett Wilkensen of Bischoff's Taxidermy in Los Angeles (now Bischoff's Taxidermy and Animal FX in Burbank, California) to preserve/mount the horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trigger's taxidermist now busy with TV werewolves|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2012422056_apusfeapetstriggerstaxidermist.html|publisher=The Seattle Times Company|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hide was professionally stretched over a foam likeness of Trigger, and the resulting mount was put on display in the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum when it opened in [[Apple Valley, California]] in 1967. The mount was later moved with the museum to first [[Victorville, California]] in 1976, and then to [[Branson, Missouri]] in 2003.

At some point, a 24-foot (7 meters) replica of a rearing Trigger was produced to sit atop the Roy Rogers Museum in [[Victorville, California|Victorville]]. The 1,300-pound (600 kg) replica could be seen from the freeway and served as a landmark until the museum closed and moved to [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]]. When the fiberglass replica of Trigger was being made, Rogers was approached by the owners of the [[Denver Broncos]]. Rogers allowed another statue to be made and then broke the mold. "Bucky the Bronco", Trigger's twin, stands above the south scoreboard of the [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|Denver Broncos stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Sports Authority Field at Mile High|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/guide/guide-to-sports-authority-field-at-mile-high/|publisher=cbslocal.com|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the closing of the Victorville museum in 2009, its contents were placed at public auction on July 14–15, 2010, at [[Christie's]] auction house in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roy Rogers Auction Features Horse Trigger's Remains|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/09/roy-rogers-auction-featur_n_641107.html|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com|accessdate=May 21, 2013|date=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trigger's preserved taxidermy remains sold for $266,500 to television channel [[RFD-TV]], which plans to start a Western museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-07-14-roy-rogers-horse_N.htm |title=Roy Rogers' stuffed horse Trigger sold at auction |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=July 16, 2010 |first=Eva |last=Dou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Tinsley, a Victorville developer who had built Roy Rogers' home in nearby [[Apple Valley, California|Apple Valley]], bought the fiberglass replica in April 2010. Tinsley's plan is to make the statue a part of historic Apple Valley Village. He explained, "I just couldn't see letting him go anywhere else."&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Brooke. "Trigger returns".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2161">'''Widowed Parent's Allowance''' is a benefit under the United Kingdom Social Security system.

==Entitlement==

It replaced [[Widowed Mother's Allowance]] in 2001 as part of the process of removing [[sexism|sex discrimination]] from the Social Security system. It is available to anyone with a child whose husband, wife or civil partner has died. The claimant must get [[Child Benefit]] for at least one child and the late husband, wife or civil partner was their parent.

It is not available if the partners were divorced at the time of death, if the claimant is in prison, if they remarry or are cohabitating with another person by means of [[Cohabitation in the United Kingdom|living together as a married couple]].

==Amount of benefit==

In 2013 the maximum payment is £108.30 a week. It is taxable, but it is not affected by the receipt of other income. It is counted in full for all [[means-tested benefit]]s. The amount payable is dependent on the [[National Insurance]] contributions paid by the deceased. It could be affected by the [[benefit cap]]. It continues while [[Child Benefit]] continues.

==Proposed changes==

In July 2013 it was reported that the government was planning changes in the [[Pensions Bill 2012]] going through parliament, which would limit this benefit to a maximum of £400 a month paid out for just 12 months, with a lump sum of £5,000 following bereavement. The 43,500 families already in receipt of the allowance would be unaffected by the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Money     State benefits  Widowed parents allowance – a vital lifeline in danger of being cut|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jul/15/widowed-parents-allowance-cut|accessdate=2 January 2014|newspaper=The Observer|date=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Work and Pensions]] estimated that in 2016 the government expects to pay £590m a year to bereaved couples and families. With the changes, payments would drop to £530m by 2020.
