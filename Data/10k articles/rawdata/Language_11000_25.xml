'''Alain Gheerbrant''' (27 December 1920 – 21 February 2013) was a French writer, editor, poet and explorer, noted for his expedition inside the [[Amazon basin|basins]] of Amazonian rivers.&lt;ref name=DAG /&gt;

== Career ==
Alain Gheerbrant was the first [[avant-garde]] publisher, founder of the publishing house K Éditeur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gheerbrant |first1=Alain |last2=Aichelbaum |first2=Léon |date=1991 |title=K éditeur |url= |language=fr |location=Cognac |publisher=[[Le Temps qu'il fait]] |isbn=9782868531094}}&lt;/ref&gt; which published in particular the works by [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Benjamin Péret]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Aimé Césaire]], et cetera. For the second edition of ''[[Story of the Eye]]'' by Bataille, Gheerbrant introduced Bataille to the German artist [[Hans Bellmer]] in May 1946: "It was tempting, says Gheerbrant, to make a dialogue between a [[papist]] and a [[Lutheran]] on their common obsession. One's Nordic and surgical precision was made to give shape to the nocturnal and romantic imaginations of the other. The project took their common approval from the outset."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gheerbrant |first1=Alain |last2=Aichelbaum |first2=Léon |date=1991 |title=K éditeur |series=Coll. « La Part du Livre » |page=18 |url= |language=fr |location=Cognac |publisher=Le Temps qu'il fait |isbn=9782868531094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the book has been entirely rewritten by Bataille himself, still published by K Éditeur.

From 1948 to 1950, Alain Gheerbrant led the [[Orinoco]]-[[Amazon River|Amazon]] expedition. He travelled through the basin of both rivers for two years and wrote of his travels in {{lang|fr|L'Expédition Orénoque-Amazone|italic=yes}} (1952). He is considered the first Westerner who had peaceful contact with the [[Yanomami Indians]] and also the first to cross the [[Parima Mountains]] between 1948 and 1950. In 1952, he directed a documentary film called {{lang|fr|Des hommes qu'on appelle sauvages|italic=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9059185/ |title=Alain Gheerbrant, Director |website=[[imdb.com]] |accessdate=2018-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has produced numerous reports all over the world and published {{lang|fr|Dictionnaire des symboles}} in 1982, a collaborative work with [[Jean Chevalier]], an encyclopaedia of cultural anthropology about the symbolism of myths and folklore, which was republished 19 times between 1982 and 1997. He has authored an illustrated [[Pocket edition|pocket book]] for the "[[Découvertes Gallimard]]" [[Collection (publishing)|collection]], called {{lang|fr|L'Amazone, un géant blessé|italic=yes}} (1988), which has been translated into eleven languages, including English. In 1995, he released his memoir entitled {{lang|fr|La Transversale}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/236065/alain-gheerbrant |title=Alain Gheerbrant |website=[[Penguin Random House]] |accessdate=2018-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleksis Kivi''' ({{Audio|Fi-Aleksis_Kivi.ogg|pronunciation}}), born ''Alexis Stenvall'', (10 October 1834 – 31 December 1872&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Britannica|319741|Aleksis Kivi}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Finnish author who wrote the first significant novel in the [[Finnish language]], ''[[Seven Brothers]]'' (''Seitsemän veljestä''). Although Kivi was among the very earliest authors of prose and lyrics in Finnish, he is still considered one of the greatest.

==Life==

Aleksis Kivi was born in [[Nurmijärvi]], [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], into a tailor's family.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; In 1846 he left for school in [[Helsinki]], and in 1859 he was accepted into the [[University of Helsinki]], where he studied literature and developed an interest in the theatre. His first play was ''Kullervo'', based on a tragic tale from the ''[[Kalevala]]''. He also met the famous journalist and statesman [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]] who became his supporter.&lt;ref name="KB"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/2826 |title=Kivi, Aleksis (1834–1872)  |last1= Sihvo |first1= Hannes |date=2014 |website= The National Biography of Finland |accessdate=1 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at school Kivi read world literature from the library of his landlord, and during his University studies, he saw plays by [[Molière]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] at the [[Swedish Theatre]] in Helsinki.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://authorscalendar.info/akivi.htm |title=Kivi, Aleksis (1834–1872)  |last1= Liukkonen |first1= Petri |date=2008 |website= Authors' Calendar |accessdate=9 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kivi also had friends such as [[Fredrik Cygnaeus]] and [[Elias Lönnrot]].&lt;ref name="AC" /&gt;

From 1863 onwards, Kivi devoted his time to writing. He wrote 12 plays and a collection of poetry. The novel ''Seven Brothers'' or ''The Brothers Seven''&lt;ref&gt;Translated twice, in 1929 by Alex. Matson and in 1991 by Richard Impola, as ''Seven Brothers'', again in 2017 by [[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Douglas Robinson]] as ''The Brothers Seven''.&lt;/ref&gt;). took him ten years to write. Literary critics, especially the prominent [[August Ahlqvist]], disapproved of the book, at least nominally because of its "rudeness" &amp;ndash; [[Romanticism]] was at its height at the time.&lt;ref name="KB"/&gt; Ahlqvist wrote "It is a ridiculous work and a blot on the name of Finnish literature"&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt;   The [[Fennoman]]s also disapproved of its depiction of not-so-virtuous rural life that was far from their idealized point of view,&lt;ref name="KB"/&gt; and Kivi's excessive drinking may have alienated some.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 1865 Kivi won the State Prize for his still often performed comedy ''Nummisuutarit'' ('[[Heath Cobblers|The Cobblers on the Heath]]', translated as ''Heath Cobblers'' by [[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Douglas Robinson]]&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Robinson, trans., ''Aleksis Kivi's'' Heath Cobblers ''and'' Kullervo (St. Cloud, MN: North Star Press of St. Cloud, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the less than enthusiastic reception of his books was taking its toll and he was already drinking heavily. His main benefactor [[Charlotta Lönnqvist]] could not help him after the 1860s.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Kivi's health had failed completely in 1870. The collapse was accelerated by [[typhoid]] and attacks of [[delirium]] and in 1871 he was admitted to the New Clinic, from where he was transferred to the Lapinlahti psychiatric hospital. The doctor treating him, A. T. Saelan, diagnosed him as suffering from melancholia resulting from "injured dignity as a writer". On the basis of the available documents, Kalle Achté concludes that it was a classic case of [[schizophrenia]], triggered by severe states of anxiety.&lt;ref name="KB"/&gt; It has also been suggested, however, that Kivi's mental illness may have been caused by advanced [[borreliosis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teema.yle.fi/ohjelmat/juttuarkisto/kuoliko-aleksis-kivi-borrelioosiin|title=Yle Teema|website=teema.yle.fi|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Kivi died in poverty at the age of 38.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Legacy==

In the early 20th century young writers [[Volter Kilpi]] and [[Eino Leino]] raised Kivi to the status of  national icon. Eino Leino – and later [[Väinö Linna]] and [[Veijo Meri]] – also identified with Kivi's fate as an author.&lt;ref name="KB"/&gt;

In 1939 the [[Aleksis Kivi Memorial]], a bronze statue of Kivi by [[Wäinö Aaltonen]], was erected in front of the [[Finnish National Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hamhelsinki.fi/sv/sculpture/aleksis-kiven-muistopatsas-waino-aaltonen/|title=Aleksis Kiven muistopatsas : Wäinö Aaltonen – HAM|publisher=.hamhelsinki.fi|accessdate=11 September 2017|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 to 1996, Finnish composer [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] wrote [[Aleksis Kivi (opera)|an opera]] about Kivi's life and works. In 2002, director [[Jari Halonen]]'s film ''The Life of Aleksis Kivi'' (Finnish title: ''[[:fi:Aleksis Kiven elämä|Aleksis Kiven elämä]]'') premiered in Finnish cinemas.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Berbice Dutch Creole''' is a now [[Extinct language|extinct]] [[Dutch-based creole languages|Dutch-based creole language]]. It had a [[lexicon]] partly based on a dialect of the West African language, perhaps the ancestor of the modern [[Kalabari language]].{{sfn|Kouwenberg|1994}} In contrast to the widely known [[Negerhollands]] Dutch creole spoken in the [[Virgin Islands]], Berbice Creole Dutch and its relative [[Skepi Creole Dutch]], were more or less unknown to the outside world until Ian Robertson first reported on the two languages in 1975. Dutch linguist Silvia Kouwenberg subsequently investigated the creole language, publishing its grammar in 1993.{{sfn|Kouwenberg|1994}}

== History ==
[[Berbice]] was settled in 1627 by the Dutchman [[Abraham van Peere]]. A few years later, [[Suriname]] was settled by Englishmen Lord Willoughby and Lawrence Hyde under a grant from the English King, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. In the beginning, therefore, Suriname was a British and Berbice a Dutch possession.

On 22 April 1796 the British occupied the territory. On 27 March 1802 Berbice was restored to the Batavian Republic (the then-current name of the Netherlands). In September 1803 the British occupied the territory again. On 13 August 1814 Berbice became a British colony. The colony was formally ceded to Britain by the Netherlands on 20 November 1815.

The Berbice slaves kept speaking a [[Dutch-based creole languages|Dutch-based creole]] among themselves, until the language came in decay in the 20th century. As of 1993 there were some 4 or 5 elderly speakers of the language, although other sources report tens of speakers.

Berbice Creole Dutch was, as are the also extinct ''[[Negerhollands]]'' and [[Skepi Creole Dutch]] (with a similar preservation status as Berbice Dutch), not based on [[Hollandic dialect]] of Dutch (the dialect that is closest to the modern standard of the [[Dutch Language Union]]) but on [[Zeelandic]].

The last speakers of this language were found in the 1970s by Professor Ian Robertson of the University of the West Indies. These speakers were living on the upper reaches of the [[Berbice River]] in and around the area of the Wiruni Creek. The last known Berbice Dutch Creole speaker is Bertha Bell, who was 103 years old when last interviewed by Ian Robertson and a UWI linguistics research team in March 2004.

What is remarkable about this language is that it survived on the upper reaches of the Berbice River, the areas around which the old Dutch colony of Berbice was concentrated prior to a shift to the coast in the late 18th century. One-third of the basic words in Berbice Dutch Creole, including words for 'eat', 'know', 'speak' are of [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] origin in [[West Africa]], from a single language-cluster, the [[Ijaw languages|Eastern Ijaw languages]].

==Extinction==
In February 2010, the language was declared officially extinct, according to an article in the upcoming March issue of the Dutch edition of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine. In the 80's there was still a small number of Berbice speakers in Guyana but, since was discovered that the last speaker died in 2005, the authoritative international language database ''[[Ethnologue]]'' had declared it extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/dutch-rss-news/berbice-dutch-officially-extinct_26220.html "Berbice Dutch officially extinct"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Beaver''' or '''''Suck-tum-mah-kway''''' (1806–1880, [[Lenape|Delaware]]) was a Native American trapper for the [[American Fur Company]], a scout and guide, and interpreter who was fluent in English, and several European and Native American languages. After working as a scout, he settled among his people in the village of Beaverstown in Indian Territory, where they had been removed. &lt;ref name=ohs&gt;May, Jon D. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/B/BL001.html "Black Beaver (1806—1880)."] ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''. (retrieved 19 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with establishing the [[California Trail|California]] and [[Chisholm Trail|Chisholm]] trails. 

At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], he guided hundreds of Union troops and their long wagon train from [[Fort Arbuckle (Oklahoma)|Fort Arbuckle]] to Kansas to escape much larger Confederate forces; they had to travel more than 500 miles through [[Indian Territory]] to reach safety. None of the party or their animals or wagons was lost. Confederates destroyed his ranch, but Black Beaver eventually resettled in Indian Territory after the war, becoming a wealthy rancher in present-day [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]], Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=ohs/&gt; His former ranch site has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==Trapper and guide==
He was born in 1806 in present-day [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]], western Illinois, to the east of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and across the Mississippi River. Many Lenape had migrated here after the [[American Revolutionary War]] from their traditional territory along the [[Delaware River]] and coast in the mid-Atlantic states.  Black Beaver began trapping and trading beaver pelts as a teenager for the [[American Fur Company]] of [[John Jacob Astor]].&lt;ref name="Jenny"/&gt;

==Interpreter and scout==
Known to his own people as ''Suck-tum-mah-kway,'' the young man became fluent in English, French, and Spanish, in addition to his native Lenape and about eight other American Indian languages; he used sign language to communicate with tribes whose language he did not know. His skills were invaluable to the many white settlers and military expeditions that were traveling west. He served the [[Dodge-Leavenworth Expedition]] of 1834 and, during the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), led a unit of Indian volunteers as a captain in the U.S. Army.

When Captain [[Randolph B. Marcy]] escorted the first 500 emigrants from [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], Arkansas to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] during the [[gold rush]] days of 1849, he engaged Black Beaver as his guide. On the way back, Black Beaver, anxious to return home, took a shortcut across the prairie that reduced the two-month trip to two weeks. Thousands of emigrants followed this route to the west; it became known as the California Trail.&lt;ref name="Jenny" /&gt;

After that he settled near [[Fort Arbuckle (Oklahoma)|Fort Arbuckle]], in south-central Indian Territory, becoming chief of a Lenape village called Beaverstown.&lt;ref name=ohs/&gt; During 1849, 1852 and 1854, Black Beaver guided Randolph B. Marcy's exploration expeditions throughout Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Carol A. Lipscomb, "Delaware Indians," ''[[Handbook of Texas]]'' Online [https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmd08], accessed July 8, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1859 guide book ''The Prairie Traveler,'' Marcy wrote that Black Beaver
&lt;blockquote&gt;had visited nearly every point of interest within the limits of our unsettled territory. He had set his traps and spread his blanket upon the head waters of the Missouri and Columbia; and his wanderings had led him south to the Colorado and Gila, and thence to the shores of the Pacific in Southern California. His life had been that of a veritable cosmopolite, filled with scenes of intense and startling interest, bold and reckless adventure. He was with me two seasons in the capacity of guide, and I always found him perfectly reliable, brave, and competent. His reputation as a resolute, determined, and fearless warrior did not admit of question, yet I have never seen a man who wore his laurels with less vanity. The truth is my friend Beaver was one of those few heroes who never sounded his own trumpet; yet no one that knows him ever presumed to question his courage.&lt;ref name=beav&gt;[http://library.untraveledroad.com/Ch/Marcy/Prairie/6/Black.htm "Black Beaver"], in ''Randolph B. Marcy: The Prairie Traveler.'' (retrieved 19 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1860 Black Beaver was the wealthiest and most well-known Lenape in America. He had settled in present-day [[Caddo County, Oklahoma|Caddo County]], Oklahoma and lived at [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]], where the Lenape had been [[Indian Removal|removed]] from east of the Mississippi.

In May 1861, with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], General [[William H. Emory]], stationed at [[Fort Arbuckle (Oklahoma)|Fort Arbuckle]], learned that 6,000 Confederate troops were advancing toward his forces from Texas and Arkansas. He gathered the soldiers from forts Washita, Cobb and Arbuckle near Minco, but to escape to Kansas across the open prairie he needed a guide.&lt;ref name="Jenny" /&gt; Other Indian guides turned him down for fear of reprisal by the Confederates. In addition, several tribes had allied with the Confederates, who promised them an Indian state if they won the war.

Emory guaranteed Black Beaver that the federal government would reimburse him for any losses, so he agreed to help. He scouted the approaching Confederate troops and provided information for Emory to capture their advance guard, who were the first prisoners captured during the Civil War. Black Beaver guided over 800 Union soldiers, their prisoners, and 200 teamsters managing 80 wagons and 600 horses and mules in a mile-long train across 500&amp;nbsp;miles of open prairie to safety at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in eastern Kansas; he did not lose a single man, horse or wagon.&lt;ref name="Jenny" /&gt; He also freed multiple slaves from each of the 5 civilized tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Books in the Delaware archive&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate Army along with the angry tribes destroyed Black Beaver’s ranch and placed a bounty on his head. He stayed in Kansas for the rest of the war. His losses were never fully compensated by the United States government.

==Rancher==
After the war, Black Beaver and his friend [[Jesse Chisholm]] returned and converted part of the Native American path used by the Union Army into what became the [[Chisholm Trail]]. They collected and herded thousands of stray Texas longhorn cattle by the Trail to [[railheads]] in Kansas, from where the cattle were shipped East, where beef sold for ten times the price in the West. 

Black Beaver resettled at Anadarko, where he built the first brick home in the area. He had 300&amp;nbsp;acres of fenced and cultivated land as well as cattle, hogs and horses.&lt;ref name="Jenny"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Jenny says they collected 3 million stray cattle, but since a contemporary account in the ''Handbook of Texas Online'' reports a total of 5 million cattle were shipped over the trail during its entire use, the Jenny account appears to be based on an incorrect source. {{Handbook of Texas|id=ayc02|name="Chisholm Trail"|author=Donald E. Worcester|retrieved=December 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Black Beaver died at his home on May 8, 1880,&lt;ref name=ohs/&gt; and was buried on his ranch. In 1976 his grave was moved to [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma|Fort Sill]]. His former ranch site has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. In addition, he was the first inductee in the [[American Indian Hall of Fame]] in [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]], Oklahoma, which is located on part of his former ranch lands.&lt;ref name="Jenny"&gt;[http://www.edmondsun.com/opinion/x519219986/Black-Beaver-s-Oklahoma-legacy-should-not-be-forgotten/print Jenny, Walter, Jr. "Black Beaver’s Oklahoma legacy should not be forgotten"], ''The Edmond Sun''. 2 July 2007 (retrieved 19 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11852">In the [[formal language]]s of [[computer science]] and [[linguistics]], the '''Chomsky hierarchy'''  is a [[containment hierarchy]] of classes of [[formal grammar]]s.
This hierarchy of grammars was described by [[Noam Chomsky]] in&amp;nbsp;1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |authorlink=Noam Chomsky |date=1956 |title=Three models for the description of language |doi=10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 |journal=IRE Transactions on Information Theory |issue=2 |pages=113–124 |url=https://chomsky.info/wp-content/uploads/195609-.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Formal grammars ==
{{main article|Formal grammar}}
A formal grammar of this type consists of a finite set of ''[[Formal grammar#Introductory example|production rules]]'' (''left-hand side'' &amp;rarr; ''right-hand side''), where each side consists of a finite sequence of the following symbols:
* a finite set of ''[[nonterminal symbol]]s'' (indicating that some production rule can yet be applied)
* a finite set of ''[[terminal symbol]]s'' (indicating that no production rule can be applied)
* a ''start symbol'' (a distinguished nonterminal symbol)

A [[formal grammar]] provides an [[axiom schema]] for (or ''generates'') a ''formal language'', which is a (usually infinite) set of [[String (computer science)|finite-length sequences of symbols]]  that may be constructed by applying [[Production (computer science)|production rules]] to another sequence of symbols (which initially contains just the start symbol).  A rule may be applied by replacing an occurrence of the symbols on its left-hand side with those that appear on its right-hand side.  A sequence of rule applications is called a ''derivation''.  Such a grammar defines the formal language: all words consisting solely of terminal symbols which can be reached by a derivation from the start symbol.

Nonterminals are often represented by uppercase letters, terminals by lowercase letters, and the start symbol by {{mvar|S}}.  For example, the grammar with terminals {{math|{{mset|''a, b''}}}}, nonterminals {{math|{{mset|''S, A, B''}}}}, production rules
: {{mvar|S}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|AB}}
: {{mvar|S}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|&amp;epsilon;}}  (where {{mvar|&amp;epsilon;}} is the empty string)
: {{mvar|A}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|aS}}
: {{mvar|B}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|b}}
and start symbol {{mvar|S}}, defines the language of all words of the form &lt;math&gt; a^n b^n &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. {{mvar|n}} copies of {{mvar|a}} followed by {{mvar|n}} copies of {{mvar|b}}).

The following is a simpler grammar that defines the same language: 
Terminals {{math|{{mset|''a, b''}}}}, Nonterminals {{math|{{mset|''S''}}}}, Start symbol {{mvar|S}}, Production rules

As another example, a grammar for a toy subset of [[English language]] is given by:
;terminals: {{Sans-serif|{{mset|generate, hate, great, green, ideas, linguists}}}}
;nonterminals: {{math|{{mset|''SENTENCE, NOUNPHRASE, VERBPHRASE, NOUN, VERB, ADJ''}}}}
;production rules

: {{mvar|NOUNPHRASE}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|NOUN}}

: {{mvar|VERB}} &amp;rarr; {{Sans-serif|generate}}
: {{mvar|VERB}} &amp;rarr; {{Sans-serif|hate}}
: {{mvar|ADJ}} &amp;rarr; {{Sans-serif|great}}
: {{mvar|ADJ}} &amp;rarr; {{Sans-serif|green}}
and start symbol {{mvar|SENTENCE}}. An example derivation is
: {{mvar|SENTENCE}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|NOUNPHRASE VERBPHRASE}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|ADJ NOUNPHRASE VERBPHRASE}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|ADJ NOUN VERBPHRASE}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|ADJ NOUN VERB NOUNPHRASE}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ NOUNPHRASE}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ ADJ NOUNPHRASE}} &amp;rarr; {{mvar|ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN}} &amp;rarr; great {{mvar|NOUN VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN}} &amp;rarr; great linguists {{mvar|VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN}} &amp;rarr; great linguists generate {{mvar|ADJ ADJ NOUN}} &amp;rarr; great linguists generate great {{mvar| ADJ NOUN}} &amp;rarr; great linguists generate great green {{mvar|NOUN}} &amp;rarr; great linguists generate great green ideas.
Other sequences that can be derived from this grammar are: "''ideas hate great linguists''", and "''ideas generate''". While these sentences are nonsensical, they are syntactically correct. A syntactically incorrect sentence ( e.g. "''ideas ideas great hate''") cannot be derived from this grammar. See "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" for a similar example given by Chomsky in 1957; see [[Phrase structure grammar]] and [[Phrase structure rules]] for more [[natural language]] examples and the problems of [[formal grammar]] in that area.

== The hierarchy ==
[[Image:Chomsky-hierarchy.svg|thumb|right|200px|alt=The Chomsky hierarchy|Set inclusions described by the Chomsky hierarchy]]
The following table summarizes each of Chomsky's four types of grammars, the class of language it generates, the type of automaton that recognizes it, and the form its rules must have.

&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = non-terminal&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = non-terminal&lt;br /&gt;
|}

Note that the set of grammars corresponding to [[recursive language]]s is not a member of this hierarchy; these would be properly between Type-0 and Type-1.

Every regular language is context-free, every context-free language is context-sensitive, every context-sensitive language is recursive and every recursive language is recursively enumerable. These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable languages that are not context-sensitive, context-sensitive languages that are not context-free and context-free languages that are not regular.

===Type-0 grammars===
{{main|Unrestricted grammar}}

Type-0 grammars include all formal grammars. They generate exactly all languages that can be recognized by a [[Turing machine]]. These languages are also known as the [[recursively enumerable language|''recursively enumerable'']] or ''Turing-recognizable'' languages.&lt;ref name=Sipser-1st&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Michael Sipser]] | year = 1997 | title = Introduction to the Theory of Computation 1st |quote=The Church-Turing Thesis (Page 130) |publisher =Cengage Learning |isbn=0-534-94728-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that this is different from the [[recursive language]]s, which can be ''decided'' by an [[machine that always halts|always-halting Turing machine]].

===Type-1 grammars===
{{main|Context-sensitive grammar}}

Type-1 grammars generate [[context-sensitive language]]s.  These grammars have rules of the form &lt;math&gt;\alpha A\beta \rightarrow \alpha\gamma\beta&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; a nonterminal and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; strings of terminals and/or nonterminals. The strings &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; may be empty, but &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; must be nonempty.  The rule &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is allowed if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; does not appear on the right side of any rule.  The languages described by these grammars are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a [[linear bounded automaton]] (a nondeterministic Turing machine whose tape is bounded by a constant times the length of the input.)

===Type-2 grammars===
{{main|Context-free grammar}}

Type-2 grammars generate the [[context-free language]]s. These are defined by rules of the form &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \gamma&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; being a nonterminal and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; being a string of terminals and/or nonterminals. These languages are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a non-deterministic [[pushdown automaton]]. Context-free languages—or rather its subset of [[deterministic context-free language]]—are the theoretical basis for the phrase structure of most [[programming language]]s, though their syntax also includes context-sensitive name resolution due to declarations and [[Scope (computer science)|scope]]. Often a subset of grammars is used to make parsing easier, such as by an [[LL parser]].

===Type-3 grammars===
{{main|Regular grammar}}

Type-3 grammars generate the [[regular language]]s.  Such a grammar restricts its rules to a single nonterminal on the left-hand side and a right-hand side consisting of a single terminal, possibly followed by a single nonterminal (right regular). Alternatively, the right-hand side of the grammar can consist of a single terminal, possibly preceded by a single nonterminal (left regular). These generate the same languages. However, if left-regular rules and right-regular rules are combined, the language need no longer be regular. The rule &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is also allowed here if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; does not appear on the right side of any rule.  These languages are exactly all languages that can be decided by a [[finite state automaton]]. Additionally, this family of formal languages can be obtained by [[regular expression]]s. Regular languages are commonly used to define search patterns and the lexical structure of programming languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14844">'''Derived stems''' are a [[Linguistic morphology|morphological]] feature of [[verb]]s common to the [[Semitic languages]]. These derived verb stems are sometimes called '''augmentations''' or '''forms''' of the verb, or are identified by their [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name [[Modern Hebrew verb conjugation#Binyanim or conjugations|'''binyanim''']]. Semitic languages make extensive use of [[nonconcatenative morphology]], and most words share a set of two, three or four consonants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=John J.|date=1981-01-01|title=A Prosodic Theory of Nonconcatenative Morphology|jstor=4178229|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|volume=12|issue=3|pages=373–418}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprise a [[Semitic root|root]]&lt;ref name="simpson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/dissertations/Simpson_dissertation_2009.pdf|title=The Origin and Development of Nonconcatenative Morphology|year=2009|accessdate=2 January 2014|author=Andrew Kingsbury Simpson}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein each root may be the basis for a number of conceptually related words. Traditionally, words are thought of as being derived from these root consonants, but a view increasingly held by contemporary linguists sees stem words being the source of derivations rather than consonantal roots.&lt;ref name="simpson" /&gt; Regardless, each language features a number of set patterns for deriving verb stems from a given root or underived stem. Stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs, albeit often semantically related, and each is the basis for its own [[Verb conjugation|conjugational]] paradigm. As a result, these derived stems are part of the system of [[derivational morphology]], not part of the [[inflection]]al system.

Typically, one stem is associated with the ordinary simple [[Active voice|active]] verbs while others may be canonically associated with other grammatical functions such as the [[Passive voice|passive]], the [[causative]], the [[Intensive word form|intensive]], the [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]], etc., or combinations thereof. These functions should not be taken as universal or absolute, but are better understood as relational, depending on the particular source of the derived stem.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Bat-El, Outi. "Semitic Templates." The Blackwell Companion to Phonology. van Oostendorp, Marc, Colin J. Ewen, Elizabeth Hume and Keren Rice (eds). Blackwell Publishing, 2011. Blackwell Reference Online.&lt;/ref&gt; These grammatical functions are also not present in all Semitic languages, [[Modern Aramaic]], for example has only two stems, one for monosyllabic verbs and the other for disyllabic verbs, with hardly any cases of related verbs in each stem.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoberman 49–64"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-2516-1_5|title=Formal properties of the conjugations in modern Aramaic|last=Hoberman|first=Robert D.|pages=49–64|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-2516-1_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], words containing the root √k-t-b have a meaning related to [[writing]] (in Hebrew, a [[Phonology|phonological]] process known as [[begadkefat]], alters the quality of certain consonants when they follow a vowel, so ''b'' becomes ''v and'' ''k'' becomes ''ḵ'' (a [[voiceless velar fricative]] like [[German language|German]] Ba''&lt;u&gt;ch&lt;/u&gt;''); the symbol ː indicates the preceding consonant is doubled or [[geminate]]). Thus:
* In the basic stem, "he wrote" in Arabic is "kataba", and in Hebrew is "katav".
* In a causative stem, "he dictated" in Arabic is "ʔaktaba" and in Hebrew is "hiḵtīv".
* In the passive stem, "it was written" in Arabic is "inkataba" and in Hebrew is "niḵtav".
* In a reflexive stem, "he corresponded" in Arabic is "kātaba" and in Hebrew is "hu hitkatːēv".
The following two tables show the full paradigm of templates for the nine most common Arabic stems and the seven most common Hebrew stems, and illustrate some of the different meanings and functions that stems can have.

The first column gives the traditional stem abbreviation used by [[Comparative linguistics|Comparative]] Semiticists and the second column gives typical stem names used in Arabic and Hebrew grammars; the Arabic system uses [[Roman numerals]], and the Hebrew uses binyanim forms with the root letters √p-ʕ-l (with ''p'' sometimes becoming ''f'' by [[begadkefat]]). The next columns give the canonical functions of each stem, and their templates (the three ''C''s stand in for the three ''Consonants'' of the root, and ''V'' stands for some ''V''owel). Finally, the meaning and form of the stems with the √k-t-b root is given in the [[Grammatical person|3rd person]] [[Grammatical gender|masculine]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]], which lacks [[inflection]]al [[affix]]es.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

The tD Stem for Arabic is not given for the √k-t-b root because it does not occur, illustrating that not each root has an actual form for each stem; in fact, √k-t-b has a more complete stem paradigm than many other roots.

In each Semitic language, the number of derived stems is different. In Hebrew there are [[Binyan|seven common ones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Aaron D.|date=2008-03-01|title=The Paradigm Root in Hebrew|url=https://academic.oup.com/jss/article-abstract/53/1/29/1729560/The-Paradigm-Root-in-Hebrew|journal=Journal of Semitic Studies|volume=53|issue=1|pages=29–41|doi=10.1093/jss/fgm043|issn=0022-4480}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Arabic there are [[Arabic verbs#Formation of derived stems .28.22forms.22.29|nine common forms]] and at least six rare ones;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:404064/component/escidoc:2079850/arabic_wright1896_1.pdf|title=A grammar of the Arabic language: translated from the German of Caspari, and edited with numerous additions and corrections|last=Wright|first=W.|publisher=Cambridge|year=1896|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] has [[Akkadian language#Verb patterns|thirteen common patterns]], [[Ugaritic]] has [[Ugaritic grammar#Patterns|ten]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] has [[Syriac language#Verbs|six]], [[Modern Aramaic]] has two,&lt;ref name="Hoberman 49–64"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; and so on.

==Comparative Morphology==
There are different ways of naming stems, most systems classify stems by their morphological patterns but others simply number them. In Arabic, a system using Roman numerals is frequently used, as well as a more traditional system where the forms with the root letters √f-ʕ-l (roughly meaning "to do") are used as names of each stem. Hebrew also uses this latter system, although the [[cognate]] root used is √p-ʕ-l (with ''p'' sometimes surfacing as ''f'' by [[begadkefat]]). In Akkadian, forms with the √p-r-s root "to decide" are most often used. The convention using Latin letter abbreviations (such as G, Dt and Š) is a morphological shorthand used most often by [[Comparative linguistics|comparative]] [[Semitic languages|Semiticists]], and emphasizes the relationships between stems within and between languages. 
* '''G''' Stem is the base stem, from the German '''G'''rund ("''ground''")  
* '''D''' Stem typically has a '''D'''oubled second root letter  
* '''L''' Stem typically '''L'''engthens the first vowel 
* '''N''' Stem has a prefix with '''N''' 
* '''Š''' Stem has a prefix with '''Š''' ([[Voiceless alveolar fricative|ʃ]] pronounced like English ''sh''), '''S''', '''H''', or '''ʔ''' (the [[glottal stop]]).  
* '''t''' Stems (such as '''tG''', '''tD''', and '''Št''') have an affix with '''t'''.
The following table compares some of the important stems of six different Semitic languages: [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Biblical Hebrew]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Standard Arabic]], [[Ge'ez|Geʿez]], and [[Shehri language|Shehri]] (aka Jibbali), representing different Semitic subfamilies. By examining these and a few other forms, and using the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] and [[internal reconstruction]], the Grammatical Function and Template for the [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] derived stems have been [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[asterisk]] (*) in the Proto-Semitic Template column indicates that these forms are hypothetical and reconstructed.

Because the L Stem is only attested in the geographically and genetically proximate Arabic and [[South Semitic languages|South Semitic]] languages, it is thought to be a later innovation, not present in Proto-Semitic. By contrast, since separate but morphologically similar '''Št''' and '''ŠtG''' Stems are attested in the relatively distantly related Akkadian and Shehri, these are posited to have been different stems in Proto-Semitic, but to have merged in most later Semitic languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Dónal Meirgeach Mac Conmara''', 18th-century [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]].

Mac Conmara was a native of Irrul, south-west [[County Mayo]]. His nickname, ''Meirgeach'', means ''freckled''. He was forced by his father to marry a wealthy girl called Sile Ni Mhaille from Drumainn, "but afterwards continued to frequent a girl of the Fergus family from Carrowmore, with whom he was in love. When this fact was discovered, he went into 'exile', to Tipperary. He is credited with the authorship of the well-known song, "An Ghaoth Andeas" ("The South Wind"), which asks the wind to carry a kiss from him to his native province" in a composition of forty-eight lines.

'''Early New High German''' ('''ENHG''') is a term for the period  in the history of the [[German language]], generally defined, following [[Wilhelm Scherer]],{{sfn|Scherer|1878|p=13}} as the period 1350 to 1650.{{sfn|Wells|1987|p=23|ps=. "1350–1650... seems the most widely accepted dating."}}

The term is the standard translation of the German {{lang|de|Frühneuhochdeutsch}} (Fnhd., Frnhd.), introduced by Scherer. The term ''Early Modern High German'' is also occasionally used for this period (but the abbreviation EMHG is generally used for ''[[Middle High German|Early Middle High German]]'').

==Periodisation==
[[File:Luther 1534, Genesis I.jpg|thumb|The opening page of the Book of Genesis in Martin Luther's Bible translation of 1534, published by Hans Luft]]
The start and end dates of ENHG are, like all linguistic [[periodisation]]s, somewhat arbitrary. In spite of many alternative suggestions, Scherer's dates still command widespread acceptance.{{sfn|Roelke|1998|ps=. lists the various suggestions.}} Linguistically, the mid 14th-century is marked by the phonological changes to the [[vowel|vowel system]] that characterise the modern standard language; the mid 17th sees the loss of status for regional forms of language, and the triumph of German over [[Latin]] as the dominant, and then sole, language for public discourse.

Scherer's dates also have the merit of coinciding with two major demographic catastrophes with linguistic consequences: the [[Black Death]], and the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Arguably, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, by ending religious wars and creating a Germany of many small sovereign states, brought about the essential political conditions for the final development of a universally acceptable standard language in the subsequent [[New High German]] period.

Alternative periodisations take the period to begin later, such as the invention of [[movable type|printing with moveable type]] in the 1450s.{{sfn|Wells|1987|p=25}}

==Geographical variation==
There was no standard Early New High German, and all forms of language display some local or regional characteristics. However, there was increasing harmonisation in the written and printed word, the start of developments towards the unified standard which was [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the New High German period.
===The Dialects===
With the end of [[Ostsiedlung|eastward expansion]], the geographical spread and the [[dialect]] map of German in the ENHG period remained the same as at the close of the MHG period.{{sfn|Schmidt|2013|page=349}}

==={{lang|de|Druckersprachen}}, "printers' languages"===
[[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb| A printing press, {{circa|1568}}]]
Since the printers had a commercial interest in making their texts acceptable to a wide readership, they often strove to avoid purely local forms of language.{{sfn|Bach|1965|page=254}} This gave rise to so-called {{lang|de|Druckersprachen}} ("printers' languages"), which are not necessarily identical to the spoken dialect of the town where the press was located.{{sfn|Schmidt|2013|page=349}} The most important centres of printing, with their regional {{lang|de|Druckersprachen}} are:
*'''[[West Central German]]''': [[Frankfurt]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Cologne]]
*'''[[East Central German]]''': [[Wittenberg]], [[Erfurt]], [[Leipzig]]
*'''[[Swabian German|Swabian]]''': [[Augsburg]], [[Ulm]], [[Tübingen]]
*'''[[Alemannic German|Alemannic]]''': [[Basel]], [[Strassburg]], [[Zürich]]
*'''[[East Franconian German|East Franconian]]''': [[Nuremberg]], [[Bamberg]], [[Würzburg]]
*'''[[Bavarian dialects|Austro-Bavarian]]''': [[Ingolstadt]], [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2013|page=350}}

===Chancery Languages===
While the language of the printers remained regional, the period saw the gradual development of two forms of German (one Upper German, one Central German), which were supra-regional: the {{lang|de|Schriftsprachen}} ("written languages", "documentary languages") of the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chanceries]] of the two main political centres. {{sfn|Keller|1978|pages=365–368}}
* The {{lang|gmh|gemaine tiutsch}} ("common German") of the [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]] of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]] and his successors in [[Prague]] and then Vienna.
* The [[East Central German]] of the Chancery of the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in [[Meissen]]
The language of these centres had influence well beyond their own territorial and dialect boundaries. 

The influence of the Saxon Chancery was due in part to its adoption for his own published works by Martin Luther, who stated, "{{lang|de|Ich rede nach der sächsischen Canzley, welcher nachfolgen alle Fürsten und Könige in Deutschland}}" ("My language is based on that of the Saxon Chancery, which is followed by all the princes and kings in Germany").{{sfn|Luther|1566|loc=1040}}

He also recognized the standardising force of the two chanceries: "{{lang|de|Kaiser Maximilian und Kurf. Friedrich, H. zu Sachsen etc. haben im römischen Reich die deutschen Sprachen also in eine gewisse Sprache gezogen}}" ("The Emperor Maximilian and [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Duke Frederick, Elector of Saxony etc.]], have drawn the languages of Germany together").{{sfn|Luther|1566|loc=1040}}

===Low German===
[[Middle Low German]], spoken across the whole of [[Northern Germany]] north of the [[Benrath Line]] in the [[Middle Ages]], was a distinct [[West Germanic]] language. From the start of the 16th century, however, High German came increasingly to be used in this area not only in writing, but also in the pulpit and in schools. By the end of the ENHG period Low German had almost completely ceased to be used in writing or in formal and public speech, and had become the low status variant in a [[diglossia|diglossic]] situation, with High German as the high status variant.{{sfn|Hartweg|Wegera|2005|p=34}}

==Phonology and orthography==
For a number of reasons it is not possible to give a single phonological system for ENHG:
* dialectal variation
* the differing times at which individual dialects introduced even shared sound changes
* the lack of a prestige variant (such as the "Dichtersprache" provides for [[Middle High German]])
Also, the difficulty of deriving phonological information from the complexity of ENHG orthography means that many reference works do not treat orthography and phonology separately for this period.{{sfn|Ebert|Reichmann|Solms|Wegera|1993|pages=13–17|ps=, has detailed discussion of the issues.|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LcUiAAAAQBAJ]}}

===Vowels===
The MHG vowel system undergoes significant changes in the transition to ENHG and their uneven geographical distribution has served to further differentiate the modern dialects.

====Diphthongisation====
[[File:ENHG diphthongisation.jpg|thumb|The diphthongisation of long vowels in ENHG]]
The long high vowels {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/uː/}} and {{IPA|/yː/}} (spelt {{angle bracket|î}}, {{angle bracket|û}} and {{angle bracket|iu}}) are [[diphthong]]ised to {{IPA|/aɪ/}}, {{IPA|/aʊ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔʏ/}}. spelt {{angle bracket|ei}}, {{angle bracket|au}} and {{angle bracket|eu/äu}}. They thus fall together with the original MHG diphthongs {{angle bracket|ei}}, {{angle bracket|ou}} and {{angle bracket|öu}} {{IPA|/øy/}}, which are all lowered.

Examples:
*MHG ''snîden'' ("to cut") &gt; NHG ''schneiden''
*MHG ''hût'' ("skin") &gt; NHG ''Haut''
*MHG ''liute'' ("people") &gt; NHG ''Leute''.

This change started as early as the 12th century in Upper Bavarian and only reached Moselle Franconian in the 16th century. It does not affect Alemannic or Ripuarian dialects, which still retain the original long vowels. The map shows the distribution and chronology of this sound change.{{sfn|Hartweg|Wegara|2005|pp=134–136}}

====Monophthongisation====
The MHG falling diphthongs {{IPA|/iə/}}, {{IPA|/uə/}} and {{IPA|/yə/}} (spelt {{angle bracket|ie}}, {{angle bracket|uo}} and {{angle bracket|üe}}) are [[monophthong]]ised, replacing the long high vowels lost in the diphthongisation. In the case of {{IPA|/iə/}} &gt; {{IPA|/iː/}} the MHG spelling is retained and in Modern German {{angle bracket|ie}} indicates the long vowel.

Examples:
*MHG ''liebe'' ("love) &gt; NHG ''Liebe'' {{IPA|/liːbə/}} 
*MHG ''bruoder'' ("brother") &gt; NHG ''Bruder'' {{IPA|/bruːdər/}} 
*MHG ''brüeder'' ("brothers") &gt; NHG ''Brüder'' {{IPA|/bryːdər/}} 

This change, sometimes called the Central German Monophthongisation, affects mainly the Central German dialects, along with South Franconian and East Franconian. The other Upper German dialects largely retain the original diphthongs.{{sfn|Hartweg|Wegara|2005|pp=136}}{{sfn|Wolf|1985|p=1310}}

====Changes in Vowel Quantity====
There are two changes in vowel quantity in ENHG, the lengthening of short vowels and the shortening of long vowel. Both show wide variation between dialects, but appear earlier and more completely in Central German dialects. Many individual words form exceptions to these changes, though the lengthening is carried out more consistently.{{sfn|von Kienle|1969|p=37}}{{sfn|Waterman|1966|p=103}}{{sfn|Hartweg|Wegera|2005|p=137}}

'''1. Lengthening''':  MHG short vowels in open syllables (that is, syllables which end in a vowel) tend to be lengthened in the ENHG period. This is not reflected directly in spelling, but it is the source of the Modern German spelling convention that a vowel ending a syllable is always long.{{sfn|von Kienle|1969|pp=37–40}}

Examples:
*MHG ''sagen'' {{IPA|/zagən/}} ("to say") &gt; NHG ''sagen'' {{IPA|/zaːgən/}} 
*MHG ''übel'' {{IPA|/ybəl/}} ("evil") &gt; NHG ''Übel'' {{IPA|/yːbəl/}}

'''2. Shortening''': MHG long vowels tend to be shortened in the ENHG period before certain consonants ({{IPA|m}}, {{IPA|t}} and others) and before certainconsonant combinations ({{IPA|/xt/}}, {{IPA|/ft/}}, and {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/r/}} followed by another consonant).{{sfn|von Kienle|1969|pp=40–42}}

Examples:
*MHG ''hât'' ("has") &gt; NHG ''hat''
*MHG ''dâhte'' ("thought") &gt; NHG ''dachte''
*MHG ''lêrche'' ("lark") &gt; NHG ''Lerche''
*MHG ''jâmer'' ("suffering") &gt; NHG ''Jammer''
This shortening seems to have taken place later than the monophthongisation, since the long vowels which result from that change are often shortened.

Examples:
*MHG ''muoter'' ("mother" &gt; NHG ''Mutter'' (via {{IPA|/muːtər/}})
*MHG ''lieht'' ("light" &gt; NHG ''Licht'' (via {{IPA|/liːxt/}})

===Consonants===
The overall consonant system of German remains largely unchanged in the transition from MHG to  Modern German. However, in many cases sounds changed in particular environments and therefore changed in distribution.{{sfn|Wolf|1985|p=1310}} Some of the more significant are the following. (In addition there are many other changes in particular dialects or in particular words.)
====/s/====
#MHG had two sibilants, written {{angle bracket|s}}/{{angle bracket|ss}} and {{angle bracket|z}}/{{angle bracket|zz}}. The difference between these is uncertain, but in ENHG both fell together in /s/. (The affricate {{IPA|/t͡s/}}, for which {{angle bracket|z}} is also used, remained unchanged.)
#Before vowels this {{IPA|/s/}} becomes voiced to {{IPA|/z/}}, e.g. MHG ''sehen'' {{IPA|/sehən/}} ("to see")  &gt; NHG ''sehen'' {{IPA|/zeːən/}}.
#Initially before consonants {{IPA|/s/}} becomes {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, indicated by the grapheme &lt;sch&gt;, e.g. MHG ''snîden'' ("to cut") &gt; NHG ''schneiden'' . Before /p/ and /t/ this is not indicated in spelling, e.g. MHG ''stein'' ("stone") &gt; NHG ''Stein'' {{IPA|/ʃtain/}}.{{sfn|Hartweg|Wegara|2005|pp=145–6}}

====/w/====
#In initial position the blibalial fricative {{IPA|/w/}} becomes the labio-dental {{IPA|/v/}}, though this is not reflected in any change in spelling, e.g. MHG ''wil'' ("want to") &gt; NHG ''will'' {{IPA|/vil/}}. In a few words, this also takes place between vowels, e.g. ''ewig'' {{IPA|/eːvig/}} ("eternal").
#Otherwise it is either lost, e.g. MHG ''snėwes'' ("of the snow") &gt; NHG ''Schnees'', or forms a diphthong with a neighbouring vowel (e.g. MHG ''brâwe'' ("brow") &gt; NHG ''Braue''.{{sfn|Hartweg|Wegara|2005|pp=146–7}}

====/h/====
#Medial /h/ is lost, though it remains in spelling to indicate the length of the preceding vowel, e.g. MHG ''sehen'' {{IPA|/sehən/}} ("to see") &gt; NHG ''sehen'' {{IPA|/zeːən/}}.{{sfn|Hartweg|Wegara|2005|pp=147}}

The loss of {{IPA|/w/}} and the {{angle bracket|s}}:{{angle bracket|z}} contrast are the only structural changes to the consonant system.

==Morphology==
As with phonology, the range of variation between dialects and time periods makes it impossible to cite a unified morphology for ENHG.
The sound changes of the vowels had which brought consequent changes to
* [[verb conjugation]]s
* further simplification of the [[noun]] declensions

==Syntax==
The following are the main syntactical developments in ENHG:{{sfn|Hartweg|Wegera|2005|pp=173–178}}{{sfn|Wells|1987|pp=227–262}}{{sfn|Keller|1978|pp=434–442}}
*'''The Noun Phrase'''
**'''Increasing complexity''': in chancery documents noun phrases increasingly incorporate prepositional and participial phases, and this development spreads from there to other types of formal and official writing.
**'''Attributive genitive''': the so-called "[[English possessive|Saxon genitive]]", in which the genitive phrase precedes the noun (e.g. ''der sunnen schein'', literally "of-the-sun shine") increasingly makes way for the now standard post-nominal construction (e.g. ''der schein der sonne'', literally "the shine of the sun"), though it remains the norm where the noun in the genitive is a proper noun (''Marias Auto'').
*'''The Verb Phrase'''
**'''Increasing complexity''': more complex verbal constructions with participles and infinitives.
**'''Verb position''': the positioning of verbal components characteristic of NHG (finite verb second in main clauses, first in subordinate clauses; non-finite verb forms in clause-final position) gradually becomes firmly established.
**'''Decline of the preterite''': an earlier development in the spoken language (especially in Upper German), the replacement of simple preterite forms by perfect forms with an auxiliary verb and the past participle becomes increasingly common from the 17th century.
**'''Negation''': double negation ceases to be acceptable as an intensified negation; the enclitic negative particle ''ne/en'' falls out of use and an adverb of negation (''nicht'', ''nie'') becomes obligatory (e.g.MHG ''ine weiz (niht)'', ENHG ''ich weiss nicht'', "I don't know").
*'''Case government'''
**'''Decline of the genitive''': Verbs which take a genitive object increasingly replace this with an accusative object or a prepositional phrase. Prepositions which govern the genitive likewise tend to switch to the accusative.

==Literature==
{{main|Early Modern German literature}}
The period saw the invention of [[printing]] with moveable type (c.1455) and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] (from 1517). Both of these were significant contributors to the development of the Modern German Standard language, as they further promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area  &amp;mdash; even the illiterate, who were read ''to''. The most important single text of the period was [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s [[Luther Bible|Bible translation]], the first part of which was published in 1522, though this is now not credited with the central role in creating the standard that was once attributed to it. This is also the first period in which [[prose]] works, both literary and discursive, became more numerous and more important than [[poetry|verse]].

|So he maintained himself in great state, jousting, tourneying and travelling around with the King’s Court, and losing much money thereby.  His friends, soon noticing that he was in danger of losing more than his means could bear, thought of giving him a wife, in the hope that she would curb his expenditure.  When they suggested this to him, he was highly pleased, and he promised to follow their advice; and so they began to search for a suitable spouse.

'''Elisabeth Wilhelmina Johanna (Betty) Couperus-Baud''' ([[History of Jakarta|Batavia]], 30 October 1867 – [[The Hague]], 18 March 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{Nl}} [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/bast002loui01_01/bast002loui01_01_0031.php Louis Couperus. Een biografie], F.J. Bastet, p. 693. Website [[Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren|DBNL]].&lt;/ref&gt;), was a Dutch [[translator]]. She was the wife of the Dutch writer [[Louis Couperus]] (1863–1923).

==Biography==
[[File:Elisabeth Couperus-Baud.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Elisabeth Couperus-Baud as a child]]
Couperus-Baud was the daughter of Jan Carel Willem Ricus Theodore Baud (1838–1883), an assistant [[Resident (title)|resident]] at [[Jatinegara|Meester Cornelis]] ([[Dutch East Indies]]) and his cousin Johanna Wilhelmina Petronella Steenstra Toussaint (1844–1927). In 1890 she published, in the Dutch magazine "Nederland", a short story called ''Een galavoorstelling''.&lt;ref name="vorige"&gt;{{nl}} [http://vorige.nrc.nl/krant/article1545664.ece/Liefde_van_alleen_de_ziel 'Liefde van alleen de ziel'], in NRC.nl&lt;/ref&gt; She married in 1891 her cousin, Louis Couperus, son of John Ricus Couperus (1816–1902) and [[Jonkheer|jkvr.]] Catharina Geertruida Reynst (1829–1893). Louis Couperus wrote about Elisabeth Couperus-Baud in his novel ''De zwaluwen neergestreken'': ''We are [[Cousin marriage|cousins]] and played together as children. We still own photographs of ourselves together, when we were young.''&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} 'Een vreemde ervaring die Couperus verwerkte in de Stille Kracht', in ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', 22 August 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 Louis Couperus received a letter from [[Oscar Wilde]], in which he was complemented with his novel ''Noodlot''; this book was translated into English by [[Clara Bell]].

As a result of the correspondence Elisabeth Couperus-Baud was asked to translate Wilde's book ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Nl}} 'Hoofdmomenten uit Louis Couperus' leven en werken', in ''De Sumatra Post'', 26 February 1932&lt;/ref&gt; After her marriage to Louis Couperus, Couperus-Baud was active as a critic of her husband's work and made readable copies of his handwritings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Nl}} [http://www.couperusmuseum.org/12_expo.html Elisabeth Couperus-Baud, een expositie over de vrouw achter de schrijver] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729180920/http://www.couperusmuseum.org/12_expo.html |date=29 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In time Couperus-Baud made numerous translations; she translated French, German, English, Spanish and Italian manuscripts. To her publisher, L.J. Veen, she wrote: everything you want ("Comme vous voulez").&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1401/ad/integration/nmc/frameset/varia/kobala_article.dhtml?artid=781612 De vrouw naast Louis Couperus], in the [[Algemeen Dagblad]], 12 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 she wrote the first of what had to become a series of travel letters in the Dutch magazine ''Hollandia'', however only one letter was published. From 1915 onwards, when she and her husband had returned from their stay abroad, Couperus-Baud edited manuscripts and changed them into plays that could be performed on stage.

After the death of Louis Couperus the "Louis Couperus Genootschap" was founded in 1928 (in [[Hilversum]]). Chairman of the foundation was writer [[Henri van Booven]], while Elisabeth Couperus-Baud was appointed chairman of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} 'Genootschap Louis Couperus. Oprichtingsvergadering te Hilversum', in the ''[[Algemeen Handelsblad]]'', 18 December 1929&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of her husband she took his place as a member of the board of directors of the Dutch magazine "Groot Nederland".&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} ''[[De Tijd (Netherlands)|De Tijd]]'', 26 March 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} 'Kunst en Letteren. Couperus souvenirs', in the ''Indische Courant'', 24 October 1923&lt;/ref&gt; She died as a poor widow in a [[Pension (lodging)|pension]] in [[The Hague]], owned by Mrs. Stracker and Mrs. Teillers and her ashes were buried at the cemetery Oud Eik en Duinen in The Hague.

From October 2001 – April 2002 an exhibition about Elisabeth Couperus-Baud was held in and organized by the [[Louis Couperus Museum]]. Special attention was paid to Couperus-Bauds marriage with a suspected gay husband and her way of dealing with this.&lt;ref name="vorige" /&gt; In 2007 a novel, written by Sophie Zijlstra, called ''Mevrouw Couperus'', was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://hupnos0.blogspot.nl/2008/02/mevrouw-couperus.html Mevrouw Couperus, terug naar de hypnosebibliotheek]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch writer [[Gerard Reve]] wrote about her: ''She had to endure quite a lot'' (in a lecture he held called "Het geheim van Louis Couperus" (The secret of Louis Couperus)) and Frédéric Bastet, biographer of Couperus, said: ''Zij kwam veel tekort'' (she could not live life to the fullest).&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.volkskrant.nl/wca_item/boeken_detail/453/43163/Mevrouw-Couperus.html 'Mevrouw Couperus'], in ''[[de Volkskrant]]'', 31 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rosa bonheur horse fair 1835 55.jpg|thumb|''[[The Horse Fair]]'' - a depiction of the Paris horse market in the 1850s]]
[[File:A Horse and His Trader.jpg|thumb|A Horse and His Trader]]
'''Horse trading''', in its literal sense, refers to the buying and selling of [[horse]]s, also called "horse dealing.” Due to the difficulties in evaluating the merits of a horse offered for sale, the sale of horses offered great opportunities for dishonesty, leading to use of the term ''horse trading'' (or ''horsetrading'') to refer to complex [[bargaining]] or other transactions, such as political [[vote trading]]. It was expected that horse sellers would capitalize on these opportunities and so those who dealt in horses gained a reputation for underhanded business practices.

== Etymology ==
As standards for ethical business declined in the United States in the [[Gilded Age]], the activities of horse traders came increasingly to be seen as the natural and, in part, desirable product of a competitive market rather than as symptoms of moral depravity. In an 1893 ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial criticizing a proposed law to make it illegal for a newspaper to falsely state its circulation figures, the author declared that "if the lying were stopped by law, the business of horse trading would come to an end, and the country taverns and groceries in the Winter season would be deprived even of the limited eventfulness which they now enjoy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03EFDA1731E033A25751C2A9659C94629ED7CF |title=Lying and Legislation |publisher=The New York Times |date=March 22, 1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting this attitude, the term ''horse trading'' was widely adopted as a way to describe what might be seen as unethical business practices in a more positive light. It is likely the 1898 publication of [[Edward Noyes Westcott]]'s  ''[[David Harum]]'' – whose title character saw all business through the lens of horse trading – played a key role in this.

In a further development of meaning, ''horse trading'' has come to refer specifically to political [[vote trading]]. This is now the most common sense of the term, largely displacing the older term, [[logrolling]].

In some languages political bargaining is known as "cow trading" ({{Lang-de|[[:De:Kuhhandel|Kuhhandel]]}}, {{Lang-sv|[[:sv:Kohandel|Kohandel]]}}, {{Lang-fi|[[:fi:Lehmänkauppa|Lehmänkauppa]]}}). In [[Sweden]], the May 1933 agreement between the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Swedish Farmers' League]] is called that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:908757/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title= Political horse trading|publisher=Linné University|language=Swedish|author=Anders Fröjmark|date=2016|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huw Thomas Edwards''' (19 November [[1892 in Wales|1892]] – 8 November [[1970 in Wales|1970]]) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[trade union]] leader and politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=Paul|title=Huw T Edwards: British Labour and Welsh Socialism|date=2011|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=9780708323298|page=9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8HqvBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Huw+T.+Edwards+labour&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYhd7E98vaAhWpKcAKHcoIB_YQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Edwards was born in [[Rowen, Conwy|Rowen]] near the top of [[Tal y fan|Tal-y-fan Mountain]], [[North Wales]]. He was the youngest of seven children, all of whom could speak only [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Edwards' father was a quarryman who grew up with no education, being taught how to read and write by Edward's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; She died when Edwards was eight, after a period of poor health. After her death, the family moved and Edwards' father remarried within a year. From the age of ten, Edwards went to the quarry at [[Penmaenmawr]] with his father, at least during his holidays from school.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., pp. 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; He soon began to start working on a farm in [[Talybont, Bangor|Talybont]] near [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], where one of his brothers also worked.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before he was eighteen, Edwards left for [[Tonypandy]] in the [[South Wales coalfield|South Wales coalfields]]. He travelled by rail, via [[Chester]], and became aware of the urban, English, middle-class world outside of North Wales. When he arrived in [[Trealaw]], he found lodgings and a job as a [[dustman]] on the night shift at Clydach Vale No. 2 Pit in the [[Rhondda]] mines. Working at the mines, Edwards became familiar with various English-speaking migrants, and quickly picked up the language. Before Edwards arrived in the area, his cousin had been one of ten people killed in an explosion at [[Clydach Vale]]. Another cousin, with whom Edwards had become close friends, was killed in the [[Senghenydd colliery disaster]]: Edwards was a member of one of the rescue parties that recovered bodies, following the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., pp. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Edwards joined the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] (known as the Fed), but did not always involve himself with strike action.

==Military service and early career==

Edwards went away to fight in August 1914, at the age of twenty-one. He returned from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in March 1918, severely wounded and made to spend months in hospital. In September 1918, he was discharged and spent the last weeks of the war teaching gas drill to new recruits. After returning to civilian life on 10 December 1918, he stayed in [[Aberfan]] for a week, before returning to Penmaenmawr quarry. He joined the [[Workers' Union]] and the [[Independent Labour Party]]. After representing the quarry workers in a case of pay, Edwards joined the [[Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union|Dockers' Union]] in around 1920, leaving the [[Amalgamated Union of Quarryworkers and Steelworkers]], which represented most quarry workers. Edwards was dismissed from his job at the quarry, due to refusing to rejoin the quarryworkers' union after strike action.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., pp. 20-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Edwards became secretary of the Penmaenmawr branch of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]], which allowed him to meet with other union leaders. In 1927, he was elected to Penmaenmawr council.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., pp. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==

He was appointed the first chair of the [[Council for Wales and Monmouthshire]] in [[1949 in Wales|1949]]. He was in favour of a Welsh Parliament but initially did not support the [[Parliament for Wales campaign]] in the early 1950s although later he did join the campaign. He opposed the decision to flood the [[Tryweryn]] valley to create a [[reservoir]] to service [[Liverpool]]. In [[1956 in Wales|1956]] he bought the Welsh-language periodical, ''[[Y Faner]]'', in order to save it from liquidation. In 1958 he resigned from the Council for Wales and in 1959 he left the [[Wales Labour Party|Labour Party]] to join [[Plaid Cymru]] although he returned to the Labour fold in 1965. He was the first President of the [[Welsh Language Society]].

He published two autobiographical volumes in his native Welsh, ''Tros y Tresi'' (1956) and ''Troi'r Drol'' (1963). He was also a poet.

==Personal life==

In March 1920, Edwards married Margaret Owen, a Welsh-speaking woman from [[Rachub]], [[Bethesda, Gwynedd]]. They had known each other since Edwards was a boy, as she was his sister's best friend.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Paul, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hyphen''' ('''‐''') is a [[punctuation]] mark used to join [[word]]s and to separate [[syllable]]s of a single word.  The use of hyphens is called '''hyphenation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hyphen|title=''Hyphen'' Definition|publisher=[[dictionary.com]]|access-date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Non-hyphenated''' is an example of a hyphenated word. The hyphen should not be confused with [[dash]]es ([[figure dash|‒]], [[en dash|–]], [[em dash|—]], [[Horizontal bar (punctuation)|―]]), which are longer and have different uses, or with the [[minus sign]] ([[−]]), which is also longer in some contexts.

As an [[Orthography|orthographic]] concept, the hyphen is a single entity. In terms of [[character encoding]] and display, that entity is represented by any of several [[character (computing)|characters]] and [[glyph]]s (including '''hard hyphens''', '''soft''' or  '''optional hyphens''', and '''nonbreaking hyphens'''), depending on the context of use ([[#In computing|discussed below]]).

Although hyphens are not to be confused with [[Dash#En dash|en dashes]] and minus signs, there are some overlaps in [[#Use in English|usage]] (in which either a hyphen or an en dash may be acceptable, depending on user preference; [[#En dash, hyphen, or either one|discussed below]]) and in character encoding (which often uses the same character, called a "[[hyphen-minus]]", to represent both the hyphen and minus sign entities; [[#In computing|discussed below]]).

== Etymology ==
The term derives from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὑφ᾽ ἕν}} (''hyph’ hén''), contracted from {{lang|grc|ὑπό ἕν}} (''hypó hén''), "in one" (literally "under one").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|u%28fe%2Fn|ὑφέν|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hyphen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term {{lang|grc|(ἡ) ὑφέν}} ((''he'') ''hyphén''), was used for a [[Tie (typography)#Papyrological hyphen|tie-like]]  (‿) sign written below two consecutive letters to indicate that they belong to the same word (when it was necessary to avoid ambiguity before the [[Space (punctuation)|space]] was in regular use).

== Use in English ==
{{Selfref|For Wikipedia's own standards for hyphen use, see [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Hyphens]]}}
{{original research section|date=January 2016|reason=Almost nothing in this section is tied to reliable sources, and there's a great deal of prescriptivist punditry about "codification" of various "rules".}}

The [[English language]] does not have definitive hyphenation rules,&lt;ref name="Economist intro"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Economist Style Guide |edition=11th |date=2015 |editor-first=Ann |editor-last=Wroe |location=London / New York |publisher=Profile Books / PublicAffairs |page=74 |quote='''hyphens'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is no firm rule to help you decide which words are run together, hyphenated or left separate.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though various [[style guide]]s provide detailed usage recommendations, and have a significant amount of overlap in what they advise.  Hyphens are mostly used to break single words into parts, or to join ordinarily separate words into single words. Spaces are not placed between a hyphen and either of the elements it connects except when using a suspended or "hanging" hyphen that stands in for a repeated word (e.g., ''nineteenth- and {{nowrap|twentieth-century}} writers'').  Style conventions that apply to hyphens (and dashes) have evolved to support ease of reading in complex constructions; editors often accept deviations if they aid rather than hinder easy comprehension.

The use of the hyphen in [[English compound]] nouns and verbs has, in general, been steadily declining. Compounds that might once have been hyphenated are increasingly left with spaces or are combined into one word. Reflecting this changing usage, in 2007, the sixth edition of the ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' removed the hyphens from 16,000&amp;nbsp;entries, such as ''fig-leaf'' (now ''fig leaf''), ''pot-belly'' (now ''pot belly'') and ''pigeon-hole'' (now ''pigeonhole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7004661.stm |title=Small object of grammatical desire |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=[[BBC News]] |location=London |date=20 September 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The increasing prevalence of computer technology and the advent of the Internet have given rise to a subset of common nouns that might have been hyphenated in the past  (e.g. "[[toolbar]]", "[[hyperlink]]", "[[pastebin]]").

Despite decreased use, hyphenation remains the norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and, among some authors, with certain prefixes (see below). Hyphenation is also routinely used as part of [[syllabification]] in [[typographic alignment#Justified|justified]] texts to avoid unsightly spacing (especially in [[column (typography)|columns]] with narrow measure, as when used with [[newspaper]]s).

=== Separating ===

==== Justification and line-wrapping ====
When flowing text, it is sometimes preferable to break a word in half so that it continues on another line rather than moving the entire word to the next line. The word may be divided at the nearest break point between syllables ([[syllabification]]), and a hyphen inserted to indicate that the letters form a word fragment, rather than a full word. This allows more efficient use of paper, allows flush appearance of right-side margins ([[typographic alignment#Justified|justification]]) without oddly large word spaces, and decreases the problem of [[river (typography)|rivers]]. This kind of hyphenation is most useful when the width of the [[column (typography)|column]] (called the measure in typography) is very narrow. For example:

{|
|- valign="top"
| ''Justified text&lt;br /&gt;without hyphenation''
|
| ''Justified text&lt;br /&gt;with hyphenation''
|- valign="top"
| style="font-family: monospace; text-align: justify"|
We,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;therefore,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the&lt;br /&gt;
representatives of the United&lt;br /&gt;
States of America...
| style=width:3em;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| style="font-family: monospace; text-align: justify;"|
We,&amp;nbsp;therefore,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;{{not a typo|represen-}}&lt;br /&gt;
tatives of&amp;nbsp;the United States &lt;br /&gt;
of America...
|}

The details of doing this properly are complex and language-dependent, and can interact with other [[Orthography|orthographic]] and [[typesetting]] practices. [[Hyphenation algorithm]]s, when employed in concert with dictionaries, are sufficient for all but the most formal texts.  See also [[Justification (typesetting)|justification]].

It may be necessary to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word [[use–mention distinction|being mentioned]] (as when used in a [[dictionary]]) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a [[critical edition]])—not only to control its [[word wrap]] behavior (which [[character encoding|encoding]] handles with [[#Hard and soft hyphens|hard and soft hyphens]] having the same [[glyph]]) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph). ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]''&lt;ref name="Gove1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gove|first=Philip Babcock|title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXR-tTsHo58C&amp;pg=PT23|accessdate=28 November 2014|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-201-7|page=14a, §&amp;nbsp;1.6.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Chambers Dictionary]]''&lt;ref name="Chambers2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chambers|first=Allied|title=The Chambers Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&amp;pg=PP38|accessdate=28 November 2014|year=2006|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=9788186062258|page=xxxviii, §&amp;nbsp;8}}&lt;/ref&gt; use a [[double hyphen]] for integral hyphens and a single hyphen for line-breaks, whereas Kromhout's Afrikaans–English dictionary uses the opposite convention.&lt;ref name="Kromhout2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kromhout|first=Jan|title=Afrikaans-English, English-Afrikaans Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1H6BP6SMMGkC&amp;pg=PA182|accessdate=28 November 2014|year=2001|publisher=Hippocrene Books|isbn=978-0-7818-0846-0|page=182, §&amp;nbsp;5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Concise Oxford Dictionary]] (fifth edition)'' repeated an integral hyphen at the start of the following line.&lt;ref name="Hartmann1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartmann|first=R.

==== Prefixes and suffixes ====
[[Prefix]]es (such as ''de-'', ''pre-'', ''re-'', and ''non-''&lt;ref name="footnote_prefix_list"&gt;A fairly comprehensive list, although not exhaustive, is given at [[Prefix#List of English derivational prefixes|Prefix &gt; List of English derivational prefixes]].&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[suffix]]es (such as ''{{nowrap|-less}}'', ''{{nowrap|-like}}'', ''{{nowrap|-ness}}'', and ''{{nowrap|-hood}}'') may or may not be hyphenated. (The unhyphenated style is also called ''closed up'' or ''solid''.) A [[rule of thumb]] is that they are not hyphenated unless the lack of a hyphen hurts clarity—specifically, clarity at first glance rather than clarity upon a second look or a moment's pause. The clear–unclear distinction involves some [[subjectivity]], because what is instantly clear to one reader may not be to another (depending on, for example, subject matter familiarity). Nonetheless, consensus among users of a language often reduces that subjectivity for many words. This is explained further below.

Many long-established words, such as ''disgusted'', ''degrade'', and ''refresh'', do not require a hyphen because they are fully fused to the point that their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other words, such as ''prewashed'' or ''repainted'', may not be ''quite'' so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they require no hyphen, because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the [[syllable]]s, and (2) if all such words were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous.

In contrast, for some other words, the closed-up style may not be as clear, and the hyphen can ensure clarity and avoid awkwardness, including odd appearance or misguided parsing of [[syllable]]s. An example of avoiding misguided parsing would be to hyphenate the word ''{{nowrap |co-worker}}'' (versus ''coworker'') to prevent the reader's eye being caught automatically by the letter group ''cow'' (which might suggest ''[[cattle|cow]]'' ({{IPAc-en|k|aʊ}}) before backtracking and reparsing occurred). In such cases, styling varies depending on individual preference, regional preference, occupational specialty, or [[style guide]] preference, because the definition of awkwardness for any given word depends on who is judging it.

Words for which prefix hyphenation is least subjective, to the point that closed-up style is widely rejected, are of several classes. One such class consists of a few words that require a hyphen to distinguish them from other words that would otherwise be [[homograph]]s, such as ''[[recreation]]'' (fun or sport) versus ''{{nowrap|re-creation}}'' (the act of creating again), ''retreat'' (turn back) versus ''{{nowrap|re-treat}}'' (give [[therapy]] again), and ''{{nowrap|un-ionized}}'' (not in [[ion]] form) versus ''unionized'' (organized into [[trade union]]s). The other classes are those in which the prefix is applied to (1) a [[proper noun|proper]] (capitalized) noun or adjective (''{{nowrap|un-American}}'', ''{{nowrap|de-Stalinisation}}'');&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.grammarmudge.cityslide.com/articles/article/426348/2805.htm | contribution = Hyphenated Words: A Guide | title = The Grammar Curmudgeon | publisher = City slide}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grammar book"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/hyphens.asp | title = Punctuation | publisher = Grammar book | contribution = Hyphens}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) an [[acronym]] (''{{nowrap|anti-[[tumor necrosis factors|TNF]] antibody}}'', ''{{nowrap|non-[[International System of Units|SI]] units}}''); or (3) a number (''{{nowrap|pre-1949 diplomacy}}'', ''{{nowrap|pre-1492 cartography}}'').

Style guides codify rules to minimize inconsistency, the ultimate goal of which is to have the style unnoticed by the reader (that is, to avoid catching the reader's eye, either with trivial differences or with a lot of superfluous hyphens). The style guide rules allow exceptions to avoid awkwardness. For example, a guide will typically say to follow dictionary X's style for any word entered therein, and for words not entered, to close up by default and thus hyphenate only to avoid awkwardness. Such a rule successfully codifies almost all choices and thus leaves little to discretion except a few rare or neologistic words, which are safely hyphenated. This ensures high intradocument and interdocument consistency. Rules about avoiding doubled vowels or doubled consonants are often mentioned in style guides. These appropriately cascade only downstream, not upstream, of the "follow dictionary X" rule, because most dictionaries close up many well-established doubled-letter pairs. (For example, any style that follows ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Collegiate Dictionary'' thus closes up ''preempt'', ''reexamine'', ''deemphasize'', ''nonnegotiable'', ''posttransfusion'', and hundreds of others.) As mentioned earlier, the definition of "awkwardness" for any given word is inherently subjective but nonetheless also subject to consensus. For example, ''reexamine'' and ''deemphasize'' are accepted as nonawkward by a broad consensus; to ''prefer'' the hyphenated styling is a matter of opinion, but to ''insist'' that the solid styling is awkward would be considered pedantic by many educated readers. However, some doublings attract smaller majorities than others in such a consensus; with the ''{{nowrap|co-worker}}''/''coworker'' example (mentioned earlier) or with ''antiinflammatory''/''{{nowrap|anti-inflammatory}}'', many readers may consider solid styling nonawkward whereas plenty of others don't, and in such cases, dictionary styles may vary (''[[Dorland's medical reference works|Dorland's]]'', ''antiinflammatory''; ''Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary'', ''{{nowrap|anti-inflammatory}}''). Tripled letters rarely occur, but when they do, the hyphen is considered mandatory (thus ''{{nowrap|shell-like}}'', not ''shelllike'').

There is a trend that over decades, words that once were hyphenated for clarity lose the hyphen as their familiarity grows. An excellent example is ''[[email]]''/''{{nowrap|e-mail}}''; the number of people who find ''email'' awkward dropped from the 1990s to the 2010s, and thus the hyphen has been dropped increasingly. For some instances, the consensus depends on occupational specialty or subspecialty. Although ''{{nowrap|[[proto-oncogene]]}}'' is still hyphenated by most users (and by both ''Dorland's'' and ''Merriam-Webster's Medical''), the solid styling (''protooncogene'') is gaining popularity, with oncologists and geneticists (for whom the term is most familiar) leading the way.

A hyphen can clarify that two adjacent [[vowel]]s—whether two of the same letter (e.g., ''oo'', ''ee'') or two different letters (e.g., ''ae'', ''ei'')—are pronounced separately rather than being merged in a [[diphthong]]. The question is how necessary the clarification is. Thus, hyphenated ''{{nowrap|de-escalate}}'' and ''{{nowrap|co-operation}}'' have plenty of support, consensus-wise (plenty of users consider their hyphens as not superfluous), although solid ''deescalate'' and ''cooperation'' have plenty of support as well (plenty of users consider the hyphens superfluous). Consensus for styling varies by class, subclass, and even by individual word, with the common theme being that internal punctuation drops out of any combination judged as instantly recognizable enough in its context not to need it. As classes, there are doubling (namely, ''aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, yy'') and nondoubling (for example, ''a+e, a+i, a+o; e+e, e+i, e+o''). Several subclasses exist. There are combinations that are not rare in English as diphthongs and also not rare as nondiphthongs for users willing to style prefixed words solidly (such as ''ee'' and ''ei''); regarding ''de+e/re+e/pre+e'' and ''de+i/re+i/pre+i'', nearly everyone agrees that some fully fused examples (such as ''reiterate'' and ''reinforce'') need no hyphen, but other examples have more evenly split pluralities (such as ''reexamine''/''{{nowrap|re-examine}}'' or ''deemphasize''/''{{nowrap|de-emphasize}}''). There are combinations that are rare in English as diphthongs (for example, ''aa'' and ''ii'') but not rare in prefixed words for those willing to style them solidly; and thus either they hardly need clarification within prefixed words (the solidification argument; thus ''intraarterial'' and ''antiinflammatory'') or they need a hyphen to avoid looking like rare diphthongs, which are "odd-looking" because rare (the hyphenation argument, thus ''{{nowrap|intra-arterial}}'' and ''{{nowrap|anti-inflammatory}}'').

A [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] can also sometimes be used, either to indicate nondiphthong status (e.g., ''coöperation'' and ''naïve'') or to indicate non-silent terminal -e (e.g., ''[[Brontë family|Brontë]]''), but there are several implicit boundaries on this style's use; it is now rare (its peak of popularity was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), and it was never applied extensively across the language (only a handful of examples, including ''coöperation'', ''naïve'', and ''Brontë'', are encountered with any appreciable frequency in English; for whatever reason, it never had any popularity in the ''de+e/re+e/pre+e'' or ''de+i/re+i/pre+i'' subclasses—thus never ''*reëxamine'', ''*reïterate'', ''*deëmphasize'', or others, although they might have been useful). Many users (and various dictionaries) consider the diaeresis optional in ''naive''/''naïve'' (because not necessary for the reader to recognize the word), and ''*na-ive'' draws attention to itself as a style that is simply never used (although comprehensible). For ''deity'' and ''deify'', only solid styling (no hyphen or diaeresis) is normative.

==== Syllabification and spelling ====
Hyphens are occasionally used to denote [[syllabification]], as in ''syl-la-bi-fi-ca-tion''. Various British and North American dictionaries use an [[interpunct]], sometimes called a "middle dot" or "hyphenation point", for this purpose, as in ''syl·la·bi·fi·ca·tion''. This allows the hyphen to be reserved only for places where a hard hyphen is intended (for example, ''{{nowrap|self-con·scious}}'', ''{{nowrap|un·self-con·scious}}'', ''{{nowrap|long-stand·ing}}''). Similarly, hyphens may be used to indicate a word is being or should be spelled. For example, ''W-O-R-D spells "word"''.

=== Joining ===

==== Compound modifiers ====
{{further|Compound modifier|English compound#Hyphenated compound modifiers}}
[[Compound modifier]]s are groups of two or more words that jointly modify the meaning of another word. When a compound modifier other than an [[adverb]]–[[adjective]] combination appears ''before'' a term, the compound modifier is often hyphenated to prevent misunderstanding, such as in ''{{nowrap|American-football}} player'' or ''{{nowrap|little-celebrated}} paintings''.  Without the hyphen, there is potential confusion about whether the writer means a "player of American football" or an "American player of football" and whether the writer means paintings that are "little celebrated" or "celebrated paintings" that are little.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 48. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compound modifiers can extend to three or more words, as in ''{{nowrap|ice-cream-flavored}} candy'', and can be adverbial as well as adjectival (''{{nowrap|spine-tinglingly}} frightening''). However, if the compound is a familiar one, it is usually unhyphenated.  For example, at least one style guide prefers the construction ''high school students'', to ''{{nowrap|high-school}} students''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jhsph.edu/publichealthnews/style_manual/h.html | title = Bloomberg School Style Manual | publisher = JHSPH | contribution = H}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the expression is technically ambiguous ("students of a high school"/"school students who are high"), it would normally be formulated differently if other than the first meaning were intended. Noun–noun compound modifiers may also be written without a hyphen when no confusion is likely: ''grade point average'' and ''department store manager''.&lt;ref name="IU Style Guide" /&gt;

When a compound modifier ''follows'' the term to which it applies, a hyphen is typically not used if the compound is a temporary compound. For example, "that gentleman is well respected", not "that gentleman is well-respected"; or "a patient-centered approach was used" but "the approach was patient centered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhv.edu/ac/newsletters/writing/grammartip2004.11.30.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109235952/http://www.uhv.edu/ac/newsletters/writing/grammartip2004.11.30.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 January 2010 |publisher=UHV |type=Grammar tip |date=2004-11-30 |title=Using Hyphens in Compound Adjectives (and Exceptions to the Rule) |first=John |last=Davis |accessdate=2010-01-05 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But permanent compounds, found as headwords in dictionaries, are treated as invariable, so if they are hyphenated in the cited dictionary, the hyphenation will be used in both attributive and predicative positions. For example, "A cost-effective method was used" and "The method was cost-effective" (''cost-effective'' is a permanent compound that is hyphenated as a headword in various dictionaries).  When one of the parts of the modifier is a [[proper noun]] or a [[proper adjective]], there is no hyphen (e.g., "a South American actor").&lt;ref name="Hyphenated Compound Words"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://englishplus.com/grammar/00000127.htm|title = Hyphenated Compound Words|accessdate = 2014-11-18|website = englishplus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the first modifier in a compound is an adverb ending in ''-ly'' (e.g., "a poorly written novel"), various style guides advise no hyphen.&lt;ref name="Hyphenated Compound Words" /&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=January 2016}} However, some do allow for this use. For example, ''[[The Economist]] Style Guide'' advises: "Adverbs do not need to be linked to participles or adjectives by hyphens in simple constructions .... Less common adverbs, including all those that end ''-ly'', are less likely to need hyphens".&lt;ref name="Economist 12"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Economist Style Guide |edition=11th |date=2015 |editor-first=Ann |editor-last=Wroe |location=London / New York |publisher=Profile Books / PublicAffairs |pages=77–78 |quote='''hyphens'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ... 12. Adverbs:  Adverbs do not need to be linked to participles or adjectives by hyphens in simple constructions [examples elided].  But if the adverb is one of two words together being used adjectivally, a hyphen may be needed [examples elided]. The hyphen is especially likely to be needed if the adverb is short and common, such as ''ill'', ''little'', ''much'' and ''well''. Less common adverbs, including all those that end ''-ly'', are less likely to need hyphens [example elided].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century, it was common to hyphenate adverb–adjective modifiers with the adverb ending in ''-ly'' (e.g., "a craftily-constructed chair"). However, this has become rare. For example, ''wholly owned subsidiary'' and ''quickly moving vehicle'' are unambiguous, because the adverbs clearly modify the adjectives: "quickly" cannot modify "vehicle".

However, if an adverb can also function as an adjective, then a hyphen may be or should be used for clarity, depending on the style guide.&lt;ref name="Grammar book" /&gt; For example, the phrase ''{{nowrap|more-important}} reasons'' ("reasons that are more important") is distinguished from ''more important reasons'' ("additional important reasons"), where ''more'' is an adjective. Similarly, ''{{nowrap|more-beautiful}} scenery'' (with a [[mass noun|mass-noun]]) is distinct from ''more beautiful scenery''. (In contrast, the hyphen in "a {{nowrap|more-important}} reason" is not necessary, because the syntax cannot be misinterpreted.) A few short and common words – such as ''well'', ''ill'', ''little'', and ''much'' – attract special attention in this category.&lt;ref name="Economist 12" /&gt; The hyphen in "well-[past_participled] noun", such as in "[[Cellular differentiation|well-differentiated cells]]", might reasonably be judged superfluous (the syntax is unlikely to be misinterpreted), yet plenty of style guides call for it. Because ''early'' has both adverbial and adjectival senses, its hyphenation can attract attention; some editors, due to comparison with ''advanced-stage disease'' and ''adult-onset disease'', like the parallelism of ''early-stage disease'' and ''early-onset disease''.  Similarly, the hyphen in ''little-celebrated paintings'' clarifies that one is not speaking of little paintings.

Hyphens are usually used to connect numbers and words in modifying phrases. Such is the case when used to describe dimensional measurements of weight, size, and time, under the rationale that, like other compound modifiers, they take hyphens in attributive position (before the modified noun),&lt;ref name="AMA10section8.3.1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al. (eds) |title=AMA Manual of Style |edition=10th |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |section=8.3.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; although not in predicative position (after the modified noun). This is applied whether numerals or words are used for the numbers. Thus ''{{nowrap|28-year-old}} woman'' and ''{{nowrap|twenty-eight-year-old}} woman'' or ''{{nowrap|32-foot}} wingspan'' and  ''{{nowrap|thirty-two-foot}} wingspan'', but ''the woman is 28 years old'' and ''a wingspan of 32 feet''.{{efn|name=Plural nouns|With numbers greater than two, where a plural noun would normally be used in an unhyphenated predicative position, the singular form of the noun is generally used in the hyphenated form used attributively. Thus ''a woman who is 28 years old'' becomes ''a {{nowrap|28-year-old}} woman''. There are occasional exceptions to this general rule, for instance with fractions (''a two-thirds majority'') and irregular plurals (''a two-criteria review'', ''a two-teeth bridge'').}} However, with symbols for [[SI]] units (such as ''[[metre|m]]'' or ''[[kilogram|kg]]'')—as opposed to the ''names'' of these units (such as ''[[metre]]'' or ''[[kilogram]]'')—both the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] and the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] recommend use without a hyphen: ''a 25&amp;nbsp;kg sphere''. When the units are spelled out, this recommendation does not apply: ''a {{nowrap|25-kilogram}} sphere'', ''a roll of {{nowrap|35-millimeter}} film''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf "The International System of Units (SI)"], [[BIPM|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf "Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)"], NIST Special Publication 811, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In spelled-out [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], hyphens are usually used when the fraction is used as an adjective but not when it is used as a noun: thus ''{{nowrap|two-thirds}} majority''{{efn|name=Plural nouns}} and ''{{nowrap|one-eighth}} portion'' but ''I drank two thirds of the bottle'' or ''I kept three quarters of it for myself''.&lt;ref name="APA6section4.13"&gt;{{Citation |author=American Psychological Association (APA) |authorlink=American Psychological Association |year=2010 |title=The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association |edition=6th |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC, USA |isbn=978-1-4338-0562-2 |url=http://apastyle.org/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at least one major style guide&lt;ref name="AMA10section8.3.1" /&gt; hyphenates spelled-out fractions invariably (whether adjective or noun).

In English, {{Anchor|En dash, hyphen, or either one}} an [[en dash]] ( – ) sometimes replaces the hyphen in hyphenated compounds if either of its constituent parts is already hyphenated or contains a space (for example, ''San Francisco–area residents'', ''hormone receptor–positive cells'', ''cell cycle–related factors'', and ''public-school–private-school rivalries'').&lt;ref name="LutzStevenson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary Lutz|author2=Diane Stevenson|title=The Writer's Digest grammar desk reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsQ9ugnMcpUC&amp;pg=PA296|year=2005|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-58297-335-7|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly used alternative style is the hyphenated string (''hormone-receptor-positive cells'', ''cell-cycle-related factors''). (For other aspects of en dash–versus–hyphen use, see ''[[Dash#En dash|Dash &gt; En dash]]''.)

==== Object–verbal-noun compounds ====
{{anchor|Object–verbal noun compounds||reason=Old section name; lots of redirs point here.}}
When an object is compounded with a verbal noun, such as ''[[Mixer (cooking)|egg-beater]]'' (a tool that beats eggs), the result is sometimes hyphenated. Some authors do this consistently, others only for disambiguation; in this case, ''egg-beater, egg beater,'' and ''eggbeater'' are all common.

An example of an ambiguous phrase appears in ''they stood near a group of alien lovers'', which without a hyphen implies that they stood near a group of lovers who were aliens; ''they stood near a group of alien-lovers'' clarifies that they stood near a group of people who loved aliens, as "alien" can be either an adjective or a noun. On the other hand, in the phrase ''a hungry pizza-lover'', the hyphen will often be omitted (a hungry pizza lover), as "pizza" cannot be an adjective and the phrase is therefore unambiguous.

Similarly, ''there's a man-eating shark in these waters'' is nearly the opposite of ''there's a man eating shark at table 6''; the first is a shark, and the second a man. ''A government-monitoring program'' is a program that monitors the government, whereas ''a government monitoring program'' is a government program that monitors something else.

==== Personal names ====

Some married couples compose a new [[surname]] (sometimes referred to as a [[double-barrelled name]]) for their new family by combining their two surnames with a hyphen. Jane Doe and John Smith might become Jane and John Smith-Doe, or Doe-Smith, for instance. In some countries only the woman hyphenates her birth surname, appending her husband's surname. (See also [[Spanish naming customs#Hyphenation]] and [[Portuguese name#Hyphenation]].) 

With already-hyphenated names, some parts are typically dropped.  For example, Aaron Johnson and Samantha Taylor-Wood became [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] and [[Sam Taylor-Johnson]]. Not all hyphenated surnames are the result of marriage. For example [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] is a descendant of Louis Lemlé Dreyfus whose son was Léopold Louis-Dreyfus.

==== Other compounds ====
Connecting hyphens are used in a large number of miscellaneous compounds, other than modifiers, such as in ''lily-of-the-valley'', ''cock-a-hoop'', ''clever-clever'', ''tittle-tattle'' and ''orang-utan''. Use is often dictated by convention rather than fixed rules, and hyphenation styles may vary between authors; for example, ''orang-utan'' is also written as ''orangutan'' or ''orang utan'', and ''lily-of-the-valley'' may be hyphenated or not.

==== Suspended hyphens ====
&lt;!-- Section header used as link target in redirects --&gt;
A suspended hyphen (also called a "suspensive hyphen" or "hanging hyphen", or less commonly a "dangling" or "floating" hyphen) may be used when a single base word is used with separate, consecutive, hyphenated words which are connected by "and", "or", or "to". For example, ''nineteenth-century and twentieth-century'' may be written as ''nineteenth- and twentieth-century.'' This usage is now common in English and specifically recommended in some style guides.&lt;ref name="IU Style Guide"&gt;[http://creativeservices.iu.edu/resources/guide/gn.shtml Indiana University Style Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; Although less common, suspended hyphens are also used in English when the base word comes first, such as in "investor-owned and {{nowrap|-operated}}". Uses such as "applied and sociolinguistics" (instead of "applied linguistics and sociolinguistics") are frowned upon in English; the Indiana University Style Guide uses this example and says "Do not 'take a shortcut' when the first expression is ordinarily open" (i.e., ordinarily two separate words).&lt;ref name="IU Style Guide" /&gt; This is different, however, from instances where prefixes that are normally closed up (styled solidly) are used suspensively. For example, ''{{nowrap|preoperative and postoperative}}'' becomes ''{{nowrap|pre- and postoperative}}'' (not ''{{nowrap|pre- and post-operative}}'') when suspended. Some editors prefer to avoid suspending such pairs, choosing instead to write out both words in full.&lt;ref name="AMA10section8.3.1" /&gt;

=== Other uses ===
A hyphen may be used to connect groups of numbers, such as in dates (see below), telephone numbers or sports scores. It can also be used to indicate a range of values, although many [[style guide|styles]] prefer an [[Dash#En dash|en dash]] (see examples at [[Dash#Ranges of values|Dash &gt; En dash &gt; Ranges of values]]).

The hyphen is sometimes used to hide letters in words ([[fillet (redaction)|filleting for redaction/censoring]]), as in [[G-d]], although an en dash can be used as well ("G–d").

The hyphen is often used in [[Reduplication|reduplicatives]].

== Varied meanings ==
Some stark examples of semantic changes caused by the placement of hyphens:

* ''Disease-causing poor nutrition'', meaning poor nutrition that causes disease
* ''Disease causing poor nutrition'', meaning a disease that causes poor nutrition
* A ''man-eating shark'' is a shark that eats humans.
* A ''man eating shark'' is a man who is eating shark meat.
* A ''hard working man'' is a working man who is tough.
* A ''hard-working man'' is a man who works hard.
* ''Three-hundred-year-old trees'' are an indeterminate number of trees that are each aged 300 years.
* ''Three hundred-year-old trees'' are three trees that are each aged 100 years.
* ''Three hundred year-old trees'' are 300 trees that are each aged 1 year.

== Origin and history ==
The first known documentation of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of [[Dionysius Thrax]]. At the time hyphenation was joining two words that would otherwise be read separately by a low [[tie (typography)|tie mark]] between the two words.&lt;ref name="nicky"&gt;Nicolas, Nick. "[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120806003722/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |date=6 August 2012 }}". 2005. Accessed 7 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek these marks were known as ''[[enotikon]]'', officially [[romanization of Greek|romanized]] as a hyphen.&lt;ref name="elot"&gt;{{lang|el|Ελληνικός Οργανισμός Τυποποίησης}} [''Ellīnikós Organismós Typopoíīsīs'', "[[Hellenic Organization for Standardization]]"]. {{lang|el|ΕΛΟΤ 743, 2η Έκδοση}} [''ELOT 743, 2ī Ekdosī'', "ELOT 743, {{nowrap|2nd ed.}}"]. ELOT (Athens), 2001. {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of [[letter-spacing]] in the [[Middle Ages]], the hyphen, still written beneath the text, reversed its meaning. Scribes used the mark to connect two words that had been incorrectly separated by a space. This era also saw the introduction of the marginal hyphen, for words broken across lines.&lt;ref name="Houston2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Houston|title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132|date=24 September 2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-06442-1|pages=121–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern format of the hyphen originated with [[Johannes Gutenberg]] of Mainz, Germany, {{circa|lk=no|1455}} with the publication of his 42-line [[Gutenberg Bible|Bible]]. His tools did not allow for a subliminal hyphen, and he thus moved it to the middle of the line.&lt;ref name="Houston2013b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Houston|title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132|date=24 September 2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-06442-1|pages=132–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of an original copy on [[vellum]] (Hubay index #35) in the [[Library of Congress|U. S. Library of Congress]] shows that Gutenberg's movable type was set justified in a uniform style, 42 equal lines per page. The Gutenberg printing press required words made up of individual letters of type to be held in place by a surrounding non-printing rigid frame. Gutenberg solved the problem of making each line the same length to fit the frame by inserting a hyphen as the last element at the right-side margin. This interrupted the letters in the last word, requiring the remaining letters be carried over to the start of the line below. His hyphen appears throughout the Bible as a short, double line inclined to the right at a 60-degree angle.

== In computing ==

=== Hyphen-minus ===
{{Main|Hyphen-minus}}

In the [[ASCII]] [[character encoding]], the hyphen is encoded as character 45. This character is sometimes called the [[hyphen-minus]], as it is also used as the minus sign and even sometimes for [[dash]]es. In [[Unicode]], the hyphen-minus is encoded as {{U+|002D}} (-) so that Unicode remains compatible with ASCII. However, Unicode also encodes the hyphen and minus separately, as U+2010 (‐) and U+2212 (−) respectively, along with the em dash U+2014 (—), en dash U+2013 (–) and other related characters. On Android, the Unicode hyphen and the hyphen-minus are similar but not identical (compare:‐-). The hyphen-minus is a general-purpose character that attempts to fulfill several roles, and wherever optimal typography is desired, the preferred hyphen, minus, or other symbol should be used instead. For example, compare 4+3−2=5 (minus) and 4+3-2=5 (hyphen-minus); in most fonts the hyphen-minus will not have the optimal width, thickness, or vertical position, whereas the minus character will.

However, the Unicode hyphen is awkward to enter on most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus character remains very common. They are often used instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via [[dialog box]]es or multi-key, unmemorable [[keyboard shortcut]]s), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent a dash in ASCII text.

The ASCII hyphen-minus character is also often used when specifying [[command-line option]]s. The character is usually followed by one or more letters that indicate specific actions. Typically it is called a dash or switch in this context. Various implementations of the [[getopt]] function to parse command-line options additionally allow the use of two hyphen-minus characters (&amp;nbsp;--&amp;nbsp;) to specify long option names that are more descriptive than their single-letter equivalents. Another use of hyphens is that employed by programs written with [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipelining]] in mind: a single hyphen may be recognized [[wikt:in lieu|in lieu]] of a filename, with the hyphen then serving as an indicator that a [[standard streams|standard stream]], instead of a file, is to be worked with.

=== Hard and soft hyphens ===
{{Further information|Soft hyphen}}

Although software ([[hyphenation algorithm]]s) can often automatically make decisions on when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user to be able to insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a [[soft hyphen]] (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is ''allowed'' but not ''forced''. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.

In contrast, a hyphen that is always displayed and printed is called a {{Anchor|hard hyphen}}'''hard hyphen''' (although some use this term to refer to a non-breaking hyphen; see below). Soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation ''may'' occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using [[hyphenation algorithm]]s are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.

=== Nonbreaking hyphens ===
&lt;!-- Section header used as link target in redirects --&gt;
Also '''nonbreaking hyphen''', '''non-breaking hyphen''' and '''no-break hyphen'''. This character looks identical to the regular hyphen, but it is treated as a letter by word processors, namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at what would be the end of a line of text; instead, the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line. The [[non-breaking space]] exists for similar reasons.

The [[word segmentation]] rules of most text systems consider a hyphen to be a [[word boundary]] and a valid point at which to break a line when flowing text. However, this is not always desirable behavior, especially when it could lead to ambiguity (such as in the examples given before, where ''recreation'' and ''re‑creation'' would be indistinguishable), or in languages other than English (e.g., a line break at the hyphen in [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|an t‑athair}} or [[Romanian language|Romanian]] {{lang|ro|s‑a}} would be undesirable). {{Anchor|non-breaking hyphen}}In Unicode it is defined as {{unichar|2011|NON-BREAKING HYPHEN|html=}}.

== Usage in date notation ==
{{Further information|Date and time representation by country}}

In parts of [[Europe]], the hyphen is used to delineate parts within a written date. Germans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Define Hyphen |url=https://hyphen.askdefine.com |website=Ask Define |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Slavs also used [[Roman numerals]] for the month; ''14‑VII‑1789'' (14 July 1789), for example, is one way of writing the first [[Bastille Day]], though this usage is rapidly falling out of favour. Plaques on the wall of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] are written this way. Use of hyphens, as opposed to the slashes used in the [[English language]], is specified for international standards.

[[International standard]] [[ISO 8601]], which was accepted as European Standard EN 28601 and incorporated into various typographic style guides (e.g., [[DIN]] 5008 in Germany), brought about a new standard using the hyphen. Now all official European governmental documents use this. These norms prescribe writing dates using hyphens: 1789-07-14 is the new way of writing the first Bastille Day. This is also the typical date format used in large parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, although sometimes with other separators than the hyphen.

This method has gained influence within North America, as most common computer filesystems make the use of slashes difficult or impossible. DOS, OS/2 and Windows simultaneously support both \ and / as directory separators, but / is also used to introduce and separate switches to shell commands (unless reconfigured to use the hyphen-minus in DOS). Unix-like systems use / as a directory separator and, while \ is legal in filenames, it is awkward to use as the shell uses it as an escape character. Unix also uses a space followed by a hyphen to introduce switches. Apart from the separator used the non-year form of the date format is also identical to the standard American representation.

== Unicode ==
Apart from dash and minus sign, Unicode has multiple hyphen characters:&lt;ref name="PropList"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt|title=Unicode 11.0 UCD: PropList.txt|date=2018-03-15|accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{unichar|002D|HYPHEN-MINUS|html=y}} (still not to be confused with {{unichar|2212|MINUS SIGN}})
* {{unichar|00AD|SOFT HYPHEN|html=y}} (see '''[[#SHY-note|note]]''')
* {{unichar|2010|HYPHEN|html=y}}
* {{unichar|2011|NON-BREAKING HYPHEN|html=y}}
{{anchor|SHY-note}}'''Note''': The [[Soft_hyphen#Text_to_be_formatted_by_the_recipient|{{sc|soft hyphen}}]] serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping at the end of a line.

And in non-Latin scripts:&lt;ref name="PropList" /&gt;

* {{unichar|058A|ARMENIAN HYPHEN|html=y}}
* {{unichar|1806|MONGOLIAN TODO SOFT HYPHEN|html=y}}
* {{unichar|2E17|DOUBLE OBLIQUE HYPHEN|html=y}} (used in ancient Near-Eastern linguistics and in blackletter typefaces)
* {{unichar|30FB|KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT|html=y}} (has the Unicode property of "Hyphen" despite its name)
* {{unichar|FE63|SMALL HYPHEN-MINUS|html=y}} (compatibility character for a small hyphen-minus, used in East Asian typography)
* {{unichar|FF0D|FULLWIDTH HYPHEN-MINUS|html=y}} (compatibility character for a wide hyphen-minus, used in East Asian typography)
* {{unichar|FF65|HALFWIDTH KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT|html=y}} (compatibility character for a wide katakana middle dot, has the Unicode property of "Hyphen" despite its name)

Unicode distinguishes the hyphen from the general interpunct.  The characters below do not have the Unicode property of "Hyphen" despite their names:&lt;ref name="PropList" /&gt;

* {{unichar|00B7|MIDDLE DOT|html=y}}
* {{unichar|1400|CANADIAN SYLLABICS HYPHEN|html=y}}

'''Jan Fethke''' (26 February 1903 &amp;ndash; 16 December 1980) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Poland|Polish]] film director and, under the pen name '''Jean Forge''', a successful author. He also was a famous proponent of the language [[Esperanto]].

==Life==
Born in [[Opole|Oppeln]], [[Silesia]], Jan Fethke attended Oppeln's grammar school. Together with his brothers Stefan and Edmond, Fethke learned [[Esperanto]] in 1919, when aged sixteen. After leaving grammar school, he edited the periodical ''Esperanto Triumfonta'' for several years.

Between 1923 and 1924 studied at Technical University of [[Danzig]] and worked for a local newspaper before moving to [[Berlin]].

In 1921, aged 18, he penned his first novel, the German language ''Der ausgestopfte Papagei'' (''The Stuffed Parrot''). After 1923, he wrote his novels in Esperanto and used the pseudonym ''Jean Forge''. His most important Esperanto works are ''[[Abismoj]]'' (''Abysses'', 1923), ''Saltego trans jarmiloj'' (''A Leap across the Millennia'', 1924) and ''[[Mr. Tot Aĉetas Mil Okulojn]]'' (''Mr. Tot Buys a Thousand Eyes'', 1931), which have been translated into several languages. His books were inventive, rich in ideas, and a witty representative of enjoyable light literature with a talent for psychological observation and a precise knowledge of effects.

After moving to Berlin in 1928, Fethke worked as a writer and assistant for [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]]. His most successful films were ''Mutter Krausens Fahrt ins Glück'' (''Mommy Krause's Trip into Happiness'') and ''Jenseits der Straße'' (''On the Far Side of the Street''), for which he wrote the screenplay. At Ufa, he also made the acquaintance of [[Fritz Lang]], who later used his ''Mr. Tot'' novel for his last film, ''[[The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse]]'' (1960).

He also continued his work in Esperanto. In 1932 began to teach courses in Sweden, using the [[Cseh-method]]. In 1934 he dubbed the German film ''Morgen beginnt das Leben'' (''Life will Start Tomorrow'') into Esperanto and, under the title ''Morgaŭ ni komencos la vivon'', exhibited during the 26th World Esperanto Congress in Stockholm.

After the [[Second World War]], Fethke achieved fame as a film director in Poland. In 1960, he moved to [[West Berlin]].

He was a collaborator of the review ''[[Literatura Mondo]]'' (''Literary World'') and many other periodicals.

[[File:Sprachen Osttimors-en.png|thumb|Languages in East Timor]]

'''Kawaimina''' is a [[syllabic abbreviation]] used to refer to four languages and dialects of [[East Timor]]:
: [[Kairui language|Kairui]], [[Midiki language|Midiki]], [[Waimoa language|Waimaha]], and [[Nauete language|Naueti]], 
spoken by one or two thousand speakers each. It is a name used by linguists discussing the languages, not the speakers themselves. The first three, which may be co-dialects, are spoken in adjacent areas in the western part of [[Baucau District]], along the north coast. Naueti is used on the south coast of eastern [[Viqueque District]], surrounded by speakers of [[Makasae]] and [[Makalero]]. Some Midiki speakers near [[Ossu (East Timor)|Ossu]] refer to their language as Osomoko.

Except perhaps for Naueti, the Kawaimina languages are members of the [[Timor–Babar languages|Timor–Babar family]] of Austronesian languages. While structurally the languages are Malayo-Polynesian, their vocabulary, particularly that of Naueti, derives mostly from [[Papuan languages]]. In this they are similar to [[Makasae language|Makasae]] and [[Habun language|Habun]]; none of these languages are easy to classify as either Austronesian or Papuan. The languages are noted for both archaisms and unusual innovations, including [[vowel harmony]] and [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and [[glottalized consonant]]s in their sound-systems.

'''Kukna''' is a minority language spoken by the [[Saraswat]] [[Konkani people]] of [[Karnataka]] and in some parts of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref group="note" name="minority"&gt;The Constitution Act 1992 (71st Amendment)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Issues"&gt;{{cite press release | title=Issues of Linguistic Minorities, Language Use in Administration and National Integration | date=19 October 2004 | publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The Karnataka Saraswat dialects are referred to as Canara Konkani. The Kerala dialects are referred to as Travancore Konkani or Kerala Konkani. Certain dialects like the Canara Saraswat dialects of the Gaud Saraswats and Bhanaps are called आमचीगॆलॆं ''āmcigelẽ'' (lit. ours) and the dialect of the Cochin Gaud Saraswats is called कॊच्चिमांय ''koccimā̃y'' (lit. mother Cochin) by the members of those communities.

The word ''Canara'' is a Portuguese corruption of the word ''Kannada''. The early Portuguese conquistadors referred to Konkani as ''lingoa Canarim'' as a reference to Canara.&lt;ref name="indialit"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Five (Sasay To Zorgot), Volume 5 | author=Mohan Lal | authorlink=Stevens, Fr. Thomas - Stotra | year=2001 | publisher=Kendra Sahitya Academy | location=New Delhi | pages=4182 | isbn=81-260-1221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kukna is distinguished from the dialect spoken by the Catholics of Mangalore which has a separate language glotto code([http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/mang1376 mang1376]).

==Geographic distribution==
Kukna is mainly spoken as a minority language in the Indian States of [[Karnataka]], and in some parts of [[Kerala]] and [[Maharashtra]]. The speakers are concentrated in the districts of [[Uttara Kannada district]], [[Udupi]] and [[Dakshina Kannada]] in Karnataka.

==History==
Influx of Konkani speakers into Canara happened in three time-lines :

* Exodus between 1312 and 1327 when General [[Malik Kafur]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultans]] [[Alauddin Khalji]] and [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammed bin Tughlaq]] destroyed [[Govapuri|Govepuri]] and the [[Kadambas]]
* Exodus subsequent to 1470 when the [[Bahamani]] kingdom captured Goa, and subsequently in 1492 by Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]] of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]]
*Hindu exodus due to [[Persecution of Hindus|persecution]] and [[Christianization of Goa|proselytisation]] of Hindus by Portuguese [[Jesuit]] and [[Franciscan]] missionaries subsequent to 1500
*Hindu exodus during the [[Goa Inquisition|Inquisition]] ordered by [[St. Francis Xavier]] which was established in 1560 and abolished in 1812.

==The people==
{{expert needed|linguistics|appears to confuse Canara Konkani with Goan Konkani spoken in Karnataka.|date=August 2015}}
According to the 1991 census of India, 40.1% Konkani speakers hail from the state of [[Karnataka]]. In Karnataka over 80% of them are from the coastal districts of North and South Canara, including Udupi. 3.6% of the Konkani speakers are from Kerala, and nearly half of them are from Ernakulam district.&lt;ref name="cardona"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cardona|first=George |author2=Dhanesh Jain |others=Rocky V. Miranda|title=The Indo-Aryan Languages |publisher=Routledge|year=2007|edition=illustrated|series=Routledge language family series|pages=1088|chapter=20:Konkani|isbn=978-0-415-77294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on local language influence, Konkani speaking people are classified into three main regions:

===North Canara (Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka)===

This is the region north of the [[Gangolli]] river, starts from the [[Kali River (Karnataka)|Kali river]] of [[Karwar]]. North Canarites are called ''baḍgikār''&lt;ref group="note" name="BadgiTenki"&gt;Term used by Konkani speaking Gaud Saraswats and Chitrapur Sarasawts&lt;/ref&gt; (Northerners) or simply ''baḍgi''  in Konkani. North Canara Konkani has more of Goan Konkani influence than Kannada influence compared to South Canara Konkani. The major Konkani speaking communities include:&lt;ref name="sardessaya"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Konkani literature: from 1500 to 1992 | author=Sardessaya, Manoharraya | year=2000 | publisher=Kendra Sahitya Akademi | location=New Delhi | pages=7,9,298 | ISBN=978-81-7201-664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uttarakannada.nic.in/CensusKYD.htm/ |title=Uttara Kannada Jilla Parishada|author=Chithra Salam |publisher=Open Publishing |date=14 October 2009 |work=Konkani Census|accessdate=5 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{div col end}}

Karwar Konkani is different from Mangalorean or south Kanara konkani. It is similar to Goan Konkani but mixed with Kannada accented words. Although people of Karwar have their mother tongue as Konkani. Konkani speakers in North Canara are bilingual; they are well conversant in Kannada as well as Konkani. A few are conversant in Marathi too.

===South Canara (Udupi and Mangalore districts, Karnataka)===

This is the region south of the Gangolli river. South Canarites are called  ''ṭenkikār'' &lt;ref group="note" name="BadgiTenki"/&gt;(Southerner) ''tenkabagli'' or simply ''ṭenki'' in Konkani. The Rajapur Saraswat, Kudalkar, Daivajna, Kumbhar, Gaud Saraswats and Chitrapur Saraswats are some of the Konkani speaking communities of this region. 15% of Dakshina Kannada speaks Konkani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=District Census Handbook, Dakshina Kannada District, | year=2001 | publisher=Govt. of Karnataka}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Canara Saraswats, both Gaud Saraswat and Chitrapur Saraswat affectionately refer to their dialect as ''āmcigelẽ'' (Ours)
This region has recently been bifurcated into Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts.

Konkani speakers in South Canara are trilingual; they are conversant in Konkani, Kannada and Tulu. Some of the towns in South Canara have separate Konkani names. Udupi is called ''ūḍup'' and Mangalore is called ''kodiyāl'' in Konkani.

===Travancore (Cochin and Ernakulam district, Kerala)===

Konkani speakers are found predominantly in the [[Cochin]] and [[Ernakulam district|Ernakulam]], Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kollam districts of Kerala, the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore. [[Kudumbi]]s, Gaud Saraswats, Vaishya Vani of Cochin, and Daivajna are the major communities. The Konkani dialect of the Gaud Saraswats is affectionately referred to as  ''koccimā̃y''  by members of that community.

The Gaud Saraswats of Cochin were part of the group of ''sāṣṭikār''s who migrated from Goa during the Inquisition hence their dialect is, but for usage of certain Malayalam words, similar to the dialect spoken by Gaud Saraswats of South Canara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Kerala District Gazetteer | authorlink=Ernakulam district | year=1965 | publisher=Govt. Of Kerala | location=Thiruvananthapuram | pages=32–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Konkani speakers in this region are bilingual; they are conversant in Konkani as well as Malayalam.

==Description==
Konkani in Karnataka has been in contact with [[Kannada]] and [[Tulu language|Tulu]], thus showing [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] influence on its syntax.&lt;ref name="rao"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhaskararao|first= Peri|author2=Karumuri V. Subbarao |title=Non-nominative subjects,  |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2004|edition=illustrated|series=Grammar, Comparative and general|volume=Volume 1|pages=332|chapter=Non-nominative subjects in Dakkhani and Konkani|isbn=978-90-272-2970-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phonetics]], sounds, [[nasalization]], [[grammar]], syntax and in turn [[vocabulary]] obviously differs from Goan Konkani.&lt;ref name="rao" /&gt;

There was a small population of Konkani speakers in Canara even before the first exodus from Goa. This group was responsible for the Shravanabelagola inscription. There was a large scale migration of Konkani communities from Goa to the coastal districts of North Canara, South Canara and Udupi as also the Shimoga district of Malnad region. This migration, caused by the persecution of the Bahamani and Portuguese rulers, took place between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries. Most of these migrants were merchants, craftsmen and artisans. These migrants were either Hindus, Muslims or Christians and their linguistic practices were influenced by this factor also. Each dialect is influenced by its geographical antecedents.

There are subtle differences in the way that Konkani is spoken in different regions: “In Karwar and Ankola, they emphasize the syllables, and in Kumta-Honavar, they use consonants in abundance. The Konkani spoken by Nawayatis of Bhatkal incorporates Persian and Arabic words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Navayats of Kanara- study in Cultural Contacts | author=D'Souza, V.S. | year=1955 | publisher=Kannada Research Institute | location=Dharwad | pages=12–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; People of South Kanara do not distinguish between some nouns of Kannada and Konkani origin, and have developed a very business practical language. They sometimes add Tulu words also. It is but natural that Konkani has many social variations also because it is spoken by many communities such as [[Daivajna]], Serugar, Mestri, Sutar, Gabeet, Kharvi, Samgar, Nawayati, etc.

Continuous inter action between the Konkani speaking communities with Dravidian Languages over a period of time has resulted in influences at the levels of morphology, syntax, vocabulary and larger semantic units such as proverbs and idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Konkani Language: Historical and Linguistic Perspectives | author=V.Nithyanantha Bhat, Ela Suneethabai | year=2004 | publisher=Sukriteendra, Oriental Research Institute | location=Kochi | pages=5–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is illustrated by Nadkarni, Bernd Heine and Tanya Kuteva in their writings.

Many Kannada words such as ''duḍḍu'' (money), ''baḍḍi''  (stick) and ''bāgilu'' (door) have found permanent places in Kukna. Kukna from Kerala has Malayalam words like sari/śeri (correct), etc.

From the above table we see that South Canara and Kerala Hindu dialects undergo doubling of consonants ''āppaytā'' (calls),  ''dzāllẽ'' (done),  ''kellẽ'' (did), ''vhaṇṇi''  (sister in law) whereas North Canara Hindu dialects use the un-doubled ones ''āpaytā'', ''dzālẽ'', ''kelẽ'',   ''vhaṇi''' . The Gaud Saraswat and Kudumbi Kochi dialects uses '' ca'' and  ''ja''  in place '' tsa'' and '' dza''  respectively.

===Language structure===
{{see also|Konkani Phonology|Konkani Script}}

Konkani speakers in Karnataka, having interacted with Kannada speakers in North Canara, Kannada and Tulu speakers in South Canara and Malayalam speakers in Kerala, their dialects have been influenced by  [[Kannada]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Malayalam]]. This has resulted in [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] influence on their syntax.&lt;ref name="rao"/&gt; According to the linguists, Konkani in Karnataka has undergone a process of ''degenitivization'', and is moving towards ''dativization'' on the pattern of Dravidian languages. ''Degenitivization'' means the loss or replacement of the [[Genitive case|genitives]], and ''dativization'' means replacement of the genitive in the donor language (i.e. Konkani) by the dative case marker in the recipient language (i.e. Kannada).&lt;ref name="rao" /&gt; E.g.:
*''rāmācẽ/-lẽ/-gelẽ kellelẽ kām''. {{nay}}
*''rāmānẽ kellelẽ kām''. {{aye}}
::In the Goan dialects, both statements are grammatically correct. In the Karnataka dialects, only the second statement is grammatically correct.

In Karnataka Konkani [[present continuous tense]] is strikingly observable, which is not so prominent in Goan Konkani.&lt;ref name="jana"&gt;{{cite book|last= Janardhan|first=Pandarinath Bhuvanendra|title=A Higher Konkani grammar|publisher=P.B. Janardhan|year=1991|pages=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Present indefinite of the auxiliary is fused with [[present participle]] of the primary verb, and the auxiliary is partially dropped.&lt;ref name="jana" /&gt; This difference became more prominent in dialects spoken in Karnataka, which came in contact with Dravidian languages, whereas Goan Konkani still retains the original form.

*In Goan Konkani "I eat", as well as "I am eating",  translates to ''hā̃v khātā''.
*In Kanara Konkani, "I eat" translates to ''hā̃v khātā'' and "I am eating" translates to ''hā̃v khātoāsā'' or ''hā̃v khāter āsā''

'''Script'''

Early Konkani literature in Goa, Karnataka and Kerala has been found in the [[Nāgarī script|Nāgarī Script]]. '''At present however, Konkani in the Devanagari script has been promulgated as an Official Language&lt;ref group="note" name="devanagari"&gt;On 20 August 1992 Parliament of India by effecting the 78th amendment to the Constitution of India, Konkani in Devanagari script has been included in VIIIth Schedule of Constitution of India.&lt;/ref&gt;'''.

==Literature==

===Early literature===
Amongst the inscriptions at the foot of the colossal statue of Bahubali at Shravanabelagola in Karnataka are two lines reading thus:

{{cquote|[[File:Chavundaraya.png|300px|center|thumb|śrīcāvuṇḍarājē̃ kara viyālē̃, śrīgaṅgārājē̃ suttālē̃ kara viyālē̃]] &lt;ref group="note" name="chavundaraya"&gt;[[Chavundaraya]] was the military chief of the Ganga dynasty King Gangaraya. This inscription on the Bahubali statue draws attention to a Basadi (Jain Temple) initially built by him and then modified by Gangaraya in the 12th century CE Ref: S. Settar in Adiga (2006), p256&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first line was inscribed circa 981 AD and the second line in 1016-17 AD.&lt;ref name="vishwakon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vishwakonkani.org/ |title=Konkani Language and Cultural Foundation |publisher=Open Publishing |date=5 March 2011 |work=Konkani History |accessdate=5 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of these lines is Konkani according to Dr. S.B. Kulkarni (former head of Department of Marathi, Nagpur University) and Dr. Jose Pereira (former professor, Fordham University, US). Considering these arguments, these inscriptions at Sravanabelegola may be considered the earliest Konkani&lt;ref name="Gomes"&gt;{{cite book | title=Medieval Indian literature: an anthology. Volume 3. | author=Ayyappapanicker, K. | authorlink=Medieval Konkani Literature (Olivinho Gomes) | year=1999 | publisher=Kendra Sahitya Akademi | location=New Delhi | pages=257–260 | isbn=81-260-0788-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; inscriptions in the [[Nāgarī script]].

A piece of poetry attributed to the twelfth century and worded in Konkani runs as follows,

{{Cquote|{{Lang|kex-Latn|jaṇẽ rasataḷavāntũ matsyarūpē̃ vēda āṇiyēlē̃.  manuśivāka vāṇiyēlē̃.}}
{{Lang|kex-Latn|to saṁsārasāgara tāraṇu. mōhō to rākho nārāyāṇu.}}}}

#The One who brought up the Vedas in the form of a fish from the bottom of the Oceans,
#(and) gave it to Manu,
#He shall deliver the world,
#To me, He is the protector, Lord Narayan.&lt;ref name="Gomes"/&gt;

===Medieval Literature===
[[File:HortusCert.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Konkani in the Old [[Nāgarī script|Nagari Script]]]]
It can be said beyond doubt, that nothing has been written for a long period up to 1900 which is an awareness, is perceived in the case of Konkani. The wilderness may be attributed to the lack of consciousness, amongst the Konkani speaking people, as to the importance of the preservation of records&lt;ref name="sardessaya"/&gt;

The earliest known Konkani epigraphy is the rock inscription at Shravanabelagola, Karnataka. Another writing of antiquity is a रायसपत्र ''Rāyasapatra'' (writ) By Srimad [[Puttige Matha Guru Parampara|Sumatindra Tirtha swamiji]] to his disciples.

:'''Goḍḍe Rāmāyaṇ'''

In Konkani, Ramayana narration is found in both verse and prose. The story has been told in full or part in folksongs of the Kudubis and ritualistic forms like ''goḍḍe rāmāyaṇ'' of Kochi, ''sītā suddi'' and ''sītā kalyāṇa'' of Northern Kerala/South Canara and the ''rāmāyaṇa raṇmāḷe'' of Cancon. Some other texts of Ramayana too are available in written form in Konkani.  '''rāmāyaṇācyo kāṇiyo''', ascribed to Krishnadas Shama is in 16th century prose.  During 1930s Late Kamalammal wrote the ''raghurāmāyaṇa'' in ''vhōvi''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A vhōvi is song made of a collection two or three liner stanzas typically sung during weddings by ladies&lt;/ref&gt; style verse.  There have also been an adapted version by late Narahari Vittal Prabhu of Gokarn and recently, the translation of '''rāmacaritramānasa''' by Kochi Ananta Bhat of Kochi.&lt;ref name="sardessaya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Custom"&gt;{{cite book | title=Custom Report | year=2007 | publisher=Konkani Language and Cultural Foundation | location=Mangalore | pages=2, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Hortus Malabaricus'''
[[File:HortusCertificate.jpg|400px|right|thumb|The Hortus Malabaricus Konkani Document corrected for contemporary grammar]]
[[Hortus Malabaricus]] (meaning Garden of Malabar) is a comprehensive treatise that deals with the medicinal properties of the flora in the Indian state of Kerala. Originally written in Latin, it was compiled over a period of nearly 30 years and published from Amsterdam during 1678–1693. The book was conceived by [[Hendrik van Rheede]], who was the Governor of the Dutch administration in Kochi (formerly Cochin) at the time.

Though the book was the result of the indomitable will power of Hendrik Van Rheede, all the basic work and the original compilation of plant properties was done by three Konkani Physicians of Kochi, namely Ranga Bhat, Vināyaka Pandit and Appu Bhat.&lt;ref name="Hortus"&gt;{{cite book | title=Hortus Malabaricus - Vol. I | author=Manilal, K.S. | year=2003 | publisher=Dept. of publications, University of Kerala | location=Thiruvananthapuram | pages=5–23 | isbn=81-86397-57-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three have themselves certified this in their joint certificate in Konkani, which appears as such at the start of the first volume of the book.

This book also contains the Konkani names of each plant, tree and creeper are also included throughout the book, in all 12 volumes, both in its descriptive parts and alongside their respective drawings. While the names are in Roman script in the descriptive part, the names alongside the diagrams are in original Nāgarī script itself, indicated as Bramanical characters.&lt;ref name="Hortus"/&gt;

[[File:Maddo.JPG|300px|right|thumb|KonkaniNames of Plants in the [[Hortus Malabaricus]]]]
The 17th century certificate was etched in the manner and style of those times, which may appear unfamiliar now. Further to this, some writing notations (mostly anuswara) are seen missing in the print. Hence, to make it easily readable, the body matter is reproduced herein with enhanced clarity, modern-day spacing between words, and with the missing notations added back, for the sake of coherence and comprehension.

:'''Bhakti Movement'''
[[File:Konkani pad 01.jpg|300px|right|thumb|This rare Konkani lithograph manuscript, dated 1904 was printed in Mangalore. It contains devotional songs in Konkani in the glory of popular Hindu deities.]]
The [[Dvaita]] seer [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]]  converted [[Smartha]] Konkani [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin|Gaud Saraswat]]s to [[Dvaita|Dvaitism]]. This Dvaita Gaud Saraswat community was instrumental in ''kīrtanasāhitya ''and ''haridāsasāhitya''. Vasudev Prabhu was a very famous Konkani poet of the Bhakti Movement. He wrote many devotional songs in Konkani and also translated Kannada devotional poetry of Vyāsarāya, [[Naraharitirtha]], Puranadaradāsa, Kanakadāsa. These Konkani songs were, later,  sung by nārāyantirtha&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=padāñcẽ pustaka | author=Prabhu, Vasudev | year=1904 | publisher=Mangalore Trading Association's Sharada Press | location=Mangalore | pages=4–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Literature===

Contemporary Konkani literature in Kerala made a rather late entry, as compared to its other concentrated states like Karnataka. However, according to historical annals, there can be established no exact evidence to relate exactly when Konkani language and literature began its predominating journey in Kerala. But a possible contact and interlinking between Goa with Kerala cannot be thrown to the wind, as collaborators in foreign trade. G Kamalammal is known to have contributed whole-heartedly to Konkani literature, in the domain of devotional writing. V. Krishna Vadyar, Bhakta R Kanhangad, S. T Chandrakala, S Kamat are some of the most renowned novelists in the Konkani dialect. Moving further ahead, V Venkates, K Narayan Naik, N Prakash and others have penned forceful short stories; P G Kamath has contributed to the sphere of essay writing.

Some of the most great and legendary poets in Konkani literature from Kerala, comprise: K Anant Bhat, N Purushottam Mallya, R Gopal Prabhu, P N S Sivanand Shenoy, N N Anandan, R S Bhaskar etc. Translations, folklore, criticism also have enriched the Konkani literature in Kerala. Stepping aside a little bit and directing the attention towards analytic and detailed study, Konkani literature in Kerala has been legendary and celebrated to have formulated dictionaries and encyclopaedias in considerable numbers.

==Culture, media and arts==
Konkani speakers have retained their language and culture in Karnataka and Kerala. Music, theatre and periodicals keep these communities in touch with the language.

Notable periodicals are ''pānchkadāyi, kodial khabar and sansakār bōdh''.

Konkani theatre made a rather late entry into the Indian art scenario. Konkani theatre groups like'' rangakarmi kumbaḷe śrīnivās bhaṭ pratiṣṭhān, and raṅgayōgi rāmānand cūryā vēdike'' played an instrumental role in bringing Konkani theatre to the masses. ''raṅgakarmi ''Kumble Shrinivas Bhat, Late Hosad Babuti Naik, Late Late K. Balakrishna Pai (''kuḷḷāppu''), Sujeer Srinivas Rao (''cinna kāsaragōḍ'') and Vinod Gangolli are some noteworthy names. Ramananda Choorya was an eminent artist who encouraged people to develop Konkani theatre. He wrote the famous play ''dōni ghaḍi hāssunu kāḍi''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">A '''language code''' is a [[code]] that assigns letters or numbers as identifiers or classifiers for [[language]]s.  These codes may be used to organize library collections or presentations of data, to choose the correct localizations and translations in computing, and as a shorthand designation for longer forms of language-name.

== Difficulties of classification ==
Language code schemes attempt to classify the complex world of human languages, dialects, and variants. Most schemes make some compromises between being general and being complete enough to support specific dialects.

For example, most people in Central America and South America speak Spanish.  Spanish spoken in Mexico will be slightly different from Spanish spoken in Peru.  Different regions of Mexico will have slightly different dialects and accents of Spanish.  A language code scheme might group these all as "Spanish" for choosing a keyboard layout, most as "Spanish" for general usage, or separate each dialect to allow region-specific idioms.

There remains a small Romansh-speaking native population in [[Graubünden]] in the east. The cantons of [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] and [[Canton of Valais|Valais]] are officially bilingual; the [[canton of Graubünden]] is officially trilingual.

[[File:Brunig-Napf-Reuss-Linie.png|thumb|180px|Distribution of [[High Alemannic]] dialects. Marked in red is the [[Brünig-Napf-Reuss line]].]]
[[File:Hoechstalemannisch.png|thumb|180px|Distribution of [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]] dialects.]]

The '''German-speaking part of Switzerland''' ({{lang-de|Deutschschweiz}}, {{lang-fr|Suisse alémanique}}, {{lang-it|Svizzera tedesca}}, {{lang-rm|Svizra tudestga}}) constitutes about 65% of [[Switzerland]] (North Western Switzerland, Eastern Switzerland, Central Switzerland, most of the [[Swiss Plateau]] and the greater part of the [[Swiss Alps]]).

In seventeen of the Swiss cantons, German is the only official language ([[Canton of Aargau|Aargau]], [[Canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden|Appenzell Ausserrhoden]], [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Basel-Stadt|Basel-Stadt]], [[Canton of Basel-Landschaft|Basel-Landschaft]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Lucerne|Luzern]], [[Canton of Nidwalden|Nidwalden]], [[Canton of Obwalden|Obwalden]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[Canton of Thurgau|Thurgau]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], and [[Canton of Zurich|Zürich]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a1.html |title=SR 101 The Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation of 18 April 1999 (Status as of 12 February 2017): Art. 1: The Swiss Confederation |date=12 February 2017 |publisher=The Federal Council |location=Berne, Switzerland |website=The portal of the Swiss government |type=Federal Law collection |accessdate=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cantons of [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]] and [[Canton of Valais|Valais]], French is co-official; in the trilingual canton of [[Canton of Graubünden|Graubünden]], more than half of the population speaks German, while the rest speak [[Romansh language|Romansh]] or [[Italian language|Italian]]. In each case, all languages are [[official language]]s of the respective canton.

While the French-speaking Swiss prefer to call themselves ''Romands'' and their part of the country is the [[Romandy]], the German-speaking Swiss used to (and, colloquially, still do) refer to the French-speaking Swiss as "Welsche", and to their area as ''Welschland'', which has the same etymology as the English [[Wiktionary:Welsh|Welsh]] (see ''[[Walha]]''). In Germany ''Welsch'' and ''Welschland'' refer to Italy; there, the term is antiquated, rarely used, and somewhat disparaging.

The German-speaking Swiss do not feel like a uniform group:{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} the average German-speaking Swiss sees himself belonging foremost to his canton, and does not consider himself as a speaker of [[Swiss German]], but, for example, ''Baseldytsch'' (dialect of Basel), ''Bärndütsch'' (dialect of Bern) or ''Züridütsch'' (dialect of Zurich).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internations.org/switzerland-expats/guide/29464-culture-shopping-recreation/difficulties-differences-through-switzerland-s-language-diversity-19049|title=Difficulties &amp; Differences through Switzerland’s Language Diversity|website=www.internations.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} This is hardly surprising, however, since there is no single unifying or standard form of Swiss German itself: rather the term "Swiss German" is simply a generic umbrella term referring in general to all of the various different [[Alemannic German language|Alemannic German]] dialects within German-speaking Switzerland. The marked [[subsidiarity]] of the Swiss [[federalism]], where many political decisions are taken at municipal or cantonal level, supports this attitude.

Nevertheless, in 2016, 10.6%, or about 871,800 of the Swiss residents speak [[Standard German]] ("Hochdeutsch") at home, but this statistic is probably mainly due to German (and Austrian) immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung/sprachen-religionen/sprachen.assetdetail.4842942.html|title=Die am häufigsten üblicherweise zu Hause gesprochenen Sprachen der ständigen Wohnbevölkerung ab 15 Jahren|last=|first=|date=28 March 2018|website=|publisher=Federal Statistical Office  FSO|location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland|language=de, fr, it|type=official site|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Middle Ages]], a marked difference had developed within the German-speaking part of Switzerland between the rural cantons (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Glarus, Zug, Appenzell, Schaffhausen) and the city cantons (Lucerne, Berne, Zurich, Solothurn, Fribourg, Basel, St. Gallen), divided by views about trade and commerce. After the [[Swiss Reformation|Reformation]], all cantons were either Catholic or Protestant, and the denominational influences on culture added to the differences. Even today, when all cantons are somewhat denominationally mixed, the different historical denominations can be seen in the mountain villages, where Roman Catholic Central Switzerland abounds with chapels and statues of saints, and the farm houses in the very similar landscape of the Protestant Bernese Oberland show Bible verses carved on the housefronts instead.

In addition to this more widespread notion of Swiss German dialect, there is also [[Walser German]], another [[Highest Alemannic]] speech brought by [[Walser]] emigrants from [[Valais]].

{{Main article|Swiss French|Suisse romande}}

'''[[Romandy]]''' ({{lang-fr|Romandie, la Suisse romande}}, {{lang-de|Romandie, Welschland, Welschschweiz, or in some contexts: Westschweiz}},&lt;ref group=note&gt;"[[Walha|Welsch]]" is an old German word for "Foreign" and is the same word the [[Anglo-Saxons]] used for the original British inhabitants which today are the [[Welsh people]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-it|Svizzera romanda}}) is the French-speaking part of [[Switzerland]]. It covers the area of the [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Canton of Vaud|Vaud]], [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], and [[Canton of Jura|Jura]] as well as the French-speaking parts of the cantons of [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] (German-speaking majority), [[Canton of Valais|Valais]] (French-speaking majority), and [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]] (French-speaking majority). 1.9 million people (or 24.4% of the Swiss population) live in Romandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/02/blank/data/01.Document.67224.xls |format=XLS |title=Bilan de la population résidante permanente (total) selon les districts et les communes |date=2 January 2015 |publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office |location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806213408/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/02/blank/data/01.Document.67224.xls |archivedate= 6 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard [[Swiss French]] and the [[Standard French|French]] of [[France]] are the same language, with some differences. For example, like some other regions of the [[Francophonie|French-speaking world]], Swiss people (as well as most Francophone Belgians) use ''septante'' (seventy) instead of ''soixante-dix'' (literally, "sixty ten") and ''nonante'' (ninety) instead of "quatre-vingt-dix" ("four twenties and ten"). In the cantons of [[Vaud]], [[Valais]] and [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], speakers use ''huitante'' (eighty) instead of the [[Standard French]] "quatre-vingts" (four twenties).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dominique Didier |url=http://monsu.desiderio.free.fr/curiosites/septante.html |title=Septante, octante ou huitante, nonante |publisher=Monsu.desiderio.free.fr |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Sou (coin)|Sou]]" is used throughout Romandy for a [[Coins of the Swiss franc|5-centime coin]], as is "tune" (or "thune") when referring to a 5-Swiss-franc piece.

Historically, the vernacular language used by inhabitants of most parts of Romandy was [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]]. Franco-Provençal (also called '''Arpitan''') is a language sometimes considered to be halfway between the [[langue d'oïl]] (the historical language of northern France and ancestor of French) and Occitan (the [[langue d'oc]], spoken in southern France). Standard French and Franco-Provençal/Arpitan, linguistically, are distinct and mutual intelligibility is limited. Increasingly, Franco-Provençal/Arpitan is used only by members of the older generations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The term ''Romandy'' does not formally exist in the political system, but is used to distinguish and unify the French-speaking population of Switzerland. The [[television]] channel [[Télévision Suisse Romande]] (TSR) serves the ''Romande'' community across Switzerland, is syndicated to [[TV5MONDE|TV5]] and [[CanalSat]] Romande.{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}

===Italian===
{{main article|Swiss Italian|Italian Graubünden}}
[[File:Suisse italiene.png|thumb|right|250px|A map showing the Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland: darker areas indicate where Italian is most prominent]]'''Italian Switzerland''' ({{lang-it|Svizzera italiana}}, {{lang-rm|Svizra taliana}}, {{lang-fr|Suisse italienne}}, {{lang-de|italienische Schweiz}}) is the Italian-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], which includes the canton of [[Ticino]] and [[Italian Graubünden|the southern part of Graubünden]]. Italian is also spoken in the [[Zwischbergen|Gondo]] Valley (leading to the [[Simplon Pass]], on the southern part of the watershed) in Valais.

The linguistic region covers an area approximately 3,500&amp;nbsp;km² and has a total population of around 350,000 inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/02/blank/data/01.Document.67126.xls Bilan de la population résidante permanente selon les cantons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920100559/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/02/blank/data/01.Document.67126.xls |date=20 September 2009 }}; calculated adding up the inhabitants in [[Ticino]] and 11% of the inhabitants of [[Grigioni]], Swiss Federal Statistical Office&lt;/ref&gt; with the number of Italophones residing in Switzerland being 545,274 (about 7% of the Swiss population).&lt;ref name="CHLangHome2012"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bevölkerung, Strukturerhebung der eidgenössischen Volkszählung 2011: Bevölkerung nach Sprache und Religion, Ständige Wohnbevölkerung ab 15 Jahren nach zuhause gesprochenen Sprachen, 2011 |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/news/04/01.Document.169329.xls |type=Statistics |format=XLS |date=30 May 2013 |publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office |location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland |language=German, French, Italian |accessdate=22 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114071643/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/news/04/01.Document.169329.xls |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of Italian-speaking inhabitants had been decreasing since the 1970s, after reaching a high of 12% of the population during the same decade. This was entirely because of the reduced number of immigrants from Italy to Switzerland, but gained again during the last decade.&lt;ref name=FSOML/&gt;

===Romansh===
[[File:Sprachen GR 2000.png|thumb|300px|Distribution of Romansh in the canton [[Graubünden]] (2000).{{legend|#ab649e|Romansh speaking}}

{{legend|#958abd|Italian speaking}}]]
{{further information|Graubünden}}
On the cantonal level, [[Romansh language|Romansh]] is an official language only in the trilingual canton of Graubünden, where the municipalities in turn are free to specify their own official languages.

Significant communities of Romansh speakers remain in the [[Surselva]], the [[Gelgia (river)|Sursés/Oberhalbstein]], the lower [[Engadin]] and the [[Val Müstair]].

Romansh has been recognized as one of four "national languages" by the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] since 1938. It was also declared an "official language" of the Confederation in 1996, meaning that Romansh speakers may use their language for correspondence with the federal government and expect to receive a Romansh response.

Besides the national languages and the many varieties of [[Swiss German language|Swiss German]], several regional Romance languages are spoken natively in Switzerland: [[Franco-Provençal]] and [[Lombard language|Lombard]]. About 20,000 [[Romani people|Romani]] speak [[Sinte Romani|Sinte]], an [[Indic language]]. Five [[sign languages]] are used: [[Swiss-German Sign Language|Swiss-German]], [[French Sign Language|French]], [[Italian Sign Language|Italian]], [[Austrian Sign Language|Austrian]],&lt;ref name=Wittmann&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann, Henri]] |date=1991 |title=Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement |publisher=Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88 |url=http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German Sign Language|German]].&lt;ref name=Wittmann/&gt;

'''Lars Erik Einar Gustavsson''' (17 May 1936 – 3 April 2016) was a Swedish poet, novelist, and scholar.

==Life and career==
Gustafsson was born in [[Västerås]], completed his secondary education at the Västerås [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and continued to [[Uppsala University]], where he studied literature, aesthetics, sociology and philosophy. In 1960, he received a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] degree in philosophy. In 1978, he was awarded a PhD in [[theoretical philosophy]] with a dissertation on speech and literature. He later served for four years on the university's board of regents (1994-1998).&lt;ref&gt;Roger Gathman, interview with Gustafsson, ''Austin Chronicle'', February 2000 [https://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2000-02-25/75963/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Already by 1960 Gustafsson was publishing novels and poetry regularly. In addition to his literary work, he was editor-in-chief of the renowned literary journal ''Bonniers Litterära Magasin'' from 1962 to 1972 . He soon established international contacts, notably to the German authors in [[Group 47]]. In 1972, through a [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]] fellowship he came to West Berlin, where he lived for two years. During this period, he also traveled extensively, among other places to Australia, Singapore, Japan, Israel, and the United States. Throughout his career, he attended and participated in many international academic and cultural events. John Updike described Gustafsson as "the enviably ideal conferee, a red-bearded fish never out of water, loving books, ideas, and discourse equally, and everywhere adept."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Updike]], "No Dearth of Death," in ''Hugging the Shore: Essays and Criticism'' (New York, 1983/2012), p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been invited to visit the [[University of Texas at Austin]] by its Germanic Studies department in 1972 and again in 1974, and because [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] was his wife's hometown&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2000-02-25/75963/ ''Austin Chronicle'' interview]&lt;/ref&gt; he moved there in 1983, where he served at first as adjunct professor in Germanic Studies, later as professor, then Distinguished Professor, in the Plan II Honors&lt;ref&gt;Plan II Honors, The University of Texas at Austin. Link:  [[Wikipedia:WikiProject University of Texas at Austin/Plan II Honors]]&lt;/ref&gt; program, teaching philosophy and creative writing. He returned to Sweden in 2003 while continuing to hold a research professorship in the University; in 2006, he retired. He lived in [[Stockholm]], spending summers in [[Västmanland County|Västmanland]]. He died at the age of 79 on 3 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/lars-gustafsson-dod/ |title=Lars Gustafsson död |publisher=''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' |date=3 April 2016 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustafsson was married three times: in 1961 to Madeleine Gustafsson (two children); in 1982 to Alexandra Chasnoff (two children); in 2005 to Agneta Blomqvist. In 1981 Gustafsson [[Conversion to Judaism|converted]] to [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedishenglishtranslation.com/jwriting/gustafsson-b.htm Swedishenglishtranslation.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Lars Gustafsson declared that he would vote for the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] in the upcoming elections for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Writing==
Gustafsson published poetry, novels, short stories, critical essays, and editorials. He gained international recognition as a Swedish writer. By 1990, he had already received a dozen major literary awards including the ''Prix International Charles Veillon des Essais'' in 1983,[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prix_européen_de_l%27essai_Charles-Veillon] ''Una Vita per la Letteratura'' in 1989, as well as the Swedish Bellman Prize in 1990. He won a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship for poetry in 1994. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature (the year is unknown as the Nobel Committee keeps nominations secret for 50 years).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/laureates_nominations.html Nobel Committee Nominations]&lt;/ref&gt; Among later awards were the [[:de: Gerard-Bonnier-Preis|Gerard-Bonnier-Preis]] in 2006, the [[Goethe Medal]] in 2009, and the [[Thomas Mann Prize]] in 2015.

Gustafsson's novels and poetry have been translated into fifteen languages, the most often translated being the novels ''The Death of a Beekeeper'' (En biodlares död), ''Bernard Foy's Third Castling'' (Bernard Foys tredje rockad), and ''Afternoon of a Tiler'' (En kakelsättares eftermiddag). [[Harold Bloom]] includes Gustafsson in ''The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages'' (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;557).&lt;ref&gt;Ia Dübois  "Lars Gustafsson (17 May 1936-)," in ''Twentieth-Century Swedish Writers After World War II'', edited by Ann-Charlotte Gavel Adams (2002), p. 117. Series: ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'', vol. 257. Online edition accessed 25 Feb. 2018. Gustafsson is listed among eight Scandinavian writers in Bloom's Appendix D: "The Chaotic Age: 20th Century." Bloom later disowned his book's four historical appendices. [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Death of a Beekeeper,'' published in 1978, is Gustafsson's best-known novel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/news?articleid=558 Obituary (Bloodaxe Books)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Updike]] praised it as "a beautiful work, lyrical and bleak, resonant and terse."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Updike|Updike]], ''Hugging The Shore'', p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; Ia Dübois has called it "one of his greatest works."&lt;ref&gt;Dübois, "Gustafsson," p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Eva Stenskar has written that it "seems so effortless yet lyrical that only an artist at the height of his powers could've produced it."&lt;ref&gt;Nordic Reach, Number 21, Volume XX&lt;/ref&gt; Its main theme is the agony of disease, as it follows Vesslan—a beekeeper who is dying of cancer—through entries he makes on notepads. The book's innovative structure allows Gustafsson to explore identity through its expression in a variety of forms: imagination, memory and even the mundane details of life. The book's central theme is revealed by the repeated motto of the protagonist, "We never give up. We begin anew." Gustafsson himself has described it as "A book about pain. It describes a journey into the center where pain rules—and pain can tolerate no rivals."&lt;ref&gt;Source?&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was re-published in 1984 as the last in a five-novel sequence ''Sprickorna i muren'' (The Cracks in the Wall), the other volumes being ''Herr Gustafsson själv'', ''Yllet'', ''Familjefesten'', and ''Sigismund''.

''Bernard Foy's Third Castling'' (1986) is nearly as well-known as ''The Death of a Beekeeper''. Its settings are Sweden, Paris, Worpsewede, Germany, and Texas. The overt genre is the detective story, but there are three plots, and Bernard Foy is three separate characters: a Houston rabbi, an old Swedish poet, and a Swedish teenager. Each gradually turns into a character in the writing of the succeeding Foy. Gustafsson said that he was prompted by a “connection to Descartes' dream argument: You start with a story and it proves to be the story of a completely different person who is dreaming up the story which proves to be the story of a third person and it is all written by one or another person.”&lt;ref&gt;Information in this paragraph condensed from ''Austin Chronicle'' interview [https://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2000-02-25/75963/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustafsson's two major fields of interest interacted from the start of his career. In 2003, he wrote that "sometimes I cannot see any sharp boundary between [my literary work] and [my philosophical work]. I tend to regard myself as a philosopher who has turned literature into one of his tools."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040616084303/http://www.utexas.edu/depts/german/faculty/gustafsson.html Germanic Studies department faculty page, The University of Texas at Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; When asked where he finds his inspiration, Gustafsson answered "I listen. I listen and I look. Creativity knows no rules. You can get an idea for a novel from a little something someone says, or just a face you see. A rabbi once told me that when God spoke to Moses in that bush, it wasn't in a thundering voice; it was in a very weak voice. You have to listen carefully for that voice. You have to be very sharp."&lt;ref&gt;Nordic Reach, Number 21, Volume XX&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ''Yllet'', the second novel in ''The Cracks in the Wall'' (Sprickorna i Muren) series was made into a feature film, directed by Jimmy Karlsson and starring [[Magnus Krepper]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330711/ Sprickorna i muren (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the problem of identity has been the defining theme of Gustafsson's writings, his social criticism often vexed the Swedish cultural elite. As a result he is seen as a controversial writer in Sweden rather than as one embraced by the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dübois, "Gustafsson," p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lexical function''' (LF) is a tool developed within [[Meaning-Text Theory]] for the description and systematization of [[semantic]] relationships, specifically [[collocation]]s and lexical [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]], between particular [[lexical unit]]s (LUs) of a language.&lt;ref&gt;Fontenelle, Thierry. (2008) Using a bilingual dictionary to create semantic networks. In Thierry Fontenelle (ed.), Practical Lexicography: A reader, 175–185. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="extracted from" group="note"/&gt; LFs are also used in the construction of technical [[Lexicon|lexica]] ([[Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary|Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionaries]]) and as abstract nodes in certain types of [[Meaning-Text Theory#Syntactic representation|syntactic representation]]. Basically, an LF is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] ƒ( ) representing a correspondence ƒ that associates a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ƒ(L) of lexical expressions with an LU L; in f(L), L is the keyword of ƒ, and ƒ(L) = {L´&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;} is ƒ’s value. Detailed discussions of Lexical Functions are found in Žolkovskij &amp; Mel’čuk 1967,&lt;ref name="zhiam" /&gt; Mel’čuk 1974,&lt;ref name="IAM1974" /&gt; 1996,&lt;ref name="IAM1996" /&gt; 1998,&lt;ref name="IAM1998" /&gt; 2003,&lt;ref name="IAM2003" /&gt; 2007,&lt;ref name="IAM2007" /&gt; and Wanner (ed.) 1996;&lt;ref name="Wanner1996" /&gt; analysis of the most frequent type of lexical functions—verb-noun collocations—can be found in Gelbukh &amp; Kolesnikova 2013.&lt;ref name="GK2012" /&gt;

==Standard Lexical Functions==
Standard LFs form a proper [[subset]] of normal LFs. A normal LF ƒ is called Standard if and only if it satisfies both following conditions:

1. Broadness of the [[Function (mathematics)|domain]] of ƒ: ƒ is defined for a relatively large number of keywords;&lt;br/&gt;
2. Diversity of the [[Function (mathematics)|range]] of ƒ: ƒ has a relatively large number of expressions as elements of its possible values and these expressions are more or less equitably distributed between different keywords.

Normal LFs that do not satisfy both Conditions 1 and 2, on the one hand, and degenerate LFs, on the other, are called Non-Standard.
An example of a Non-Standard LF is the meaning ‘without addition of dairy product’. It has two expressions in English, a phraseological one—BLACK (with COFFEE: black coffee), and a free one—WITHOUT MILK (tea without milk is not *''black tea''). This meaning fails Condition 1: it is too specific and applicable only to  one beverage. It thus corresponds to a Non-Standard LF.

===Simple Standard LFs===
1. '''Syn''' [Lat. ''synonymum''] = synonym.&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Syn'''(''helicopter'') = ''copter, chopper''&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Syn'''(''telephone''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''phone''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;
2. '''Anti''' [Lat. ''antonymum''] = antonym.&lt;br/&gt;
3. '''Conv'''&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt; [Lat. ''conversivum''] = conversive. &lt;br/&gt;
:This LF returns for L an LU L´ with the same meaning as L but with its Deep Syntactic Actants (roughly, syntactic arguments) i, j and k permuted —for example, the DSyntAs k, i and j of L are permuted in L´ such that [i→k, j→i, and k→j].
 '''Conv'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(''include'') = ''belong''&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Conv'''&lt;sub&gt;231&lt;/sub&gt;⊃(''opinion'') = ''reputation''&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Conv'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(''behind'') = ''in front of''&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Conv'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(''precede'') = ''follow''
4. '''Gener''' [Lat. ''genus''] = the closest generic concept for L. 
:The value of this LF must appear in one of the following two constructions:
::1) ‘Gener(L)−ATTR→DER(L)’ = ‘L’ [where DER is any DSynt-derivative, see 6–9 below]; or
::2) ''L, X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and other (kinds of)'' '''Gener'''(L).
 '''Gener'''(''republic'') = ''state'' [''republican state = republic'']&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Gener'''(''liquid''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''substance'' [''liquid''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; ''substance'' = ''liquid''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;

5. '''Figur''' [Lat. ''figuraliter'' ‘figuratively’] = standard received metaphor for L. 
 '''Figur'''(''fog'') = ''wall'' [''wall of fog ≈ fog'']&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Figur'''(''rain'') = ''curtain'' [''curtain of rain ≈ rain'']&lt;br/&gt;
 '''Figur'''(''remorse'') = ''pangs'' [''pangs of remorse ≈ remorse'']
6. '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Substantival, output N having a congruent meaning to L (which can be of any part of speech except N):
 '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''analyze'') = ''analysis''
7. '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Adjectival, output A having a congruent meaning to L (which can be of any part of speech except A):
 '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''city'') = ''urban''
8. '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Verbal, output V having a congruent meaning to L (which can be of any part of speech except V):
 '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''analysis'') = ''analyze''
9. '''Adv'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Adverbial, output Adv having a congruent meaning to L (which can be of any part of speech except Adv):

42. '''Labreal'''&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt; [a hybrid of '''Labor''' and '''Real'''] 

43. '''Involv''' [Lat. ''involvere'' ‘[''to''] ''drag along''’] = verb meaning ‘[''to''] ''involve'' Y’, ‘[''to''] ''affect'' Y’
:'''Involv''' links L and the name of a non-participant Y which is affected or acted upon by the situation ‘L’; Y is DSyntA II of ''Involv'', and L  is its DSyntA I:
 '''Involv'''(''light&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') = ''floods'' [N = Y, e.g. the room]
 '''Involv'''(''snowstorm'') = ''catches'' [N&lt;sub&gt;hum&lt;/sub&gt;=Y Loc&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; N], ''hits'' [N&lt;sub&gt;area&lt;/sub&gt;= Y]
44. '''Manif''' [Lat. ''manifestāre'' ‘[to] manifest’] = verb meaning ‘L manifests itself [≈ becomes apparent] in Y’
:The keyword L, a noun, is DSyntA I of '''Manif''', and Y (= in which L manifests itself) is its DSyntA II:
 '''Manif'''(''doubt'') = ''nags''
 '''Manif'''(''joy'') = ''lights up'' [''his eyes'']
45. '''Degrad''' [Lat. ''degradāre'' ‘[to] degrade’] = verb meaning ‘[to] degrade’ ≈ ‘[to] become permanently worse or bad’. 
:'''Degrad''' takes its keyword L, which can be any noun, as its DSyntA I.
 '''Degrad'''(''milk'') = ''goes sour''
 '''Degrad'''(''meat'') = ''goes off''	
 '''Degrad'''(''discipline'') = ''weakens''
 '''Degrad'''(''house'') = ''becomes dilapidated''
46. '''Son''' [Lat. ''sonāre'' ‘[''to''] ''sound''’] = verb meaning ‘[to] emit characteristic sound’. 
:'''Son''' also takes its keyword, which most often, but not necessarily, is a concrete noun, as its DSyntA I.
 '''Son'''(''dog'') = ''barks''
 '''Son'''(''battle'') = ''rumbles''
 '''Son'''(''banknotes'') = ''rustle''
 '''Son'''(''wind'') = ''howls''

===Complex LFs and Configurations of LFs===
Simple LFs can be combined to form complex LFs:
 '''AntiMagn'''(''applause'') = ''scattered''
 '''IncepOper'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''love&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') = [''to'']  ''fall'' [''in'' ~]
 '''Adv'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''Real'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''whim'') = ''on'' [''a'' ~]
Certain expressions (collocations or derivations) can simultaneously realize two LFs, resulting in a configuration of LFs:
 '''[Magn + Oper&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]'''(''doubt'') = [''to''] ''be plagued'' [''by'' ~] (≈ ‘[''to''] ''have'' [= '''Oper'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;] ''strong'' [= '''Magn'''] ''doubts''’)
 '''[Ver + Oper&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]'''(''health'') = [''to''] ''have a clean bill'' [''of'' ~] (≈ ‘[''to''] ''have'' [= '''Oper'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;] ''good'' [= '''Ver'''] ''health''’)

==LFs in the lexicon==
Lexical Functions play an important part in the [[lexicon]], which of necessity must include information about the collocational and derivational properties of LUs. In MTT, the LFs for L are included in the entry for L in the [[Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary]]:

He did it from deep revulsion for the bitterness of the sectarian strife. Any revulsion they might feel from fat-ass bastards they ran up against professionally was ad hominem and not ad genus [A.

'''Lift slab construction''' (also called the Youtz-Slick Method) is a method of constructing [[concrete]] buildings by [[casting]] the floor or roof slab on top of the previous slab and then raising (jacking) the slab up with [[hydraulic jack]]s. This method of construction allows for a large portion of the work to be completed at ground level, negating the need to form floor work in place. The ability to create monolithic [[concrete slab]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s makes the lift slab construction technique useful in quickly creating structures with repetitive form work, like parking ramps. 

== History ==
This method of construction simultaneously began development in 1948 by both Philip N. Youtz of New York and Thomas B. Slick of Texas. Although the first patent for lift slab construction was given to Slick in 1955, the method of construction is commonly referred to as the "Youtz-Slick Method".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Apparatus for erecting a building|date=Aug 9, 1955|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2715013|inventor-last=B|inventor-first=Slick Thomas|issue=US2715013 A|accessdate=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His patent called for a method that would allow for fabrication to be completed at the ground level, eliminate a large portion of the [[formwork]], create uniform floors of concrete, and reduce the labor to be completed at an elevated level.

== Applications of lift slab construction ==
The method was first used at [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] during the construction of Northup Hall in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a%3Dd%26d%3Dp1757 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221060522/http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a=d&amp;d=p1757 |archivedate=2014-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Northrup Hall was the first full scale building erected using lift slab construction. Being such, the process drew a crowd of spectators, waiting to see if the structural integrity of the building would hold.&lt;ref&gt;Brackenridge, R.D. ''Trinity University: A Tale of Three Cities''. Trinity University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CU Johnstone Hall Aug2010.jpg|thumb|Johnstone Hall, Clemson University]]
'''[[Johnstone Hall]]''', a [[Clemson University]] dormitory in [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]], [[South Carolina]], was erected using this method in 1954, as did [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Portland, Oregon)|'''Woodrow Wilson High School''']] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oregondigital.org/catalog/oregondigital:df67rn17s#page/3/mode/1up|title=Wilson High School (Portland, oregon)|last=|first=|date=|website=Oregon Digital|publisher=Oregon Historical Site Form|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the blocks from Johnstone Hall have now been demolished.

The building located at '''2150 Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, CA''' (or '''First Savings Building''') is one example of lift slab construction utilized in the Bay Area in the mid-twentieth century. Built in 1969, the First Savings Building utilizes lift slab construction to support the fourteen story height of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi, Franklin; Winder, Sarah (2015-05-15). [https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Planning_(new_site_map_walk-through)/Level_3_-_General/DPR523%20ShattuckAve_2150%20090115.pdf "Primary Record: First Savings Building"] (PDF). ''City of Berkeley, California''. California Department of Parks and Recreation.&lt;/ref&gt; The building's structural system consists of a system of trusses from which the various concrete slab floors are hung. In turn, these trusses extend out from two reinforced concrete cores which provide the main structural support for the entirety of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Mar, David; et al. (n.d.). "Performanced-Based Seismic Upgrade of a 14-Story Suspended Slab Building Using State-of-the-Art Analysis and Construction Techniques". Tipping Structural Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lift slab construction was also involved in the '''[[L'Ambiance Plaza]]''' collapse in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], Connecticut, in 1987, and resulted in a nationwide federal investigation into this construction technique in the United States, and Connecticut imposed a temporary [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on lift slab construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/23-years-later-L-Ambiance-losses-still-sting-460387.php|title=23 years later, L'Ambiance losses still sting|last=Barone|first=Meg|date=April 23, 2010|journal=[[Connecticut Post]]|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the structure has been primarily attributed to instability with the steel columns that were meant to support the floors. Although other factors were involved in the collapse while under construction, it is the insufficient lateral bracing that ultimately caused the structural failure.&lt;ref&gt;Feld, J., and K.L. Carper. ''Construction Failure''. A Wiley Interscience Publication. Wiley, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

=== Concrete ===
To begin, a concrete slab is first poured on the ground level. Lifting collars are set around each of the columns and cast into place as the slab is poured around them. The lifting collars will later be used to support the slab as it is raised and secured in place. Subsequent floors and the roof are then poured and formed on top of the initial ground slab. Bond breakers are used between each floor plate to allow the slabs to separate as they are raised.&lt;ref&gt;Brannigan, F.L. ''Building Construction for the Fire Service''. Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, LLC, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with reducing the formwork required to create the slabs, slabs can be easily protected from inclement weather since all of the slabs remain together during the curing process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randall|first=Frank A.|date=|title=New developments in lift slab construction|url=http://imcyc.com/biblioteca/ArchivosPDF/Tilt-Up/4%20New%20developments%20in%20lift%20slab%20construction.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lifting ===
Once the slabs have been raised to their desired height the lifting collars are welded to the columns, along with shear blocks to support the slab from beneath. To assure the security of a structure during the raising of the slabs, the hydraulic [[Jack (device)|jack]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, attached to the top of the columns, use synchronized consoles to lift the slabs at an even rate. Conventional methods of mounting the jacks to the columns require that the jacks are removed before continuing to raise the slabs. More recent approaches utilize welded plates, separated from the columns, to support the jack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Simultaneous floor and wall construction ===
In Latin America, contractors have started to use a form of lift slab construction where [[Load-bearing wall|load-bearing concrete wall]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are raised at the same time as the floor slabs. Both the wall panels and the floor slabs are cast on the ground. The walls are attached to the slabs through hinges formed by plastic ropes. As the floors are raised, the walls unfold into place and form the vertical support for the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mal''', also known as '''Thin''', is a [[Mon–Khmer language]] of Laos and Thailand. It is one of several closely related languages which go by the names ''Thin'' or ''Prai''.

'''Tayten''' (300 speakers as of 1995) is spoken in the 2 villages of Ban Phia and Ban Tenngiou in Pakxeng District, Luang Prabang Province, Laos. It is either Thin or [[Tai Thanh language|Tai Then]].&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/Laos/Tayten.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mixed ability''' is a proposed new term to be used in place of the terms [[Disability|disabled]], handicapped, abnormal, and crippled. Mixed ability refers to any person who has a different or ''mixed'' physical ''ability''. It can also refer to anyone who has a different emotional or learning ability. Words like disabled, crippled, and handicapped have negative connotations throughout history. Mixed ability contemporizes the label placed on those who have a different or medically documented physical or mental abilities and attempts to relieve any social or conversational [[Social stigma|stigma]].

The objective in changing the term is to eliminate [[stereotype]]s that exist currently in any society in regard to those with a mixed ability.

==In education==
Mixed ability may also refer to a group in which children of varied abilities are taught together rather than being set apart in groups according to level of learning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.buffalostate.edu/~MED595/JRME1998-11-533a.pdf An example of "mixed ability" in an educational setting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Şalli-Çopur, Deniz. [http://iteslj.org/Techniques/Salli-Copur-MixedAbility.html Coping with the Problems of Mixed Ability Classes], Internet TESL Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Educator Robert Pondiscio has argued that mixed-ability grouping in the classroom creates problems of its own, especially the neglect of higher-functioning students.  He also points out that "tracking," the practice of grouping students by ability, is routinely used in school sports programs, and questions whether educators are more concerned about athletic achievement than they are about academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Pondiscio, Robert.

'''No comment''' is a phrase used as a response to [[journalistic]] inquiries which the respondent does not wish to answer. Public figures may decline to comment on issues they are questioned or have nothing to say about the issue at the time. 

''No comment'' indicates that the speaker does not choose to say anything on the subject, and it is automatically invalidated if the speaker then comments or answers questions.  It is not a request for the material to be considered ''[[Journalism sourcing#Using confidential information|off the record]]'' or otherwise kept confidential.  If the speaker wishes to talk about the subject, but does not wish to be named as a source, he must obtain the journalist's explicit agreement in advance that the response is not to be used for attribution.

== Etymology ==

The first recorded usage as a stock answer to questions was made in 1950 by [[Charlie Ross (journalist)|Charles Ross]] (President Harry Truman's White House press secretary).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=comment&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 etymonline.com narrowed search for "comment"] accessed 2016-06-15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some [[public relations]] professionals have argued against the use of ''no comment'', stating that one of the goals of working with the press is to resolve issues before they become hot topics. Offering no comment allows the press to fill in the blanks, diverts the focus of the publicity, and sacrifices an opportunity to communicate key messages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Laermer|Laermer, R]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3915">The '''Nordic Language Convention''' is a [[Treaty|convention]] of [[linguistic rights]] that came into force on 1 March 1987, under the auspices of the [[Nordic Council]]. Under the Convention, citizens of the [[Nordic countries]] have the opportunity to use their [[native language]] when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any [[interpreting|interpretation]] or [[translation]] costs. The Convention covers health care, social security, tax, school, and employment authorities, the police and
courts. The languages included are [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/about-nordic-co-operation/treaties-and-agreements/treaties-and-agreements/education-and-research/spraakkonventionen?set_language=en  Konvention mellan Sverige, Danmark, Finland, Island och Norge om nordiska medborgares rätt att använda sitt eget språk i annat nordiskt land], ''Nordic Council website''.

{{Other uses}}
The phrase "'''not even wrong'''" describes an argument or explanation that purports to be scientific but is based on invalid reasoning or speculative premises that can neither be proven correct nor [[falsifiability|falsified]]. Hence, it refers to statements that cannot be discussed in a rigorous, [[scientific method|scientific sense]].&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt; For a meaningful discussion on whether a certain statement is true or false, the statement must satisfy the criterion called "falsifiability"—the inherent possibility for the statement to be tested and found false. In this sense, the phrase "not even wrong" is synonymous to "nonfalsifiable".&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt;

The phrase is generally attributed to  [[theoretical physicist]] [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was known for his colorful objections to incorrect or careless thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shermer M |authorlink = Michael Shermer | title = Wronger Than Wrong | journal = Scientific American | year = 2006 | pages =  | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810231612/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=wronger-than-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNAPngEACAAJ |title=Atom and Archetype: The Pauli/Jung Letters, 1932–1958 |last=Jung |first=C.

Pauli remarked sadly, 'It is not even wrong'."&lt;ref name=peierls&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peierls, R. |title=Wolfgang Ernst Pauli, 1900–1958 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume=5 |issue= |page=186 |year=1960 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1960.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also often quoted as "That is not only not right; it is not even wrong", or in Pauli's native [[German language|German]], "{{lang|de|Das ist nicht nur nicht richtig; es ist nicht einmal falsch!}}". Peierls remarks that quite a few [[Apocrypha#Metaphorical usage|apocryphal stories]] of this kind have been circulated and mentions that he listed only the ones personally vouched for by him. He also quotes another example when Pauli replied to [[Lev Landau]], "What you said was so confused that one could not tell whether it was nonsense or not."&lt;ref name=peierls /&gt;

The phrase is often used to describe [[pseudoscience]] or bad science and is considered derogatory.&lt;ref name=Bukerman&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1573072,00.html |title = Not even wrong |publisher = The Guardian |date = September 19, 2005 |author = Oliver Burkeman |authorlink = Oliver Burkeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">In [[computer science]], particularly in [[human-computer interaction]], '''presentation semantics''' specify how a particular piece of a [[formal language]] is represented in a distinguished manner accessible to [[human senses]], usually human vision. For example, saying that &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;bold&gt; ... &lt;/bold&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must render the text between these constructs using some [[bold typeface]] is a specification of presentation semantics for that [[syntax]]. An example of  interactive presentation semantics is defining the expected behavior of a [[Hyperlink|hypertext link]] on a suitable syntax.

Many [[markup languages]] like [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[DSSSL]], [[XSL-FO]] or [[troff]] have presentation semantics, but others like [[XML]], [[XLink]] and [[XPath]] do not.&lt;ref&gt; H. P.

'''Prlwytzkofsky''' is{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} a fictional written variant of the [[Dutch language]], based on the idiolect of the [[Polish language|Polish]]-[[Germans|German]] [[Professor Zbigniew Prlwytzkofsky]] (sometimes spelled Prlwytzkofski), as featured in the [[Tom Puss]] (Tom Poes in Dutch) and [[Oliver B. Bumble]] (Olivier B. Bommel in Dutch) series by [[Marten Toonder]].

== Frequent catchphrases by professor Prlwytzkofsky ==
The Professor uses several well-known catchphrases:
* "'''Praw!'''": used at the beginning of exclamations. Something has gone wrong and the Professor expresses his dismay. The word is probably derived from Slavic "prav" (=that is right, you are right), since it replaces the normal Dutch "waarachtig" (which literally means truly).
* "'''Der naam is Prlwytzkofsky. Met ener z in der midden. Der goede dag.'''" Translation: "The name is Prlwytzkofsky. with a z in the middle. The good day." (alternative second sentence: "'''Met ener y an der enden.'''", "With a y at the end"). This is his usual greeting, even when meeting people he knows very well.
* "'''Gans (on)wetenschappelijk!'''" meaning "completely (un)scientific". Example: the professor routinely calls his scientific colleague [[Sickbock]] "gans onwetenschappelijker kwak".

== Distinctive characteristics of the Prlwytzkofsky language ==
The language is characterised by an abundance of composite words built on the combination of words literally translated from German, but in a small number of cases including a Slavic word. Often, the particular combination in Dutch may create a hint or an echo of a totally unconnected word. For instance, "'''mislinger'''" (loser,failure, a person) combines the Dutch word mis (miss = wrong, failure) with the German word (ge)lingen (succeed) creating a word which hints at "slinger" (pendulum or festoon). The actual Dutch word is "mislukkeling". Professor Prlwytzkofsky calls disturbed brains "'''verhoornde hersenschors'''" - horned [[cerebral cortex]]. "Verhoornd" ([[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]ed) rhymes with "verstoord" (disturbed), which is the meaning here, but actually translates the German word for [[brain]], which is "Gehirn". Without knowledge of the German word, one may be led to think that the phrase refers to the brains of a cuckold.

A Slavic influence is obvious in Prlwytzkofsky calling his assistant Alexander Pieps (a mouse) "'''Irkoetsk'''" ("short-statured assistant, who always manages to do things in the wrong way", but of course also referring to [[Irkutsk|the Siberian town]]).

=== Straight German Influence ===
Clearest examples of [[Germanization]] are:

* the use of the German [[masculine gender]] [[Article (grammar)|article]] "'''Der'''"
(but since all words not of the female sex but ending in a [[consonant]] or [[diphthong]] take "Der" as their article, this also hides a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] substratum and simplifies the Prlwytzkofsky gender system, compared to Dutch and German)
* a limited number of isolated words like "'''gans'''" (whole), "'''tas'''" (cup), words with the -iker ending rather than the Dutch -icus. These words are actually in normal use in the variant of the Dutch language spoken in [[Flanders]].
* the order of auxiliary verbs in subordinate sentences is as in German

=== [[Germanism (linguistics)|Germanism]]s ===
* "'''overhoofd'''" (Dutch actually uses überhaupt)
* "'''manschap'''" (team, troops, from German Mannschaft. Dutch only uses this word in the plural)
* "'''kraftwagen'''" (=car)

=== [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] linguistic influence ===
* "'''besjnemtsing'''" : a sexual insult, possibly hinting at "[[degermanization]]" and claimed to be [[Serbo-Croatian people|Serbo-Croat]] in origin by the [[Haagsch Bommel Genootschap]].
* "'''proeksel'''" : sexual insult, meaning unknown but claimed to be Serbo-Croat. The word made it into the Dutch language and developed several meanings, from "wet snow" to "mashed and mixed-up food".
* "'''frlwortzln'''" : verb, derogatory and possibly meaning to dismember by a process involving eradication, also claimed to be influenced by Serbo-Croat.

=== Miscellaneous influences ===
* "'''Minkukel'''": although not original Prlwytzkofsky language (it was coined by extraterrestrials in '''Tom Poes en het Kukel'''), the Professor is responsible for its present meaning in Dutch: a "person with a low IQ". Only after his own "kukel" is measured by the extraterrestrials and diagnosed as negative, does he start to protest it must mean something else. Only the whacky (but Taoist) goose Wammes Waggel has a "plus" kukel and Oliver Bommel's kukel registers as zero (higher than everybody else in Rommeldam, even Tom Poes, who all get negative scores), signifying "kukel" has nothing to do with intelligence, but rather with spontaneity and savoir-vivre.
* "'''Kwak'''": English: quack. Although the normal Dutch word is "kwakzalver" and the German word is "Quacksalber", the Professor always uses the shorter form, which may indicate [[English language|English]] influence.
* contrary to practice in both Dutch and German, the perfect participle of a second, third ... auxiliary in a subordinated clause is never turned into an infinitive (this may be an influence of English, or of [[Romance languages]])

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Edouard Manet 004.jpg|thumb|[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]] by [[Edouard Manet]] may be an early example of product placement. The distinctive label and shape of two bottles allow them to be identified as [[Bass beer]]]]
Product placement began in the 19th century. By the time [[Jules Verne]] published the adventure novel ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (novel)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' (1873), his fame had led transport and shipping companies to lobby to be mentioned in the story. Whether Verne  was actually paid to do so, however, remains unknown.&lt;ref name=butcher&gt;William Butcher (translation and introduction). ''Around the World in Eighty Days'', [[Oxford Worlds Classics]], 1995, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a painting by Eduoard Manet (1881-1882) shows a bar at the [[Folies Bergere]] with distinctive bottles placed at either end of the counter. The beer bottle is immediately recognisable as Bass beer. Manet's motivations for including branded products in his painting are unknown; it may be that it simply added to the work's authenticity, but on the other hand the artist may have received some payment in return for its inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Lehu, J-M, ''Branded Entertainment: Product Placement &amp; Brand Strategy in the Entertainment Business,'' Kogan Page, 2007, pp 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Research reported by Jean-Marc Lehu (2007) suggests that films produced by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] in 1876 were made at the request of a representative of [[Lever Brothers]] in France. The films feature [[Sunlight (cleaning product)|Sunlight soap]], which may be the first recorded instance of paid product placement in film.&lt;ref&gt;Lehu, J-M, ''Branded Entertainment: Product Placement &amp; Brand Strategy in the Entertainment Business,'' Kogan Page, 2007, pp 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; This led to cinema becoming one of the earliest channels used for product placement.

[[File:Johanna Schaffgotsch liest Die Woche closeUp.jpg|thumb|Self-advertising: A German countess holds a copy of the magazine ''Die Woche'' in her hands. The photo appeared in 1902 in an issue of the magazine. (detail of the actual photograph)]]

With the arrival of photo-rich periodicals in the late 19th century, publishers found ways of lifting their paper's reputation by placing an actual copy of the magazine in photographs of prominent people. For example, the German magazine ''[[Die Woche]]'' in 1902 printed an article about a countess in her castle where she, in one of the photographs, holds a copy of the magazine in her hands.&lt;ref&gt;''Die Woche'', issue 40, October 4, 1902, page 1874&lt;/ref&gt;

Product placement was a common feature of many of the earliest [[Actuality film|actualities]] and cinematic attractions from the first ten years of cinema history.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Gurevitch, Leon. (2010). "The Cinemas of Transactions: The exchangeable currency of GC attractions across audiovisual" in ''Popular Narrative Media'', [[Liverpool University Press]], Liverpool, Vol. 2 (2), 143-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next four decades, ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' frequently cited cases of on-screen brand-name products.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews]]''. Volume 1, page iii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. S. Harrison|Harrison]] condemned the practice as harmful to movie theatres, and his editorials reflected his hostility towards product placement in films. ''Harrison's Reports'' published its first denunciation of that practice over [[Chevron Corporation|Red Crown gasoline's]] appearance in ''[[The Garage (1920 film)|The Garage]]'' (1920).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports]]''. January 17, 1920, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Another editorial  criticised the collaboration between the [[Corona Typewriter]] company and [[First National Pictures]] when a Corona typewriter appeared in several films in the mid-1920s including ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports]]''. September 12, 1925, page 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognisable brand names appeared in movies from cinema's earliest history. Before films were even narrative forms in the sense that they are recognized today, industrial concerns funded the making of what film scholar Tom Gunning described as "cinematic attractions",&lt;ref&gt;For more detail on the Cinemas of Attractions see Tom Gunning's work: "The Cinema of Attractions: Early Film, Its Spectator and the Avant-Garde"; in ''Early Film'' ed. Thomas Elsaesser and Adam Barker ([[British Film Institute]], 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; short films of one or two minutes. In the first decade or so of film (1895–1907) audiences attended films as "fairground attractions" interesting for their then-amazing visual effects. This format was better suited to product placement than narrative cinema. Gurevitch argued that early cinematic attractions have more in common with television advertisements in the 1950s than they do with traditional films.&lt;ref&gt;See Gurevitch, Leon (2010) "The Cinemas of Transactions: The Exchangeable Currency of CG Attractions", ''Journal of Television and New Media'', [[Sage Publications]], New York, 11 (5), 367-385&lt;/ref&gt; Gurevitch suggested that as a result, the relationship between cinema and advertising is intertwined, suggesting that cinema was in part the result of advertising and the economic advantage that it provided early film makers.&lt;ref name="Gurevitch, L. 2009"&gt;Gurevitch, L. (2009). "Problematic Dichotomies: Narrative and Spectacle in Film and Advertising Scholarship", ''Journal of Popular Narrative Media'', Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, Vol. 2 (2), 143-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Segrave detailed the industries that advertised in these early films.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Segrave. ''Product Placement in Hollywood Films: A History''. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movies and television===

====Early film====
A feature film that has expectations of reaching millions of viewers attracts marketers.&lt;ref&gt;Wiles, Michael. (2009) ''The Worth of Product Placement in Successful Film''&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases no payment is made for product exposure and no promise of marketing support is made when consumer brands appear in movies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Film productions need props for scenes, so each movie's ''[[property master]]'', who is responsible for gathering props film, contacts product placement middlemen agencies or product companies directly. In addition to items for on-screen use, the product/service supplier might provide a production with large quantities of complementary products or services. Tapping product placement channels can be particularly valuable for movies when a vintage product is required—such as a sign or bottle—that is not readily available.

Although there is no definitive proof that product placement for Red Crown gasoline in ''The Garage'', [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]'' (1922) contained a prominent title card in the opening credits reading "The gowns of the female stars were designed by Vally Reinecke and made in the fashion studios of Flatow-Schädler und Mossner."

Among notable [[silent film]]s to feature product placement was ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' (1927), the first to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. It contained a plug for [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's chocolate]]. Fritz Lang's film ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (released in 1931) shows a banner display for [[Wrigley Company|Wrigley's PK Chewing Gum]], for approximately 20–30 seconds.

Another early example occurs in ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932), where [[Thelma Todd]]'s character falls out of a canoe and into a river. She calls for a "[[Personal flotation device|life saver]]" and [[Groucho Marx]] tosses her a [[Life Savers]] candy. ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) depicts a young boy with aspirations to be an explorer, displaying a prominent copy of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine. In ''[[Love Happy]]'' (1949), [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]] cavorts on a rooftop among various billboards and at one point escapes from the villains on the old [[Mobil]] logo, the "Flying Red Horse". ''Harrison's Reports'' severely criticised this scene in its film review&lt;ref&gt;''Harrison's Reports''; October 8, 1949, page 162.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a front-page editorial. In ''[[Gun Crazy]]'' (1949), the climactic crime is the payroll robbery of the [[Armour and Company|Armour]] meat-packing plant, where a [[Bulova]] clock is prominently displayed.

=====Later films=====
''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' and ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' film series featured conspicuous placements. The film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|ET]]'' is often cited for its multiple, obvious placements.

In the New World Pictures dub of ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'', ''Godzilla 1984'', [[Dr. Pepper]] is subject to prominent product placement in the new scenes shot specifically for the dub. In a scene shot at an American military base, a vending machine is situated directly between two characters, and in similar scenes characters are often shown drinking the soft drink.

[[Cheerios]] and [[Coca-Cola]] had product placement in the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] musical [[Evita (musical)|''Evita'']], in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' and the sequel ''[[Superman II]]''. [[Clark Kent]] eats Cheerios for breakfast in ''Smallville''. In ''[[Superman II]]''{{'}}s climax, Superman crashes into a giant Coca-Cola advertisement and saves people on a bus bearing an ad for ''Evita'', before he smashes into a [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] delivery truck.

A more prominent example of product placement comes in the film ''[[Cast Away]]'' in which Tom Hanks, the lead character, is a [[FedEx]] employee. References to the delivery company FedEx are made throughout the film, and the company is central to the plot itself. ''[[The Internship]]'' (2013), which features two unemployed friends seeking employment at [[Google]], was described by Tom Brook of the [[BBC]] as "one huge advertisement for Google" that took "product placement to a startling new extreme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130704-the-internship-a-movie-or-an-ad|title=The Internship: One long ad for Google?|publisher=BBC|first=Tom|last=Brook|accessdate=12 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113161645/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130704-the-internship-a-movie-or-an-ad|archive-date=January 13, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early television====
In other early media, e.g., [[radio]] in the 1930s and 1940s and [[television]] in the 1950s, programs were often [[Underwriting spot|underwritten]] by companies. ''[[Soap opera]]s'' were so-named because they were initially underwritten by [[consumer packaged goods]] companies such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] or [[Unilever]]. When television began to displace radio, [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont's]] ''[[Cavalcade of Stars]]'' television show was, in its era, notable for not relying on a sole [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]. Sponsorship continues with programs being sponsored by major vendors such as [[Hallmark Cards]].

The conspicuous display of [[Studebaker]] motor vehicles in the television series ''[[Mr. Ed]]'' (1961–1966), which was sponsored by the Studebaker Corporation from 1961 to 1963, as well as the display of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] vehicles on the series ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'' (1961–1966), which was sponsored by the Ford Motor Company from 1961 to 1965, are notable examples of television product placement.

==Types==
Placements fall into two categories: those that are donated to reduce production costs and those placed in exchange for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;ERMA.org, a Hollywood product placement association&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amanda D. Lotz|Lotz]] refers to two classifications within these two categories—"basic" and "advanced". Basic placement is when the logo of an object or a brand name is visible but the characters do not draw attention to the brand. Advanced placement is when the product or brand is mentioned by name by characters in the show or movie.&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) ''The Television Will Be Revolutionized''. New York, NY: [[New York University Press]]. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Barter and service deals (mobile phones provided for crew use, for instance) are also common practices. Content providers may trade product placements for help funding advertisements tied-in with a film's release, a show's new season or other event.&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) ''The Television Will Be Revolutionized''. New York, NY: New York University Press. p. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of product placement is advertisement placement. In this case an [[advertisement]] for the product (rather than the product itself) appears in the production. Examples include a [[Lucky Strike]] cigarette advertisement on a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] or a truck with a milk advertisement on its trailer.

===Re-placement===
Placing contemporary products into existing content creates new opportunities for marketers.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Friedman and Jack Neff, "Eagle-Eye Marketers Find Right Spot, Right Time,''Advertising Age'', 1/22/01.&lt;/ref&gt; Current product placements can be added to older programs when they are rerun or released on video.&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) ''The Television Will Be Revolutionized''. New York, NY: New York University Press. p. 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/02/business/media/02digital.html |title=Advertising's Twilight Zone: That Signpost Up Ahead May Be a Virtual Product |last=Lubell |first=Sam |date=January 2, 2006 |website=nytimes.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612172247/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/02/business/media/02digital.html |archive-date=June 12, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/48956.html |title=Virtual Product Placement Infiltrates TV, Film, Games |last=Cohen |first=Nancy |date=February 23, 2006 |website=ecommercetimes.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303233228/http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/48956.html |archive-date=March 3, 2009 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include ''[[Numb3rs]]'' and ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]''; where a scene may be shot originally with a blank table, with sponsored products digitally added, possibly for each airing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11728512/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/product-placement-goes-digital-gets-lucrative/#.W-Gw--JRfIU |title=Product placement goes digital, gets lucrative |last=Cobb |first=Jarry |date=March 8, 2006 |website=nbcnews.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531052714/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11728512/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/product-placement-goes-digital-gets-lucrative#.W-Gw--JRfIU |archive-date=May 31, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, dynamic or switchable placements became possible. Placements can be customised based upon factors such as demographics, [[psychographics]] or behavioral information about the consumer. In-game advertising vendors such as [[Massive Incorporated]] transmit user information such as individual player IDs and data about what was on the screen and for how long to their servers, enabling user-specific placements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article/ads-get-piece-of-the-action |title=Ads get piece of the action |last=Kyllo |first=Blaine |date=September 1, 2005 |website=straight.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019233515/https://www.straight.com/article/ads-get-piece-of-the-action |archive-date=October 19, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypervideo]] techniques allow the insertion of interactive elements into video.

===Brand integration===
A variant of product placement is brand integration, which varies from placement when "the product or company name becomes part of the show in such a way that it contributes to the narrative and creates an environment of brand awareness beyond that produced by advanced placement."&lt;ref name="revolutionized169"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotz|first=Amanda|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|year=2007|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8147-5220-3|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this type of advertising is common on unscripted shows such as ''[[The Apprentice (TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', it can also be used in [[scripted television]].&lt;ref name="revolutionized169" /&gt; An early example was by [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], when one of its stores provided the notional venue for part of the romantic comedy film ''[[Man's Favorite Sport?]]'' (1964). On ''[[All My Children]]'' one character took a job at [[Revlon]].&lt;ref name="revolutionized169" /&gt; The character's job became part of the character's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzagency.com/our-work/project/damages-cadillac/|title=Damages + Cadillac|publisher=BLITZ Agency|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108190600/http://www.blitzagency.com/our-work/project/damages-cadillac/|archivedate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' not only prominently features [[Ford]] cars and other commercial products, but also includes a scene displaying its own promotional merchandise. One shot shows the "Jurassic Park Souvenir Store", with products that it offered for sale to fans.

===Product displacement===
According to [[Danny Boyle]], director of the film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (2008), the makers used "[[product displacement]]" to accommodate sponsors such as [[Mercedes-Benz]] that refused to allow their products to be used in non-flattering settings. While Mercedes did not mind having a gangster driving their cars, they objected to their products being shown in a [[slum]]. The makers removed [[logo]]s digitally in post-production, costing "tens of thousands of pounds". When such issues are brought up in advance of filming, production companies often resort to "greeking", the practice of simply covering logos with tape, but one of them driven by Latika is shown to have the logos on the car keys.

Similarly, in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), portions of the defunct [[Dixie Square Mall]] in [[Harvey, Illinois]], were reconstructed in façade and used as the scene of an indoor car chase. Signage belonging to mall tenants was replaced with that of other vendors; for instance, a [[Walgreens]] would become a [[Toys "R" Us]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070111193700/http://pawfilmworks.com/DSMHistory.html "Dixie Square Mall History"], pawflimworks.com (archived, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006) parodies [[NASCAR]], an advertising-heavy sport which controversially had long allowed [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] sponsorships. NASCAR's sponsors were replaced with [[fictional brand|fictional or parody brands]]; [[Dinoco]] Oil takes pride of place, followed by a string of invented automotive aftermarket products positioned as pharmacy or medical brands. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.|"Dale Earnhardt Inc."]] displaced "Junior #8"'s sponsor [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] to avoid advertising [[beer]] in a [[Pixar|Disney]] feature. NASCAR's former [[Winston Cup]] trophy became the [[Sprint Cup Series|Piston Cup]], removing a tobacco advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/04/entertainment/ca-cars4 |title=A grease geek will guide you: `Cars' decoded |last=Neil |first=Dan |date=June 4, 2006 |website=articles.latimes.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714073559/http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/04/entertainment/ca-cars4 |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-06-04/news/0606030282_1_racing-restrictor-cars |title=Cars' requires a crash course in racing |last=Neil |first=Dan |date=June 4, 2006 |website=articles.chicagotribune.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105181708/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-06-04/news/0606030282_1_racing-restrictor-cars |archive-date=November 5, 2014 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio vs visual===
Placements can be sound-only, visual-only or a combination of both. The Russian television show дом-2 (phonetically ''[[Dom-2]]'') (similar to ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'') often features participants stating something along the lines of, "Oh, did you check out the new product X by company Y yet?" after which the camera zooms in on the named product, explicitly combining an audio mention with a visual image. In ''[[The Real World/Road Rules Challenge]]'' participants often make a similar comment, usually pertaining to the mobile device and carrier for a text message.

===Advertiser-produced programming===
In 2010 [[Wal-Mart]] teamed with [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] to produce ''[[Secrets of the Mountain]]'' and ''[[The Jensen Project]]'', both [[family film|family-oriented]] films that display the characters using Wal-Mart and Procter &amp; Gamble- branded products. ''The Jensen Project'' also featured a preview of [[Kinect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peckham, Matt|date=July 14, 2010|title=Walmart Pushing Limited $199 Kinect Pre-Order Bundle|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/201049/walmart_pushing_limited_199_kinect_preorder_bundle.html?tk=hp_blg|publisher=''[[PC Magazine]]''|accessdate=September 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717022354/http://www.pcworld.com/article/201049/walmart_pushing_limited_199_kinect_preorder_bundle.html?tk=hp_blg|archive-date=July 17, 2010|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la times review"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Television Review: ''The Jensen Project''—Nothing Says Family Togetherness Like a Game of Predict the Cheesy Dialogue.

Advertiser Funded Programming is one of the ways the ''[[Battle of the Chefs: Harare]]'' managed to fund 2 Seasons (Season 2 &amp; 3) with funding from the leading supermarket in Zimbabwe TM Pick n Pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chronicle.co.zw/battle-of-the-chefs-is-back/ |title=Battle of the Chefs is back! |date=March 7, 2017 |website=chronicle.co.zw |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512121717/http://www.chronicle.co.zw/battle-of-the-chefs-is-back/ |archive-date=May 12, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self promotion===
[[20th Century Fox]] regularly uses their sister [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] and [[Sky News]] channels in their films by including them as a plot device when characters view news broadcasts. The channel is featured in a film depends on its setting. The character typically says that the audience is viewing Sky News. Examples include the 1996 films ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and [[Mission: Impossible (film)|''Mission: Impossible'']].

===Parodies===
The [[Pilot (30 Rock)|pilot episode]] of the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[30 Rock]]'' featured the [[General Electric]] (at the time an 80% owner of NBC) [[Trivection oven]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitchencontraptions.com/archives/007881.php Trivection Oven] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101041917/http://www.kitchencontraptions.com/archives/007881.php |date=November 1, 2006 }} on kitchencontraptions.com&lt;/ref&gt; but was said to be a joke by the show's creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah1969.shtml  |title=On ‘30 Rock,’ Tina Fey Draws From Her Past At ‘SNL’  |date=October 12, 2006 |website=accesshollywood.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213135247/http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah1969.shtml |archive-date=December 13, 2007 |access-date=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show later parodied placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/30rock-fey-mcdonalds-1002943.aspxl |title=30 Rock Boss Tina Fey Addresses a McFlurry of Criticism |last=Mitovitch |first=Matt |date=February 13, 2009 |website=tvguide.com |access-date=November 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616140328/http://www.tvguide.com/news/30rock-fey-mcdonalds-1002943.aspxl |archive-date=June 16, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1988 film ''[[Return of the Killer Tomatoes]]'' mocked the concept when at one point the film stops for lack of money. The character played by [[George Clooney]] suggests product placement as a way to continue. This was followed by several scenes with blatant product placement, including a [[Pepsi-Cola|Pepsi]] billboard installed in front of the villain's mansion.

The film ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', directed by [[David Fincher]], bit the hand that fed it by depicting acts of violence against most of the products that paid to be placed in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/30-things-we-learned-from-the-fight-club-commentary-81196ba0b04f/|title=30 Things We Learned from the ‘Fight Club’ Commentary|date=July 11, 2014|work=Film School Rejects|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710010433/https://filmschoolrejects.com/30-things-we-learned-from-the-fight-club-commentary-81196ba0b04f/|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the scene where the [[Apple Store (retail)|Apple Store]] is broken into, the scene where [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Edward Norton]] smash the headlights of a [[Volkswagen New Beetle|new Volkswagen Beetle]], and try to blow up a "popular coffee franchise", a thinly veiled dig at [[Starbucks]].

The film ''[[Superstar (1999 film)|Superstar]]'', starring [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Molly Shannon]], shows every resident in town driving [[Volkswagen New Beetle]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, possibly for comic effect. Similarly, the film ''[[Mr. Deeds]]'' shows [[Adam Sandler]]'s character purchasing a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] for every resident of his town.

''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' featured a scene where Wayne refuses to allow his show's sponsor to appear on the air. When told it is part of his contract, Wayne argues that the deal "didn't include selling out" while conspicuously drinking a can of [[Pepsi]], eating [[Doritos]], and displaying a [[Pizza Hut]] pizza. Garth then laments that "people only do things because they get paid" while his entire wardrobe consists of [[Reebok]] athletic wear. Finally, Wayne complains of a headache and Garth advises him to take [[Nuprin]] while cutting to a few seconds of a Nuprin TV ad.

''[[Kung Pow! Enter the Fist]]'' spoofed its product placements, highlighting the anachronistic inclusion of a [[Taco Bell]]. In a similar vein, in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back In Action]]'', the main characters stumble across a Wal-Mart while stranded in the middle of [[Death Valley]] and acquire supplies just for providing an endorsement. ''[[Kannagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens]]'' poked fun at its sponsor Sony by having one character give another a [[Blu-ray Disc]] with the tagline "It's a Sony", only for them to complain that they do not have a [[Blu-ray]] player, to which the character responds with a version in [[Betamax]].

===Faux placements===
{{further|Fictional brands}}

''[[X-Files]]'' (1993–2002) (as well as many other films and television productions) featured the fictional [[Morley (cigarette)|Morley]] brand of cigarettes, the choice of the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.metv.com/stories/the-fascinating-history-of-morley-cigarettes-the-favorite-fake-brand-of-hollywood |title=The fascinating history of Morley Cigarettes, the favorite fake brand of Hollywood |last=MeTV Staff |date=July 28, 2016 |website=metv.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827210015/https://www.metv.com/stories/the-fascinating-history-of-morley-cigarettes-the-favorite-fake-brand-of-hollywood |archive-date=August 27, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company producing Morleys was also involved in a cover-up conspiracy, ''Brand X''.

''[[Ghostbusters]]'' had a faux product in the climax of the film when the team faces the [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]]. Previously in the film, Stay-Puft brand marshmallows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.eater.com/2010/8/27/6721355/stay-puft-marshmallows-from-ghostbusters-made-real-19-99 |title=Stay Puft Marshmallows from Ghostbusters Made Real, $19.99 |last=Forbes |first=Paula |date=August 27, 2010 |website=eater.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825123703/http://www.eater.com/2010/8/27/6721355/stay-puft-marshmallows-from-ghostbusters-made-real-19-99 |archive-date=August 25, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; are shown in Dana's apartment and a Stay-Puft billboard is visible (via a [[matte painting]]) when the Ghostbusters' storage grid is deactivated and the imprisoned ghosts are released. Similar in form, [[Mel Brooks]] used the same device in the comedy spoof ''[[Spaceballs]]'', which parodied ''[[Star Wars]]'': in one scene, he opened up a can of Perri-Air canned air, a play on the name Perrier, the brand of fresh spring water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/selling-bottled-lake-louise-air-started-as-a-joke-but-theres-actually-a-lot-of-demand |title=We talked to the Albertans selling bottled air to China — and despite all indications to the contrary, it's not a hoax |last=Hopper |first=Tristan |date=December 16, 2015 |website=nationalpost.com |access-date=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Truman Show]]'' utilized faux placements to advance the narrative of the reality television set. The protagonist's wife places products in front of hidden cameras, even naming them in dialogue with her husband. This increases Truman's suspicions as he comes to realise his surroundings are intentionally fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.smstudy.com/article/the-truman-show-a-reflection-on-product-placement |title=The Truman Show: A Reflection on Product Placement |date=January 7, 2016 |website=smstudy.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714015358/https://smstudy.com/article/the-truman-show-a-reflection-on-product-placement |archive-date=July 14, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some filmmakers created fictional products that appear in multiple movies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Examples include [[Kevin Smith]] (Nails Cigarettes, [[Mooby the Golden Calf|Mooby Corporation]], Chewlees Gum, Discreeto Burritos) and [[Quentin Tarantino]] (Red Apple Cigarettes, Jack Rabbit Slim's Restaurants, [[Big Kahuna Burger]]).  This went even further with the fictional brand [[Binford Tools]] which appeared in TV shows [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Home Improvement'']] and [[Last Man Standing (U.S. TV series)|''Last Man Standing'']] and in the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' movie franchise, all starring [[Tim Allen]].

This practice is also fairly common in certain [[comics]], such as [[Svetlana Chmakova]]'s ''[[Dramacon]]'', which makes several product-placement-esque usages of "Pawky", (a modification of the name of the Japanese snack "[[Pocky]]", popular among [[anime]] and [[manga]] fans) or [[Naoko Takeuchi]]'s ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', which includes numerous references to the series ''[[Codename: Sailor V]]'', from which ''Sailor Moon'' was spun off.

This practice is also common in certain "reality-based" video games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], which feature fictitious stores such as Ammu-Nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://guides.gamepressure.com/gtav/guide.asp?ID=21701 |title=Grand Theft Auto V Game Guide |website=guides.gamepressure.com |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709021239/http://guides.gamepressure.com/gtav/guide.asp?ID=21701 |archive-date=July 9, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinyl Countdown, Gash (spoofing [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]]) Zip, Pizza Boy, etc.

===Reverse placement===
So-called "reverse product placement"  creates real products to match those seen in a fictional setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morexpertise.com/download.php?id=148 |title=Management Online Review |publisher=Morexpertise.com |date=2008-09-30 |accessdate=2012-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425112024/http://www.morexpertise.com/download.php?id=148 |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2007, [[7-Eleven]] rebranded 11 of its American stores and one Canadian store as "[[Kwik-E-Mart]]s", selling versions of products seen in episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', such as Buzz Cola and Krusty-O's cereal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070710165352/http://www.7-eleven.com/kem.asp "Locate A Kwik-E-Mart Near You"], 7-eleven.com (archived, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, [[Acme Communications]] was created as a chain of real television stations; the firm is named for the fictional [[Acme Corporation]] of [[Warner Brothers]] fame. ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971) led to a real [[The Willy Wonka Candy Company|Willy Wonka candy company]], established soon after the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2011/1129/Dunder-Mifflin-Office-paper-now-real.-Can-it-top-these-fiction-to-fact-products/Willy-Wonka-Candy-Company-Willy-Wonka-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-1971 |title=top these fiction-to-fact products? |last=Velasco |first=Schuyler |date=November 29, 2011 |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102232013/http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2011/1129/Dunder-Mifflin-Office-paper-now-real.-Can-it-top-these-fiction-to-fact-products/Willy-Wonka-Candy-Company-Willy-Wonka-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-1971 |archive-date=January 2, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, [[Crazy Eddie]] was created as a fictional car dealer in the film ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/09/business/media/09adcol.html |title=Fake Products and the Movies That Loved Them |last=Elliot |first=Stewart |date=January 9, 2006 |website=nytimes.com |access-date=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That name, bestowed in 1971 upon a real-life electronics chain in [[New York City]], appeared in 1984 in an ad in ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]''. Crazy Eddie's memorable ads are parodied in ''[[Howard the Duck]]'', featuring a duck version of the famous pitchman, and [[UHF (film)|''UHF'']], as "Crazy Ernie", a used car salesman, threatens to club a baby seal if nobody comes in to buy a car.

While radio and television stations are regulated by national governments, producers of printed or recorded works are not, leading marketers to attempt to get products mentioned in lyrics of popular songs.

An Alcohol Beverages Advertising Code (ABAC) exists in Australia to handle complaints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the ABAC Scheme|publisher=The ABAC Scheme Ltd.|url=http://www.abac.org.au/about/|access-date=August 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911112451/http://www.abac.org.au/about|archive-date=September 11, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a placement of [[Midori (liqueur)|Midori]] [[liqueur]] in [[Cobra Starship]]'s "[[You Make Me Feel...]]" was judged not to be alcohol advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Midori Product Placement - Alcohol Advertising Review Board|publisher=McCusker Centre for Action on Alcohol and Youth, [[Curtin University]], [[Perth]], [[Australia]]|url=http://www.alcoholadreview.com.au/key-concerns/alcohol-advertising-ten-shockers/midori-product-placement/|access-date=August 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819034047/http://www.alcoholadreview.com.au/key-concerns/alcohol-advertising-ten-shockers/midori-product-placement/|archive-date=August 19, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
[[South Africa]]n football comic book ''[[Supa Strikas]]'' accepts product placement to allow for the comic's free distribution. Product placement occurs throughout the publication; on players' shirts, billboards and signage, and through the branding of locations or scenarios. ''Supa Strikas'' receives the majority of its support from [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], via its [[Caltex]] and [[Texaco]] brands.

In markets where Chevron lacks a presence, other brands step in, e.g., including [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] in [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]]. Other brands include their logos included as both billboard and background advertising, and through the branding of locations and scenarios. These companies include [[Metropolitan Life]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Spur Steak Ranches]] and the [[South African National Roads Agency]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Komik Melangkau Sempadan|publisher=''[[Kosmo!]]''|date=December 9, 2008|url=http://www.kosmo.com.my/kosmo/content.asp?y=2008&amp;dt=1209&amp;pub=Kosmo&amp;sec=Rencana_Utama&amp;pg=ru_01.htm|accessdate=December 9, 2008|language=Malay|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209232317/http://www.kosmo.com.my/kosmo/content.asp?y=2008&amp;dt=1209&amp;pub=Kosmo&amp;sec=Rencana_Utama&amp;pg=ru_01.htm|archive-date=December 9, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other titles adopted the same system, including cricket comic ''Supa Tigers'' and ''Strike Zone''.

==Sports==
Product placement has long been prevalent in sports at all levels.

===NFL===
While now-defunct [[NFL Europe]] allowed liberal use of team uniforms by sponsors, the main [[National Football League]] (NFL) does not. For instance, the league prohibits logos of sponsors painted onto the fields, although [[Gillette Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], has their stadium's logomark painted onto the [[FieldTurf]] field. In 2008, the league allowed sponsors on the practice jerseys of the uniforms, but not game uniforms.

In 1991, the league allowed uniform suppliers to display their logos on their NFL-related products. Since 2012, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] has been the league's official uniform supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/nfl-nike-uniform-deal |title=US sportswear giant will remain exclusive uniform provider for league’s 32 teams. |last=Carp |first=Sam |date=March 28, 2018 |website=sportspromedia.com |access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, two of the league's flagship teams—the [[Green Bay Packers]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]—adopted their identity from corporate sponsors. The Packers adopted the name "Packers" because they were sponsored by the [[Indian Packing Company]]. They later had "ACME PACKERS" written on their uniforms in the early 1920s after the Acme Packing Company bought Indian Packing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.packers.com/news/the-acme-packers-were-short-lived-18677091 |title=The Acme Packers were short-lived |last=Christl |first=Cliff |date=March 23, 2017 |website=packers.com |access-date=November 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801221116/https://www.packers.com/news/the-acme-packers-were-short-lived-18677091 |archive-date=August 1, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steelers adopted their current logo in 1962 as a product-placement deal with the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]], which owned the rights to the [[Steelmark]] logo. The Steelers later were allowed to add "-ers" to the Steelmark logo the following year so that they could own a [[trademark]] on the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.steel.org/about-aisi/history/history-of-the-steelmark |title=History of the Steelmark |website=steel.org |access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Steelers' [[J.P. Rooneys|pre-NFL predecessors]] also regularly sold naming rights to companies in the Pittsburgh area.)

The league has placed itself. NFL Japan was a sponsor of the football-themed [[anime]] series ''[[Eyeshield 21]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070618006518/en/Japans-Top-Anime-Series-Eyeshield-21-Brings |title=Japan's Top Anime Series Eyeshield 21 Brings a New Concept, Sports Anime, to the Forefront of the Cartoon World with Its Global Debut on Toonami Jetstream |last=Moss |first=Geoff |date=June 18, 2007 |access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NASCAR===
In automobile racing, the concept of the [[factory-backed]] contestant, who is provided with vehicles and technical support in return for the car's manufacturer obtaining visibility for its products in competition, dates in [[NASCAR]] to the 1950s and [[Marshall Teague (racing driver)|Marshall Teague]]'s factory-backed [[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]]. "Win on Sunday, sell on Monday" was once a common [[adage]] among automakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivingtoday.com/greatest_cars/hudson_hornet/|title=The Greatest Cars: Hudson Hornet|first=Jack|last=Nerad|publisher=Driving Today|access-date=August 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522184202/http://www.drivingtoday.com/greatest_cars/hudson_hornet/|archive-date=May 22, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable placements==
[[Car|Automobiles]], [[Clothing|apparel]], [[Drink|beverages]], [[home appliance|home goods]], [[furniture]], consumer [[electronics]], [[computer]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[financial institution]]s, [[travel]], [[airline]]s and [[website]]s are just a few of the product categories.

[[Fedex]] provided vehicles, access, and logistical support for the making of ''[[Cast Away]]''. The movie depicted real Fedex locations, and the company's CEO appeared in one scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB976490076669428270 |title=FedEx Has a Star Turn In New Film 'Cast Away' |last=Lippman |first=John |date=December 11, 2000 |website=wsj.com |access-date=November 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204025419/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB976490076669428270 |archive-date=February 4, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automobiles===
The most common [[product (business)|products]] to be promoted in this way are automobiles. Frequently, all the important vehicles in a film or television series are supplied by one manufacturer.

Luxury vehicles like [[Aston Martin]], [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[Audi]], [[BMW]] utilize brand integration in films like ''[[Iron Man 3]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Stark Contrast: Iron Man 3's Audi Deal Complicates Product Placement|url = http://brandchannel.com/2013/03/12/stark-contrast-iron-man-3s-audi-deal-complicates-product-placement/|website = brandchannel:|accessdate = September 29, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150930182718/http://brandchannel.com/2013/03/12/stark-contrast-iron-man-3s-audi-deal-complicates-product-placement/|archive-date = September 30, 2015|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectre (2015 film)|''Spectre'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = He Drives Fast, but Can James Bond Sell a Car?|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-12-29/he-drives-fast-but-can-james-bond-sell-a-car|website = BloombergView|accessdate = September 29, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151001195428/http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-12-29/he-drives-fast-but-can-james-bond-sell-a-car|archive-date = October 1, 2015|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Jurassic World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Mercedes-Benz vehicles to be featured in 'Jurassic World'|url = http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/mercedes-benz-vehicles-debut-new-jurassic-world-movie|accessdate = September 29, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151001070250/http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/mercedes-benz-vehicles-debut-new-jurassic-world-movie|archive-date = October 1, 2015|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation|''Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = BMW's 'Mission: Impossible' Marketing: Plenty of Racing, No Logo Close-Ups|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bmws-mission-impossible-marketing-plenty-812436|website = The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate = September 29, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003064024/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bmws-mission-impossible-marketing-plenty-812436|archive-date = October 3, 2015|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006) portrays a mix of real and fictional vehicles as characters. None are directly paid product placements, but many are [[factory-backed]] by manufacturers who provided technical assistance and vehicles during production.&lt;ref name="christophorus"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesandservices/christophorusmagazine/archive/archive2006/august-september/|title=Goodbye, Mustang Sally – Hello, Sally Carrera!|magazine=Christophorus Magazine|publisher=[[Porsche AG]]|author1=Larry Edsall|author2=Valerie Höhne|date=August 2006|pages=72–78|access-date=July 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908000524/http://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesandservices/christophorusmagazine/archive/archive2006/august-september/|archive-date=September 8, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lexus LC 500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lexus.com/models/LC|title=2018 Lexus LC - Luxury Coupe|website=Lexus USA|accessdate=April 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423170044/https://www.lexus.com/models/LC|archive-date=April 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was featured in the 2018 film ''[[Black Panther (film)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/20/17261614/black-panther-box-office-records-gross-iron-man-thor-captain-america-avengers|title=Black Panther just keeps smashing box office records|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423101923/https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/20/17261614/black-panther-box-office-records-gross-iron-man-thor-captain-america-avengers|archive-date=April 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Audi R8]]&lt;ref name=motorl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/features/144549/best-worst-car-product-placement/2910125/|title=The Best And Worst Car Product Placements In TV And Movies|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423101946/https://www.motor1.com/features/144549/best-worst-car-product-placement/2910125/|archive-date=April 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was featured in the [[Iron Man]] film series, while the Acura NSX Roadster &lt;ref name=motorl/&gt; was featured in [[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]].

===Consumer electronics and computers===
[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s products frequently appear in films, music videos and on television. Apple has stated that they do not pay for this, but declined to discuss how its products are placed; some Apple placements may have stemmed from the brand's position as a [[status symbol]] rather than actual paid promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401670.html?noredirect=on |title=Apple Gets a Big Slice Of Product-Placement Pie |last=Goo |first=Sara Kehaulani |date=April 15, 2006 |website=washingtonpost.com |access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Pixar]] films have often featured references to Apple products, although these are an homage to the involvement of its founder, [[Steve Jobs]], as an early investor in the studio.&lt;ref name="tnw-applepixar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scare Different and Mac iCar: Two Apple references in Pixar flicks you may have missed|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/03/26/scare-different-and-mac-icar-two-apple-references-in-pixar-flicks-you-may-have-missed/#gref|website=The Next Web|accessdate=May 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701143109/http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/03/26/scare-different-and-mac-icar-two-apple-references-in-pixar-flicks-you-may-have-missed/#gref|archive-date=July 1, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 ''[[Modern Family]]'' episode "[[Game Changer (Modern Family)|Game Changer]]" prominently featured the [[iPad]] and aired prior to its launch, while the 2015 episode "[[Connection Lost]]" is presented entirely from the perspective of a character's [[Macbook Pro]] laptop, with all interactions between characters being conducted via [[FaceTime]] and [[iMessage]]. Show creator [[Steven Levitan]] said the show had an ongoing relationship with Apple, but did not elaborate further.

In video games, the most common placements are for processors or graphics cards. For example, in EA's ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'', ads for [[Intel Core 2]] processors appear on map billboards. EA's ''[[The Sims]]'' contains in-game advertising for [[Intel]] and for [[McDonald's]]. [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s ''[[Perfect Dark Zero]]'' features many ads for [[Samsung]] in their menus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uisk.jinonice.cuni.cz/sisler/publications/games_politics.htm Videogames and Politics], Šisler, Vít.

In the [[Arrow (TV series)|TV adaptation]] of [[DC Comics|DC]]'s [[Green Arrow]], several characters noticeably use devices with [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10|10]].

===Food and beverage===
The use of [[Reese's Pieces]] as a prominent plot element in the film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' was the result of a sponsorship deal; it was originally intended for the titular character's favorite food to be [[M&amp;Ms]] candies, but [[Mars, Incorporated]] turned down an offer, believing the film's alien would scare children. [[The Hershey Company]] took the sponsorship instead, which included the rights for the company to cross-promote Reese's Pieces with the film. The deal was considered a major coup for the company; sales of Reese's Pieces tripled, and some retailers had trouble meeting demand for the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/et-gadgets-and-gear/|title=The Gear That Made E.T. the Pinnacle of Product Placement|work=Wired|access-date=December 11, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211105236/https://www.wired.com/2015/03/et-gadgets-and-gear/|archive-date=December 11, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a few years after the film's release, Reese's ran commercials featuring a purple-skinned alien (who looked nothing like E.T.) that came down to Earth and bonded with Earth children by offering them Reese's Pieces.

Alongside criticism for trying to ride off the popularity of ''E.T.'', the film ''[[Mac and Me]]'' was widely criticised for containing numerous placements for Coca-Cola soft drinks and the fast food chain McDonald's; both brands are integral to the film's plot, while McDonald's mascot [[Ronald McDonald]] makes an appearance during a dance scene set at a McDonald's, and is credited as appearing in the film "as himself". Critics also noted that the name of the alien creature featured in the film, "Mac", could also be interpreted as a reference to the chain's notable burger, the [[Big Mac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/ronald-mcdonald-approved-case-file-151-mac-and-me-1798218494|title=Ronald McDonald Approved Case File #151: Mac And Me|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|work=The A.V.

Louis denied that the film was funded by McDonald's; he had previously worked on campaigns for the company and wanted to make a film that would help benefit the [[Ronald McDonald House Charities]], and had to pursue rights to portray the McDonald's brand in the film (noting that he was "still the only person in the universe that ever had the exclusive motion picture rights to the McDonald's trademark, their actors, their characters, and the whole company"), but did receive funding from one of the chain's major suppliers, [[Golden State Foods]]. He also justified the extended dance scene, as trips to McDonald's were often seen as a "treat" for children of the era, and explained that "Mac" was meant to be an acronym for "Mysterious Alien Creature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/mcdonalds-mac-and-me-paul-rudd-movie-et-spinoff|title=How McDonald's Insane 'E.T.'

[[Sylvester Stallone]]'s ''Rocky'' films featured heavy product placement. The most obvious example appeared in ''[[Rocky III]]'': when Rocky spends time with his young son, he asks him what he wants for breakfast. The boy responds, "[[Wheaties]]!" and, at Rocky's prompting, adds that it's "the breakfast of champions!"

===Tobacco===
Tobacco companies have made direct payment to stars for using their [[cigarette]]s in films. Sylvester Stallone received US$500,000 to use [[Brown and Williamson]] tobacco products in five feature films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/tmq36b00U.S. Exhibit 21,044] Legacy Tobacco Documents Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/hlm56b00 Re: agreements between Stallone and Associated Film Promotions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614120311/http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/hlm56b00 |date=June 14, 2011 }} Legacy Tobacco Documents Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/about/about_collections.jsp#ucbw|title=Master Settlement Agreement Collections|publisher=|access-date=May 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622090229/http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/about/about_collections.jsp#ucbw|archive-date=June 22, 2010|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bergman|first1=Carol|title=Tobacco's Cloudy Image on The Silver Screen|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1989/0728/ebond.html|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor.|accessdate=13 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413155826/http://www.csmonitor.com/1989/0728/ebond.html|archive-date=April 13, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; accusing the industry of deliberately using product placement as an advertising strategy, the [[Tobacco Institute]] claimed that product placement is driven by filmmakers to "achieve desired artistic effects but also to offset production costs". It also claimed "the 1970 federal ban on cigarette advertising on television and radio does not prohibit payments to filmmakers for the use of cigarettes in a film." The rebuttal concludes with the sentiment that smoking in film provides a certain "aesthetic" which is legitimate and at the filmmaker's discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Curtis Sitome|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/yvo72f00/pdf|publisher=University of California|accessdate=June 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616043635/http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/yvo72f00/pdf|archive-date=June 16, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airlines===
Many airlines have advertised prominently in film, in some cases to promote a new flight route or just to increase public awareness of the  company. [[Pan American World Airways]] advertised in many films, including some [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] ones. [[American Airlines]] was advertised in ''[[Home Alone]]'' and ''[[Home Alone 2]]'', and a model of a [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Atlantic]] [[Boeing 747]] was shown in ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. Mike Myers' later film, ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', featured a major promotion with Virgin, including repainting some of Virgin's fleet to read "Virgin Shaglantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://adage.com/article/news/virgin-brings-aboard-austin-powers-tie/31416/ |title=Virgin brings aboard 'Austin Powers' tie-in |last=Goetzl |first=David |date=May 10, 1999 |website=adage.com |access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Airlines]] was mentioned in the title of the movie ''[[United 93]]''; this movie, however, was based on [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks|a real life event]].

[[American Airlines]] and Hilton Hotels were featured in the film ''[[Up in the Air (2009 film)|Up in the Air]]''. [[George Clooney]], an avid flyer is constantly seen in the airport because of his career. This film was a huge endorsement for American Airlines, yet no payment was exchanged between the filmmaker and the airline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://adage.com/article/madisonvine-case-study/american-airlines-a-free-ride-air/141059/ |title=How American Airlines Got a Free Ride in 'Up in the Air' |last=Hampp |first=Andrew |date=December 14, 2009 |website=adage.com |access-date=November 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607120448/http://adage.com/article/madisonvine-case-study/american-airlines-a-free-ride-air/141059/ |archive-date=June 7, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In 2001, British author [[Fay Weldon]] published ''[[The Bulgari Connection]]'', a novel commissioned by Italian jewellery company [[Bulgari]]. According to ''[[The Independent]]'', this was the first instance of a literary product-placement deal between an established writer of fiction and a commercial partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Usborne|first1=David|title=Strange tale of the author, a jeweller and some novel product|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/strange-tale-of-the-author-a-jeweller-and-some-novel-product-placement-9270505.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=September 4, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111045710/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/strange-tale-of-the-author-a-jeweller-and-some-novel-product-placement-9270505.html|archivedate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal considerations==

===United States===
Much of U.S. [[broadcast law]] pertaining to on-air product promotion dates to the [[payola]] scandals of 1950s broadcast radio. An investigation launched in November 1959 into allegations that some radio disc jockeys had accepted [[bribe]]s in return for radio airplay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/243496/payola_scandal_again_rocking_roiling_radio_fcc_scrutiny_recalls_59/index.html |title=Payola Scandal Again Rocking, Roiling Radio: FCC Scrutiny Recalls '59 Charges |date=September 19, 2005 |website=redorbit.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917095931/http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/243496/payola_scandal_again_rocking_roiling_radio_fcc_scrutiny_recalls_59/index.html |archive-date=September 17, 2011 |dead-url=yes |access-date=November 7, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ended with a US$2,500 fine for disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] (of [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] and [[WINS (AM)|WINS]]) for violating [[commercial bribery]] laws. On September 13, 1960, the U.S. government banned payola in broadcasting. Under {{UnitedStatesCode|47|317}} "All matter broadcast by any radio station for which money, service, or other valuable consideration is directly or indirectly paid, or promised to or charged or accepted by, the station so broadcasting, from any person, shall, at the time the same is so broadcast, be announced as paid for or furnished, as the case may be, by such person..." with similar and related provisions reflected in [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations as {{CodeFedReg|47|73|1212}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/73-1212-sponsorship-identification-retention-19852479|title=CFR TITLE 47 PART 73.1212 - Sponsorship identification|work=vLex|access-date=March 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304203009/http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/73-1212-sponsorship-identification-retention-19852479|archive-date=March 4, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These provisions have governed subsequent payola investigations, including a 2005 investigation into [[Sony BMG]] and other major record companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/smash-hits/Content?oid=1195395 |title=Smash hits  Will the latest payola scandal shake up the radio and music industries? |last=Morgan |first=Fiona |date=August 10, 2005 |website=indyweek.com |access-date=November 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019234039/https://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/smash-hits/Content?oid=1195395 |archive-date=October 19, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, a broadcaster claimed to have complied by placing an acknowledgement in an inconspicuous place, such as embedded within the credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/24/AR2005052401294.html |title=FCC Panelist Wants Probe Of Product 'Payola' |last=Kurtz |first=Howard |date=May 25, 2005 |website=washingtonpost.com |access-date=November 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430134822/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/24/AR2005052401294.html |archive-date=April 30, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] commissioner Jonathan Adelstein stated "if broadcasters and [[cable TV]] companies insist on further commercializing new and other shows alike, that is their business. But if they do so without disclosing it to the viewing public, that is payola, and that is the FCC's business."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices/6321149-1.html FCC’s Adelstein: Probe ‘Payola’], Ted Hearn, Multichannel News, May 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:PP - Product Placement UK logo.svg|thumb|120px|The 'PP' icon, introduced by [[Ofcom]] to identify programs on television which contain product placement.]]

In the [[United Kingdom]], placement by commercial broadcasters was forbidden prior to 2011. On February 28, 2011, telecommunications regulator [[Ofcom]] legalised placements in certain types of programming. A placement must be "editorially justified" and not place "undue prominence" on the product. Product placements are not allowed for products that cannot legally be advertised on television, including alcohol, baby milk, gambling products, medication or [[junk food]]. Placements are not allowed during children's, news, public affairs and religious programs. Additionally, broadcasters must disclose placements on-air by displaying a "PP" icon on-screen during the program for at least three seconds at the beginning, after every commercial break, and at the end. The first legal product placement on British television came during an episode of ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'', for a [[Nestlé]]-produced [[coffee maker]]. As with all other advertising, the [[BBC]] is barred from using placements on its publicly funded services.&lt;ref name=guardian-ppofcom&gt;{{cite web|title=Ofcom confirms product placement on UK TV|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/20/ofcom-product-placement-uk-tv|work=The Guardian|accessdate=August 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195419/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/20/ofcom-product-placement-uk-tv|archive-date=September 10, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-productplacement&gt;{{cite news|title=Product placement ban on British TV lifted|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12593061|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 25, 2013|date=February 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520030133/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12593061|archive-date=May 20, 2011|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extreme examples==
''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' offers placements for [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], [[Ovaltine]], Audi, FedEx, [[Dos Equis]] and [[JVC]] among others, all of them introduced within the film's first ten minutes.

The 2006 comedy film ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]'' parodied the large amount of sponsorship in NASCAR. For example, Ricky Bobby thanks baby [[Jesus]] for certain products during the dinner blessings, due to contractual obligations. In one race, he drives his car with a giant [[Fig Newtons]] sticker on his windshield, which obscures his vision. A scene where Ricky's and Jean Girard's cars go flipping for an excessively long time is interrupted by an [[Applebee's]] commercial (referencing [[NASCAR on NBC|NBC]]'s use of commercial breaks during its own coverage).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/talladega.html ''Themoviespoiler.com''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428182603/http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/talladega.html |date=April 28, 2007 }} Plot, product placements.

''[[Josie and the Pussycats (movie)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' contains placements in most of the shots. This appears to be done ironically, as the plot of the film revolves around [[subliminal message]]s in advertising. The film's general message can also be construed as an anti-consumerist one. The film neither sought nor received compensation for the placements.

The 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', in a scene where young James Kirk drives and crashes a [[Chevrolet Corvette]], he operates a [[Nokia]] touch-screen smartphone. Before running the car off the cliff while being chased by a hovering motorcycle cop, the distinct [[Nokia tune|Nokia trademark ring tone]] can be heard. The Finnish phone maker offered ''Star Trek'' apps for its phones. The use of contemporary products was ridiculed, as the scene is set in the year 2255.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.productplacement.biz/200905123080/News/Movies/nokia-product-placement-in-star-trek.html |title=Volkswagen Recruits Top Comedic Talent for 'Inside the VW Academy' Series of Digital Only Webisodes |publisher=Product Placement News |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103062224/http://www.productplacement.biz/200905123080/News/Movies/nokia-product-placement-in-star-trek.html |archive-date=January 3, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Filipino film ''[[My Little Bossings]]'' attracted criticism for its extensive use of product placement. Reviewers panned the film for being "one long commercial", where advertisements for brands endorsed by the characters' actors are frequently interspersed into the film.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2014/01/19/1280634/vic-sotto-im-open-all-criticism|title=Vic Sotto: ‘I’m open to all criticism’|last=Smith|first=Chuck|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|accessdate=July 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019233155/http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2014/01/19/1280634/vic-sotto-im-open-all-criticism|archive-date=October 19, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franco"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/41801/blogger-lourd-de-veyra-posts-message-for-vic-sotto-puwede-namang-magpatawa-pa-rin-habang-nagtataas-n|title=Blogger Lourd de Veyra posts message for Vic Sotto: "Puwede namang magpatawa pa rin habang nagtataas ng antas ng kalidad ng paggawa ng pelikula."|last=Franco|first=Bernie|work=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]|language=[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]|accessdate=July 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019233737/http://www.pep.ph/news/41801/blogger-lourd-de-veyra-posts-message-for-vic-sotto-puwede-namang-magpatawa-pa-rin-habang-nagtataas-n|archive-date=October 19, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zig Marasigan of ''Rappler'' described the film's use of product endorsements as "some of the most distasteful examples of local product placement while no effort is made to weave them into the narrative."&lt;ref name="rappler"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/46989-mmff-my-little-bossings-review-marasigan|title='My Little Bossings': The horrible business of show business|last=Marasigan|first=Zig|date=January 1, 2014|work=[[Rappler]]|accessdate=January 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104041712/http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/46989-mmff-my-little-bossings-review-marasigan|archive-date=January 4, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein to early radio and television programs, sponsored programs in the Philippines are not uncommon, where children's programs like ''[[Tropang Potchi]]'' and ''[[Jollitown]]'' were produced on behalf of companies, prominently featuring products and related properties in the shows in question.

==Viewer response==
In April 2009, fans of the television series ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' responded to a placement by [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurants with a [[grassroots]] effort to save the show from cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=York | first=Emily Bryson | title=Subway Caught Up in Fan Effort to Save NBC Series 'Chuck' | url=http://adage.com/madisonandvine/article?article_id=136301 | date=April 27, 2009 | work=[[Advertising Age]] | accessdate=2009-04-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502194513/http://adage.com/madisonandvine/article?article_id=136301 | archive-date=May 2, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement gained support from cast and crew, with series star [[Zachary Levi]] leading hundreds of fans to a Subway restaurant in [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="cnn-2009apr30"&gt;{{Cite news | last=France | first=Lisa Respers | title='Save Chuck' Latest in Campaigns To Rescue Favorite Shows | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/30/save.chuck.show/ | date=April 30, 2009 | work=[[CNN]] | accessdate=April 30, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505135955/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/30/save.chuck.show/ | archive-date=May 5, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Placement continues to grow, despite consumer groups such as [[Commercial Alert]] that object to the practise as "an affront to basic honesty". The group requested disclosure of all product-placement arrangements and notification before and during embedded advertisements. It justifies this to allow parents to protect easily influenced children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commercialalert.org/issues/culture/product-placement |title=Product Placement |publisher=Commercial Alert |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809004115/http://www.commercialalert.org/issues/culture/product-placement |archive-date=August 9, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Writers Guild of America]], a trade union representing authors of television scripts, objected that its members were forced to produce disguised ad copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117932866.html |title=Scribes chase blurb bonanza Product placement perturbs WGA |last=McNary |first=Dave |date=November 13, 2005 |website=vvariety.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304121245/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117932866.html?categoryid=18&amp;cs=1 |archive-date=March 4, 2009 |access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that product placement may inherently affect the creativity and originality of movies as film producers may re-write scripts in order to incorporate products.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Hollywood Meets Madison Avenue: The Commercialization of US Films.|last = Wakso|first = Janet|date = 1993|journal = Media, Culture &amp; Society|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most typically, product placement and merchandise are most successful amongst specific genres of movies which may eventually limit the diversity of films.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Research==

===Effectiveness===
As with most marketing tactics, product placement leads to explicit as well as implicit advertising effects. Explicit effects can be observed directly and are usually visible by higher recall scores.&lt;ref name="Herrmann et al. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrmann|first1=Jean-Lux|last2=Walliser|first2=Björn|last3=Kacha|first3=Mathieu|title=Consumer Consideration of Sponsor Brands They Do Not Remember: Taking a Wider Look at the Memorisation Effects of Sponsorship|journal=International Journal of Advertising|date=2011|volume=30|issue=2|pages=259–281|doi=10.2501/IJA-30-2-259-281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthes et al. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthes|first1=Jörg|last2=Schemer|first2=Christian|last3=Wirth|first3=Werner|title=More than Meets the Eye: Investigating the Hidden Impact of Brand Placements in Television Magazines|journal=International Journal of Advertising|date=2007|volume=26|issue=4|pages=477–503}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are highly connected to the [[conscious]] mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Peter|title=Psychology|date=199|publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Company|isbn=978-1572599437|page=682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit effects can be observed by a change in behavior – like a higher purchase intention.&lt;ref name="Herrmann et al. 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Johnson und Lehmann 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Michael D.|last2=Lehmann|first2=Donald R.|title=Consumer Experience and Consideration Sets For Brands and Product Categories|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|date=1997|volume=24|pages=295–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro et al. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Stewart|last2=MacInnis|first2=Deborah J.|last3=Heckler|first3=Susan E.|title=The Effects of Incidental Ad Exposure on the Formation of Consideration Sets|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=94–104|doi=10.1086/209496}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are fully based on the [[subconscious]] mind.&lt;ref name="Herrmann et al. 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coates et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coates|first1=Sarah L.|last2=Butler|first2=Laurie T.|last3=Berry|first3=Dianne C.|title=Implicit Memory: A Prime Example for Brand Consideration and Choice|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|date=2004|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1195–1211|doi=10.1002/acp.1044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit effects are more relevant for purchase decisions and therefore more valuable than explicit reactions.&lt;ref name="Herrmann et al. 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coates et al. 2004" /&gt;

====Recall====
Recall describes whether people can name a product after seeing it within the content. Research showed that there is a significant relationship between product placement and recall.&lt;ref name="Bressoud 374"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bressoud|first=Etienne|author2=Lehu, Jean-Marc |author3=Russell, Cristel Antonia |title=The Product Well Placed: The Relative Impact of Placement and Audience Characteristics on Placement Recall|journal=Journal of Advertising Research|volume=50|issue=4|page=374|doi=10.2501/S0021849910091622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Delattre and Colovic 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delattre|first=Eric|author2=Colovic, Ana |title=Memory and perception of brand mentions and placement of brands in songs|journal=International Journal of Advertising|date=2009|volume=28|issue=5|page=0|doi=10.2501/S0265048709200916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 373"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Rick T.|author2=Till, Brian D. |title=Product placements in movies and on Broadway: a field study|journal=International Journal of Advertising|volume=30|issue=3|page=373|doi=10.2501/IJA-30-3-373-398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoo 439–446"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoo|first=Seung-Chul|author2=Peña, Jorge|title=Do Violent Video Games Impair The Effectiveness of In-Game Advertisements?

====Attitude====
Product placement also leads to changes in attitude towards the product or brand.&lt;ref name="Cowley and Barron 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cowley|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Barron|first2=Chris|title=When Product Placement Goes Wrong: The Effects of Program Liking and Placement Prominence|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=2008|volume=37|issue=1|pages=89–98|doi=10.2753/joa0091-3367370107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janiszewski and Meyvis 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janiszewski|first1=Chris|last2=Meyvis|first2=Tom|title=Effects of Brand Logo Complexity, Repetition, and Spacing on Processing Fluency and Judgment|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=2001|volume=28|issue=1|pages=18–32|doi=10.1086/321945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishnan|first1=H.

A lot of research has shown a higher purchase intention as a result of product placement.&lt;ref name="Auty 697–713"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auty|first=Susan|author2=Lewis, Charlie |title=Exploring children's choice: The reminder effect of product placement|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=2004|volume=21|issue=9|pages=697–713|doi=10.1002/mar.20025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Law and Braun 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Sharmistha|author2=Braun, Kathryn A. |title=I'll have what she's having: Gauging the impact of product placements on viewers|date=2000|journal=Psychology and Marketing|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1059–1075|doi=10.1002/1520-6793(200012)17:12&lt;1059::AID-MAR3&gt;3.0.CO;2-V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallinckrodt and Mizerski 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mallinckrodt|first1=Victoria|last2=Mizerski|first2=Dick|title=The Effects of Playing an Advergame on Young Children's Perceptions, Preferences, and Requests|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=2007|volume=36|issue=2|pages=87–100|doi=10.2753/joa0091-3367360206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morton and Friedman 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Cynthia R.|last2=Friedman|first2=Meredith|title='I Saw It in the Movies': Exploring the Link Between Product Placement Beliefs and Reported Usage Behavior|journal=Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising (CTC Press)|date=2002|volume=24|issue=2|pages=33–40|doi=10.1080/10641734.2002.10505133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang and Roskos—Ewoldsen 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Moonhee|author2=Roskos-Ewoldsen, David R. |title=The Effectiveness of Brand Placements in the Movies: Levels of Placements, Explicit and Implicit Memory, and Brand-Choice Behavior|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=3|pages=469–489|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00353.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subconscious effects====
Product placement affects the audience on a conscious, but also subconscious level. Science showed that there does not even need to be an explicit, conscious effect to activate subconscious effects.&lt;ref name="Law and Braun 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Laurie T.|last2=Berry|first2=Dianne C.|title=The Influence of Affective Statements on Performance on Implicit and Explicit Memory Tasks|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|date=2002|volume=16|issue=7|pages=829–843|doi=10.1002/acp.841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perfect|first1=T.

The better the product placement fits the surrounding content, the better the implicit effectiveness (like attitude or purchase-intention) will be.&lt;ref name="Lee and Faber 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Astous|first1=Alain|last2=Bitz|first2=Pierre|title=Consumer Evaluations of Sponsorship Programmes|journal=European Journal of Marketing|date=1995|volume=29|issue=12|pages=6–22|doi=10.1108/03090569510102504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonald|first1=Colin|title=Sponsorship and the Image of the Sponsor|journal=European Journal of Marketing|date=1991|volume=25|pages=31–38|doi=10.1108/eum0000000000630}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Ken|title=Sponsorship: The Research Contribution|journal=European Journal of Marketing|date=1991|volume=25|issue=11|pages=22–30|doi=10.1108/eum0000000000629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Audio vs visual=====
After viewing a ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode with visual, auditory and audiovisual product placements, a recall task indicated that audiovisual product placements were recalled the best, visual product placements somewhat less and audio placements least. In a recognition test audiovisual was still remembered the best but audio placements were remembered second best and visual placements were remembered third best.&lt;ref name="Law and Braun 2000" /&gt; As indicated, the type of placement that is most effective seems to vary depending on task, but audiovisual placements seem to be often the most effective.&lt;ref name="Gupta and Lord 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Pola B.|last2=Lord|first2=Kenneth R.|title=Product Placement in Movies: The Effect of Prominence and Mode on Audience Recall|journal=Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising|date=1998|volume=20|issue=1|pages=47–59|doi=10.1080/10641734.1998.10505076}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, audiovisual product placements are not remembered best when there is more than one audiovisual placement at once, making it hard to remember each one.&lt;ref name="Bressoud 374" /&gt; In case the placement is only on the audio level, advertisers must make sure it is very prominent to have any effect at all.&lt;ref name="Delattre and Colovic 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Russel 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purnawirawan|first1=Nathalia|last2=Wouters|first2=Marijke|last3=De Pelsmaker|first3=Patrick|title=Brand Placements in Movies: The Impact of Modality, Prominence and Plot Connection on Attitude and Behavioral Intention|journal=Advances in Advertising Research|date=2010|volume=1|pages=347–361|doi=10.1007/978-3-8349-6006-1_23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Character attractiveness=====
People tended to like brand names that were paired with attractive faces more than those paired with unattractive faces. The more times a brand was paired with an attractive face, the more people liked it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=Michael S. |author2=Tangen, Jason M. |author3=Bettina Cornwell, T. |author4=Quinn, Emerald A. |author5=Murray, Krista L. |title=Unintended effects of memory on decision making: A breakdown in access control|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=63|issue=3|pages=400–415|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2010.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Product prominence=====
Product placement perceived to disrupt a movie, especially when repeated, were found in one study to be counterproductive. Moderate repetition of subtle product placements did not increase people's feelings of distraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Homer|first=Pamela Miles|title=Product Placements|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=38|issue=3|pages=21–32|doi=10.2753/JOA0091-3367380302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products that are integrated within the plot of a movie are better recall, although not if more than one product is shown at a time.&lt;ref name="Bressoud 374"/&gt; In one study placements connected to the story were recognized most often, products used by the main character were remembered less often and products in the background were remembered least often.&lt;ref name="Yang and Roskos—Ewoldsen 2007" /&gt;

Placements were found more effective on a larger screen compared to on a smaller one.&lt;ref name="Bressoud 374"/&gt; Also, products placed in the first half of a movie tend to be remembered better than products in the second half of a movie, which demonstrates the primacy effect.&lt;ref name="Bressoud 374"/&gt;

=====Level of Involvement=====
High involvement with the program makes it easier for people to recognize the product placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friestad|first1=Marian|last2=Wright|first2=Peter|title=The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=1994|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=10.1086/209380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moorman|first1=Marjolein|last2=Willemsen|first2=Lotte M.|last3=Neijens|first3=Peter C.|last4=Smit|first4=Edith G.|title=Program-Involvement Effects on commercial Attention and Recall of Successive and Embedded Advertising|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=2012|volume=41|issue=2|pages=25–38|doi=10.2753/JOA0091-3367410202}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to positive effects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laurent|first1=Gilles|last2=Kapferer|first2=Jean-Noël|title=Measuring Consumer Involvement Profiles|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|date=1985|volume=22|issue=1|pages=41–53|doi=10.2307/3151549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strahan|first1=Erin J.|last2=Spencer|first2=Steven J.|last3=Zanna|first3=Mark P.|title=Subliminal Priming and Persuasion: Striking While the Iron is Hot|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=2002|volume=38|issue=6|pages=556–568|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(02)00502-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but might also lead to negative reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaichkowsky|first1=Judith Lynne|title=Conceptualizing Involvement|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=1986|volume=15|issue=2|pages=4–14|doi=10.1080/00913367.1986.10672999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies for high product category involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Meryl Paula|last2=Mitchell|first2=Andrew A.|last3=Russo|first3=J. Edward|title=Low Involvement Strategies for Processing Advertisements|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=1985|volume=14|issue=2|pages=4–56|doi=10.1080/00913367.1985.10672941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audience demographics===

====Cultural attributes====
Older research cited a difference between different cultural areas. For example, Australians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Stacey|last2=Rosenberger|first2=Philip J. III.|last3=Hementera|first3=Veronica|title=Product Placements in Movies: An Australian Consumer Perspective on their Ethicality and Acceptability|journal=Marketing Bulletin|date=2004|volume=15|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=Stephen|author2=Gupta, P.

====Age====
Children are usually more easily influenced than adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gunter|first1=Barrie|last2=Oates|first2=Caroline|last3=Blades|first3=Mark|title=Advertising to Children on TV: Content, Impact, and Regulation|date=2005|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=978-0805844887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hang|first1=Haiming|title=The implicit influence of bimodal brand placement on children: information integration or information interference?|journal=International Journal of Advertising|date=2012|volume=31|issue=3|page=465|doi=10.2501/IJA-31-3-465-484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Laura|last2=Lewis|first2=Charlie|last3=Auty|first3=Susan|last4=Buijzen|first4=Moniek|title=Is Children's Understanding of Nontraditional Advertising Comparable to Their Understanding of Television Advertising?|journal=Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing|date=2013|volume=32|issue=2|pages=195–206|doi=10.1509/jppm.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex====
If the product is endorsed by a person, there are stronger [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] effects if the audience is the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenko|first1=Anna|last2=Wilemijn|first2=Drost|title=A study in pink: What determines the success of gender-specific advertising?|journal=13th International Conferences on Research in Advertising (ICORIA), Amsterdam, 26–28 June|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women tend to be influenced a little easier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Huan|last2=Haley|first2=Eric|title=Product Placement in Social Games: Consumer Experiences in China|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=2014|volume=43|issue=3|pages=286–295|doi=10.1080/00913367.2013.858086}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Gregorio|first1=Frederico|last2=Sung|first2=Yongjun|title=Understanding Attitudes Toward and Behaviors in Response to Product Placement|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=2010|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–96|doi=10.2753/JOA0091-3367390106}}&lt;/ref&gt; but show more negative reactions when the product can be described as ethically questionable (e.g. alcohol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Pola B.|last2=Gould|first2=Stephen J.|title=Consumers' Perceptions of the Ethics and Acceptability of Product Placements in Movies: Product Category and Individual Differences|journal=Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising (CTC Press)|date=1997|volume=19|issue=1|pages=38–50|doi=10.1080/10641734.1997.10505056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement===
To measure the success of product placement, one first tracks the parameters of the placement itself, like the ease of identification, screen time, number of exposure(s), or association with a main character. That information is also often used to determine the price of a specific placement. Secondly, the effectiveness is measured using direct (for [[explicit memory]] effects) as well as indirect (for [[implicit memory]] effects) measurements.

====Measurement of the explicit memory====
Explicit effects are measured by recall or recognition tests. Subjects are asked to name the products that he or she noticed ([[free recall]]).&lt;ref name="Herrmann et al. 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duke|first1=Charles R.|title=Exploratory Comparisons of Alternative Memory Measures for Brand Name|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=1995|volume=12|issue=1|pages=19–36|doi=10.1002/mar.4220120103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survey can be also aided by giving additional information like a specific product category.&lt;ref name="Babin and Carder 1996" /&gt; At recognition tests, a selection of products is shown to the interviewed person, who then needs to select the ones that he has seen before.&lt;ref name="Vollmer and Mizerski 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta and Lord 1998" /&gt;

====Measurement of the implicit memory====
Implicit effects are measured in an indirect way by observing a change in behavior.&lt;ref name="Herrmann et al. 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schacter|first1=Daniel L.|title=Implicit Memory: History and Current Status|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1987|volume=13|issue=3|pages=501–518|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.13.3.501}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done by tracking the consideration set and buying behavior of people,&lt;ref name="Herrmann et al. 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Johnson und Lehmann 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro et al. 1997" /&gt; measuring brain activities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Medina|first1=John|title=The Neurobiology of the Decision To Buy|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=2004|volume=21|issue=10|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; or using abstract indirect test settings like the word fragment or word stem completion test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=Anthony|last2=Kitchen|first2=Philip J.|title=Researching Mere Exposure Effects to Advertising: Theoretical Foundations and Methodological Implications|journal=International Journal of Market Research|date=2007|volume=49|issue=2|pages=191–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[implicit association test]] (IAT) is also an applicable measurement tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenwald|first1=Anthony G.|last2=McGhee|first2=Debbie E.|last3=Schwartz|first3=Jordan L. K.|title=Measuring Individual Differences in Implicit Cognition: The Implicit Association Test|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1998|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1464–1480|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464|pmid=9654756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mierke|first1=Jan|last2=Klauer|first2=Karl Christoph|title=Method-Specific Variance in the Implicit Association Test|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|volume=85|issue=6|pages=1180–1192|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.6.1180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Many argue that product placement is ethically questionable, because it manipulates people against their will.&lt;ref name="Morton and Friedman 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Astous|first1=Alain|last2=Chartier|first2=Francis|title=A Study of Factors Affecting Consumer Evaluations and Memory of Product Placements in Movies|journal=Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising|date=2000|volume=22|issue=2|pages=31–40|doi=10.1080/10641734.2000.10505106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Astous|first1=Alain|last2=Séguin|first2=Nathalie|title=Consumer Reactions to Product Placement Strategies in Television Sponsorship|journal=European Journal of Marketing|date=199|volume=33|issue=9|pages=896–910|doi=10.1108/03090569910285832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Pola B.|last2=Balasubramanian|first2=Siva K.|title=Viewers' Evaluations of Product Placements in Movies: Public Policy Issues and Managerial Implications|journal=Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising (CTC Press)|date=2000|volume=22|issue=2|pages=41–52|doi=10.1080/10641734.2000.10505107}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrary view is, even if product placement is only perceived unconsciously, it is still evaluated by our mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chartrand|first1=Tanya L.|last2=Dalton|first2=Amy N.|last3=Fitzsimons|first3=Gavan J.|title=Nonconscious Relationship Reactance: When Significant Others Prime Opposing Goals|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=2007|volume=43|issue=5|pages=719–726|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laran|first1=Juliano|last2=Dalton|first2=Amy N.|last3=Andrade|first3=Eduardo B.|title=The Curious Case of Behavioral Backlash: Why Brands Produce Priming Effects and Slogans Produce Reverse Priming Effects|journal=The Journal of Consumer Research|date=2011|volume=37|issue=6|pages=999–1014|doi=10.1086/656577}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot make people act against their beliefs. Most people also appreciate the fact that movies look more realistic with real brands and do not feel disturbed by the placements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackley|first1=Christopher|last2=Tiwsakul|first2=Rungpaka A.|title=Entertainment Marketing and Experiential Consumption|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|date=2006|volume=12|issue=1|pages=63–75|doi=10.1080/13527260500358608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiwsakul|first1=Rungpaka A.|last2=Hackley|first2=Christopher|last3=Szmigin|first3=Isabelle|title=Explicit, Non-Integrated Product Placement in British Television Programmes|journal=International Journal of Advertising|date=2005|volume=24|issue=1|pages=95–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, further research argues that product placement is not any different from other marketing tactics when it comes to ethics.&lt;ref name="Hackley et al. 2008" /&gt;

'''''Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights''''' [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721 was a [[reference question]] posed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] regarding provisions in the [[Manitoba Act]] stipulating the provision of French language services in the province of Manitoba. The Court heard the appeal in June 1984, and gave its ruling a year later, on June 13, 1985.

Four questions were asked:
# Are sections 133 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] and 23 of the [[Manitoba Act, 1870]], requiring laws be in both French and English, mandatory in Manitoba, Quebec, and Parliament?
# If so, are those Manitoban laws not printed in both languages invalid under section 23 of the Manitoba Act?
# If so, do the laws have any force and effect, and if so to what extent?
# Are any of the provisions of [[An Act Respecting the Operation of Section 23 of the Manitoba Act in Regard to Statutes]] inconsistent with section 23 of the [[Manitoba Act, 1870]], and if so are the provisions invalid and of no legal force and effect?

The Court found that the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] and the [[Manitoba Act, 1870]] did require both languages and that those laws that were not in both languages were of no force and effect; however, they were deemed temporarily valid for a time until translations can be re-enacted in order to avoid a legal vacuum in Manitoba and to ensure the continuity of the rule of law.

This reference was the first time that the courts in Canada had used the remedy of a delayed declaration of invalidity.

{{Place of articulation}}
{{align|right|{{Manner of articulation}}}}

In [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]], '''relative articulation''' is description of the [[manner of articulation|manner]] and [[place of articulation|place]] of [[articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] of a speech sound relative to some reference point. Typically, the comparison is made with a default, [[unmarked]] articulation of the same [[phoneme]] in a neutral sound environment. For example, the English velar consonant {{IPA|/k/}} is ''fronted'' before the vowel {{IPA|/iː/}} (as in ''keep'') compared to articulation of {{IPA|/k/}} before other vowels (as in ''cool''). This fronting is called [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]].

The relative position of a sound may be described as ''advanced'' (''fronted''), ''retracted'' (''backed''), ''raised'', ''lowered'', ''centralized'', or ''mid-centralized''. The latter two terms are only used with [[vowel]]s, and are marked in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] with [[diacritic]]s over the vowel letter. The others are used with both [[consonant]]s and vowels, and are marked with [[Iconicity|iconic]] diacritics under the letter. Another dimension of relative articulation that has IPA diacritics is the degree of [[roundedness]], ''more rounded'' and ''less rounded''.

==Advanced and retracted==
{{Infobox IPA
| above = Advanced, retracted
| ipa symbol   = ◌̟ ◌˖
| ipa symbol2  = ◌̠ ◌˗
| showbelow    = yes
}}
{{also|Fronting (phonetics)}}
{{anchor|Advanced}}{{anchor|Retracted}}
An '''advanced''' or '''fronted''' sound is one that is pronounced farther to the front of the [[vocal tract]] than some reference point. The diacritic for this in the IPA is the subscript plus, {{unichar|031F|COMBINING PLUS SIGN BELOW|html=}}. Conversely, a '''retracted''' or '''backed''' sound is one that is pronounced farther to the back of the vocal tract, and its IPA diacritic is the subscript minus {{unichar|0320|COMBINING MINUS SIGN BELOW|html=}}. When there is no room for the sign under a letter, it may be written after, using: {{unichar|02D6|MODIFIER LETTER PLUS SIGN}} as in {{IPA|[ɡ˖]}}, or {{unichar|02D7|MODIFIER LETTER MINUS SIGN}} as in {{IPA|[y˗]}}.

Both vowels and consonants may be fronted or backed. In verbal description, the prefix ''pre-'' may be used to indicate fronting, especially in the terms ''[[palatal|prepalatal]]'' and ''[[velar consonant|prevelar]]''. Otherwise phrases like "fronted u" may be used. For retraction, either the prefix ''post-'' may be used to indicate retraction, as above, or phrases like "retracted i" may be used.

In [[English language|English]], the [[back vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} is farther forward than what is normally indicated by the IPA letter {{IPA|‹u›}}. This fronting may be shown explicitly, especially within a [[International Phonetic Alphabet#Usage|narrow transcription]]: {{IPA|[u̟]}}. Whether this is as far front as the [[central vowel]] {{IPA|[ʉ]}}, or somewhere between {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[ʉ]}}, may need to be clarified verbally, or on a [[vowel diagram]].

The difference between a fronted and non-fronted consonant can be heard in the English words ''key'' {{IPA|[k̟ʰi]}} and ''coo'' {{IPA|[kʰu]}}, where the {{IPA|/k/}} in ''key'' is fronted under the influence of the [[front vowel]] {{IPA|/i/}}. In English, the plosive in the [[affricate]] {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, as in the word ''church'', is farther back than an alveolar {{IPA|/t/}} due to [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] with the [[Voiceless postalveolar fricative|postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. In narrow transcription, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} may be transcribed {{IPA|[t̠ʃʰ]}}. In [[General American|General American English]], the {{IPA|/t/}} in the word ''eighth'' is farther front than normal, due to [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] with the [[interdental consonant]] {{IPA|/θ/}}, and may be transcribed as {{IPA|[eɪt̟θ]}}. 

Languages may have phonemes that are farther back than the nearest IPA symbol. For example, [[Polish language|Polish]] ''sz'' is a postalveolar sibilant. While this is often transcribed as {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, it is not ''domed'' (partially [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]) the way a prototypical {{IPA|[ʃ]}} is. A more precise transcription is therefore {{IPA|[s̠]}}.&lt;!--sic, see [[Postalveolar consonant#Examples]]--&gt; Similarly, the [[velar consonant]]s in [[Kwak'wala|Kwakiutl]] are actually ''postvelar''; that is, pronounced farther back than a prototypical velar, between velar {{IPA|[k]}} and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] {{IPA|[q]}}, and is thus transcribed {{IPA|[k̠]}}.

Officially, the IPA symbol {{IPA|[a]}} stands for the [[open front unrounded vowel]]. However, in most languages where it is used, {{IPA|[a]}} actually stands for the [[Open central unrounded vowel|central]], rather than the front vowel. If precision is desired, this may also be indicated with the minus sign {{IPA|[a̠]}}, although a number of other transcription are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;They include: centralized {{IPAblink|a}} ({{IPA|[ä]}}), centralized {{IPAblink|ɑ}} ({{IPA|[ɑ̈]}}), lowered {{IPAblink|ɐ}} ({{IPA|[ɐ̞]}}) and advanced {{IPAblink|ɑ}} ({{IPA|[ɑ̟]}}), although the last transcription can also indicate an only somewhat advanced back vowel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raised and lowered==
{{Infobox IPA
| above = Raised and lowered
| ipa symbol   = ◌̝ ◌˔
| ipa symbol2  = ◌̞ ◌˕
|showbelow=no
}}
{{also|Raising (phonetics)}}
{{anchor|Raised}}{{anchor|Lowered}}A '''raised''' sound is articulated with the tongue or lip raised higher than some reference point. In the IPA this is indicated with the ''uptack'' diacritic {{unichar|031D|COMBINING UP TACK BELOW|html=}}.

A '''lowered''' sound is articulated with the tongue or lip lowered (the mouth more open) than some reference point. In the IPA this is indicated with the ''downtack'' diacritic {{unichar|031E|COMBINING DOWN TACK BELOW|html=}}. Both consonants and vowels may be marked as raised or lowered.

When there is no room for the tack under a letter, it may be written after, using: {{unichar|02D4|MODIFIER LETTER UP TACK}} as in {{IPA|[ɭ˔]}}, or {{unichar|02D5|MODIFIER LETTER DOWN TACK}} as in {{IPA|[ɣ˕]}}.

===Raised and lowered vowels===
In the case of a vowel, raising means that the vowel is ''[[close vowel|closer]],'' toward the top of the vowel chart. For example, {{IPA|[e̝]}} represents a vowel somewhere between [[cardinal vowel|cardinal]] {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[i]}}, or may even be {{IPA|[i]}}. Lowering, on the other hand, means that the vowel is ''[[Vowel#Height|more open]],'' toward the bottom of the chart. For example, {{IPA|[e̞]}} represents a vowel somewhere between [[cardinal vowel|cardinal]] {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, or may even be {{IPA|[ɛ]}}.

In other non-IPA transcription systems, raised vowels are indicated with the iconic upward-pointing arrowhead {{unichar|02F0|MODIFIER LETTER LOW UP ARROWHEAD|html=}} while lowered vowels have the downward arrowhead {{unichar|02EF|MODIFIER LETTER LOW DOWN ARROWHEAD|html=}}. Thus, IPA {{IPA|[e̝]}} is equivalent to [e˰], IPA {{IPA|[e̞]}} is equivalent to [e˯].

===Raised and lowered consonants===
With consonants, raising and lowering changes the [[manner of articulation]] to something with more or less stricture. For example, raised [[Approximant consonant|approximants]] and [[Trill consonant|trills]] are [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], whereas lowered [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] are [[Approximant consonant|approximants]]. The ambiguous symbols for rear approximant/fricatives may be specified as fricatives with the raising diacritic, {{IPA|[ʁ̝, ʕ̝, ʢ̝]}}, or as approximants with the lowering diacritic, {{IPA|[ʁ̞, ʕ̞, ʢ̞]}}. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the [[Lenition|lenited]] [[allophone]]s of the voiced stops are generally transcribed as [[fricative]]s even though they are [[approximant]]s, or intermediate between fricative and approximant. This may be partially due to the fact there is only a dedicated IPA symbol for one of them, the [[velar approximant]]. More precise transcription will use the fricative symbols with the lowering diacritic, {{IPA|[β̞, ð̞, ɣ˕]}} (the last symbol may be rendered as {{IPA|[ɣ̞]}}, but that may not display properly in some browsers). [[Czech language|Czech]], on the other hand, requires the opposite: Its fricated trill, which is a separate phoneme, may be transcribed as a raised trill, {{IPA|[r̝]}}. Similarly, the [[Voiced alveolar fricative#Voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative|non-sibilant coronal fricative]] is written {{IPA|[ɹ̝]}}, and the [[voiceless velar lateral fricative]] as {{IPA|[ʟ̝̊]}}. (A dedicated letter for this sound, {{angbr|{{IPA|{{PUA|&amp;#xf268;}}}}}}, is not part of the IPA.)

From most open (least [[Manner of articulation#Stricture|stricture]]) to most close (most stricture), there are several independent relationships among speech sounds. ''[[Open vowel]] → [[mid vowel]] → [[close vowel]] → [[approximant]] → [[fricative]] → [[plosive]]'' is one; ''[[flap consonant|flap]] → [[stop consonant|stop]]'' is another; and ''[[Trill consonant|trill]] → trilled [[fricative]]'' yet another. The IPA chart has been organized so that the raising diacritic moves the value of a letter through these series toward the top of the chart, and the lowering diacritic toward the bottom of the chart, but this only works for some of the consonants. While it would be convenient if all consonants could be so ordered, consonants are too diverse for a single dimension to capture their relationships. In addition, many of the points along the series may be [[Nasalization|nasalized]] or [[lateral consonant|lateralized]] as well, and these parameters are independent of stricture.

==Centralized==
{{For|non-lateral consonants|Central consonant}}

===Centralized vowels===
{{Infobox IPA
| above = Centralized
| ipa symbol   = ◌̈
| showbelow    =no
}}
A '''centralized vowel''' is a [[vowel]] that is more [[central vowel|central]] than some point of reference, or that has undergone a shift in this direction. The diacritic for this in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is the dieresis, {{unichar|0308|COMBINING DIAERESIS|html=}}.

For example, to transcribe [[Near-close central rounded vowel|rounded]] and [[Near-close central unrounded vowel|unrounded]] near-close central vowels, the symbols {{IPA|[ɪ̈, ʊ̈]}} may be used.

In other (non-IPA) transcription systems, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ᵻ, ᵿ}}}} (or {{angle bracket|{{IPA|&lt;s&gt;ɪ&lt;/s&gt;, &lt;s&gt;ʊ&lt;/s&gt;}}}}) will be seen instead of {{IPA|[ɪ̈, ʊ̈]}} (by analogy with {{IPA|[ɨ, ʉ]}}). Before the letters {{IPA|[ɘ, ɵ, ɜ, ɞ]}} were added to the IPA in 1993, the symbols {{IPA|[ë, ö, ɛ̈, ɔ̈]}} were used for these near-[[schwa]] values. {{IPA|[ë, ö, ɛ̈, ɔ̈]}} would now be assumed to represent articulations intermediate between {{IPA|[e, o, ɛ, ɔ]}} and {{IPA|[ɘ, ɵ, ɜ, ɞ]}}. Similarly, {{IPA|[ï, ÿ, ü, ɯ̈]}} would be intermediate between {{IPA|[i, y, u, ɯ]}} and {{IPA|[ɨ, ʉ]}}.

However, since the IPA does not specify the exact amount of centralization that centralized vowels have, the symbols {{IPA|[ë, ö, ɛ̈, ɔ̈]}} and {{IPA|[ï, ÿ, ü, ɯ̈]}} can in modern transcriptions&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Gimson|2014|p=133}}, who transcribes the central realizations of the English {{sc2|GOOSE}} vowel {{IPA|/uː/}} with the symbols {{IPA|[üː, ɯ̈ː]}} instead of {{IPA|[ʉː, ɨː]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; be at times used to transcribe fully central vowels, or vowels that have a variable amount of centralization.

In the majority of languages described as having an {{IPA|[a]}} (which denotes a [[Open front unrounded vowel|front]] vowel), the vowel is actually [[Open central unrounded vowel|central]] and therefore a more narrow transcription of it is {{IPA|[ä]}}. However, this symbol is not commonly used mainly because of the common practice of avoiding using diacritics wherever possible, and because very few languages contrast front and central open unrounded vowels.

Instead of the diacritic for centralization, the [[advanced (phonetics)|advanced]] or [[retracted (phonetics)|retracted]] diacritics may be used (an equivalent transcription of {{IPA|[ä]}} is retracted {{IPA|[a̠]}}), but the concept of centralization is convenient in cases where [[front vowel|front]] and [[back vowel]]s move toward each other, rather than all advancing or retracting in the same direction.

When a transcription system uses ''both'' the centralized and the advanced/retracted diacritics, generally the former indicates a more central vowel, so that e.g. {{IPA|[i̠]}} indicates an only slightly centralized (retracted) front vowel {{IPAblink|i}}, whereas {{IPA|[ï]}} indicates a more centralized (retracted) front vowel, or even a fully central vowel (which, as stated above, has a dedicated IPA symbol {{IPAblink|ɨ}}).

===Centralized semivowels===

[[Semivowel]]s can be centralized much like vowels; for instance, the semivowels corresponding to the close central vowels {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɨ}}, {{IPA link|ʉ}}]}} can be written as centralized palatal semivowels {{IPA|[j̈, ɥ̈]}}, or centralized velar semivowels {{IPA|[ɰ̈, ẅ]}}. The transcription {{IPA|[ɥ̈]}} vs. {{IPA|[ẅ]}} may also denote a distinction in the [[Roundedness|type of rounding]], with the former symbol denoting a semivowel with compressed rounding typical of front vowels, and the latter symbol denoting a semivowel with protruded rounding typical of central and back vowels, though an additional verbal clarification is usual in such cases, as the IPA does not provide any official means to distinguish sounds with compressed and protruded rounding.

===Mid-centralized vowels===
{{Infobox IPA
| above = Mid-centralized
| ipa symbol   = ◌̽
| showbelow    =no
}}
{{anchor|Mid-centralized}}'''Mid-centralized vowels''' are closer to the midpoint of the vowel space than their referent vowels. That is, they are closer to the mid-central vowel schwa {{IPA|[ə]}} not just by means of centralization, but also by [[#Raised|raising]] or [[#Lowered|lowering]]. The diacritic used to mark this in the International Phonetic Alphabet is the over-cross, {{unichar|033D|COMBINING X ABOVE|html=}}.

In most languages, vowels become mid-centralized when spoken quickly, and in some, such as English and Russian, many vowels are also mid-centralized when [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]]. This is a general characteristic of [[vowel reduction]].

Even when fully articulated, the vowels of a language may be on the schwa side of a cardinal IPA vowel. One example of this is Lisbon [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], where unstressed ''e'' is a [[near-close near-back unrounded vowel]]. That is, it lies between the [[close back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ɯ]}} and schwa, where {{IPA|[ʊ]}} sits in the vowel chart, but unlike {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, is not rounded. It may be written {{IPA|[ɯ̽]}}, as in ''pegar'' {{IPA|[pɯ̽ˈɣaɾ]}} "to hold", though such a fully narrow transcription is rarely used, with symbols {{IPA|[ɨ]}}, {{IPA|[ɯ]}} or even {{IPA|[ə]}} being the usual broader transcriptions.

==More and less rounded==
{{Infobox IPA
| above = More or less rounded
| ipa symbol   = ◌̹
| ipa symbol2  = ◌̜
| showbelow    =no
}}
{{anchor|More rounded}}{{anchor|Less rounded}}There are also diacritics, respectively {{unichar|0339|COMBINING RIGHT HALF RING BELOW}} and {{unichar|031C|COMBINING LEFT HALF RING BELOW}}, to indicate greater or lesser degrees of rounding. For example, the English {{IPAslink|ʊ}} often has very little rounding, and may be transcribed {{IPA|[ʊ̜]}}. In [[Assamese language|Assamese]], on the other hand, the [[open back rounded vowel]] is much more rounded than is typical for a low vowel, and may be transcribed {{IPA|[ɒ̹]}}.

These diacritics are sometimes also used with consonants to indicate degrees of [[labialization]]. For example, in the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]] [[Hupa language|Hupa]], [[voiceless velar fricative]]s distinguish three degrees of labialization, transcribed either {{IPA|[x x̹ xʷ]}} or {{IPA|[x x̜ʷ xʷ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;A simpler transcription is also possible, and involves putting an additional labialization diacritic next to the last symbol: {{IPA|[x xʷ xʷʷ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Extensions to the IPA]] have two additional symbols for degrees of rounding: spread, as in {{IPA|[i͍]}}, and open-rounded {{angle bracket|&amp;#xA7F9;}} (&lt;sup&gt;œ&lt;/sup&gt;), as in English  {{IPA|[ʃ&lt;sup&gt;œ&lt;/sup&gt;]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ&lt;sup&gt;œ&lt;/sup&gt;]}}.

==Sound changes==
Many [[sound change]]s involve changes in place of articulation:
* [[raising (phonology)]]
** [[imāla]] ({{IPA|/a/}} raising in Arabic)
** [[iotacism]] (vowel raising and partly fronting in Greek)
* [[fronting (phonology)]]
** [[i-mutation]] (vowel fronting or raising, triggered by {{IPA|[i]}} or {{IPA|[j]}})

'''Reuben Asher Braudes'''  ({{lang-he|רְאוּבֵן אָשֵׁר בּראודס}}; {{lang-ru|Реувен Ашер Браудес}}; 1851, [[Vilnius]] – 18 October 1902, [[Vienna]]) was a Lithuania-born [[Hebrew literature|Hebrew novelist]] and [[journalist]].
==Biography==
Educated based on the traditional [[Talmud]]ic lines of Jewish education, he came early under the influence of the [[Maskilim]]. 
==Literary career==
In 1868, Braudes became a contributor to ''Ha-Lebanon'', a Hebrew weekly published by [[Brill Publishers]] in [[Mainz]], and for several years he devoted his pen to topics of the day and to criticism. It was as a novelist, however, that he was to make a mark in [[Hebrew literature]]. In 1874, he published in ''{{illm|The Dawn (Hebrew-language magazine)|lt=The Dawn|he|השחר}}'', a monthly edited by [[Peretz Smolenskin]] at Vienna. His first story, entitled ''The Mysteries of the Zephaniah Family'', a tale of great promise from its style and vivid descriptions. The next year appeared his second novel, ''The Repentant'', which was followed by one entitled ''Religion and Life'', treating of Jewish life. This work was published in ''The Morning Light'', issued by [[Gottlober]] at [[Lviv]] in 1875.

Another novel, ''The Two Extremes'', appeared in Lviv in 1885. In this book Braudes pictures in vivid colors the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Reformed Judaism|Reformed]] camps in modern [[Israel]].
==Zionist activism==
In 1882, at the time of the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Semitic riots in Russia]], Braudes joined the [[Zionist movement]] and became one of its foremost advocates. To foster this idea he went to [[Romania]], and in [[Bucharest]] began the publication of ''Yehudit'', a weekly in [[Yiddish]]. At the end of two years, however, Braudes was expelled from the country.

In 1891, he went to [[Kraków]], and started a weekly in Hebrew, ''The Time''. This paper existed for nine months, when, for lack of funds, its publication was suspended.

[[Theodor Herzl]] appointed Braudes editor of the Yiddish edition of his [[Zionist]] weekly, [[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/braudes-reuben-asher Reuben Asher Braudes]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|rotation in music theory|Permutation (music)}}
In [[broadcasting]], '''rotation''' is the repeated airing of a limited [[playlist]] of [[song]]s on a [[radio station]] or [[satellite radio]] channel, or [[music video]]s on a [[TV network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IU9ZqbYqe6gC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=rotation+music&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBsoWixb7WAhXqDsAKHb5aDf0Q6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=rotation%20music&amp;f=false|title=This Business of Gospel Music|last=King|first=Darrell W.|date=2010|publisher=Darrell King|year=|isbn=9780615410067|location=|pages=152|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually in a different order each time. However, they are not completely [[shuffle play|shuffled]], so as to avoid varying the time between any two consecutive plays of a given song by either too much or too little. When measuring [[airplay]], the number of times a song is played is counted as '''spins'''.

Stations playing new music typically have a short rotation of around four hours, while stations playing "[[classic]]s" may go as long as eight hours. [[College radio]] and [[indie radio]] stations sometimes have no particular rotation, only the [[music director]]'s suggested lists for the [[disc jockey]]s, or are totally [[freeform radio]]. [[Broadcast automation]] systems handle a limited rotation quite well, in turn making [[voice tracking]] easy. Even if a live person is present, the automation system at commercial stations usually picks the music ahead of time out of the current rotation, thus the DJ becomes only an [[announcer]].

'''Heavy rotation''' or '''power rotation''' is a list of [[songs]] that get the most airplay on a [[radio station]]. Songs in heavy rotation will be played many times in a 24-hour period. A reason for playing the same song more than once a day is that many listeners tune in expecting to hear their favorite song, and most listeners don't listen to the radio for extended periods of time. Prolonged listening to a station that places songs in heavy rotation can quickly become unpleasant; such stations are not well-suited for [[retailing|retail]] environments, where employees must listen for hours on end, and doing so can [[familiarity breeds contempt|breed contempt]] for the music and create a [[hostile work environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wivb.com/2017/11/07/psychologists-christmas-music-bad-for-your-health/ Psychologists: Christmas music bad for your health]. ''Nexstar Media Group'' (November 7, 2017). Retrieved November 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A song placed in "'''lunar rotation'''" is one that is only played in off-peak hours, usually late at night. There can be various reasons for this, but such songs are usually not hits and are played because of the personal musical preference of the DJ or programmer, to avoid [[Watershed (broadcasting)|more stringent daypart-based regulations on music content]] or to fulfill a broadcasting obligation such as [[Canadian content]] quotas. (See also "[[beaver hour]]".)

==Recurrent rotation==
Recurrent rotation refers to a group of songs still frequently aired on a [[contemporary hit radio]] station several months or even years after the initial debut. It is also used to describe core songs in other [[radio format]]s as well. Most charts have special rules to determine when a song has become recurrent, at which point they are removed from current charts (such as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]) and placed on special "recurrent charts". Recurrent charts tend to be more static, with fewer week-to-week changes in popularity than current charts.

The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts include these lists:

*[[Hot 100 Singles Recurrents]]
*[[Billboard charts#Hot 100 Recurrent Airplay|Hot 100 Recurrent Airplay]]
*[[Billboard charts#Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Recurrents|Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Recurrents]]
*[[Billboard charts#Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Recurrent Airplay|Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Recurrent Airplay]]
*Top 40 Adult Recurrents
*Hot Adult Contemporary Recurrents
*Hot Country Recurrents

Songs that survive in recurrent [[rotation (music)|rotation]] typically form the basis of radio formats as years advance. A hit song that is left out of recurrent rotation will eventually become known as a "forgotten 45", a name derived from the fact that singles used to be released on 45 RPM records.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6861">'''Sayre’s Paradox''' is a dilemma encountered in the design of automated [[handwriting recognition]] systems.  A standard statement of the paradox is that a cursively written word cannot be recognized without being [[Text segmentation|segmented]] and cannot be segmented without being recognized.&lt;ref&gt;See the PhD thesis by Alessandro Vinciarelli “Offline Cursive Handwriting:  From Word to Text Recognition” (http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/82879). See also Machine Learning:  Theory and Applications, Vol. 31 of Handbook of Statistics, B. V. Elsevier, ed., p. 422 (https://one.overdrive.com/media/1358341/machine-learning-theory-and-applications).&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox was first articulated in a 1973 publication by [[Kenneth M. Sayre]], after whom it was named.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, “Machine Recognition of Handwritten Words:  A Project Report,” Pattern Recognition, Pergamon Press, Vol. 5, 1973, pp. 213-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the problem==

It is relatively easy to design automated systems capable of recognizing words inscribed in a printed format.  Such words are segmented into letters by the very act of writing them on the page.  Given templates matching typical letter shapes in a given language, individual letters can be identified with a high degree of probability.  In cases of ambiguity, probable letter sequences can be compared with a selection of properly spelled words in that language (called a lexicon).&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Vinciarelli, “A Survey on [sic] Off-line Cursive Word Recognition,” Pattern Recognition, Vol. 35, issue 7.  July 2002, pp. 1433-1446.&lt;/ref&gt; If necessary, syntactic features of the language can be applied to render a generally accurate identification of the words in question.&lt;ref&gt;See “Introduction of Statistical Information in a Syntactic analyzer for Document Image Recognition,” by André O. Maroneze, Bertrant Coüashon, and Aurélie Lemaitre (http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=731511).&lt;/ref&gt; Printed-character recognition systems of this sort are commonly used in processing standardized government forms, in sorting mail by zip code, and so forth.

In cursive writing, however, letters comprising a given word typically flow sequentially without gaps between them.  Unlike a sequence of printed letters, cursively connected letters are not segmented in advance.  Here is where Sayre’s Paradox comes into play.  Unless the word is already segmented into letters, template-matching techniques like those described above cannot be applied.  Prior segmentation, that is to say, is necessary for word recognition.  On the other hand, there are no reliable techniques for segmenting a word into letters unless the word itself has been previously identified.  Word recognition requires letter segmentation, and letter segmentation requires word recognition.  There is no way a cursive writing recognition system employing standard template-matching techniques can do both simultaneously.

Advantages to be gained by use of automated cursive writing recognition systems include routing mail with handwritten addresses, reading handwritten bank checks, and automated digitalization of hand-written documents.&lt;ref&gt;See Alessandro Vinciarelli, “Offline Cursive Handwriting:  From Word to Text Recognition,” op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; These are practical incentives for finding ways of circumventing Sayre’s Paradox.

==Avoiding the paradox==

One way of ameliorating the adverse effects of the paradox is to normalize the word inscriptions to be recognized.  Normalization amounts to eliminating idiosyncrasies in the penmanship of the writer, such as unusual slope of the letters and unusual slant of the cursive line.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Vinciarelli, “A Survey on [sic] Offline Cursive Word Recognition,” op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure can increase the probability of a correct match with a letter template, resulting in an incremental improvement in the success rate of the system.  Since improvement of this sort still depends on accurate segmentation, however, it remains subject to the limitations of Sayre’s Paradox.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Vinciarelli, “Offline Cursive Handwriting:  From Word to Text Recognition,” op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have come to realize that the only way to circumvent the paradox is by use of procedures that do not rely on accurate segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Vinciarelli, “Offline Cursive Handwriting:  From Word to Text Recognition,” op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directions of current research==

Segmentation is accurate to the extent that it matches distinctions among letters in the actual inscriptions presented to the system for recognition (the input data).  This is sometimes referred to as “explicit segmentation”.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Vinciarelli, “A Survey on [sic] Offline Cursive Word Recognition,” op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; “Implicit segmentation,” by contrast, is division of the cursive line into more parts than the number of actual letters in the cursive line itself.  Processing these “implicit parts” to achieve eventual word identification requires specific statistical procedures involving [[Hidden Markov Model]]s (HMM).

A [[Markov model]] is a statistical representation of a random process, which is to say a process in which future states are independent of states occurring before the present. In such a process, a given state is dependent only on the conditional probability of its following the state immediately before it.  An example is a series of outcomes from successive casts of a die.  An HMM is a Markov model, individual states of which are not fully known.  Conditional probabilities between states are still determinate, but the identities of individual states are not fully disclosed.

Recognition proceeds by matching HMMs of words to be recognized with previously prepared HMMs of words in the lexicon.  The best match in a given case is taken to indicate the identity of the handwritten word in question.  As with systems based on explicit segmentation, automated recognition systems based on implicit segmentation are judged more or less successful according to the percentage of correct identifications they accomplish.

Instead of explicit segmentation techniques, most automated handwriting recognition systems today employ implicit segmentation in conjunction with HMM-based matching procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Vinciarelli, “Offline Cursive Handwriting:  From Word to Text Recognition,” op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The constraints epitomized by Sayre’s Paradox are largely responsible for this shift in approach.

      <comment>/* The Classic Staff Ride */ Link to [[Great General Staff]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7096">The term '''staff ride''' describes three different types of exercise, each of which is conducted on a particular piece of ground:

# The Classic Staff Ride
# The Leavenworth Staff Ride
# The Decision-Forcing Staff Ride

==The Classic Staff Ride==

The classic staff ride (a direct translation of the German term ''Stabs-Reise'') is a technique made famous by  [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]] in the second half of the nineteenth century.  While serving as chief of the [[Great General Staff]] of the Prussian Army, Moltke took his subordinates on riding tours of areas where, in the event of war, significant military events (such as battles or the deployment of large numbers of troops) were likely to occur.  These exercises served the double purpose of training staff officers to appreciate the operational and strategic significance of particular pieces of terrain and informing contingency planning.  The term "staff" refers to the fact that participants in these exercises were originally members of the Great General Staff.

The Prussian staff ride evolved to an intermediate stage between table-top war games and army maneuvers. In this expanded form of staff rides, the commanding officers and staffs would deploy in the field as if at war, but without troops, with 'teams' for both sides. Reconnaissance and movement orders were given to umpires, who decided what units would be sighted or encountered, and when, passing the information back to the commanders and staffs. The exercise thus allowed the commanders to war game more realistically than on a table top. Critiques would take place at the conclusion of the staff rides. As an example, the [[Battle of Tannenberg]] was largely anticipated in one of [[Alfred von Schlieffen]]'s pre-war staff rides.&lt;ref name = "Zuber1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Zuber |first = Terrence | title = Inventing the Schlieffen Plan: German War Planning 1871-1914 | publisher = New York: Oxford University Press | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = "Zuber2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Zuber | first = Terrence | title = The real German war plan, 1904-14 | publisher = New York: History Press | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Leavenworth staff ride==

The Leavenworth staff ride was introduced by Major [[Eben Swift]] of the US Army, while he was serving as assistant commandant of the General Service and Staff School (today's [[Command and General Staff College]]) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  Like the classic staff ride, the Leavenworth staff ride was originally conducted on horseback.  However, rather than studying the role that a particular piece of ground might play in a future conflict, the participants in a Leavenworth staff ride studied the ground associated with a battle or campaign that took place at some point in the past.

The staff rides conducted by Major Swift were invariably those of the American Civil War.  For example, in 1906, Major Swift led a group of twelve students on a staff ride to the site of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]].

In the 1970s, the United States Army revived the staff ride, replacing horses with buses and automobiles; expanding the range of battles and operations studied well beyond those of the American Civil War; and extending the opportunity to participate to soldiers of all ranks and specialties.

In some instances, the Leavenworth staff ride consists of a guided tour of the battlefield, with explanations provided by military historians, park rangers, or others with expertise on the events in question.  In other instances, each participant is assigned the task of explaining the events of a particular time and place to the other participants.


Since that time, army schools have used staff rides to enhance professional [[military education and training]]. It began at CGSC and has continued at the [[United States Army War College|War College]] and the various officer schools; however, staff riding is not limited to officers. Indeed, [[Non-commissioned officer]]s, too, find the process useful to understand higher level [[decision-making]], [[military tactic]]s, and [[leadership]]; they also benefit from a historical view of training.



A staff ride differs from a guided battlefield tour:{{sfn|Johns Hopkins||}}

:* it is an educational technique for studying leadership, decisions taken and whether alternatives could have been employed, and
:* it requires active participation, where each group member assumes the role of a participant in the battle, and he is questioned by the others as to the view on what occurred in the battlefield.

A properly conducted staff ride consists of three phases: 

#''Preliminary Study'': Participants study the battle or campaign in detail with guidance from the staff ride instructor. During this phase, each participant assumes a role or position to brief during the ride. This [[active learning]] enhances the educational value of the staff ride.{{sfn|Robertson|1987|pp=11{{endash}}13}}
#''Field Study'': A well-led staff ride with a competent instructor on the campaign or battle site is an invaluable lesson for all. The instructor should set the stage at each stand, orienting the students to key terrain, and then guide the students through the discussion of the actions at each position, finishing the stand with questions that help spark deeper analyses of the actions. Understanding the [[terrain]], [[technology]], [[force structure]], and backgrounds of the key commanders is critical to understanding the battle. Properly prepared students will gain immeasurably from the experience of presenting information to their peers in this environment.{{sfn|Robertson|1987|pp=13{{endash}}17}}
#''Integration'': Integrating the insights and understandings developed during the staff ride and applying them to the current environment is crucial to the learning experience. At the end of the staff ride, the instructor should provide a final integration phase to examine the experience and firmly link the insights of the past to the army of today.{{sfn|Robertson|1987|pp=17{{endash}}18}}

==Decision-Forcing Staff Ride==

Also known as an "on-site decision-forcing case" or a "Quantico-style staff ride", a decision-forcing staff ride is a [[Case method | decision-forcing case]] conducted in the places where the decisions at the heart of the case were made.  That place could be a historic building, a scenic overlook, or a ship that has been turned into a museum.  In most instances, however, it is a portion of a battlefield that has been preserved.

'''John Stig Claesson''' (2 June 1928 – 4 January 2008), also known under his signature '''Slas''', was a Swedish writer, visual artist, and illustrator. Claesson was born on 2 June 1928 in [[Huddinge]], south of [[Stockholm]]. He attended the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]] between 1947 and 1952, during which time he began to illustrate Swedish literature such as the novels of [[Per Anders Fogelström]]. Claesson is the father of actor [[Leif Claesson (photographer)|Leif Claesson]]. Stig Claesson died on 4 January 2008 in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1353&amp;a=730519|accessdate=December 30, 2009|title=Ett språk utan skitprat|newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=Swedish|date=January 7, 2008|first=Ola|last=Larsmo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Claesson debuted in his writing career in 1956, when he was 28 years of age. During his career Claesson published more than 80 books. A number of his books are based on travel abroad and move in the frontier between [[Journalism|reporting]] and [[fiction]]. Among his best-known works include ''En vandring i solen'' (Walking in the Sun, 1976), which was [[A Walk in the Sun (1978 film)|made into a film]] with [[Gösta Ekman]] in the role of the main character. Claesson provided works about the remote and rural regions of Sweden and describe the conflict between the town and the country in books such as ''Vem älskar Yngve Frej'' (1968; Who Loves Yngve Frej), which was translated into 10 languages and was filmed for television in 1973 starring [[Allan Edwall]]. A stage adaption was created in the 1990s. His last book was ''God Natt Fröken Ann'' (Goodnight, Miss Ann), published in 2006.

Stig Claesson's work has received many awards, such as the literature prize of the newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' and the [[Selma Lagerlöf Prize]]. The [[University of Uppsala]] awarded him an honorary doctorate degree in 1974.

He died on 4 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/20080105/9571 Author Stig Claesson dies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syldavian''' is a [[fictional language|fictional]] [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] created by [[Hergé]] as the national language of [[Syldavia]], a small fictional [[Balkan]] [[monarchy|kingdom]] that serves as a major setting in many of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' stories. Hergé modeled the language on [[Marols]], a dialect of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spoken in and around [[Brussels]]. The entire corpus of the language has been analyzed by [[Mark Rosenfelder]].

==Characteristics==

As presented in the Tintin books, Syldavian has a superficial resemblance to certain Central European languages, particularly [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], due to its [[orthography]]. Like [[Serbian language|Serbian]], it uses both Cyrillic and Latin script, although apparently in somewhat different contexts; it is most commonly written in the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet, albeit with the [[Latin]] alphabet by the royal court. It shares numerous orthographic features found in various Eastern European languages, most notably the "sz" and "cz" of [[Polish language|Polish]].

However, the language is clearly a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] language. Its vocabulary and grammar resembles that of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language|German]] and has little in common with any Slavic languages. But while Marols, Hergé's native dialect, was used as a basis for the language, Syldavian has a much more complicated grammar, with other Central European influences added. (Indeed, it is easy to imagine that if Hergé was, say, [[Italian language|Italian]], Syldavian would have ended up like [[Romanian language|Romanian]].)

The language also appears to have been influenced by [[Borduria|Bordurian]] (another fictional language), [[Slavic languages]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The Syldavians often bear names of Slavic origin, such as Wladimir; the dish ''szlaszeck'' that Tintin encountered also appears to be a borrowing (''szaszłyk'' is the Polish word for "shish kebab", borrowed in turn from Turkish). Many words are based on common French slangs. For examples, "klebcz" is constructed on the French Parisian slang "clebs" meaning "dog".

This language, which is Germanic but bears a great resemblance to [[Polish language|Polish]], may be likened to the artificial Romance language [[Wenedyk]], or to the endangered [[Wymysorys language]].

== Phonology ==
Syldavian boasts a rich range of sounds.&lt;ref name="rosenfelder"/&gt;

=== Vowels ===
In addition to the [[diacritical mark]]s shown in the chart below, there are acute and grave accents that may indicate stress.

''Roman letters are on the left, Cyrillic letters on the right.''

In addition to these letters, Syldavian also contains several digraphs and letters for which the pronunciation is uncertain:
* {{angle bracket|â}} - uncertain, possibly /{{IPAlink|æ}}/
* {{angle bracket|ï}} - uncertain. Likely a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] indicating to pronounce as syllabic {{IPAslink|i}} rather than {{IPAslink|j}}, or for the benefit of [[French language|French]]-speakers so they don't mispronounce ''ai'' as {{IPA|/ɛː/}} instead of the correct {{IPA|/aj/}}.
* {{angle bracket|oe}} - {{IPAslink|ø}}
* {{angle bracket|ou}} - {{IPA|/ou/}}
* {{angle bracket|eu}} - uncertain: perhaps the vowel {{IPAslink|œ}} or {{IPAslink|ø}}, perhaps a diphthong {{IPA|/eu/}} or {{IPA|/ɛu/}}. It is only seen in one word: ''teuïh'' ("door").
* {{angle bracket|ei}} - {{IPA|/ei/}}

Note: As in [[Czech language|Czech]], the letter {{angle bracket|r}} can be syllabic, as seen in names such as ''Staszrvitch'' and ''Dbrnouk''.

There are some additional digraphs and trigraphs, including {{angle bracket|tch}} (used in names and pronounced with {{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}}, the apparent Syldavian version of the common Serbo-Croatian/Balkan surname ending ''-ić''), {{angle bracket|chz}} (uncertain, but may be an alternative form of {{angle bracket|cz}} {{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}}), and {{angle bracket|th}} {{IPAslink|t}}. These demonstrate that the Latin-based orthography has a number of irregularities, or else these are old inconsistent spellings that have been preserved in family names but are no longer used in the standard orthography ([[Hungarian alphabet#Historic spellings used in names|as in Hungarian]], where for example one may find the family name ''[[Széchenyi]]'' retaining a traditional spelling rather than the orthographically correct *''Szécsenyi'').

Note that Syldavian Cyrillic diverges in some important respects from Cyrillic as used in real-world languages, most notably by porting over Latin digraphs into the Cyrillic alphabet (for example, /ʃ/ is written "сз" instead of "ш"), and to use a few Cyrillic letters (щ, ю) for sounds for which they are never used in the real world. This, together with the use of Latin script in old medieval manuscripts, may suggest that the Syldavians adopted the Latin alphabet first, and the Cyrillic later, which is the reverse of several real-world languages (most notably [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) which switched from Cyrillic to Latin.

==Grammar==

=== Plurals ===
* Native words are pluralized with '''-en''': ''klebcz'''''en''' - "dogs"; ''fläsz'''''en''' - "bottles"
* Loanwords are pluralized with '''-es''': ''zigarett'''''es''' - "cigarettes"

=== Definite articles ===
Unlike Marols, but like [[German language|German]] (shown in ''italics'' in the table), Syldavian definite articles are extensively inflected.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!        ||Masc./Fem.  ||Neut. ||Plural
|-
|''Nom.''||'''dze'''&lt;br&gt;''der/die''||'''dascz'''&lt;br&gt;''das''||'''dzoe'''&lt;br&gt;''die''

|-
|''Gen.''||'''doscz'''&lt;br&gt;''des/der''||'''doscz'''&lt;br&gt;''des''||'''doscz'''&lt;br&gt;''der''
|-
|}

=== Indefinite articles ===
* Singular: ''on'' - "a"
* Plural: ''onegh'' - "some"

== Adjectives ==
Adjectives precede nouns:&lt;ref name="rosenfelder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zompist.com/syldavian.html |title=Hergé's Syldavian: A grammar |last=Rosenfelder |first=Mark |date= |website=zompist.com |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''forwotzen zona'' 'prohibited area'; ''Zekrett Politzs'' 'Secret Police'.

There is no sufficient evidence to tell whether adjectives change form. The rules of Dutch, a control language of Syldavian, are very complex.

Note: the derivation Klow &gt; Klowaswa is merely one of many adjectivizations, however, compare Zyldav 'Syldavian'

Adjectives can be used to modify verbs like adverbs:

:''Nadja Wladimir '''zekrett'' löwt'''. 'Nadja secretly loves Vladimir'

:''Dzapeih '''wzryzkar''' eszt on vaghabontz''. 'The guy is surely a tramp.'

*The 2nd person conjugations are unknown, with reconstructions shown with asterisks. Corresponding German verbs and the 2 pl. imperative were used as a guideline in the reconstructions, with ''-szt'' in 2 sing. based upon German ''-st'', although ''-szcz'' and ''-eh'' (the latter written -ещ in Cyrillic, which would be ''-esht'' in Bulgarian Cyrillic) are other possibilities.

===Negatives===

To negate a sentence, the particle ''nietz'' is placed after the subject, in auxiliary position.

:''Müsstler nietz dzem könikstz löwt''. 'Müsstler does not love the king.'

In copulative sentences, ''nietz'' is placed after the verb (or ''czesztot'') :

:''Müsstler eszt nietz güdd''. 'Müsstler is not good.' 
:''Czesztot wzryzkar nietz on waghabontz!'' 'That's surely not a vagabond!'

== Adverbs ==

Most adverbs tend to be identical to adjectives in form. Adverbs can be used to modify verbs:

:Nadja Wladimir ''zekrett'' löwt. 'Nadja secretly loves Vladimir'

:Dzapeih ''wzryzkar'' eszt on vaghabontz. 'The guy is surely a tramp.'

==Interjections==

''szplug'' - a curse word, perhaps equivalent to "damn". (Not found in original French edition, only English translation.)

''szplitz on szplug''- a more extreme form of szplug

''hamaïh!''- praising or surprise, could be something like "hail!" or "wow!"

''hält!''- a command, probably meaning "stop!" or "halt!"

''szcht!''- another command, sounds almost like "shh!" and perhaps means "silence!"

''zsálu''- a greeting, probably "salute" or "hello".

== Syntax ==

===Verbs===
The verb normally follows the object:&lt;ref name="rosenfelder"/&gt;

:''Ihn dzekhoujchz blaveh!''  'In the car stay!'

:''Ek mejn mädjek löw''. 'I love my girlfriend.'

:''On sprädj werlagh''. 'I want some red wine.'

Where there's an auxiliary and a main verb, the main verb remains at the end, and the auxiliary verb moves just after the subject:

:''Zsoe ghounh dzoeteuïh ebb touhn.''  'They're going to open the doors.'

:''Ek werlagh ihn Klow blavn.''  'I want to stay in Klow.'

===Pronouns===

In earlier Syldavian the pronoun may follow the verb, and this form may still be used for emphasis:&lt;ref name="rosenfelder"/&gt;

:''Eih bennec, eih blavec'' 'Here I am, here I stay.' [medieval spelling] 
:''Wzryzkar kzomme ek!'' 'I'm coming, for sure!'

You can say either Eihn ben ek, Eihn bennek or Ek ben eihn, but never *Eihn ek ben (unlike English, where you can say 'Here I am'). In general "X is Y" can be inverted to "Y is X". When X is a pronoun, the inversion adds some emphasis:

:''Güdd eszt itd'', 'Good it is.'

In the ''kzommet'' sentences in the corpus, prepositional phrases follow the verb. The comma, however, is a signal that the prepositional phrase has been moved for emphasis, or because it is an afterthought:

:''Kzommet micz omhz, noh dascz gendarmaskaïa!'' Come with us to the police station!

Forms of 'be' directly follow the subject :

:Könikstz eszt güdd. 'The king is good.'

:Sbrodj on forwotzen eszt zona . 'Sbrodj is a forbidden zone.'

:''Dan dzetronn eszt ervöh''. 'Then the throne is for him.'

The merged form ''czesztot'' 'it is, that is' begins a sentence: ''Czesztot Tintin''. "That's Tintin."

==Historical changes==

Samples of Syldavian from only two periods - the 14th century and the 20th century - are available to us. But even with such a small sample, some changes can be seen in the language over a 600-year period:

* ''pho'' became ''vüh'' ("for")
* ''cegan'' became ''czaïgan'' ("say")
* ''eih'' became ''eihn'' ("here")
* ''coe'' became ''kzou'' ("cow")
* ''ön'' became ''o'' ("at, about")
* ''wazs'' became ''vazs'' ("what")
* ''w'' and ''v'' transposed
* ''c'' (/{{IPAlink|k}}/) became ''k''

== Sample text==

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:Text.PNG|right|thumb|14th-century manuscript, ''Noble Deeds of Ottokar IV''.]] --&gt;
From a 14th-century manuscript, ''Noble Deeds of Ottokar IV'':

'''Medieval Spelling'''
:''"Pir Ottocar, dûs pollsz ez cönicstz, dan tronn eszt pho mâ." Czeillâ czäídâ ön eltcâr alpû, "Kzommetz lapzâda pacceho." Cönicstz itd ön alpû clöppz Staszrvitchz erom szûbel ön. Dâzsbíc fällta öpp ön cârrö.''

'''Modern Spelling'''
:''"Pir Ottokar, dûs pollsz ez könikstz, dan tronn eszt vöh mâ." Czeillâ czäídâ o eltkâr alpû, "Kzommetz lapzâda pakkeho." Könikstz itd o alpû klöppz Staszrvitchz erom szûbel o. Dâzsbíck fällta öpp o kârrö.''

'''Cyrillic Spelling'''
:''"Пир Оттокар, дўс поллсз ез кёникстз, дан тронн есзт вёщ мӕ.” Чеиллӕ чяѝдӕ о елткӕр алпў, “Кзомметз лапзӕда паккещо.” Кёникстз итд о алпў клёппз Стасзрвитчз ером сзўбел о. Дӕзсбѝк фяллта ёпп о кӕррё.''

'''English translation:'''
:"Father Ottokar, thou falsely art king; the throne is for me." This one said thus to the other, "Come seize the sceptre." The king thus hit him, Staszrvitch, on his head. The villain fell onto the floor."

'''More Examples'''

:''Czesztot on klebcz.'' - "That's a dog."

:''Hamaïh!'' - "Hail!"

:''Kzommet micz omhz, noh dascz gendarmaskaïa.'' - "Come with us to the Police Station." ("politzski" in the English translation.) Note that because ''gendarmaskaïa'' is a borrowing from French  ''gendarme'', it is likely pronounced closer to [ʒandarmaskaja] than *[gendarmaskaja]. The suffix ''-skaïa'' is also apparently borrowed from the [[Russian language|Russian]] feminine adjective ending -ская.

:''On fläsz Klowaswa vüh dzapeih... Eih döszt!'' - "A bottle of Klow water for this guy... He's thirsty!" (cf. Dutch 'dorst' &amp; cf. Swedish 'törst' , "thirst". (Lit. 'He thirsts!')

:''Czesztot wzryzkar nietz on waghabontz! Czesztot bätczer yhzer kzömmetz noh dascz gendarmaskaïa?'' - "That's surely not a tramp! Isn't it better for him to come to the police station?" (Lit. probably "Is it better [that] he comes to the police station?")

:''Rapp! Noh dzem buthsz!''-"Quick! Into the boat!" (cognate literally to German ''Nach dem Boot!,'')

A '''text display''' is an electronic [[alphanumeric]] [[display device]] that is mainly or only capable of showing [[Plain text|text]], or extremely limited [[graphic character]]s.  This includes [[electromechanical]] [[split-flap display]]s, [[vane display]]s, and [[flip-disc display]]s; all-electronic [[liquid-crystal display]]s, incandescent eggcrate displays, [[LED display]]s, and [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s; and even electric [[nixie tube]]s.

There are several ways to form text for display.  A [[segment display]] uses lines, while a [[dot-matrix display]] uses a [[dot matrix|grid of dots]], and both of these are seen in LCD, LED, VFD, and vane/disc types.  For split-flap displays, the characters or words are pre-printed, and for nixie tubes the shapes are also pre-formed.  In any case, the display elements are controlled by electronics which activate them in the correct physical and [[time|temporal]] sequence to show the desired information.

Text displays are used in everything from [[clock]]s ([[clock radio]]s, [[wristwatch]]es) to [[variable-message sign]]s ([[departure board]]s, [[intelligent transportation system]]s), because until the late 2000s, they were (and in many cases still are) the least expensive for their purpose.

==Text display types==

===LED text displays===
LED text displays refer to types that are specialized and limited to display of alpha-numeric characters. Most types display either one character  or a group of characters.  One character is generally displayed by a matrix of LEDs, or by a set of segments.

===Liquid-crystal display===
A '''[[liquid-crystal display]]''' ('''LCD''') is a [[flat panel display]], [[electronic visual display]], [[video display]] that uses the light modulating or polarizing properties of [[Liquid Crystals|liquid crystals]] (LCs).  LCs do not emit light directly. A character display type is limited to and specialized for display of alphanumeric characters.

They are used in a wide range of applications, including [[computer monitor]]s, [[television]], instrument panels, [[flight instruments|aircraft cockpit displays]], [[signage]], etc.  They are common in consumer devices such as video players, gaming devices, [[clock]]s, watches, [[calculator]]s, and [[telephone]]s.

The low electrical power consumption of LCDs enables them to be used in [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[electronics|electronic]] equipment.  It is an [[Electro-optic modulator|electronically modulated optical device]] made up of any number of  [[pixel]]s filled with [[liquid crystal]]s and arrayed in front of a [[Light#Light sources|light source]] ([[backlight]]) or [[reflector (photography)|reflector]] to  produce images in  color or  [[monochrome]].  The earliest  discovery leading  to  the development  of LCD technology, the discovery of liquid crystals, dates from  1888.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2008, worldwide sales of televisions with LCD screens had surpassed the sale of CRT units.

===Eggcrate displays===
An '''eggcrate display''' is one older method of displaying an alphanumeric character.  It consists of a matrix of [[incandescent light bulb]]s. A foam rubber mask with an array of holes surrounding the bulbs is attached to the display, causing it to resemble an egg crate.

Some eggcrate displays use a complete 5×7 matrix for each digit, permitting the display of nearly all alphanumeric characters. Other types display only numeric characters and optionally a dollar sign. This type of eggcrate display is popularly used for sports [[scoreboard]]s.

Eggcrate displays have been used on many [[game show]]s to display contestants' scores and/or for countdown clocks because other types of displays, such as [[light-emitting diode|LED]] [[seven-segment display]]s, were prone to being washed out by bright studio lights. Though they continued to see extensive use well into the late 1990s, many shows began adopting LCDs in the 2000s.  They have also been used as [[variable-message sign]]s on highways, although they were later superseded by [[flip-disc display|flip-disc]], fiber optic, and eventually [[LED display]]s.

===Vane displays===
A '''[[vane display]]''' is an electro-mechanical type of [[7-segment display]]. Unlike [[light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] segmented displays, vane displays are composed of seven physical surfaces, typically painted white, but occasionally other colors, such as yellow or fluorescent green. If a segment is to be displayed as "off", it will be rotated so that its edge faces forward, with the painted surface pointing away and not visible. A segment that is to be displayed as "on" will be rotated so that the painted surface is shown.

[[File:Unicode logo.svg|thumb|right|100px|The Unicode logo]]

'''Unicode input''' is the insertion of a specific [[Universal Character Set characters|Unicode character]] on a computer by a [[user (computing)|user]]; it is a common way to input characters not directly supported by a physical [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]. Unicode characters can be produced either by selecting them from a display or by typing a certain sequence of keys on a physical keyboard.  In addition, a character produced by one of these methods in one web page or document can be [[Cut,_copy_and_paste|copied]] into another. Unicode is similar to [[ASCII]] but provides many more options and encodes many more signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lafontaine|first=Sylvain|title=Unicode vs ASCII difference and benefits|url=http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/918f7c8b-cc16-4c03-b4f9-f9b0660e0587/unicode-vs-ascii-difference-and-benefits?forum=transactsql|publisher=MSDN|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Unicode input system needs to provide a large repertoire of characters, ideally all valid Unicode code points. This is different from a [[keyboard layout]] which defines keys and their combinations only for a limited number of characters appropriate for a certain [[locale (computer software)|locale]].
[[Image:KCharSelect Mathematical Operators.png|thumb|right|345px|[[KCharSelect]] picks some of [[Unicode Mathematical Operators]]]]

== Unicode numbers ==
Unicode characters are distinguished by [[code point]]s, which are [[Unicode#Upluslink|conventionally represented]] by "U+" followed by four or five [[hexadecimal digit]]s, for example U+00AE or U+1D310. Characters in the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP), containing modern [[Writing system|scripts]]&amp;nbsp;– including many Chinese and Japanese characters&amp;nbsp;– and many symbols, have a 4-digit code. Historic scripts, but also many modern symbols and pictographs (such as [[emoticon]]s, [[playing card]]s and many [[CJK characters]]) have 5-digit codes.

== Availability ==

An application can display a character only if it can access a [[font]] which contains a [[glyph]] for the character. &lt;ref name="mswin"&gt; Andrew Marcuse, [https://www.fileformat.info/tip/microsoft/enter_unicode.htm "How to enter Unicode characters in Microsoft Windows"]. Access date: September 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Very few fonts have full Unicode coverage; most only contain the glyphs needed to support a few [[writing system]]s. However,  most modern browsers and other text-processing applications are able to display multilingual content because they perform [[font substitution]], automatically switching to a fallback font when necessary to display characters which are not supported in the current font. Which fonts are used for fallback and the thoroughness of Unicode coverage varies by software and operating system; some software will search for a suitable glyph in all of the installed fonts, others only search within certain fonts.

If an application does not have access to a font supporting a character, the character will usually be shown as a question mark or another generic replacement character, e.g. � or &amp;#x2002;&amp;#x20DE;&amp;#x2002;.

== Selection from a screen ==
[[File:20170802073953!GNOME_Character_Map_3.18.2.png|thumb|300px|GNOME Character Map]]

Many systems provide a way to select Unicode characters visually. [[ISO/IEC 14755]] refers to this as a ''screen-selection entry method''.

[[Microsoft Windows]] has provided a Unicode version of the [[Character Map (Windows)|Character Map]] program, appearing in the consumer edition since XP. This is limited to characters in the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP). Characters are searchable by Unicode character name, and the table can be limited to a particular code block.

More advanced third-party tools of the same type are also available (a notable [[freeware]] example is [[Andrew West (linguist)#BabelMap|BabelMap]], which supports all Unicode characters).

In [[Mac OS X|macOS]] the "Emoji &amp; Symbols" ({{key press|[[command key|command]]|[[Control key|Ctrl]]|Space}}) menu can be found in the [[Edit menu]] in many programs. This brings up the Characters palette allowing the user to choose any character from a variety of views. The user can also search for the character or Unicode plane by name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1518 Support.Apple.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On most [[Linux]] desktop environments, equivalent tools&amp;nbsp;– such as [[gucharmap]] (GNOME) or [[List of KDE applications|kcharselect]] (KDE)&amp;nbsp;– are available.

== Decimal input ==
In some applications on [[Microsoft Windows]], particularly those using the [[RichEdit]] control, decimal Unicode code points (for example, 256 for U+0100) are supported with [[Alt code]]s. &lt;!-- I've seen this work system-wide before, but can't duplicate it --&gt;

The text editor [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] allows characters to be specified by two-character mnemonics (confusingly called [[digraph (computing)|"digraphs"]] by Vim developers).  The installed set can be augmented by custom mnemonics defined for arbitrary code points, specified in decimal.  For example, as decimal 9881 is equal to hexadecimal 2699, {{Code|dig Gr 9881}} associates "Gr" with {{unichar|2699|GEAR}}.

== Hexadecimal input ==

Clause 5.1 of ISO/IEC 14755 describes a ''Basic method'' whereby a ''beginning sequence'' is followed by the [[hexadecimal|hex number]] representation of the [[code point]] and the ''ending sequence''. On some systems, this is limited to the BMP (characters up to U+FFFF).

=== In Microsoft Windows ===

In order to enable a universal (independent of language settings) input method in Windows, one can add a string type (REG_SZ) value called &lt;code&gt;EnableHexNumpad&lt;/code&gt; to the [[Windows Registry|registry]] key &lt;code&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control&amp;nbsp;Panel\Input&amp;nbsp;Method&lt;/code&gt; and assign the value data &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to it. Users need to log off/in on Windows&amp;nbsp;8.1/8.0, Windows&amp;nbsp;7, and Vista or reboot on earlier systems after editing the registry for this input method to start working.
Unicode characters can then be entered by holding down {{keypress|Alt}}, pressing the {{keypress|+}} on the numeric keypad, followed by the hexadecimal code – using the numeric keypad for digits from 0 to 9 and letter keys for A to F digits – and then releasing {{keypress|Alt}}.&lt;ref name="mswin" /&gt; This may not work for 5-digit hexadecimal codes like U+1F937.
[[File:Unicodeinput Window.png|thumb|220px|UnicodeInput window]]
If one prefers not to edit the registry or if, as on many laptops, the numeric keypad is unavailable, the utility UnicodeInput can be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=UnicodeInput Review|last=Opris|first=Elena|website=[[Softpedia]]|accessdate=November 28, 2018|url=https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/UnicodeInput.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If one invokes this program when typing text, the window shown on the right appears; entering the hexadecimal value and pressing {{keypress|Enter}} then produces the desired character and makes the window disappear.

[[AutoHotkey]] scripts support substitution of Unicode characters for keystrokes.  For example, the command &lt;code&gt;Send {U+2014}&lt;/code&gt; will insert an [[Dash#Em dash|em dash]] in a text field in the active window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm|title=Send Keys &amp; Clicks|publisher=AutoHotkey Foundation LLC. Copyright © 2003–2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individual Windows programs or apps already support the input of Unicode. For instance, [[WordPad]] and [[LibreOffice]]  programs ([[LibreOffice Writer|Writer]], [[LibreOffice Calc|Calc]],  etc.) support the following input method: one first enters the character’s hexadecimal code (between two and six hexadecimal digits), then immediately presses {{keypress|Alt|X}}. For example, entering &lt;code&gt;f1&lt;/code&gt; and then pressing the combination will produce the character ñ. Unless it is six hexadecimal digits long, the code must not be preceded by any digit or letters a–f as they will be treated as part of the code to be converted. For example, entering &lt;code&gt;af1&lt;/code&gt; followed by {{keypress|Alt|X}} will produce ૱ (U+0AF1), but entering &lt;code&gt;a0000f1&lt;/code&gt; followed by {{keypress|Alt|X}} will produce añ. This also works in [[Microsoft Word]]&amp;nbsp;2002/2003 for Windows.
In [[Microsoft Word]]&amp;nbsp;2007/2010 for Windows {{keypress|Alt|C}} has to be used.

=== In MacOS ===

In Mac OS 8.5 and later, one can choose the ''Unicode Hex Input'' keyboard layout; in OS X Yosemite, this can be added in Keyboard → Input Sources. Holding down {{key press|option}}, one types the four-digit [[hexadecimal]] Unicode code point and the equivalent character appears; one can then release the {{key press|option}} key.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mac.sillydog.org/archives/001703.php typing special and accented characters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309212927/http://mac.sillydog.org/archives/001703.php |date=2008-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters outside of the BMP exceed the four-digit limit of the Unicode hex input mechanism but can be entered using the search entry box in the Character Viewer (Edit → Emoji &amp; Symbols) or by using [[UTF-16#Description|surrogate pairs]]: holding down the {{keypress|Option}} key while entering the first surrogate, the {{keypress|+}}, the second surrogate, then releasing the Option key.

=== In X11 (Linux and Unix variants) ===

The possibility of hexadecimal code input on operating systems using the [[X Window System]] depends on the system and applications. Hex input is not implemented in the common [[X.Org Server]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26747 Xorg Bug 26747 – X does not allow input of Unicode characters using Ctrl+Shift followed by the character code]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual [[input methods]] and [[GUI toolkits]] can provide hex input independent of the X server.

For example, [[GTK+]] is an [[ISO/IEC 14755]]-conformant system{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;!-- the standard does not mention the "u" which is needed in gtk --&gt;. The beginning sequence is {{keypress|Ctrl|Shift|U}} and the ending sequence is {{keypress|Enter}} or {{keypress|Space}}. Programs based on GTK+, such as GNOME applications, support Unicode input.

There are two common methods for direct input of Unicode characters:
* Hold {{keypress|Ctrl|Shift}} and type {{keypress|u}} followed by the hex digits. Then release {{keypress|Ctrl|Shift}}.
* Enter {{keypress|Ctrl|Shift|u}}, release, then type the hex digits, and press {{keypress|Enter}} (or {{keypress|Space}} or even on some systems, press and release {{keypress|Shift}} or {{keypress|Ctrl}} ).

In non-GTK applications, however, there usually is no escape sequence to input arbitrary input characters. For example, [[Qt (framework)|Qt]] and [[KDE]] rely on the standard [[X Input Method|X Input Method (XIM)]] framework, and do not implement their own solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103788 KDE Bug 103788 – input of arbitrary unicode characters as defined in ISO 14755]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[xterm]], these input methods are not supported, but using [[escape sequences]] is an alternative.  [[rxvt-unicode]] implements optional ISO/IEC 14755, enabled by default.

However, regardless of the toolkit used, the [[Compose key]] subsystem can be used to configure certain key stroke combinations to input a subset of unicode.

=== In platform-independent applications ===
* In [[Emacs]], {{keypress|[[Control key|Ctrl]]|x}}{{keypress|8}}{{keypress|Enter}} or {{keypress|[[Meta key|Meta]]|x}}&lt;code&gt;insert-char&lt;/code&gt;.
* In [[LibreOffice]] 5.1 onwards, type the hexadecimal number of a symbol and press {{keypress|Alt|X}}.&lt;!-- https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/gitweb?p=core.git;a=commitdiff;h=ff3c4f4c704977b2eec1dba1238b422537e413f3 - not sure if this counts as a “reference” --&gt;
* In [[Opera (browser)|Opera]] versions that use the Presto layout engine—i.e. up to and including version 12.xx—, enter the hexadecimal number of the desired symbol or character and then press {{keypress|Ctrl|Shift|x}} (alternative shortcut {{keypress|[[Meta key|Meta]]|Shift||x}} on [[macOS]]).
* In the [[Vim (text editor)|Vim editor]], in insert mode, the user first types {{keypress|Ctrl|V}} {{keypress|u}} (for codepoints up to 4 hex digits long; use {{keypress|Ctrl|V}} {{keypress|Shift|U}}  for longer), then types in the hexadecimal number of the symbol or character desired, and it will be converted into the symbol.  (On Microsoft Windows, {{keypress|Ctrl|Q}} may be required instead of {{keypress|Ctrl|V}}.&lt;ref name="vim_w32"&gt;[http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/gui_w32.html#mswin.vim Vim documentation: gui_w32]&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Unicode in HTML ==
{{main|Numeric character reference}}
[[Unicode and HTML|HTML]] uses a different syntax for code points. Character codes may be specified after ampersand (&amp;amp;) and the number sign (#), and are followed by the semicolon (;). The number can be either in [[decimal]] or in hexadecimal. Preceding zeros may be omitted. If the input is in hexadecimal, the number is preceded by an "x". Some characters can also be specified by [[Character entity reference|"entity name"]].&lt;br /&gt;
Example: The HTML code of the [[copyright sign]] © (&lt;code&gt;U+00A9&lt;/code&gt;) can be:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#169;&lt;/code&gt; (decimal input)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#xa9;&lt;/code&gt; (hexadecimal input)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;copy;&lt;/code&gt; (entity name)
 
====In Thunderbird====
The HTML option in the [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] Insert menu allows the insertion of Unicode characters using either decimal or hexadecimal values with the HTML syntax.  {{Code|&amp;#169;}}, {{Code|&amp;#xA9;}}, and {{Code|&amp;copy;}} each produces a '&amp;thinsp;©&amp;thinsp;'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5374">A '''walking audit''' is an assessment of the [[walkability]] or [[pedestrian]] access of an external environment.  Walking audits are often undertaken in [[street]] environments to consider and promote the needs of pedestrians as a form of transport.  They can be undertaken by a range of different stakeholders including:
*Local community groups
*Transport planners / engineers
*Urban designers
*Local police officers
*Local politicians / councilors

Walking audits often collect both [[Quantitative data|quantitative]] and [[qualitative data]] on the walking environment.

==Pedestrian Environment Review System==

The '''Pedestrian Environment Review System (PERS)''' is the most developed and widely used walking audit tool available.
PERS is “a systematic process to assess the pedestrian environment within a framework that promotes objectivity”.&lt;ref&gt;TRL (2009) PERS On-street Assessment Handbook&lt;/ref&gt;  The environment is reviewed from the end user perspective of a vulnerable pedestrian.  PERS consists of:
*An on-street audit process
*A GIS software package to consolidate, map and display results&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trlsoftware.co.uk/products/street_auditing/pers TRL PERS Software]&lt;/ref&gt;

A PERS walking audit collects both [[Quantitative data|quantitative]] and [[qualitative data]] on six types of facility in the street environment:
*Links (footways, footbridges, subways)
*Crossings
*Routes
*Public Transport Waiting Areas (bus stops, tram stops, taxi ranks)
*Public Spaces (parks and squares)
*Interchange Spaces (between different modes of transport)

Each facility is rated on a seven point scale (-3 to +3) for different parameters such as effective width, dropped kerbs, [[permeability (spatial and transport planning)|permeability]] or personal security.  PERS also rates disabled peoples access.  These PERS ratings are linked to Red/Amber/Green (RAG) colour-coding.  The PERS software allows users to analyse and display walkability data using GIS maps, charts and quick win recommendation lists.

PERS was originally developed in 2001 by [[Transport Research Laboratory|TRL]] and [[London Borough of Bromley]].  The software tool (PERS 1) was designed to allow transport professionals and community groups to quickly and cost-effectively assess and rate the walkability of local streets and recommend improvements for pedestrians.  This version of the tool assessed Links, Crossings and Routes.  In 2005 [[Transport for London]] and TRL co-developed PERS 2 which expanded the original system to include Public Transport Waiting Areas (PTWA), Public Spaces and Interchange Spaces.  In 2009 ransport for London and TRL further developed the tool into PERS 3 which included a built in GIS mapping tool and the ability to add photographs and [[georeference]]s of quick wins (low cost, easy to implement physical improvements).  PERS 3 also has the added functionality of automatically generate quick-win recommendation work lists for Highway work crews.

The PERS tool has been used by organisations all over the world and has been used extensively in London to assess over 200&amp;nbsp;km of the street network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walk21.com/papers/TfL%20TRL%20Walk21%20NYC%202009%20paper%20-%20Identifying%20and%20prioritizing%20walking%20investment%20through%20PERS%20audit%20tool.pdf Davies, A. and Clark, S. (2009) Identifying and prioritising walking investment through the PERS audit tool - Walk21 Proceedings, 10th International Conference for Walking, New York, USA, October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walk21.com/papers/Allen,%20David%20et%20al%20-New%20directions%20in%20street%20auditing.pdf Allen, D. and Clark, S. (2007) New Directions in Street Auditing: Lessons from the PERS Audits - Walk21 Proceedings, 8th International Conference for Walking, Toronto, Canada October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using walking audits to make a business case==

Research undertaken by the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]] (CABE) have used the PERS walking audit method to show:
"how we can calculate the extra financial value that good street design contributes, over average or poor design".&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110118095356/http:/www.cabe.org.uk/files/paved-with-gold.pdf CABE (2007) Paved with Gold]&lt;/ref&gt;

The study found a direct link between an increase in PERS scores (and therefore an increase in the quality of a street for pedestrians) and residential house prices.  The study demonstrates how PERS can be used to show how:
"clear financial benefits can be calculated from investing in better quality street design".&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110118095356/http:/www.cabe.org.uk/files/paved-with-gold.pdf CABE (2007) Paved with Gold]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Writing material''' refers to the materials that provide the surfaces on which humans use [[writing instruments]] to  inscribe writings. The same materials can also be used for [[symbol]]ic or [[Representation (arts)|representational]] [[drawing]]s. [[Building material]] on which writings or drawings are produced are not included. The gross characterization of writing materials is by the material constituting the writing surface (for example, [[paper]]) and the number, size, and usage and storage configuration of multiple surfaces (for example, paper sheets) into a single object (for example, a [[spiral notebook]]). Writing materials are often paired with specific types of writing instruments. Other important attributes of a writing material are its reusability, its permanence, and its resistance to fraudulent misuse.

==Archaeology==
Because drawing preceded writing, the first remains of writing materials are the [[Rock (geology)|stone]] walls of the caves on which the famous images were drawn. Another precursor were [[tally stick]]s used to record the count of objects or the passage of discrete units of time ([[days]]). Tally sticks have been found made of [[wood]] and of [[bone]]. Knotted ropes and similar materials were also used for tallies. Such materials did not take a great deal of preparation for their use for drawing or writing. Animal [[Hide (skin)|hides]] also had potential for use as a material for writing or drawing, although the drawings and writings may have been decorative or to convey status or religious meaning. Among the barks of trees, [[birch bark]] is very well suited for use as a writing material and was so used both in Northern Europe and among native peoples in North America.

Four other classes of material were sometimes used for writing: [[clay]], [[wax]], [[cloth]], and [[metal]]. The value of metal for useful implements may have made it less than useful for practical writing and drawing. The very hardness of many metals that made them useful also made it an inconvenient material for many kinds of writing. But foils or sheets of soft metals like lead were usable. Lead sheets were used for [[curse tablets]], as well as personal correspondence.

Cloth probably shared its mode of use with animal skins. Clay introduces the useful combination of extreme ease of making the inscription with the potential for rendering it fairly permanent. Unglazed pottery can readily accept inscription even after firing. Wax offers another novel combination of advantage: a reusable surface, easily inscribed and erased, and easy combination with materials like wood that give it durability. [[Stone tablets]], clay and wooden writing tablets, and [[Wax tablet|wax-covered wooden tablets]] are some of the first specialized configurations of materials in flat surfaces specifically for writing.

Unglazed pottery shards were used almost as a kind of scratch paper, as [[ostraka]], for tax receipts and, in Athens, to record the individual nominations of Greek leaders for [[ostracism]].

The archaeological record contains either examples of these materials used for drawing or writing or it has indirect indications of their use for writing, drawing, or tallying.

==Common writing materials of the Middle Ages==
In western civilisations, early use of [[papyrus]] was soon replaced by [[parchment]] made by treating animal hide. A wide variety of parchments from various animal skins, with different texture, quality and hue were widely used for codices, religious and cultural texts. This was replaced by the advent and increasing access and availability of [[paper]].

In eastern civilisations such as [[India]], the principal writing media were [[birch bark]] or ''bhurjapatra'' (Sanskrit) and [[palm leaf manuscript|dried palm leaves]]. The use of paper began only after the 10th century. However birch bark and palm leaf continue to be used even today on a limited scale in a rural milieu for the use of horoscopes, wedding invitations and other cultural uses.

In China, the early material was animal bones, later silk, [[bamboo and wooden slips]], until the 2nd century when [[paper]] was invented.

==History==
Writing seems to have become more widespread with the invention of [[papyrus]] in Egypt. [[Parchment]], using sheepskins left after the wool was removed for cloth, was sometimes cheaper than papyrus, which had to be imported outside Egypt. With the invention of [[wood-pulp paper]], the cost of writing material began a steady decline.

==Printing==
The dramatic increase in demand foray paper associated with the [[printing press]] stimulated dramatic cost reduction efforts. Specialized materials developed for printing have also been made available for writing. The invention of the [[typewriter]] was a major step, making possible reliable production of legible written materials by organizations and individual writers.

==Electronic media==
Electronic media have utilized the keyboard developed for the typewriter, electrical and electronic circuitry and storage devices, and the viewing screen developed for reading electronic signals to separate the medium for writing from the medium for reading.

'''Jánka Kupála''' (akas: '''Yanka Kupala''', '''Janka Kupała''', '''{{lang-be|Я́нка Купа́ла}}'''; {{OldStyleDate|July 7|1882|June 25}} – June 28, 1942) – was the [[pen name]] of '''Iván Daminíkavich Lutsévich''' ('''Ivan Daminikavič Łucevič''', {{lang-be|Іва́н Даміні́кавіч Луцэ́віч}}), a [[Belarus]]ian poet and writer. Kupala is considered one of the greatest Belarusian-language writers of the 20th century.

==Biography==
{{unsourced|section|date=February 2017}}
===Early life===
[[Image:Yanka Kupala's House.JPG|thumb|left|House where Janka Kupala was born ([[folwark]] [[Maladzyechna Raion|Viazynka]], [[Minsk district]], Belarus)]]
[[Image:Yanka Kupala in Saint Petersburg, 1909.jpg|thumb|left|Janka Kupala during his study under a professor A. Charniaev in [[Saint Petersburg]], 1909]]
Kupala was born on July 7, 1882 in [[Maladzyechna Raion|Viazynka]], a [[folwark]] settlement near [[Maladzyechna]]. His family was noble, although both of Kupala's parents were employed as tenant farmers at the folwark. Kupala was thus essentially born into a landless peasant class. Kupala received a traditional Belarusian education, completing his studies in 1898. Following the death of his father in 1902, Kupala worked a variety of short-term jobs, including as a tutor, a shop assistant, and a record keeper.

Kupala's first serious literary attempt was ''Ziarno'', a Polish-language sentimental poem which he completed around 1903–1904 under the pseudonym "K-a." His first Belarusian-language work ("Мая доля") was dated July 15, 1904. Kupala's first published poem, "Мужык" ("Peasant"), was published approximately a year later, appearing in Belarusian in the Russophone Belarusian newspaper ''Severo-Zapadnyi Krai'' (''Northwestern [[Krai]]'') on May 11, 1905. A number of subsequent poems by Kupala appeared in the Belarusian-language newspaper ''[[Nasha Niva]]'' from 1906 to 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.gov.by/eng/index.php?id=951386 Yanka Kupala: personality and work]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vilnius and St. Petersburg===
Kupala moved to [[Vilnius]] in 1908, where he continued with his career as a poet. The same year the first published collection of his poems, ''Жалейка'' (''The Little Flute'') brought on the ire of the czarist government, which ordered the book confiscated as an anti-government publication. The order for Kupala's arrest was revoked in 1909, but a second printing was again confiscated, this time by the local authorities in Vilnius. Kupala ceased working for the ''[[Nasha Niva]]'' in order to avoid ruining the reputation of the newspaper.

Kupala left for [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1909. The subsequent year saw the publication of several works, including the poem ''Адвечная песьня'' (''Eternal Song''), which appeared as a book in St. Petersburg in July 1910. ''Сон на кургане'' (''Dream on a Barrow'')– completed in August 1910 –symbolised the poor state of Kupala's Belarusian homeland. Kupala left St. Petersburg and returned to Vilnius in 1913. Among those influencing Kupala in the 1910s was [[Maxim Gorky]].

===During the Soviet period===
Kupala's writing changed to an optimistic tone following the [[October Revolution|Great October Revolution]] of 1917. Among Kupala's numerous translations into the Belarusian language were the internationalist-Marxist anthem ''[[The Internationale]]'' and an ancient epic poem [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]] (translated in 1921).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myslenedrevo.com.ua/en/Lit/S/SlovoPolkIgor.html|title=The tale of Igor's campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2011/11/03/slovo.html|title=Исполнилось 90 лет первому переводу "Слова о полку Игореве" на белорусский язык|author=Виктор Корбут|publisher= Российская газета|trans-title=the first translation of The Tale of Igor's Campaign into Belarusian was made 90 years ago|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Kupala maintained his connections with the [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] oriented nationalist emigres of the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], who exhorted that he join them in exile in [[Czechoslovakia]] during a trip abroad in 1927. At home, the newly established authorities considered him with some distrust–at times, criticism of Kupala in the press mounted insofar as Kupala's activities were regarded as too oriented around nationalism. This period stopped once Kupala printed a public letter of apology in the 1930s.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Kupala was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]] in 1941 for the poetry collection ''Ад сэрца'' (''From the Heart''). With the [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany]] in 1941, because of being very ill he moved to Moscow and then to [[Tatarstan]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Even from there he wrote poems supporting the [[Soviet partisans#Belarus|Belarusian partisans]] fighting against [[Nazi Germany]]. He died in Moscow in 1942, aged 59, having fallen down the stairwell in [[Hotel Moskva (Moscow)|Hotel Moskva]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} 
 
==Legacy==
[[File:Yanka Kupala monument in Ashdod - 2.jpg|thumb|A monument to Yanka Kupala in Ashdod, Israel]]
Kupala became recognised as a symbol of [[culture of Belarus]] during the Soviet era. A museum, organised in [[Minsk]] through the efforts of his widow in 1945, is the leading literary museum in Belarus. [[Hrodna State University]] was named after Yanka Kupala. There is also a [[Yanka Kupala Park|park]] named after him with a monument to the poet, a [[Yanka Kupala National Academic Theatre|theatre]] and a [[Minsk Metro|metro]] station ([[Kupalaŭskaja (Minsk Metro)|Kupalaŭskaja]]) named after him in [[Minsk]].

At the Arrow Park in [[Monroe, New York]] there is a monument of Yanka Kupala that was created by Belarusian sculptor Anatoly Anikeichik and architect Sergey Botkovsky. Since 1973 it is presented to the American Side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://un.mfa.gov.by/en/mission/news/df5a48b73098f554.html Flowers laid at Yanka Kupala monument in Arrow Park, Monroe, New York]&lt;/ref&gt; A monument to Kupala is placed on a square in the city of [[Ashdod]] in [[Israel]].
