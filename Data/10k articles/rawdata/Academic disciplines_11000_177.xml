'''Artificial neural membrane''' ('''ANM''') refers to a new class of functional structure developed through research adaptive and evolutionary neural networks and programmable materials.  The greatest interest in ANM structures surround their potential as [[open architecture]] environments for the integration of [[Micrometre|microscale]] and [[Nanometre|nanoscale]] devices.

Originally based on the [[Neurogenesis]] Algorithms developed by [[mathematician]] and engineering [[physicist]] Dr. P. A. Menges.  While working as a postdoctoral research associate at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], Dr. Menges became interested in thin film materials used in specialized sensors also referred to as smart skins.  After leaving the laboratory she established a computational method allowing networks to automatically embed or simulate on other networks based in functional materials. 

Artificial neural membrane technology development has been funded by the [[NASA]] Institute for Advanced Concepts, for application to flapping wing flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/abstracts/1121Menges.pdf |title=ARTIFICIAL NEURAL MEMBRANE FLAPPING WING |first=Pamela |last=Menges }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently [[Aerospace Research Systems, Inc]] – the agency that pioneered work in developing artificial neurons for use in control of multifunctional smart structures – is applying the technology to reusable launch vehicles.  Other applications include [[biotechnology]] processes, morphing aircraft and spacecraft, adaptive [[wind turbine|wind generators]], and [[artificial organ]]s.  Recent research also indicates that ANM systems may provide the first truly automated intentional or conceptual programming environment.  The ANM technology has been referred as being as significant as [[semiconductors]] in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Mike Tyers, Bobby-Joe Breitkreutz, and Chris Stark at the [[Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)|Mount Sinai Hospital]]. It strives to provide a comprehensive curated resource for all major [[model organism]] [[species]] while attempting to remove redundancy to create a single mapping of data. Users of The '''BioGRID''' can search for their [[protein]] or [[publication]] of interest and retrieve annotation, as well as curated data as reported, by the primary literature and compiled by in house large-scale curation efforts. The BioGRID is hosted in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], United States and is partnered with the [[Saccharomyces Genome Database]]. The BioGRID is funded by the [[BBSRC]], [[NIH]], and [[CIHR]]. BioGRID is a member of the [http://imex.sourceforge.net/ International Molecular Exchange Consortium] (IMEx).

==History==
The '''BioGRID''' was originally published and released as simply the [[General Repository for Interaction Datasets]]&lt;ref name="pmid12620108" /&gt; but was later renamed to the BioGRID&lt;ref name="pmid16381927" /&gt; in order to more concisely describe the project, and help distinguish it from several [[grid computing|GRID Computing]] projects with a similar name. Originally separated into [[organism]] specific databases, the newest version now provides a unified front end allowing for searches across several organisms simultaneously. The BioGRID was developed initially as a project at the [[Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] but has since expanded to include teams at the Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et en Cancérologie at the [[Université de Montréal]], the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at [[Princeton University]], and the Wellcome Trust Center for Cell Biology at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. The BioGRID's original focus was on curation of binary protein-protein and genetic interactions, but has expanded over several updates&lt;ref name="pmid16381927" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25428363" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23203989"&gt;

==Abstract==
The Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) is an open access database that houses genetic and protein interactions curated from the primary biomedical literature for all major [[model organism]] species and humans. {{As of|2014|09|01}},&lt;ref name="pmid25428363"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BioGRID contains 749,912 interactions as drawn from 43,149 publications that represent 30 model organisms. BioGRID data are freely distributed through partner model organism databases and meta-databases and are directly downloadable in a variety of formats. In addition to general curation of the published literature for the major model species, BioGRID undertakes themed curation projects in areas of particular relevance for biomedical sciences, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system and various human disease-associated interaction networks. BioGRID curation is coordinated through an Interaction Management System (IMS) that facilitates the compilation interaction records through structured evidence codes, phenotype ontologies, and gene annotation. The BioGRID architecture has been improved in order to support a broader range of interaction and post-translational modification types, to allow the representation of more complex multi-gene/protein interactions, to account for cellular phenotypes through structured ontologies, to expedite curation through semi-automated text-mining approaches, and to enhance curation quality control. Through comprehensive curation efforts, BioGRID now includes a virtually complete set of interactions reported to date in the primary literature for budding yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''), thale cress (''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''), and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5302">'''Biosocial Theory''' is a theory in [[behavioural science|behavioral]] and social science that describes [[personality disorder]]s and [[mental illness]]es and [[Mental disability (disambiguation)|disabilities]] as biologically-[[determinism|determined]] personality traits reacting to environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name=cloninger&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cloninger CR |title=A unified biosocial theory of personality and its role in the development of anxiety states |journal=Psychiatr Dev |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=167–226 |year=1986 |pmid=3809156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=matson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matson JL |title=Biosocial theory of psychopathology: a three by three factor model |journal=Appl Res Ment Retard |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=199–227 |year=1985 |pmid=3160305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biosocial Theory also explains the shift from evolution to culture when it comes to gender and mate selection. Biosocial Theory in motivational psychology identifies the differences between males and females concerning physical strength and reproductive capacity, and how these differences interact with expectations from society about social roles. This interaction produces the differences we see in gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1022784633|title=Motivation biological, psychological, and environmental|last=Lambert,|first=Deckers,|isbn=9781351713887|edition= 5th|location=New York|oclc=1022784633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
M. M. Linehan wrote in her 1993 paper, Cognitive–Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder that "the biosocial theory suggests that BPD is a disorder of [[Self-control|self-regulation]], and particularly of emotional regulation, which results from biological irregularities combined with certain dysfunctional environments, as well as from their interaction and transaction over time"&lt;ref name=cbtbpd&gt;Linehan, M. M. (1993a) Cognitive–Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1999 article published by [[McClean Hospital]] "DBT is based on a biosocial theory of personality functioning in which BPD is seen as a biological disorder of emotional regulation. The disorder is characterized by heightened sensitivity to emotion, increased emotional in-tensity [sic] and a slow return to emotional baseline. Characteristic behaviors and emotional experiences associated with BPD theoretically result from the expression of this biological dysfunction in a [[social environment]] experienced as invalidating by the borderline patient."&lt;ref name=promising&gt;Murphy, Elizabeth T., and Gunderson, John. [https://web.archive.org/web/19991014032825/http://www.mcleanhospital.org/psychupdate/psyupI-3.htm A Promising Treatment] for
Borderline Personality Disorder, [[McLean Hospital]] Psychiatic Update, January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex, Gender, and Mate Selection ==
The interaction between evolved sex differences of reproductive capacity and physical strength and experiences in society are stressed in this theory. Jealousy and differences in long-term mate selection between males and females are also explained by this theory. Evolutionary emphasis proposes that mate value preferences stay constant, but this is not entirely the case as differences and changes in those mate preferences among and across countries implies cultural influences. This shift from evolution to social cultural experiences is what is emphasized in Biosocial Theory. The important aspect of this theory is that women and men biologically have different roles – Men are physically stronger and bigger while women bear and nurse children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The differences between the biological sexes interact with societal expectations to form the assumptions that men should hold more power and status while women hold lesser roles in society. Because of this, psychological difference increases between males and females as they try to adjust to their biologically and culturally influenced social roles. The adjustment to expected social roles is based on a cost-benefit analysis that typical sex roles are more functional and satisfactory with less effort than those of non-typical sex roles. This implies that it is more beneficial if a man enters a male-dominated occupations and women should assume positions in female-dominated occupations. However, occupations in our society may be staffed equally well by both men and women, and societal views are constantly changing even though biological differences stay constant. Because of this, men and women may staff occupations in fields dominated by the other sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:NMMP dolphin with locator.jpeg|thumb|Bottlenose dolphin ([[Tursiops truncatus]]) of the NMMP on mineclearance operations, with locator beacon.]]
The '''Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute''' (BDRI) is a research and educational centre dedicated to the understanding and conservation of cetaceans and the marine environment in which they live. The Institute's BDRI centre was founded by the biologist Bruno Díaz López in [[Sardinia]], Italy in 2005. In 2014, the BDRI opened a new facility in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain. 

BDRI concentrates its efforts on research into [[dolphins]] because they are predators at the top of their [[food chain]], so their well-being provides an excellent indication of the health of the entire [[ecosystem]] on which they, and humans, depend. Whales and dolphins around the world are under threat from [[marine pollution]], [[over-fishing]], getting entangled in nets, [[whaling]] and uncontrolled tourism.

The BDRI is intended to contribute to the understanding and conservation of dolphins, expand the public's knowledge and concern for the marine environment, and add to the knowledge base of bottlenose dolphins through publications of collected and analysed field data. Using study techniques that neither harm nor seriously disturb the animals, the BRDI is currently engaged in the conduction of a long-term study about the ecology and behaviour of a bottlenose dolphin population, as well as collecting detailed information about their environment.

The BDRI has educational and research programmes aimed at providing extra support for scientists early in their careers, science students, local students and scientists from developing countries, including training
opportunities in the field, grants, and online and field courses.

==Significance of BDRI research projects==

Cetacean populations are affected by man's use of coastal waters, particularly by fisheries activities and habitat modification. BDRI research projects provide scientific data to assist environmental agencies in managing and conserving marine natural resources and to obtain fundamental knowledge about this behaviourally flexible and cosmopolitan species. Their programs are conducted under a Research Permit issued by the Department of Environment of the Galician Government as part of our cooperation with the national networking for the study of marine mammals (CEMMA).
Additional studies by the BDRI have also been conducted in Italy, Spain and Abu Dhabi to date.

===Previous and current BDRI research projects===

BDRI researchers address a wide range of questions to form a multi-dimensional picture of the marine mammals behaviour and ecology and its relationship to the rest of the planet, including human society. The BDRI research has a multidisciplinary approach where we currently focus on four main research projects:
 
- Cetacean distribution along Galician coast: Current studies by the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute BDRI research team principally focus on the cetacean species frequenting the inshore waters of the outer Arousa Firth, however, a new area like Galician coastal waters (north-west Spain) offers us to also take on new projects and a more diverse range of issues and species. These waters are characterized by high biodiversity and productive fisheries, supported by nutrient input due to upwelling. Twenty species of cetaceans have been recorded in Galician waters, of which the most abundant appear to be short-beaked common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. Other species present in the area include harbour porpoises, Risso’s dolphins and long-finned pilot whale. Conservation issues for cetaceans in Galician waters include interactions with fisheries, which may be a significant cause of mortality, overfishing, and oil spills. Hence, the information collected will inform conservation plans by identifying coastal areas of high importance to cetaceans. Wild bottlenose dolphins and humans frequenting the same small areas makes boat interaction more or less inevitable. BDRI researchers provided quantified data about bottlenose dolphin diving behaviour in the presence and absence of boats in Galicia. The data reported by BDRI researchers could be used to implement precautionary management proposals that take into account the potential effects of boat presence on dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Lopez, B., Shirai, J.A.; Bilbao Prieto, A. &amp; Méndez Fernández, P., 2008. "Diving activity of a solitary wild free ranging bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)". ''Journal of Marine Biological Association'' U.K.88(6): 1153-1157.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernal Shirai, J. A., Diaz Lopez, B., Méndez Fernández, P., Bilbao Prieto, A. &amp; Díaz da Silva, J.I., 2006. "Analysis of diving behaviour of a solitary male bottlenose dolphin in the inshore waters of Galicia (Spain)" 20th Annual Conference of the European Cetacean Society ECS 2006 - Gdynia, Polonia.&lt;/ref&gt;

- Behavioural ecology of dolphins and impact of human activities on their lives: Much of the research work is based upon repeat observations of individually-recognisable dolphins, providing data for a range of long-term and ongoing studies on the abundance, site fidelity, home range, social structure and behaviour of this population. The study of dolphins social structures defines an important class of ecological relationships between individuals and their nearby conspecifics. Common bottlenose dolphins live in fission–fusion societies within which individuals associate in small groups that change in composition, often on a daily or hourly basis. Fission–fusion societies limit the effect of within-unit competition through unit splits during periods of high competition, and they enhance cooperative effects through unit cohesion when the ecological costs of aggregating are low or benefits of sociality are high. Human activities can influence the distribution of food resources, which may promote the evolution of social organizations as a response to fluctuations in the costs of feeding competition. Therefore, fission–fusion societies present a good opportunity to examine the costs and benefits of association in dolphin populations affected by human use of coastal waters, especially by fisheries activities and habitat modification.
 
Individual-based studies focusing explicitly the variability of social unit structure in relation to anthropogenic factors are few. In this project, BDRI researchers will study the patterns of association of different populations of bottlenose dolphins (in Italy and Spain) and will describe the way in which their association behaviour is related to the way they respond to food patches created by human activities. BDRI researchers studied interactions between dolphins and [[gillnets]] along the north-eastern coast of Sardinia (Italy). Although dolphins benefit from taking fish entangled in gillnets, the association with gillnets is harmful because it exposes dolphins to additional risk. An observed annual estimate of the number of dolphins caught in gillnets was 3.54%. The extent of the estimated [[by-catch]] is worrisome in terms of the ability of bottlenose dolphins off Sardinia to sustain such an annual loss. The higher annual numbers of immature dolphins than adults dolphins caught in gillnets was related with a lack of experience together with and the tendency of immatures to play and/or to spend a lot of time scouting.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez et al 2013"&gt;Diaz Lopez B., Addis A., Fabiano, F., 2013.

BDRI's researchers have also examined the effects of aquaculture on marine fauna in general, and more specifically, the impacts of aquaculture on dolphins in different marine fin fish farms off the coast of Sardinia, Italy. One of the objectives of these studies was to determine the variables that influence the presence and abundance of dolphins in the fish farms area.&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2012"&gt;Díaz López B. , 2012.

Marine [[aquaculture]] and, in particular intensive fish farming, have shown a large expansion in most Mediterranean countries over the last ten years. To curb predation, many marine fish farms employ control methods which exclude, harass or remove predators. One such method, predator netting, creates a physical barrier that protects farmed fish from attacks by airborne and underwater predators. The incidental capture of [[marine mammals]] by commercial fisheries is often a controversial and emotive issue. A potential impact on marine mammals as a result of aquaculture interaction is death or injury through entanglement in gear. BDRI researchers carried out the first attempt in the Mediterranean basin to obtain information on encounter rate, group size and incidental capture of bottlenose dolphins in a marine fish farm. The regular occurrence of some dolphins suggests individual preferences for the fish farm area. The incidental bottlenose dolphin capture observed in large, loose predator nets is cause for concern, as it is questionable whether or not the bottlenose dolphins in the area can sustain incidental capture of this magnitude. The information gained from this study showed the necessity for further regulations to be established, both in the use of predator nets and management of marine fish farms.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez B 2008"&gt;Diaz Lopez B. and Shirai, J.A., 2008.

Assessing the consequences of fisheries and habitat modification with relatively obvious effects on marine predators can be difficult. BDRI researchers were the first to show how coastal fisheries and aquaculture are not only directly affecting marine predators but could also indirectly affect their social structure and behaviour. BDRI researchers suggest that the main management issues raised by their studies relates to the dolphins' habitat. The feeding opportunities for dolphins that are created by human activities have become part of their "way of life", part of their habitat requirements. When top predators display complex social responses to activities not directed at them, the task of studying all possible effects in the food chain can become even more challenging. Further work should focus on elucidating how human activities induce social and spatial changes in marine top predators.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez B 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Lopez B., Bunke, M. and Shirai, J.A., 2008.

BDRI researchers observed that the use of [[Underwater locator beacon|pinger]]s reduces dolphin mortality due to bycatch on gillnets. Definite proof that acoustic devices have a long-term effectiveness has not been found. The Dinner Bell and Habituation factors must be taken into consideration to test in future studies.&lt;ref&gt;Troncone, R., Diaz Lopez, B., Shirai, J.A.B., 2008.

Bottlenose dolphins living around coastal regions have received much attention due to their increased vulnerability of inhabiting areas where marine traffic is concentrated. [[Marine traffic]] has previously been observed to elicit responses in [[cetacean]] behaviours, but the cause and effects of these interactions has yet to be fully understood. BDRI's current study area of Aranci Bay, Sardinia, provides a unique insight into an area where the interactions of bottlenose dolphins and vessels remains largely unchecked. Our studies showed that the dolphins were surfacing less regularly in the presence of vessels and this response was further enhanced during vessel approaches. Moreover, by examining the influence of different types of vessel it was evident that the dolphins elicited a stronger response to tourist than fisheries vessels. The behaviour vessels display around the dolphins as well as speed, engine type and distance of approach were all factors that needed to be taken into consideration when analysing the changes observed. Research is contributing to a wider management scheme to ensure that marine traffic is monitored effectively when bottlenose dolphins are present.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, K., Diaz Lopez, B., and Shirai, J.A., 2007.

- Dolphins communication: [[Bioacoustics]] research provides important insights into animal behavior. Dolphins (family: Delphinidae) are an extremely vocal mammalian family and vocal communication plays an important role in mediating social interactions. Most BDRI studies of delphinid vocalizations have concentrated on bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (in the Mediterranean, Italy, and in the Atlantic Ocean, Spain) and T. aduncus (in the [[Persian Gulf]], Abu Dhabi, UAE). Until recently, communication behaviour had a limited role in conservation, being restricted to enhancing captive breeding programs or use in species counts. However, knowledge of how individuals within a population communicate can generate information ranging from measures of habitat use, social relevance, geographical variation, cultural transmission, etc., that can be applied to conservation. Marine mammals use sound for activities essential to survival and reproduction. Bottlenose dolphins are extremely vocal mammalian species, and vocal communication plays an important role in mediating social interactions. Amid the abundant literature pertaining to vocalizations of bottlenose dolphins, very little is known about the vocal repertoire of Mediterranean wild bottlenose dolphins. BDRI bioacoustical studies carried out year round from 2005 represent the first attempt to obtain information on the repertoire and production patterns of bottlenose dolphins resident in an area characterized by important interaction with human activities (tourism, aquaculture and coastal fisheries). Many vocal signals were strongly implicated in social and feeding interactions. Although many of these vocalizations have been previously described in the literature, their association with specific behaviours linked with human activities provides additional contextual information about their potential use as communication signals. One of BDRI's most recent projects shows that the number of whistles recorded in a group increased significantly as the number of mother-calf pairs increased, confirming that whistles may be used as contact calls. These studies use benign techniques to demonstrate the great diversity of communication signals emitted and indicate a functional role of these vocalizations during the observed behaviours.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2008"&gt;Diaz Lopez, B and Shirai, J.A., 2008. "Whistles characteristics and repertoire of wild bottlenose dolphins in Sardinia Island, Italy". RIMMO 16 ème Conférence Internationale sur les Cétacés en Méditerranée, Nice France, 15 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2011"&gt;Díaz López B., 2011. "Whistle characteristics in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Mediterranean Sea: influence of behaviour". Mammalian Biology 76: 180-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Cetaceans (dolphins, whales and porpoises) are often faced with the challenge of hearing strange sounds in environments with noise from both natural and anthropogenic sources. BDRI researchers have documented that human-introduced noise induces behavioural reactions in bottlenose dolphins. In addition noise pollution is being considered as a cause of displacement of cetaceans from preferred habitats. Short-term noise pollution may not create significant problems. Repeated or long-term noise pollution, however, can cause stress and debilitation and may be related to dolphin mortality. Related scientific publications:&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2008"/&gt;

- Dolphins in the [[Persian Gulf]]: At least ten species of cetacean have been identified in the Persian Gulf, but most of these are considered vagrant or seasonal visitor. Only two species of dolphin, the Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) are thought to be common residents of the Gulf. The finless porpoise (Neophocoena phocaenoides) is thought to be an uncommon resident.

The conservation status of these species in Abu-Dhabi waters is totally unknown, largely because of the lack of research on either species. The world conservation status of these species is Data Deficient, that is, there is insufficient information on which to make an assessment. This deficiency hampers conservation and management efforts and our ability to assess the impact of human activities on local populations of this species.

BDRI researchers participate in cooperation with the Environmental Agency of Abu Dhabi since 2014, for the first time in Abu Dhabi waters, in a research project in order to obtain accurate data on population estimate, distribution, potential threats and residence patterns of dolphin species observed in coastal waters of Abu-Dhabi (UAE). The final purpose of this project is to inform and improve the design of conservation and management interventions towards these species in Abu-Dhabi waters.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz López B, and Methion S, 2015. "Abundance estimate, distribution and use of habitat of dolphin species in Abu-Dhabi waters during the summer and winter 2014". Final report - Environment Agency Abu Dhabi, EA. March 2015. 148pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== BDRI Environmental policy==
As a marine science research team, BDRI researchers have witnessed first hand the effects [[global warming]] and [[climate change]] have on our planet. Every year new tropical species are catalogued in north Sardinia as having arrived from tropical waters as an effect of global warming, and entire ecosystems are being affected. BDRI researchers are committed to the implementation of proactive measures to help protect and sustain the local and global environment for future generations. The BDRI aims to achieve the objective of improved environmental performance through pollution prevention and continuous improvement. All BDRI members, workers and volunteers are expected to conduct their work in a manner compatible with the BDRI's Responsible Travel policy and objectives.

'''Bruce Manning Metzger''' (February 9, 1914 – February 13, 2007) was an American [[biblical scholar]], [[Bible translator]] and [[textual critic]] who was a longtime professor at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] and Bible editor who served on the board of the [[American Bible Society]] and [[United Bible Societies]]. He was a scholar of Greek, [[New Testament]], and New Testament textual criticism, and wrote prolifically on these subjects. Metzger is one of the most influential New Testament scholars of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="NYT2007"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Margalit Fox]] |title=Bruce Metzger, Scholar and Bible Translator, Dies at 93 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/16/obituaries/16metzger.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130728083543/http://www.pres-outlook.com/news-and-analysis3/1-news-a-analysis/4073.html New Testament Scholar and Bible Translator Bruce Metzger Dies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncccusa.org/news/070214metzger.html|title=Bruce Metzger dies at 93|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/3831/20130820184059/http://www.ncccusa.org/news/070214metzger.html|archivedate=August 20, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Metzger was born in [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown, Pennsylvania]], and earned his BA (1935) at [[Lebanon Valley College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.ptsem.edu/index.aspx?id=25769807030|title=A Centennial Tribute to Bruce Metzger: Remembering His Achievements, Influence, and Legacy|date=24 January 2014|publisher=Princeton Seminary|accessdate=12 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209021650/http://ptsem.edu/index.aspx?id=25769807030|archivedate=February 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzger had strong academic training in Greek before enrolling in Princeton Seminary, and in the summer prior to entering the Seminary, he completed reading through the entire Bible consecutively for the twelfth time.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Manning Metzger, ''Reminiscences of an Octogenarian'' (1997), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Bachelor of Theology|ThB]] in 1938 at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], and in the autumn of 1938 began teaching at Princeton as a [[Fellow|Teaching Fellow]] in [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]]. On April 11, 1939, he was [[ordination|ordained]] in the [[United Presbyterian Church of North America]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Manning Metzger, ''Reminiscences of an Octogenarian'' (1997), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; which has since merged and is now known as the [[PCUSA|Presbyterian Church (USA)]]. In 1940, he earned his [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[Princeton University]] and became an instructor in [[New Testament]]. Two years later, he earned his PhD ("Studies in a Greek Gospel Lectionary ([[Lectionary 303|Greg. 303]])"), also from Princeton University.

In 1944, Metzger married Isobel Elizabeth Mackay, daughter of the third president of the Seminary, [[John A. Mackay]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Manning Metzger, ''Reminiscences of an Octogenarian'' (1997), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he was promoted to Assistant Professor. In 1948, he became Associate Professor, and full Professor in 1954. In 1964, Metzger was named the George L. Collord Professor of New Testament Language and Literature. In 1971, he was elected president of both the [[Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas]] and the [[Society of Biblical Literature]]. The following year, he became president of the North American Patristic Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patristics.org/about/|title=About - NAPS – The North American Patristics Society|first=NAPS – The North American Patristics|last=Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzger was visiting fellow at [[Clare Hall, Cambridge]] in 1974 and [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] in 1979. In 1978 he was elected corresponding fellow of the [[British Academy]], the Academy's highest distinction for persons who are not residents in the United Kingdom. At the age of seventy, after teaching at Princeton Theological Seminary for a period of forty-six years, he retired as Professor [[Emeritus]]. In 1994, Bruce Metzger was honoured with the Burkitt Medal for Biblical Studies by the [[British Academy]]. He was awarded [[honorary doctorate]]s from [[Lebanon Valley College]], the [[University of Findlay|Findlay College]], the [[University of St Andrews]], the [[University of Münster]] and [[Potchefstroom Campus|Potchefstroom University]]. "Metzger's unrivaled knowledge of the relevant languages, ancient and modern; his balanced judgment; and his painstaking attention to detail won him respect across the theological and academic spectrum."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Moorhead, ''Princeton Seminary in American Religion and Culture'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2012): 434.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative evangelical scholar [[Daniel B. Wallace]] described Metzger as "a fine, godly, conservative scholar, although his view of biblical authority is not quite the same as many other evangelicals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bible.org/article/inerrancy-and-text-critical-problem-romans-51|title=Inerrancy and the  Text-Critical Problem in Romans 5:1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his 93rd birthday, Metzger died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. He was survived by his wife Isobel and their two sons, John Mackay Metzger and James Bruce Metzger.

==Books and commentaries==
[[File:Kurt Aland - Amrican Bibl Society.jpg|left|thumb|Metzger, Aland, Wikgren, Black&lt;!-- Who is the figure to Metzger's right? There are clearly five people in this photo. --&gt;]]

Metzger edited and provided commentary for many Bible translations and wrote dozens of books. He was an editor of the [[United Bible Societies]]' standard Greek New Testament, the starting point for nearly all recent New Testament translations. In 1952, he became a contributor to the [[Revised Standard Version]] (RSV) of the Bible, and was general editor of the [[Revised Standard Version#Adaptations of the RSV|''Reader's Digest Bible'']] (a condensed version of the RSV) in 1982. From 1977 to 1990, he chaired the Committee on Translators for the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (NRSV) of the Bible and was "largely responsible for ... seeing [the NRSV] through the press."&lt;ref name="SBL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=638|title=SBL Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it a privilege to present the NRSV—which includes the books referred to as [[Apocrypha]] by Protestants, though [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] consider them [[deuterocanonical]]—to [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Patriarch Demetrius I of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;

Central to his scholarly contribution to New Testament studies is his trilogy: ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'' (1964; 2nd ed., 1968; 3d enlarged ed., 1992); ''The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission, and Limitations'' (1977); ''The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;James A. Brooks, "Bruce Metzger as Textual Critic," ''Princeton Seminary Bulletin'', vol. 15, no. 2, new series (1994), 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume of a series that he founded and edited, ''New Testament Tools and Studies,'' appeared in 1960.

Metzger's commentaries often utilize [[historical criticism]] and [[higher criticism]], which attempt to explain the literary and historical origins of the Bible and the [[biblical canon]]. For instance, Metzger argues that the early church which assembled the New Testament did not consider [[biblical inspiration|divine inspiration]] to be a sufficient criterion for a book to be placed in the canon.{{dubious|reason=That this was Metzger's view is not in dispute, but isn't this a generally accepted "given" in historical scholarship on the formation of the canon? That's how it's treated by Dale Martin (https://cosmolearning.org/video-lectures/from-stories-to-canon-6796/), who attributes the idea that "inspiration" is an important criterion to "modern people", apparently implying that this is a modern misconception on the part of Christian popular culture, but was Metzger the progenitor of the idea that inspiration WASN'T the most important criterion? If not, it probably doesn't belong in this article, or should not be written the way it is so as to imply that other scholars disagree or disagreed with this view. The quotation provided in the citation for the following sentence, if that is all there is to it, indicates that associating this idea specifically with Metzger is indeed a weak form of OR. The cited source was published late in Metzger's life, only 12 years before the Martin lecture cited above.|date=September 2016}} Metzger says that the early church saw it as very important that a work describing Jesus' life be written by a follower of or an eyewitness to Jesus, and considered other works such as [[Shepherd of Hermas|''The Shepherd'' of Hermas]] and the ''[[Epistles of Clement (disambiguation)|Epistles of Clement]]'' to be inspired but not canonical.&lt;ref&gt;"The Fathers … did not consider inspiration to be a unique characteristic of canonical writings." Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Canon of the New Testament'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997), 256, and see 211, n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the canon, Metzger identifies three criteria “for acceptance of particular writings as sacred, authoritative, and worthy of being read in services of worship…”, criteria which were “generally adopted during the course of the second century, and were never modified thereafter”, namely, orthodoxy (conformity to the rule of faith), apostolicity, and consensus among the churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The New Testament: Its Background, Growth, and Content'', 3rd ed., rev. and enlarged (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2003), 317–8. And see the detailed discussion in Metzger, ''The Canon of the New Testament'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997), 251–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that, “In the most basic sense neither individuals nor councils created the canon; instead they came to recognize and acknowledge the self-authenticating quality of these writings, which imposed themselves as canonical upon the church.”&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The New Testament: Its Background, Growth, and Content'', 3rd ed., rev. and enlarged (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2003), 318. Also see Metzger, ''The Canon of the New Testament'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997), 287–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''C. G. Jung Institute, Zürich''' (German: '''C. G. Jung-Institut Zürich''') was founded in [[Küsnacht]], [[Switzerland]], in 1948 by the psychiatrist [[Carl Gustav Jung]], the founder of [[Analytical psychology]] (more commonly called Jungian psychology). [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] and [[Jolande Jacobi]] were also active in the foundation and early work of the institute.

The institute was founded in 1948 to provide training and conduct research in Analytical psychology and [[psychotherapy]]. Jung led the institute until 1961, the year of his death. The library of the institute holds around 15,000 books and periodicals related to [[Jungian psychology]].

Several other organizations named the C.G. Jung Institute exist around the world, e.g. in [[Los Angeles]].

'''Chabot Space and Science Center''', located in [[Oakland, California]], is a hands-on center featuring interactive exhibits, a digital [[planetarium]], a large screen theater, hands-on activities and three powerful [[telescopes]].

The Center is the continuation and expansion of a [[public observatory]] that has served [[San Francisco Bay Area]] schools and citizens with [[astronomy]] and [[science]] education programs since 1883. It is named after the father of [[hydraulic mining]] and benefactor of the original Oakland Observatory, [[Anthony Chabot]]. Since 2000, the Center has been located on the western border of Redwoods Regional Park.

==History==
[[Image:Chabot SSC front.jpg|thumbnail|left|The sign at the entrance of the Chabot Space and Science Center.]]

The institution began in 1883 as the Oakland Observatory, through a gift from [[Anthony Chabot]] to the City of Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabotspace.org/aboutus/ |title=Chabot Space &amp; Science Center (CSSC) educates students of all ages on Planet Earth and the universe |accessdate=August 19, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815021228/http://www.chabotspace.org/aboutus/ |archivedate=August 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Oakland Observatory was located in [[downtown Oakland]] and provided public telescope viewing for the community. For decades, it also served as the official timekeeping station for the entire Bay Area, measuring time with its [[transit telescope]].

The observatory moved to its Mountain Boulevard location in 1915 due to increasing [[light pollution]] and urban congestion. In the mid-1960s, the facility was expanded considerably. Throughout this time, the Chabot Science Center, as it was renamed, was staffed mainly by Oakland Unified School District personnel and volunteers. In 1977, seismic safety concerns terminated public school students’ access to the original observatory facility. The observatory building remained open to the general public, but school activities were limited to outlying classroom buildings and the planetarium.

[[File:Wightman Observatory Plaza at Chabot Space and Observatory Center.jpg|thumbnail|Wightman Observatory Plaza at the current location.]]

Recognizing the need to restore full access to the facility, either by repair or relocation, in 1989 Chabot Observatory &amp; Science Center was formed as a Joint Powers Agency with the City of Oakland, the Oakland Unified School District, and the East Bay Regional Park District, in collaboration with the [http://www.eastbayastro.org Eastbay Astronomical Society], and in 1992 was recognized as a nonprofit organization. The project was led by Chabot's Executive Director and CEO, Dr. [[Michael D. Reynolds]], breaking ground for the facility in October 1996 with construction of the new {{convert|88000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Science Center beginning in May 1998.

In January 2000, anticipating the opening of the new facility, the organization changed its name from Chabot Observatory &amp; Science Center to Chabot Space &amp; Science Center. The new name was chosen to better convey the organization's focus on astronomy and the [[space sciences]], while communicating both the broad range and the technologically advanced nature of programs available in the new Science Center.

Opened August 19, 2000, the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center is an {{convert|86000|sqft|m2|sing=on}}, state-of-the-art science and technology education facility on a {{convert|13|acre|m2|sing=on}} site in the hills of Oakland, California. The museum was formerly an affiliate in the [[Smithsonian Affiliations]] program.&lt;ref name="Chabot"&gt;{{cite web|year=2011|title=Chabot Space and Science Center|work=Affiliate Details|publisher=Smithsonian Affiliations|url=http://affiliations.si.edu/AffiliateDetail.Asp?AffiliateID=17|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is currently no longer an affiliate.

''Cosmos 360''  uses the planetarium's digital [[fulldome]] system to view the night sky as well as flying through space to see the universe from a different perspective. The guided tour include in-depth views of planets, constellations and other current astronomical events. The show is updated to reflect seasonal night skies.

*'''Daily Shows:'''
The daily shows range from content geared for young children through more sophisticated shows designed for a general audience.

A complete schedule and listing of daily shows as well as current show times can be found at the center's [http://www.chabotspace.org/planetarium-shows.htm planetarium page].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabotspace.org/planetarium-shows.htm Chabot's Planetarium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Retrieved August 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galaxy Explorers program==
The Chabot Space and Science Center offers volunteer and educational opportunities to local teens, who work as explainers on the museum floor or on outreach trips. The program was initiated by a grant from ''YouthALIVE!'' (Youth Achievement through Learning Involvement, Volunteer and Employment!) through the Association of Science-Technology Centers.

Bilateral symmetry is a dominant aspect of our world and strong representation of it with matching figures often creates a balance that is appealing in artwork.

In ancient art, confronted-animal motifs often involve the [[Master of Animals]], a central human figure between two confronted animals, often grasping them, and are probably part of a unified [[sociology|socio-]][[culture|cultural]] motif. A related motif in ancient art is known as the [[Mistress of Animals]].

It is thought that the [[iconography]] sometimes has [[ritual]] and religious associations; for example, the Lion Gate of [[Mycenae]] has a column between the protective, surmounted and confronted lionesses standing with two feet on the ground and two on the same base on which the column rests. The column is thought to represent a goddess, abstracted to avoid [[taboo]]ed direct representation.  Alternatively, the column has also been interpreted as symbolizing the entrance to the palace.  The lions are thus guarding the entrance to the palace and the walled fortification simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/4306/1/The_Lion_Gate_Relief.pdf|title=The Lion Gate Relief at Mycenae Reconsidered (PDF)|last=Shaw|first=Maria C.|date=1986|website=TSpace (University of Toronto), Archaeological Society of Athens, Greece|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif called the [[Tree of Life]], where two confronted animals graze on a shrub or tree, is also very ancient.

==Gebel el-Arak Knife==

The reverse side of the [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] handle, displayed at the top of the article, shows two powerful confronted lions, separated by a figure who is grasping them. Of note, the knob on the reverse shows the top end of the hole for a cord or rope, on the suspension [[lug (knob)|lug]]; this knife may have been worn around the neck ceremonially.

==Examples from archaeology==

===Cylinder seals===

[[Image:Uruk3000BCE.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Cylinder seal]] of [[Uruk]] displaying a confronted-lioness motif sometimes described as a ''"[[serpopard]]"'' - 3000 BC - [[Louvre]]]]
Examples of confronted animals exist on [[Cylinder seal]]s from [[Mesopotamia]]. [[deity|Deities]], or [[hero]]es grasping lionesses, cattle, [[griffin]]s, or other, imaginary creatures are sometimes found.

Many cylinder seals involving confronted [[goat]]s surrounding a central [[Tree of life]] on a 'cone' or 'mountain' platform share one common theme. Others may be thought of as deities holding the animals under their control.

Because cylinder seals are numerous and also come from [[prehistory|pre-historical]] periods, back to the [[4th millennium BC|fourth]] or [[5th millennium BC]], themes are varied. Another Tree of life type of confronted animals cylinder seal has a "hero grasping water buffalo" and a "bull-man grasping lions", each between the animals; again, the central figure is the "Tree-of-Life" that often is interpreted as representing a goddess.

===Confronted snakes===
[[Image:Snake Goddess Crete 1600BC.jpg|thumb|Figure from [[Crete]], holding confronted snakes, dated 1600 BC. ]]
Confronted [[serpent (symbolism)|snake]]s are frequent images in many cultures from ancient times to historical periods. Often associated with religious ceremonies and deities, perhaps the most familiar figure known popularly from ancient times is the deity or priestess of Crete depicted holding up two confronted snakes on either side of her.

A [[chlorite]] vessel [http://www.nyu.edu/classes/wright/Fall03/ChloriteVase2.jpg] from the area of contemporary [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] is displayed at this link. It depicts three pairs of confronted animals. Two confronted [[snakes]] are being held in the hands of the central figure; below the snake-pair are a pair of ''anti-confronted-lionesses'' (although they turn their heads to face each other their hind quarters are closely confronted), recumbent. The third similar pair of animals on this item are two anti-confronted bovines with a human or deity between also. Two tumbling lions and other animals are depicted to the right.

===Narmer Palette===
[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|thumb|left|Narmer Palette with confronted lionesses, displayed in iconographic [[register (sculpture)|register]]s - ''Ancient Egypt c. 3,000 BC'']]
The [[Narmer Palette]], used to mix cosmetics in the receptacle on one side, has two confronted [[Felidae|felines]], sometimes called [[serpopard]]s (because of their exaggerated long necks which look snakelike to some researchers) forming the receptacle. Close examination of the animals with the exaggerated, long necks supports identification as [[lion]]esses. The entire theme of the Narmer Palette, is about the [[pharaoh]] of the newly unified [[Ancient Egypt]] represented in two scenes, (palette ''obverse'', palette ''reverse''). On one side the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Upper Egypt]] and on the other, the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Lower Egypt]]. Thus, it is thought that the lionesses with their intertwining necks are representing two kingdoms, once separate, but now unified under one pharaoh. The lioness [[Bastet|Bast]] had been the protective deity of one kingdom and the lioness [[Sekhmet]] of the other kingdom, equally important deities in each of the early [[Egyptian pantheon]]s. Respectively, they were the special protectors of the pharaoh in each kingdom, who persisted as deities throughout the long history of unified [[Ancient Egypt]]. Eventually their roles diverged, however, with one becoming less of the protector and warrior deity and assigned other roles. Typically, many similar deities in the two kingdoms soon were merged, so the retention of both is thought to be the result of the long and strong tradition of each.

Examples of other confronted animals exist on many [[cosmetic palette]]s of Ancient Egypt that have been discovered.  One palette has confronted-[[hippopotamus]]es; others include giraffes, geese, and other animals familiar to the Egyptians. Bilaterally depicted [[palm tree]]s also are known as well on palettes.

===Mycenae Lion Gate===
[[Image:Mycenae lion gate detail dsc06384.jpg|thumb|225px|The Mycenae "Lion Gate" (detail) with two [[lion]]esses or lions that flank a central column|alt=]]
The gate to the citadel of [[Mycenae]] is shown to the right. It crowned the major entrance gateway to the ancient citadel that was the centre of the culture, [[Mycenaean Greece]], that predated that of [[Greece]], and is a well-known example of two confronted lionesses. Debate exists in research of this image, questioning whether these are leopards or lionesses confronted with a column between them that represents the deity, but the characteristic tufts at the end of the tails confirm the species. Many images of lioness related deities are depicted with heavier manes than typical for lionesses, but that may have been the result of attempts to interpretation of the species or, unfamiliarity with the atypical [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] differences within this feline species.  Alternatively, George Mylonas believed lions were depicted, not lionesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mycenae and the Mycenaean Age|last=Mylonas|first=George|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0691035239|location=|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greek herald's staffs (kerykeia)===

In ancient Greece, heralds functioning as private messengers or public criers were referred to as ''kerykes''. The ''keryx'' has functions in political, military, judicional and religious matters. He was identified by his attribute, the herald's staff or ''kerykeion'', in Latin ''caduceus''. The attribute also offered him protection. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, also carries a ''kerykeion''. Kerykeia were often donated to temples by private persons and on state occasions. They are also found in herald's graves, and identify the profession of the buried person.

===Etruscan tomb mural===

{{Main|Tomb of the Leopards}}
Confronted leopards appear in a tomb found in Tarchuna ([[Tarquinia]]), or Tarchna Tarchnal, the chief of the [[Etruscan cities|twelve cities]] of [[Etruria]], a district in what is described as the [[Etruscan civilization]] that existed in Italy from 1200 BC through the 100 BC. It appears in the earliest history of [[Rome]], which was dominated by it until early in the 330s BC. This mural features confronted [[leopard]]s providing protection for a banquet in the afterlife. Frequently felines, lionesses and leopards such as these are confronted with a tree, shrub, or column between them in murals from this culture. The Etruscans are thought to have migrated from the area of Troy,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} through Greece where they absorbed many cultural elements, to Italy where they founded their culture in prehistoric times.

In Europe, confronted animals are an important motif in [[animal style]], or [[zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] decoration, [[Insular art]], and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]. In these contexts there may be little or nothing between the two animals, and the emphasis is on the pair themselves.  Human figures are often treated in the same way, often mixed in with animals in decorative schemes - [[Archery|archer]]s were especially popular in the Romanesque period.

The early [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[ship burial]] found in contemporary Great Britain at [[Sutton Hoo]], from the seventh century AD, contains famous examples of [[Migration Period art]].  The [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid]] has three stylized confronted-animal pairs; the two side pairs, left and right, are identical, and have the animals in the person's clutched grasp. The central confronted animals are even more complex in theme.

Opposed animals are used in [[Insular art]], the style of which is derived from a mixture of [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and northern European design traditions. Confronted animals, or animals intertwined in very intricate patterns, often depicted grabbing at each other to form the "gripping beast" pattern, are a main feature of some periods of [[Viking art]]. So intertwined are the animals, they are dissolved into pure ornament, and the individuals are barely discernable from each other.  Confronted animals are also frequently seen in European [[Romanesque art]], for example as decorative patterns in [[Romanesque architecture]].

[[Supporters (heraldry)|Supporters]] in [[heraldry]], not always a matched pair, continue the theme.

===Asian art===

====Luristan bronzes, Anatolian "animal" carpets====
{{See also|Early Anatolian Animal carpets|Luristan bronze}}

Confronted-animal motifs are found extensively in Asian art and in textiles, including [[Oriental rug|rug]]s, across [[Eurasia]].

Few examples still exist of a special type of Oriental [[Oriental rug|carpet]], termed "animal carpets" because their main feature are confronted animals. Dated to the 13th–16th century, they represent carpets woven during the transition period between the late [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuq]] and the early [[Ottoman empire]]. Parallels were shown between the "opposed animal" and "latch-hook" motifs from woven pile rugs and the [[Lorestān bronze]]s.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are [[Early Iron Age]] [[bronze]] artifacts of various individual forms which have been recovered from [[Lorestān Province|Lorestān]] and [[Kermanshah]] areas in west-central [[Iran]].

Carpet fragments discovered in [[Konya]] and [[Beyşehir]] in Turkey, and [[Fustat|Fostat]] in Egypt were dated to the 13th century, which corresponds to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R.

A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between phoenix and dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet now displayed at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin, and radiocarbon dated to the mid 15th century. The Chinese motif was probably introduced into Islamic art by the Mongols during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="Dragon and Phoenix carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon and Phoenix Carpet|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;de;Mus01;34;de|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another animal carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt;

Since 1988, seven more carpets of the animal type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large confronted animals, each with a smaller animal inside. An almost complete animal carpet is now at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]].

"Animal carpets" were also depicted in Italian paintings of the 14th and 15th century, and thus represent the earliest Oriental carpets shown in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance paintings]].

===Native North American Art===
[[File:Powhatan's mantle, lithography 1888.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of Powhatan's Mantle]]
"Powhatan's Mantle" is a cloak of [[deerskin]], which originally belonged to a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] of high social status. Its decoration consists of shell beadwork, depicting a central standing human figure flanked by two upright, opposed quadrupeds and surrounded by 34 discs. The two animals resemble one another in terms of their overall outline, but their tails and paws differ. The left-hand animal has a long tail and round paws with five articulated digits. The right-hand animal has a shorter tail, and its legs end in cloven hoofs. Historically, this artwork was believed to have belonged [[Powhatan]], who was the [[paramount chief]] of [[Tsenacommacah]], an [[Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom|alliance]] of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] [[Virginia Indians]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] at the time English settlers landed at [[History of the Jamestown Settlement (1607–1699)|Jamestown]] in 1607. "Powhatan's Mantle" is one of the earliest North American artifacts to be collected by Europeans that still survives today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/amulets/tradescant/tradescant07-13.html "Powhatan's Mantle"] at the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of herbaria''' includes the preventative care, repair, and restoration of [[herbarium]] specimens. This is performed by [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[curator]]s, and [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] on herbarium collections in universities and museums. Herbarium specimens may be susceptible to [[water damage]], [[mold]], [[Pest (organism)|pests]], unattached specimens, [[dust]] and [[dirt]], and damage from improper storage conditions. [[Collections care|Preventative conservation]] can prevent much of the damage that could occur.

==Herbarium==
A herbarium is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens and associated data used for scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a herbarium|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/herbarium/what-is-a-herbarium|website=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specimens may be whole plants or plant parts. These will usually be dried and pressed and mounted on a sheet of paper but, depending upon the material, may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservative.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Conserve O Gram - Preparing and Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=November 2009|website=National Park Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of specimens ===
* '''Pressed and dried:''' [[Vascular plant]] (flowering plants, [[conifer]]s, [[fern]]s) specimens are pressed and dried plants that are mounted on herbarium sheets. Various techniques are used to attach the plants with the most common method using archival adhesive and, if necessary, heavier portions of the plant are supported additionally by [[linen]] thread or narrow strips of gum-backed linen tape or polyester film (Mylar). If there are loose [[seed]]s or [[fruit]]s, these are placed in a small fragment packet, which also is glued to the sheet. A label with collection information is glued on the bottom right corner. 
* '''Dried:''' Small [[bryophyte]]s ([[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|hepatics]] or liverworts, and [[hornwort]]s) are dried and placed loose in folded packets. The label is glued on the front of the packet and the packets are filed loose in boxes, glued to sheets of mounting paper, or placed loose in folders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Causes of deterioration==

===Pests===
Common herbarium pests include:[[File:Silverfish 2007-2.jpg|thumb|Silverfish]]
*[[Silverfish]] 
* [[Psocoptera|book lice (psocids)]]
* [[Lasioderma|cigarette or tobacco beetles (Lasioderma]])
* [[Dermestidae|dermestids]]
* [[Drugstore beetle|drugstore beetles (Stegobium paniceum)]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
A reoccurring threat to the longevity of herbarium specimens is insects, a number of which find dried plants palatable. Historically, various methods have been used to kill insects, which either come in with the plants when they are collected or are in the building where the plants are stored.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bio.cgrer.uiowa.edu/herbarium/HerbariaAndSpecimens.htm#driedplants|title=Herbaria and Specimens: What Are They?|last=Horton|first=Diana|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pests are commonly treated with two different methods:
* '''Freezing:''' the specimen is placed inside a clear [[polyester]] bag with excess air pushed out and heat sealed, or place inside polythene bags and sealed with parcel tape. Then it is placed into a normal domestic freezer for at least 14 days at a temperature of −18&amp;nbsp;°C, or for 72 hours if freezing at -30&amp;nbsp;°C.
* '''Anoxia:''' this method starves the pests of oxygen. Small anoxic environments are created using sealed barrier films and placing [[oxygen scavenger]]s and [[RH buffer]]s inside before sealing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_botanical_specimens.pdf|title=Care and conservation of botanical specimens|last=|first=|date=2013|website=The Institute of Conservation (Icon) and Natural Sciences Collections Association (NatSCA)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Integrated Pest Management (for museums)|integrated pest management]] program is cost-effective over time and the best preventative measure against pests.

===Fungal attack===
The primary risk factor for [[Mold|fungal]] attack is incomplete drying of specimens, caused either during the specimen preparation process or afterwards, or in collections that become wet later through [[flood]], other water damage or improper storage conditions, especially in the [[tropics]]. Properly dried plant specimens will not suffer from fungal attack if stored in the correct conditions. During the drying process specimens are particularly at risk if they dry slowly. This happens through poor drying conditions or specimens being wet before being pressed or having water-retaining or [[Succulent plant|succulent]] parts. Specimens with sugary [[Exudate#Plant exudates|exudations]] or large quantities of nectar are also particularly attractive to fungi and need special care during drying to ensure that they dry fast enough to prevent mold growth. If fungal growth occurs on specimens, it can be brushed with 95% [[ethanol]] or [[Denatured alcohol|methylated spirits]] (denatured alcohol). However, this may alter the specimen for chemical and other investigative research and only kills the fungus present on the specimen, not preventing further problems of fungal growth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natsca.org/sites/default/files/publications/books/Vascular%20plants.pdf|title=Vascular plants|last=Bedford|first=David J.|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light ===
Herbarium specimens are sensitive to [[Light|visible light]] and [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], which can cause fading of biological [[pigment]]s (fading or shifts in color) and/or damage to chemical bonds (weakened or embrittled).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/AppendixT.pdf|title=Appendix T: Curatorial Care of Biological Collections|last=|first=|date=2005|website=National Park Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature and RH ===
High temperatures contribute to [[desiccation]]. The rate of any chemical reaction that damages specimens will double with each 10&amp;nbsp;°C rise in temperature. Excessive moisture in the air (above 65% relative humidity) encourages pest infestation and/or the softening of some adhesives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Preventative care==

===Environment===
Specimens are stored in environmentally controlled storage rooms away from direct sunlight with limited exposure to other light sources to minimize causes of deterioration. Storage rooms are kept at a [[relative humidity]] (RH) level of between 45% and 55%. [[Temperature]] levels are kept between 18&amp;nbsp;°C and 22&amp;nbsp;°C. Store rooms are never completely immune to pests. Pest infestations are reduced by the regular vacuuming of storage areas and not allowing any food or drink in the storage rooms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Sarracenia purpurea herbarium specimens.jpg|thumb|Specimens in front of metal herbarium cabinets.]]

===Storage and handling ===
Specimens are stored in standard herbarium cabinets, as metal shelves can be easily cleaned and a well-sealed cabinet will provide a stable micro-climate for the specimens. Metal cabinets do not release [[volatile organic compound]]s, like wooden cabinets do.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plants are thoroughly dry and free of pests before placing in cabinets to prevent deterioration. Specimens mounted on sheets are kept flat and placed on stiff cardboard or in a box when moving them from cabinets to work spaces to minimize damage during examination. The weight from folders stacked too high can cause damage to lower specimens. Folders are kept specimen-side up and never turned over, so the specimens are never face down. During examinations, handlers review for potential maintenance (loose specimens, unattached specimens, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Leaning on herbarium sheets, writing notes on top of them, or placing heavy items or elbows on them can cause serious damage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Older herbaria specimens may have been treated with toxic chemicals including [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[arsenic]] to prevent pests. Handlers wear [[Medical glove|nitrile]] gloves and work in a well ventilated room when working with specimens prepared earlier than 1989. The card on which the specimen is mounted and the specimen itself may contain the chemicals. The dust on herbaria sheets may be contaminated, so conservators wear a [[dust mask]] and use a dust extractor or [[Fume hood|fume cupboard]] when cleaning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Repair and restoration==
===Cleaning=== 
Dust and dirt are removed from herbarium sheets by using a smoke sponge. Conservators gently rub the place where the dirt is and then softly remove any excess with a fine brush.

=== Broken specimens=== 
Broken specimens are reattached to the herbaria sheet using thinly cut strips of archival pre-gummed linen tape. Detached materials such as seeds, leaves, etc., are placed in an acid-free card fragment packet, which is secured onto the sheet with the original specimen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Neuchâtel Herbarium - Equisetum sylvaticum - NEU000001915.tif|thumb|Pressed and dried specimen with linen tape supports.]]

=== Removal from mounting sheet ===
Unattached specimens are removed from the herbaria sheet by humidifying it to make them pliable and removing the plant with a paper lifter (smooth wooden spatula). They are then placed to dry and flatten along with the original mounting sheet and written documentation (label and annotations). The specimen and original documents are then remounted to a new sheet using the original sheet as reference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Disaster recovery ===
Unforeseen disasters can occur at any time and [[Emergency response (museum)#Preparedness|disaster recovery]] planning and materials for herbaria are similar to [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]]. Little can be done with burnt specimens and fragmented specimens except to preserve and protect what is left intact. The damage most likely to occur is water damage through natural or man made flooding, such as roof leakage or [[Fire sprinkler system|fire sprinkler]] malfunction. Damaged of waterlogged specimens are frozen to delay deterioration and prevent fungal attack, which gives curators time to evaluate the situation and decide how best to approach the problem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

{{Purinergic signalling}}

'''DORN1''' refers to a [[purinergic receptor]] found in green plants, which is involved in extracellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] detection.&lt;ref name="receptoridentification"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi J, Tanaka K, Cao Y, Qi Y, Qiu J, Liang Y, Lee SY, Stacey G | title = Identification of a plant receptor for extracellular ATP | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6168 | pages = 290–4 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24436418 | doi = 10.1126/science.343.6168.290 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6168/290.short }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the process of [[signal transduction]], DORN1 couples extracellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] binding (which occurs during cellular stress) to downstream signalling and ultimately [[gene expression]], which is thought to aid in plant survival.&lt;ref name="receptoridentification" /&gt;&lt;ref name="currentplantopinion" /&gt;

== Molecular properties ==
In contrast to animal purinergic receptors (which are [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s), DORN1 is a lectin receptor kinase (LecRK),&lt;ref name="currentplantopinion"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao Y, Tanaka K, Nguyen CT, Stacey G | title = Extracellular ATP is a central signaling molecule in plant stress responses | journal = Current Opinion in Plant Biology | volume = 20 | pages = 82–7 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24865948 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbi.2014.04.009 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526614000569 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of the L type lectin receptor kinases, due to its legume-like extracellular domain.&lt;ref name="Ltypelection"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouwmeester K, Govers F | title = Arabidopsis L-type lectin receptor kinases: phylogeny, classification, and expression profiles | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 60 | issue = 15 | pages = 4383–96 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19773388 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erp277 | url = https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jxb/erp277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In green plants such as ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', several mutants lacking the DORN1 receptors are unable to phosphorylate [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]]s after ATP stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adler EM | title = Of ATP receptors, opioid receptors, and AKAP regulation of calcium channels | journal = The Journal of General Physiology | volume = 143 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–4 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24567506 | doi = 10.1085/jgp.201411175 | url = http://jgp.rupress.org/content/143/3/313.short | pmc = 3933938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
DORN1 receptors may play a role in mediating wound-induced inflammatory responses in green plants, with ATP acting as a [[damage-associated molecular pattern]] molecule. In response to cell [[lysis]], ATP is discharged and binds onto the extracellular [[lectin]] domain of the DORN1 receptor. The intracellular DORN1 kinase domain is subsequently activated, resulting in several cellular responses such as [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] activation, increased cytosolic [[calcium]] concentration and [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) production,  ultimately leading to the induction of defence [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name="currentplantopinion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi J, Tanaka K, Liang Y, Cao Y, Lee SY, Stacey G | title = Extracellular ATP, a danger signal, is recognized by DORN1 in Arabidopsis | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 463 | issue = 3 | pages = 429–37 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25301072 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20140666 | url = http://www.biochemj.org/content/463/3/429.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic background==

Danilo Orozco began studying music with Moraima Guash at the Juan Bautista Sagarra School in Santiago de Cuba, where he participated in the choir activities.&lt;ref name=orovio&gt;Orovio, Helio. Cuban Music from A to Z.Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied classical guitar with professor Guillermo Dufourneau in the same city.”

With his degree thesis ''La categoría Son como componente de la identidad nacional de Cuba,'' Danilo Orozco earned himself a Doctorate ''Summa Cum Laude'' in Philosophical and Musicological Sciences from the Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany ”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinoticias.com/content/article/20904.html Murió el destacado musicólogo cubano Danilo Orozco]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professor==

From 1969 to 1972 he worked as a professor of musical acoustics at the [[National Art Schools (Cuba)|National School of Arts]].&lt;ref name=orovio/&gt; He also taught numerous extra-curricular courses and seminars about subjects such as: ''Disciplines and formative actions in musical acoustics'', ''Analytical procedures of contemporary music'', ''Introductory seminar to musical techniques and trends from the 20th Century'', ''Cultural processes, tradition and rupture'' and ''Analysis of works from the Renaissance and Baroque.''

Danilo Orozco was frequently invited to offer postgraduate courses and seminars by reputable educational institutions such as the Tchaikovsky Conservatory and the Central Institute of Art Research in Moscow, the University of Panama (1982), the Conservatory of Rio de Janeiro (1989), the Vicente Emilio Sojo Institute in Venezuela (1991), the Salamanca University, Spain, UCLA in California, USA (1992) and the University of Chile (1996).

==Musicologist==

In 1979, at a request from UNESCO, he worked as adviser and analyst in events coordinated by the UNESCO-PNUD in Colombia. That same year, he participated as juror in the first Musicology Contest of Casa de Las Américas in Havana, Cuba.

Between 1988 and 1999, Orozco collaborated as musicologist with the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington D.C., and also contributed to the LAMR magazine from the Austin University, in Texas. He worked as musical adviser for the Cultural Center in Santiago de Cuba and the Cuban Television Film Studios. Danilo Orozco served also as a member of the advisory committee for Instituto del Libro in Havana, Cuba.

His work titled Antología Integral del Son, a double CD based on a thorough musicological investigation about the origin of Son Cubano, is considered a landmark in Cuban musicological studies.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=orovio/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1974, he received the Musicology National Award ''Pablo Hernández Balaguer'', in the ''Analysis category'', for his work titled: ''A propósito de la Nueva Trova''.&lt;ref name=orovio/&gt;

[[File:Paris July 2011-30.jpg|thumb|The [[Arc de Triomphe]] of the [[Place de l'Étoile]], one of the most famous example of Empire architecture, commissioned in 1806 after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon|Emperor Napoleon I]]]]
The '''Empire style''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃.piːʁ}}, ''style Empire'') is an early-nineteenth-century [[design]] movement in [[architecture]], [[furniture]], other [[decorative arts]], and the [[visual arts]], representing the second phase of [[Neoclassicism]]. It flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and the [[First French Empire]] periods, although its life span lasted until the late-1820s. From France it spread into much of Europe and the United States. 

The style originated in and takes its name from the rule of the Emperor [[Napoleon I]] in the [[First French Empire]], when it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The previous fashionable style in France had been the [[Directoire style]], a more austere and minimalist form of Neoclassicism, that replaced the [[Louis XVI style]].  The Empire style brought a full return to ostentatious richness.  The style corresponds somewhat to the [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal style]] in the United States, and the [[Regency style]] in Britain. 

==History==
[[File:Versailles Grand Trianon Napoleon's Chamber.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's bedchamber in the [[Grand Trianon]], [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] epitomizes the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical style]] of the [[First French Empire]]]]

The style developed and elaborated the Directoire style of the immediately preceding period, which aimed at a simpler, but still elegant evocation of the virtues of the [[Ancient Roman Republic]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[stoicism|stoic]] virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. ''Conventionels'' saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after [[Brutus]], [[Solon]] and [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of ''Salut Publique'' sat were made on antique models devised by David. ...In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Honour|1977|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Empire style "turned to the florid opulence of Imperial Rome. The abstemious severity of [[Doric order|Doric]] was replaced by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] richness and splendour".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honour|1977|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two French architects, [[Charles Percier]] and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Pierre Fontaine]], were together the creators of the French Empire style. The two had studied in [[Rome]] and in the 1790s became leading furniture designers in [[Paris]], where they received many commissions from Napoleon and other statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fredlund |first=Jane |year=2008 |title=Stilguiden: möbler &amp; inredning 1700–2000 |edition=2nd |location=Stockholm |publisher=Prisma |page=108 |oclc=234047178 |isbn=9789151849874 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture of the Empire style was based on elements of the [[Roman Empire]] and its many archaeological treasures, which had been rediscovered starting in the eighteenth century.  The preceding Louis XVI and [[Directoire (style)|Directoire]] styles employed straighter, simpler designs compared to the [[Rococo]] style of the eighteenth century.  Empire designs strongly influenced the contemporary American [[Federal style]] (such as design of the [[United States Capitol]] building), and both were forms of [[propaganda]] through architecture.  It was a style of the people, not ostentatious but sober and evenly balanced.  The style was considered to have "liberated" and "enlightened" architecture just as Napoleon "liberated" the peoples of Europe with his [[Napoleonic Code]].
[[File:Église de la Madeleine 3753x3156.jpg|left|thumb|[[Église de la Madeleine]] in [[Paris]], a Temple to the Glory of Napoleon's [[Grande Armée]]]]
The Empire period was popularized by the inventive designs of [[Percier and Fontaine]], Napoleon's architects for [[Château de Malmaison|Malmaison]].  The designs drew for inspiration on symbols and ornaments borrowed from the glorious ancient Greek and Roman empires.  Buildings typically had simple timber frames and box-like constructions, [[wood veneer|veneer]]ed in expensive [[mahogany]] imported from the [[colonies]]. Biedermeier furniture also used [[ebony]] details, originally due to financial constraints. [[Ormolu]] details (gilded bronze furniture mounts and embellishments) displayed a high level of craftsmanship.

[[File:View to Kazan Cathedral by Ivan Smelov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]

General Bernadotte, later to become King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Karl Johan]] of Sweden and Norway, introduced the Napoleonic style to Sweden, where it became known under his own name. The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared from other parts of Europe. France paid some of its debts to Sweden in ormolu bronzes instead of money, leading to a vogue for crystal [[chandeliers]] with bronze from France and crystal from Sweden.

After Napoleon lost power, the Empire style continued to be in favour for many decades, with minor adaptations.  There was a revival of the style in the last half of the nineteenth century in France, again at the beginning of the twentieth century, and again in the 1980s.

The most famous Empire-style structures in France are the grand neoclassical [[Arc de Triomphe|Arc de Triomphe of Place de l'Étoile]], [[Place du Carrousel#The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel|Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]], [[Vendôme column]], and [[Église de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]], which were built in Paris to emulate the edifices of the Roman Empire.  The style also was used widely in [[Imperial Russia]], where it was used to celebrate the victory over Napoleon in such memorial structures as the [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General Staff Building]], [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], [[Alexander Column]], and [[Narva Triumphal Gate]]. [[Stalinist architecture]] is sometimes referred to as Stalin's Empire style.

The style survived in Italy longer than in most of Europe, partly because of its Imperial Roman associations, partly because it was revived as a national style of architecture following the unification of Italy in 1870. [[Mario Praz]] wrote about this style as the Italian Empire.  In the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States, the Empire style was adapted to local conditions and gradually acquired further expression as the [[Egyptian Revival]], [[Greek Revival]], [[Biedermeier|Biedermeier style]], [[Regency style]], and [[Federal style|late-Federal style]].

Encapsulin nanocompartments are structurally similar to the [[HK97|HK97 bacteriophage]] and their function depends on the proteins loaded into the nanocompartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichols|first=Robert J.|last2=Cassidy-Amstutz|first2=Caleb|last3=Chaijarasphong|first3=Thawatchai|last4=Savage|first4=David F.|date=October 2017|title=Encapsulins: molecular biology of the shell|journal=Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|volume=52|issue=5|pages=583–594|doi=10.1080/10409238.2017.1337709|issn=1549-7798|pmid=28635326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sphere is formed from 60 (for a 25&amp;nbsp;nm sphere) or 180 (for a 30&amp;nbsp;nm sphere) copies of a single [[protomer]], termed encapsulin.

Encapsulins purified from ''Rhodococcus jostii'' can be assembled and disassembled with changes in pH.

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

The '''Enumclaw horse sex case''' was a 2005 incident involving Kenneth Pinyan &lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; (1960–2005), a [[Boeing]] engineer residing in Gig Harbor, Washington.  Pinyan distributed [[zoophile|zoophilic]] pornography of himself receiving anal sex from a stallion under the alias Mr. Hands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/movies/01lim.html A Lyrical Approach to a Subject That Shocks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcrunch.com/7-people-who-took-animals-for-lovers/ Horse Riding Mr Hands, Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was reported in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' and was one of that paper's most read stories of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/horse-sex-story-was-online-hit/|accessdate=2016-05-11|title=Horse sex story was online hit|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=December 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was informally referred to as the "Enumclaw horse sex case".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Macdonald|first=Moira|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2003097374_horse03.html|accessdate=2016-05-11|title=Infamous Enumclaw horse sex case to be made into movie|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinyan's death rapidly prompted the passing of a bill in Washington prohibiting both [[Zoophilia|sex with animals]] and the videotaping of such an act. Under current Washington law, bestiality is now a [[Class C felony]] punishable by up to five years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Fifty-Ninth Legislature|last=State of Washington|title=Animal cruelty in the first degree|work=RCW 16.52.205|accessdate=January 17, 2015|date=March 8, 2006|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=16.52.205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On July 1, 1976, section 9.79.100 of the [[Revised Code of Washington]], which prohibited "Every person who shall carnally know in any manner any animal or bird", was repealed and legalized bestiality in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/RCWArchive/Documents/1974/Vol1a.pdf 9.79.100]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/washington.htm#fn132 The Sensibilities of Our Forefathers Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Pinyan had worked for Boeing for eight years.&lt;ref name="thestranger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=30811|accessdate=2006-04-30|author=Mudede, Charles|title=The Animal In You|publisher=The Stranger|date=February–March 2006|authorlink=Charles Mudede}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously married to a woman and had children with her. He had moved from Seattle to [[Oak Harbor, Washington]].&lt;ref name=Mudededoesntwanttotalk&gt;[[Charles Mudede|Mudede, Charles]].

''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''. July 22, 2015. Retrieved on April 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, Pinyan was building a new house and a barn, in which he planned to place a horse, on the Key Peninsula Highway in [[Gig Harbor, Washington]]. He was about to begin making payments on his 30-year, $144,000 mortgage on it.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt;

Pinyan previously lost the ability to experience certain sensations after suffering from a motorcycle accident, and became involved in increasingly extreme sexual acts such as insertion of extremely large dildos, fisting, and receptive anal sex with horses. In the early 2000s, he found online a group of men, nicknamed "zoos", who began meeting at a farm in an unincorporated area in King County, Washington for communal weekends and filmed, and later posted online, each other being sodomized by horses, along with sometimes having sex with each other afterwards. According to Charles Mudede, co-writer of the 2007 documentary film ''Zoo'', the men trained the horses to penetrate them by stripping, applying a horse breeding pheromone, and bending over.&lt;ref name="vice.com"/&gt; Pinyan had a cast created of the penis of his favorite horse, Strut.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/film/a-stable-relationship-7406907.html A stable relationship?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X4K4oPPLouoC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Transformative Consumer Research for Personal and Collective Well-Being]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The incident==

The incident occurred at a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm,&lt;ref name="seattle1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/videotapes-show-bestiality-enumclaw-police-say/|accessdate=2016-05-11|title=Videotapes show bestiality, Enumclaw police say|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=July 15, 2005 | first=Jennifer | last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in an unincorporated area in King County, Washington,&lt;ref name="AndersonBarn1"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Rick Anderson|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2005-11-09/news/closing-the-barn-door/|title=Closing the Barn Door|publisher=Seattle Weekly|date=November 9, 2005}} "Tait, a truck driver who lives near the Southeast 444th Street&lt;!--"Southeast 444th Street, WA" leads to an unincorporated area--&gt; farm where the death occurred, "&lt;/ref&gt;  five miles northwest of the city of [[Enumclaw]].&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt; Pinyan, and a man named James Michael Tait (who lived in a trailer next to the farm), plus another unidentified man, often visited the farm for sexual purposes. After either Pinyan or the other man recorded Tait being penetrated by a stallion, Tait then filmed Pinyan submitting to the same act. During this incident, Pinyan sustained internal injuries including a perforated colon.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt;

==Death==

Pinyan was anonymously dropped off at the Enumclaw Community Hospital.&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Keegan | first = Rebecca Winters | url = http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1583009,00.html |title=Have You Seen the Horse Sex Movie? | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = January 28, 2007 | accessdate = September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2005, a man asked hospital staff for medical assistance for his companion. Pinyan was found dead in the [[emergency department|emergency room]], aged 45. The man who brought Pinyan into the hospital had disappeared by the time hospital staff came to contact him.&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt; According to the Medical Examiner's Office, Pinyan "died of acute [[peritonitis]] due to perforation of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]",&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt; and the death was ruled accidental.&lt;ref name="seattle2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/enumclaw-area-animal-sex-case-investigated/|accessdate=2016-05-11|title=Enumclaw-area animal-sex case investigated|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=July 15, 2005 | first=Jennifer | last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

After Pinyan died, the authorities used his [[driver's license]] to find acquaintances and relatives. Earlier news reports stated that the authorities had used [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance camera]] footage to track down Pinyan's companion. Using the contacts, the authorities found the farm where the incident occurred. The police tracked down the rural [[Enumclaw]]-area farm, which was known in [[zoophile]] Internet chat rooms as a destination for people who want to have sex with livestock, and seized hundreds of hours of videotapes of men engaging in bestiality. One of the videotapes featured Kenneth Pinyan shortly before he died on July 2.&lt;ref name="seattle1"/&gt;

Prosecutors later determined that the horse had not been injured by being forced to engage in sex in this manner.&lt;ref name="AndersonBarn1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foundas, Scott.

&lt;!-- !!! DO NOT EDIT THE TEXT OF THIS QUOTE !!!

Yes, the original source said "fucking". Changing it to "having intercourse with" (or similar) makes it no longer an accurate quote.

{{quote|It was only after Pinyan died, when law enforcement looked for one way to punish his associates, that the legality of bestiality in Washington State became an issue [...] The prosecutor's office wanted to charge Tait with animal abuse, but the police found no evidence of abused animals on the many videotapes they collected from his home. As there was no law against humanely having sex with one horse, the prosecutors could only charge Tait with trespassing.|[[Charles Mudede]], [[The Stranger (newspaper)|''The Stranger'']]&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt;}}

==Media reporting==
Jennifer Sullivan, a ''[[Seattle Times]]'' staff reporter, said that originally the King County Sheriff's Department did not expect the newspaper to report on the event, because "it was too gruesome." After an ''[[Associated Press]]'' report stated that the farm where the event occurred  attracted "a significant number of people" who wanted to partake in bestiality, the ''Seattle Times'' decided that it needed to write articles about the case, since multiple people were involved.&lt;ref name="WhattodoMesser"&gt;{{cite news | last = Messer | first = Lesley | url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/when-a-man-dies-in-a-sex-act-with-a-horse-what-s-a-reporter-to-do/ | title = When a Man Dies in a Sex Act with a Horse – What's a Reporter to Do? | work = [[Editor &amp; Publisher]] | date = July 18, 2005 | accessdate = 2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal charges, guilty plea, and sentencing==
The photographer, 54-year-old James Michael Tait,&lt;ref name="AndersonBarn1"/&gt; was charged with criminal [[trespass]]ing in the first degree, because the owners of the farm, a third party, were not aware that the men entered the property to engage in bestiality. The third man was not charged since he was not visible in the videos seized by investigators.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; On November 29, 2005, Tait entered an [[Alford plea]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/man-in-infamous-enumclaw-horse-sex-case-faces-new-charges-in-tennessee/ Man in infamous Enumclaw horse-sex case faces new charges in Tennessee ]." ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. October 20, 2009. Updated October 21, 2009. Retrieved on February 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and Judge David Christie gave him a suspended one-year sentence, a $300 fine, and one day of community service. Judge Christie ordered Tait to never visit the farm again.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

Mudede wrote that at the time of the incident the residents of Enumclaw were shocked and angered by the incident. In 2015, ten years after the incident, Mudede wrote that Enumclaw residents were unwilling to acknowledge the incident.&lt;ref name=Mudededoesntwanttotalk/&gt;

===2 Guys 1 Horse===

After Pinyan's death, a video circulated around the internet of Kenneth Pinyan engaging in receptive anal intercourse with a horse. The video was nicknamed "Mr. Hands" or "2 Guys 1 Horse". The video, intended originally to sexually gratify the viewer, has became one of the first [[Viral video|viral]] [[reaction video]]s. This video is featured in the 2007 film ''Zoo''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d_Z1qnWuIg0C&amp;pg=PA516#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Transformative Consumer Research for Personal and Collective Well-Being]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vice.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Dennis.

===James Michael Tait===

In 2005, James Michael Tait moved to [[Maury County, Tennessee]] where he lived on Kenny Thomason's farm, which had 13 horses, Shetland ponies, goats and dogs. On October 13, Christy D. Morris was arrested with three counts of animal cruelty. On October 15, 2009, an anonymous person e-mailed investigators a photo of a man who was having sex with a Shetland pony from Kenny Thomason's farm, leading to the arrest of Tait and Thomason that same day. Tait was charged with three counts of three counts of felony animal cruelty, while Thomason was charged with two counts of felony animal cruelty. According to Tait's arrest warrant, he had been engaging in sex acts with a stud horse over a span of several months. Both Tait and Thomason admitted to engaging in sex acts with a horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605121119/https://www.wkrn.com/2009/10/19/3-accused-of-having-sex-with-animals-in-maury-co | title=3 accused of having sex with animals in Maury Co |publisher=[[WKRN]] | date=19 October 2009 | accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/man-in-infamous-enumclaw-horse-sex-case-faces-new-charges-in-tennessee/|title=Man in infamous Enumclaw horse-sex case faces new charges in Tennessee |publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]''|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2017-06-11}} "James Tait, 58, was arrested and charged Thursday with three counts of felony animal cruelty in Maury County, Tenn."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lite-news.com/us-man-filmed-friends-having-sex-with-horses/ US Farmer in horse-sex arrest]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010 Tait pleaded guilty in a Tennessee court to engaging in sexual acts with animals, and he was placed on probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sullivan | first=Jennifer | url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/felon-accused-of-running-animal-sex-farm-in-whatcom-county/ | title=Felon accused of running animal-sex farm in Whatcom County | work=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=16 April 2010 | accessdate=2016-05-11}} "Tait, 58, pleaded guilty in January in Tennessee to engaging in sexual activity with animals and was released on probation."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 16.52.205 of the Revised Code of Washington ===

After Pinyan died,&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; [[Pam Roach]], a member of the [[Washington State Senate]] and a Republican from [[Auburn, Washington|Auburn]], crafted a bill to ban [[Zoophilia|bestiality]] in Washington State.&lt;ref name="WhattodoMesser"/&gt; Senate Bill 6417, which made bestiality a Class C felony, passed on February 11, 2006 with 36 state senators voting for it (The vote record is "passed; yeas, 36; nays, 0; absent, 0; excused, 13", meaning that 13 of the 49 total senators refrained from going on record about the matter).  Mudede wrote "It was an almost comically easy law to pass."&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; Bestiality had no political support in Washington state, and no group in Washington state advocated for bestiality.&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt;  The law is [http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=16.52.205 RCW 16.52.205](3). Mudede wrote that reading RCW 16.52.205 "is very much like reading hardcore porn."&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; In addition, the law prohibits "videotap[ing] a person engaged in a sexual act or sexual contact with an animal" "either alive or dead." Because of the provision against videotaping, Mudede stated that the law "points an angry finger directly at James Tait."&lt;ref name="thestranger"/&gt; In 2015 Mudede said that he was unaware of any bestiality arrests in Washington State since the Pinyan incident.&lt;ref&gt;Sokol, Zach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6528">{{Distinguish|Euphemism}}
'''Euphuism''' is a peculiar mannered style of English [[prose]]. It takes its name from a prose romance  by [[John Lyly]]. It consists of a preciously ornate and sophisticated style, employing a deliberate excess of literary devices such as [[antitheses]], [[alliteration]]s, repetitions and  [[rhetorical question]]s. Classical learning and remote knowledge of all kinds are displayed. Euphuism was fashionable in the 1580s, especially in the [[Elizabethan]] court.

==''Euphues'' (1580)==
[[File:Campaspe.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''[[Campaspe (play)|Campaspe]]'' by John Lily, 1584]]

"Euphues" is the Greek for "graceful, witty". [[John Lyly]] published the works ''[[Euphues (1578)|Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit]]'' (1578) and ''Euphues and his England'' (1580). Both works illustrated the intellectual fashions and favourite themes of Renaissance society&amp;mdash;in a highly artificial and mannered style. The plots are unimportant, existing merely as structural elements on which to display conversations, discourses and letters mostly concerning the subject of love. Its essential features had already appeared in such works as [[George Pettie]]'s ''A Petite Pallace of Pettie his pleasure'' (1576), in [[sermon]] literature, and Latin tracts. Lyly perfected the distinctive rhetorical devices on which the style was based.

==Principles==
The euphuistic sentence followed principles of balance and antithesis to their extremes, purposely using the latter regardless of sense. John Lyly set up three basic structural principles:
#phrases of equal length that appear in succession;
#the balance of key verbal elements in successive sentences;
#the correspondence of sounds and syllables, especially between words that are already balanced against each other.

==Examples==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is virtue, yea virtue, gentlemen, that maketh gentlemen; that maketh the poor rich, the base-born noble, the subject a sovereign, the deformed beautiful, the sick whole, the weak strong, the most miserable most happy. There are two principal and peculiar gifts in the nature of man, knowledge and reason; the one commandeth, and the other obeyeth: these things neither the whirling wheel of fortune can change, neither the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate, neither sickness abate, neither age abolish". (''Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit'')
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Is it not far better to abhor sins by the remembrance of others' faults, than by repentance of thine own follies?" (''Euphues, 1, lecture by the wise Neapolitan)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Can any treasure in this transitory pilgrimmage be of more value than a friend? In whose bosom thou mayest sleep secure without fear, whom thou mayest make partner of all thy secrets without suspicion of fraud, and partaker of all thy misfortune without mistrust of fleeting. Who will account thy bale his bane, thy mishap his misery, the pricking of thy finger the piercing of his heart" (Euphues)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"How frantic are those lovers which are carried away with the gay glistering of the fine face? The beauty whereof is parched with the summer's blaze and chipped with the winter's blast: which is of so short continuance, that it fadeth before one perceive it flourish". (Euphues' after-dinner speech to the 'coy' Neapolitan ladies on whether the qualities of the mind or the composition of the man are more worthy).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Time hath weaned me from my mother's teat, and age rid me from my father's correction". (Lucilla, considering her father's reaction in abandoning her fiance Philanthus for Euphues).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A sharp sore hath a short cure" (Euphues)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As they be hard to be won without trial of great faith, so are they hard to be lost without great cause of fickleness". (Euphues to Lucilla on the quality of 'fervency' in women).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But alas Euphues, what truth can there be found in a traveller? What stay in a stranger? Whose words and bodies both watch but for a wind, whose feet are ever fleeting, whose faith plighted on the shore, is turned to perjury when they hoist sail". (Lucilla to Euphues).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
Many critics did not appreciate Lyly's deliberate excesses. [[Philip Sidney]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]] castigated his style. 

Lyly's style, however, influenced Shakespeare, who satirised it in speeches by Polonius in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the florid language of the courtly lovers in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''; Beatrice and Benedick in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' also made use of it, as did Richard and Lady Anne in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. It was taken up by the Elizabethan writers [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], [[Thomas Lodge]] and [[Barnabe Rich]]. [[Walter Scott]] satirised it in the character of Sir Piercie Shafton in ''The Monastery'', while [[Charles Kingsley]] defended ''Euphues'' in ''Westward Ho!''.

==Contemporary equivalents in other languages==
Euphuism was not particular to Britain, or a manifestation of some social structure and artistic opportunity unique to that country. There were equivalents in other major European languages, each of which was called by a different name: [[culteranismo]] in [[Spain]], [[Giovan Battista Marino|Marinismo]] in [[Italy]], and [[préciosité]] in [[France]], for example.

      <comment>Adding [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: "The part of the genome of a population that was advantageous in past circumstances but is currently disadvantageous" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7384">{{short description|The part of the genome of a population that was advantageous in past circumstances but is currently disadvantageous}}
'''Evolutionary baggage''' is the part of the [[genome]] of a population that was advantageous in past individuals but is disadvantageous under the pressures exerted by [[natural selection]] today.&lt;ref&gt;Appenzeller, T. 1999. "Test tube evolution catches time in a bottle." ''Science.'' 284: 2108-2110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Gene]]s that may have been advantageous in the past may be critically unfit for individuals in today’s environment. Natural selection is not a perfect process; if an organism is “fit enough” to survive a particular environment and reproduce, its genes are passed on to the next generation.&lt;ref name=Thanukos&gt;Thanukos, A. 2008. "Views from understanding evolution: [[parasite]]s and [[pathogen]]s take the leap." ''Evolution:Education and Outreach'' 1:25-28&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these genes may increase an organism’s fitness while some may even be slightly disadvantageous. This seeming paradox is the origin of evolutionary baggage, which is the collectively inherited traits that evolved in a different environment from the present.&lt;ref name="Thanukos"/&gt;  In the case of humans, the result is a “[[Paleolithic]]” genome, which is not adapted to today’s environment and is contributing to “diseases of civilization,” including [[atherosclerosis]] and [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;Spotorno, A.E. 2005. "Evolutionary medicine: an emergent basic science." ''Rev. Med. Chile.'' 133:231-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Other hypotheses link evolutionary baggage to genetic diseases. Since all organisms descended from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]], evolutionary baggage can be seen universally among organisms.&lt;ref name="Thanukos"/&gt;

==Diet==
It is a fundamental biological concept that organisms are most fit if they eat the same diet which their evolution has adapted them to. Throughout history, humans adapted to a diet by living off the land. Today, humans maintain the same genes that have been evolved from our ancestors and adapted to the diet they consumed. This has created a mismatch between the modern diet and lifestyle (which has emerged in evolutionary terms very recently), and the diet and lifestyle to which the human body has slowly adapted to over thousands of years.&lt;ref name=OKeefe&gt;O'Keefe, J.H. and L. Cordain. 2004. "Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer." ''Mayo. Clin. Proc.'' 79: 101-108.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can be considered evolutionary baggage because the deviation from the [[Paleolithic#Diet and nutrition|Paleolithic diet]] and lifestyle has led to “diseases of civilization” such as obesity, [[hypertension]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type II diabetes]].&lt;ref name="OKeefe"/&gt;

The human body adapted over time to crave [[calorie]]-dense foods and to store energy efficiently because our ancestors did not have abundant food; this is called the [[thrifty gene hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="OKeefe"/&gt; These adaptations are genetic baggage today, causing humans to store fat efficiently despite abundant food availability. This leads to obesity, which is an important [[risk factor]] for [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="OKeefe"/&gt; However, studies have shown that consuming a [[Paleolithic diet|Paleolithic-type diet]] rich in unprocessed foods and lean protein decreased [[blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]] level while increasing [[glucose]] tolerance.&lt;ref name="pmid19209185"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.4 |title=Metabolic and physiologic improvements from consuming a paleolithic, hunter-gatherer type diet |year=2009 |last1=Frassetto |first1=L A |last2=Schloetter |first2=M |last3=Mietus-Synder |first3=M |last4=Morris |first4=R C |last5=Sebastian |first5=A |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=947–955 |pmid=19209185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sickle-cell and malaria==
As a recessive gene, Sickle-cell disease is only present if homozygous, with no dominant gene to beat them out. Sickle-cell disease, originating in people living in tropical areas where malaria is prevalent, is a [[hereditary]] blood disorder characterized by rigid, sickle-shaped red blood cells.. The unusual shape and rigidity of these altered red blood cells reduces a cell’s ability to effectively travel with regular blood flow, occasionally blocking veins and preventing proper blood flow. Life expectancy is shortened for people with sickle-cell disease, though modern medicine has significantly lengthened the life expectancy of someone with this disease. As detrimental as the effects of sickle-cell disease seem, it also offers an unforeseen benefit; humans with the sickle-cell gene show less severe symptoms when infected with malaria, as the abnormal shape of blood cells caused by the disease hinder the malaria parasite’s ability to invade and replicate within these cells.&lt;ref name=Wellems&gt;Wellems TE, Hayton K, Fairhurst RM (September 2009). "The impact of malaria parasitism: from corpuscles to communities". J. Clin. Invest.119 (9): 2496–505.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to have the sickle-cell allele, but not have the disease, for example if heterozygous.
	
[[Malaria]], a [[mosquito]]-borne infectious disease of humans and other animals, is a potentially deadly disease that causes fever, fatigue, nausea, muscular pain, coughing, and, in extreme cases, coma and death. Malaria is caused by parasitic [[protozoans]] transferred through mosquito saliva into a person’s circulatory system, where they travel to the liver to mature. Though eliminated in the U.S., there were an estimated 219 million documented cases of malaria in 2010 according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=Nayyar&gt;Nayyar GML, Breman JG, Newton PN, Herrington J (2012). "Poor-quality antimalarial drugs in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa".Lancet Infectious Diseases 12 (6): 488–96.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The correlation between [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[malaria]] is a double-edged sword. Having a sickle-cell allele does limit the life expectancy of a person, however, the presence of sickle-cell genes reduces the detrimental effects of malaria should it be contracted. Natural selection allowed for the spreading of the sickle-cell gene in areas of high numbers of mosquitoes carrying malaria; those that weren't as susceptible to malaria were much more likely to live than those that were. Because malaria is not as prevalent as it once was, the benefits of sickle-cell have since eroded, leaving behind the detrimental effects of the disease.

==Implications==
Evolutionary baggage from our ancestors may be causing disease in individuals today. In our ancestors, these phenotypes conferred selective advantage against harsh climate, [[infectious disease]] and scarce food. However, since these conditions are less common in today’s world, individuals with these [[phenotype]]s are at a selective disadvantage. This disadvantage has major implications in the area of [[health care]] because some of the diseases caused by evolutionary baggage are major contributors to the rising cost of health care in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The '''Five Colleges of Ohio''' is an academic and administrative consortium of five selective private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] in the US state of [[Ohio]]. It is a nonprofit educational consortium established in 1995 to promote the broad educational and cultural objectives of its member institutions. The consortium developed from a range of highly successful collaborations including friendly academic and athletic rivalries among the five institutions.

==Members==
The members of The Five Colleges of Ohio consortium are:
* [[Denison University]], [[Granville, Ohio]]
* [[Kenyon College]], [[Gambier, Ohio]]
* [[Oberlin College]], [[Oberlin, Ohio]]
* [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], [[Delaware, Ohio]]
* [[The College of Wooster]], [[Wooster, Ohio]]

== History ==
The designation ''Ohio Five'' first appeared in Ohio newspapers in the early twentieth century. The grouping, predating any formal agreement, was immediately adopted by the press as a foreshadowing of an Ohio league of schools with similar academic and athletic reputations, which, at the time was a common perception.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
|}
Following informal discussions among the five colleges in the early 1990s, the consortium was formalized by the incorporation of the organization on June 30, 1995. The five colleges had been affiliated as members of state and national educational and athletic organizations and had enjoyed friendly rivalry in various academic and athletic competitions, similar to [[Little Three]] in New England. 

A grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], awarded in June 1995, provided for the development of a joint library system, establishment of an administrative structure, and investigation of the benefits and methods for sharing digital images and multimedia resources, establishing The Five Colleges of Ohio, Inc. as a legal entity.

== Collaboration ==

Collaboration among the five colleges occurs in several areas:

*Academic Programs
*[[Academic administration|Administrative]] Programs
*Libraries
*Technology
*Cross-registration
*[[Sport|Athletic]] Rivalry

== Academic programs ==
The five colleges collaborate on various academic projects. During 2004 and 2005 collaboration has been active in language videoconferencing in languages that are less commonly taught. The five colleges collaborate in the instruction of [[Arabic language]] courses and significant applications of teaching technology in joint teaching enterprises.

A recent project, began in May 2006, focused on how creativity and critical reasoning develop and are embedded in the liberal arts curriculum of each member college. The project will provide a quantitative understanding of how student at each college define "creativity" and "critical reasoning" and how these two attributes change as a result of their academic experiences in a liberal arts college.

==Administrative programs==
The colleges currently maintain a central clearing house for employment opportunities at all five schools.

==Libraries==
The libraries of [[Denison University]], [[Kenyon College]], [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], and [[The College of Wooster]] share an [[integrated library system]] called [[CONSORT Colleges|CONSORT]]. The primary objective of this endeavor is to maximize the ability to share a diverse book collection and other electronic resources. [[Oberlin College]] maintains its own [[integrated library system]] called [http://obis.oberlin.edu/ OBIS].

==Technology==
The members also collaborate on various technology-related projects. For example, in order to be able to handle environmental impact cost efficiently, environmental health and safety (EHS) managers of the five schools meet into one central resource team, called the EHS Roundtable.

The five schools have been athletic rivals for almost a century. The informal athletic rivalry was formalized in 1984 when the five colleges left the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] to form a new league, beginning with the 1984–85 academic year. A desire for greater uniformity in academic and athletic standards was cited as the major motive for the withdrawal of these schools from the OAC. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051026115112/http://www.oac.org/Ohio%20Althletic%20Conference/General%20OAC/History/OAC%20History.pdf].

It was in February, 1983 that the [[North Coast Athletic Conference]] was created to "foster a complementary relationship between intercollegiate athletics and the pursuit of academic excellence". [https://web.archive.org/web/20050310202704/http://www.northcoast.org/timeline/83_88.html]. Each league member was to have seven sports for both men and women and each school would go off campus for recruiting. It was decided that there would be no athletic scholarships.

Wooster teams are now known as the ''Fighting Scots,'' Kenyon's nickname is ''Lords and Ladies,'' Denison's teams are known as ''Big Red,'' Oberlin's teams are known as the ''Yeomen,'' and Ohio Wesleyan's nickname is the ''Battling Bishops''.

Ohio Wesleyan and Denison share a historic rivalry in [[lacrosse]], which has been very closely contested.

==Students==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:OhioFivePolitical.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Political leanings of students of Ohio Five Colleges from survey responses on [[Facebook|thefacebook]] on April 10, 2005.]] --&gt;

A majority of students at all the schools self-identify as liberal. Students at Oberlin and Wesleyan have the highest percentage of liberal students while Denison attracts the highest percentage of students who identify as conservative and very conservative. 

The curriculum at all of the five schools is highly structured and academically rigorous. Generally, the four basic elements—the required humanities sequence, the breadth of study requirement, and a senior thesis (Independent Study at Wooster, Senior Exercise at Kenyon, varying specifics based on major at the other schools) — creates a mix for strong component of interdisciplinary work with study of traditional majors.

First- and second-year students at each one of the colleges develop a strong a background in a broad context of liberal arts classes. Classes like Love and Sex at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], Philosophy of Art at [[Kenyon College]] or the Oberlin Film Series at [[Oberlin College]] provide opportunities for humanistic and scientific study. The junior and senior years at each college provide opportunities for intensive examination of the subject matter and techniques of a more narrowly defined academic discipline. 

Other features of the student bodies at the five schools exist. Oberlin attracts the highest percent of out-of-state students, followed by Kenyon and Ohio Wesleyan. Ohio Wesleyan has the highest percent of international students among the five schools and currently has the fifth highest percentage of international students among all liberal arts colleges. Oberlin and Wooster typically have the highest percentage of students continuing for PhD degrees immediately following graduation.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-635-3966-27, Panzerfabrik in Deutschland.jpg|thumb|During [[World War II]], production of German tanks such as the [[Panther tank|Panther]] was accurately estimated by Allied intelligence using statistical methods]]
In the [[statistical theory]] of [[estimation theory|estimation]], the '''German tank problem''' consists in estimating the maximum of a [[discrete uniform distribution]] from [[sampling without replacement]]. In simple terms, suppose we have an unknown number of items which are sequentially numbered from 1 to ''N''. We take a random sample of these items and observe their sequence numbers; the problem is to estimate ''N'' from these observed numbers. 

The problem is named after its application by Allied forces in [[World War II]] to the estimation of the monthly rate of German tank production from a paucity (statistically speaking) of sampled data.  This exploited the manufacturing practice of assigning ascending sequences of serial numbers to tank components (chassis, gearbox, engine, wheels) — which were captured in battle by Allied forces.

The problem can be approached using either [[frequentist inference]] or [[Bayesian inference]], achieving different results. Estimating the population maximum based on a ''single'' sample yields divergent results, whereas estimation based on ''multiple'' samples is a practical estimation question whose answer is simple (especially in the frequentist setting) but not obvious (especially in the Bayesian setting).

==Suppositions==

The adversary is presumed to have manufactured a series of tanks marked with consecutive whole numbers, beginning with serial number 1.  Additionally, regardless of a tank's date of manufacture, history of service, or the serial number it bears, the distribution over serial numbers becoming revealed to analysis is uniform, up to the point in time when the analysis is conducted.

==Example==

[[File:German_tank_problem_graphs.svg|thumb|Graphs of estimated population size, ''N'' for number of samples, ''k'' and largest sample serial number, ''m'' using frequentist (dotted lines) and Bayesian analysis (solid line shows mean and shading shows range from minimum possible value to mean plus 1 standard deviation). The example shows if 4 tanks are observed and the highest serial number is 60, frequentist analysis predicts ''N'' = 74 whereas Bayesian analysis predicts a mean of 88.5 and standard deviation of 138.72 &amp;minus; 88.5 = 50.22, and a minimum of 60 tanks. In [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/German_tank_problem_graphs.svg the SVG file], hover over a graph to highlight it.]]
Suppose {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 4}} tanks with serial numbers 19, 40, 42 and 60 are captured. The maximal observed serial number, {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 60}}. The unknown total number of tanks is called ''N''.

The formula for estimating the total number of tanks suggested by the ''frequentist'' approach outlined below is

:&lt;math&gt;N \approx m + \frac{m}{k} - 1 = 74,&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the ''Bayesian'' analysis below yields (primarily) a [[probability mass function]] for the number of tanks

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(N=n) = \begin{cases}
   0 &amp;\text{if } n &lt; m \\
   \frac {k - 1}{k}\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom n k} &amp;\text{if } n \ge m,
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

from which we can estimate the number of tanks according to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       N &amp;\approx \mu \pm \sigma = 88.5 \pm 50.22, \\[5pt]
     \mu &amp;= (m - 1)\frac{k - 1}{k - 2}, \\[5pt]
  \sigma &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{(k-1)(m-1)(m-k+1)}{(k-3)(k-2)^2}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This distribution has positive [[skewness]], related to the fact that there are at least 60 tanks.

==Historical problem==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H26258, Panzer V "Panther".jpg|thumb|right|Panther tanks are loaded for transport to frontline units, 1943]]
During the course of the war, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] made sustained efforts to determine the extent of German production and approached this in two major ways: conventional intelligence gathering and statistical estimation.  In many cases, statistical analysis substantially improved on conventional intelligence.  In some cases, conventional intelligence was used in conjunction with statistical methods, as was the case in estimation of [[German tanks in World War II|Panther tank]] production just prior to [[D-Day]].

The allied command structure had thought the [[Panzer V]] (Panther) tanks seen in Italy, with their high velocity, long-barreled 75&amp;nbsp;mm/L70 guns, were unusual heavy tanks and would only be seen in northern France in small numbers, much the same way as the [[Tiger I]] was seen in Tunisia. The US Army was confident that the [[Sherman tank]] would continue to perform well, as it had versus the [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]] tanks in North Africa and Sicily.{{refn|An Armored Ground Forces policy statement of November 1943 concluded: "The recommendation of a limited proportion of tanks carrying a 90 mm gun is not concurred in for the following reasons: The M4 tank has been hailed widely as the best tank of the battlefield today. ... There appears to be no fear on the part of our forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank.  There can be no basis for the T26 tank other than the conception of a tank-vs.-tank duel – which is believed to be unsound and unnecessary."&lt;ref&gt;AGF policy statement.  Chief of staff AGF. November 1943. MHI&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Shortly before D-Day, rumors indicated that large numbers of Panzer V tanks were being used.

To determine whether this was true, the Allies attempted to estimate the number of tanks being produced.  To do this, they used the serial numbers on captured or destroyed tanks. The principal numbers used were gearbox numbers, as these fell in two unbroken sequences. Chassis and engine numbers were also used, though their use was more complicated.  Various other components were used to cross-check the analysis. Similar analyses were done on wheels, which were observed to be sequentially numbered (i.e., 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''N'').{{sfn|Ruggles|Brodie|1947|p=?}}{{efn|The lower bound was unknown, but to simplify the discussion, this detail is generally omitted, taking the lower bound as known to be 1.}}&lt;ref name=Davies-2006-07-20&gt;

The analysis of tank wheels yielded an estimate for the number of wheel molds that were in use.  A discussion with British road wheel makers then estimated the number of wheels that could be produced from this many molds, which yielded the number of tanks that were being produced each month.  Analysis of wheels from two tanks (32 road wheels each, 64 road wheels total) yielded an estimate of 270 tanks produced in February 1944, substantially more than had previously been suspected.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"&gt;

German records after the war showed production for the month of February 1944 was 276.{{sfn|Ruggles|Brodie|1947|pp=82–83}}{{refn|Ruggles &amp; Brodie is largely a practical analysis and summary, not a mathematical one – the estimation problem is only mentioned in footnote 3 on page 82, where they estimate the maximum as "sample maximum + average gap".|group=N}} The statistical approach proved to be far more accurate than conventional intelligence methods, and the phrase "German tank problem" became accepted as a descriptor for this type of statistical analysis.

Estimating production was not the only use of this serial-number analysis.  It was also used to understand German production more generally, including number of factories, relative importance of factories, length of supply chain (based on lag between production and use), changes in production, and use of resources such as rubber.

===Specific data===
According to conventional Allied intelligence estimates, the Germans were producing around 1,400 tanks a month between June 1940 and September 1942. Applying the formula below to the serial numbers of captured tanks, the number was calculated to be 256 a month. After the war, captured German production figures from the ministry of [[Albert Speer]] showed the actual number to be 255.&lt;ref name=Davies-2006-07-20/&gt;

Estimates for some specific months are given as:{{sfn|Ruggles|Brodie|1947|p=89}}

| August 1942 || 327 || 1,550 || 342
|}

===Similar analyses===
[[File:Fusée V2.jpg|thumb|[[V-2]] rocket production was accurately estimated by statistical methods]]
Similar serial-number analysis was used for other military equipment during World War II, most successfully for the [[V-2]] rocket.{{sfn|Ruggles|Brodie|1947|pp=90–91}}

Factory markings on Soviet military equipment were analyzed during the [[Korean War]], and by German intelligence during World War II.{{sfn|Volz|2008}}

In the 1980s, some Americans were given access to the production line of Israel's [[Merkava]] tanks. The production numbers were classified, but the tanks had serial numbers, allowing estimation of production.{{sfn|Johnson|1994}}

The formula has been used in non-military contexts, for example to estimate the number of [[Commodore 64]] computers built, where the result (12.5 million) matches the low-end estimates.&lt;ref name="pagetable.com"&gt;

===Countermeasures===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
To prevent serial-number analysis, serial numbers can be excluded, or usable auxiliary information reduced. Alternatively, serial numbers that resist cryptanalysis can be used, most effectively by randomly choosing numbers without replacement from a list that is much larger than the number of objects produced (compare the [[one-time pad]]), or produce random numbers and check them against the list of already assigned numbers; collisions are likely to occur unless the number of digits possible is more than twice the number of digits in the number of objects produced (where the serial number can be in any base); see [[birthday problem]].{{efn|As discussed in [[birthday attack]], one can expect a collision after 1.25{{radic|''H''}} numbers, if choosing from ''H'' possible outputs. This square root corresponds to half the digits.  For example, in any base, the square root of a number with 100 digits is approximately a number with 50 digits.}} For this, a [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]] may be used. All these methods require a lookup table (or breaking the cypher) to back out from serial number to production order, which complicates use of serial numbers: a range of serial numbers cannot be recalled, for instance, but each must be looked up individually, or a list generated.

Alternatively, sequential serial numbers can be encrypted with a simple [[substitution cipher]], which allows easy decoding, but is also easily broken by a [[known-plaintext attack]]: even if starting from an arbitrary point, the plaintext has a pattern (namely, numbers are in sequence). One example is given in [[Ken Follett]]'s novel ''[[Code to Zero]]'', where the encryption of the [[Jupiter-C]] rocket serial numbers is described as:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|- align=center
! H !! U !! N !! T !! S !! V !! I !! L !! E !! X
|- align=center
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 0
|}&lt;/center&gt;

The code word here is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] (with repeated letters omitted) to get a 10-letter key. The rocket number 13 was therefore "HN", and the rocket number 24 was "UT".

Strong encryption of serial numbers without expanding them can be achieved with [[format-preserving encryption]]. Instead of storing a truly random permutation on the set of all possible serial numbers in a large table, such algorithms will derive a pseudo-random permutation from a secret key. Security can then be defined as the pseudo-random permutation being indistinguishable from a truly random permutation to an attacker who doesn't know the key.

==Frequentist analysis==

===Minimum-variance unbiased estimator===
For [[point estimation]] (estimating a single value for the total, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N}&lt;/math&gt;), the [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]] (MVUE, or UMVU estimator) is given by:{{efn|In a continuous distribution, there is no &amp;minus;1 term.}}

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{N} = m\left(1 + k^{-1}\right) - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the largest serial number observed ([[sample maximum]]) and ''k'' is the number of tanks observed ([[sample size]]).{{sfn|Johnson|1994}}&lt;ref name="Johnson2"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that once a serial number has been observed, it is no longer in the pool and will not be observed again.

This has a variance{{sfn|Johnson|1994}}

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}(\hat{N}) = \frac{1}{k}\frac{(N-k)(N+1)}{(k+2)} \approx \frac{N^2}{k^2} \text{ for small samples } k \ll N,&lt;/math&gt;

so the [[standard deviation]] is approximately ''N''/''k'', the average size of the gap between samples; {{clarify span|compare ''m''/''k'' above|date=February 2016}}.

The formula may be understood intuitively as the sample maximum plus the average gap between observations in the sample, the sample maximum being chosen as the initial estimator, due to being the [[maximum likelihood estimator]],{{efn|Given a particular set of observations, this set is most likely to occur if the population maximum is the sample maximum, not a higher value (it cannot be lower).}} with the gap being added to compensate for the negative bias of the sample maximum as an estimator for the population maximum,{{efn|The sample maximum is never more than the population maximum, but can be less, hence it is a [[biased estimator]]: it will tend to ''underestimate'' the population maximum.}} and written as

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{N} = m + \frac{m - k}{k}= m + mk^{-1} - 1 = m\left(1 + k^{-1}\right) - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be visualized by imagining that the samples are evenly spaced throughout the range, with additional samples just outside the range at 0 and ''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. If starting with an initial gap between 0 and the lowest sample (sample minimum), the average gap between samples is &lt;math&gt;(m - k)/k&lt;/math&gt;; the &lt;math&gt;-k&lt;/math&gt; being because the samples themselves are not counted in computing the gap between samples.{{efn|1=For example, the gap between 2 and 7 is (7&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, consisting of 3, 4, 5, and&amp;nbsp;6.}}. A derivation of the expected value and the variance of the sample maximum are shown in the page of the [[discrete uniform distribution]].

This philosophy is formalized and generalized in the method of [[maximum spacing estimation]]; a similar heuristic is used for 
[[plotting position]] in a [[Q–Q plot]], plotting sample points at {{math|''k'' / (''n'' + 1)}}, which is evenly on the uniform distribution, with a gap at the end.

===Confidence intervals===
Instead of, or in addition to, ''point'' estimation, [[interval estimation|''interval'' estimation]] can be carried out, such as [[confidence interval]]s.
These are easily computed, based on the observation that the probability that ''k'' samples will fall in an interval covering ''p'' of the range (0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1) is ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; (assuming in this section that draws are ''with'' replacement, to simplify computations; if draws are without replacement, this overstates the likelihood, and intervals will be overly conservative).

Thus the [[sampling distribution]] of the quantile of the sample maximum is the graph ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt; from 0 to 1: the ''p''-th to ''q''-th quantile of the sample maximum ''m'' are the interval [''p''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''N'',&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''N'']. Inverting this yields the corresponding confidence interval for the population maximum of [''m''/''q''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;].

For example, taking the symmetric 95% interval ''p'' = 2.5% and ''q'' = 97.5% for ''k'' = 5 yields 0.025&lt;sup&gt;1/5&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.48, 0.975&lt;sup&gt;1/5&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.995, so the confidence interval is approximately [1.005''m'', 2.08''m'']. The lower bound is very close to ''m'', thus more informative is the asymmetric confidence interval from ''p'' = 5% to 100%; for ''k'' = 5 this yields 0.05&lt;sup&gt;1/5&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.55 and the interval [''m'',&amp;nbsp;1.82''m''].

More generally, the (downward biased) 95% confidence interval is [''m'', ''m''/0.05&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;] = [''m'', ''m''·20&lt;sup&gt;1/k&lt;/sup&gt;]. For a range of ''k'' values, with the UMVU point estimator (plus 1 for legibility) for reference, this yields:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''k'' !! point estimate !! confidence interval
|-
|  1 || 2''m''    || [''m'', 20''m'']
|-
|  2 || 1.5''m''  || [''m'', 4.5''m'']
|-
|  5 || 1.2''m''  || [''m'', 1.82''m'']
|-
| 10 || 1.1''m''  || [''m'', 1.35''m'']
|-
| 20 || 1.05''m'' || [''m'', 1.16''m'']
|}

Immediate observations are:
* For small sample sizes, the confidence interval is very wide, reflecting great uncertainty in the estimate.
* The range shrinks rapidly, reflecting the exponentially decaying likelihood that ''all'' samples will be significantly below the maximum.
* The confidence interval exhibits positive skew, as ''N'' can never be below the sample maximum, but can potentially be arbitrarily high above it.

Note that ''m''/''k'' cannot be used naively (or rather (''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''/''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/''k'') as an estimate of the [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] ''SE'', as the standard error of an estimator is based on the ''population'' maximum (a parameter), and using an estimate to estimate the error in that very estimate is [[circular reasoning]].

==Bayesian analysis==
The Bayesian approach to the German tank problem is to consider the credibility &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (N=n\mid M=m, K=k)&lt;/math&gt; that the number of enemy tanks &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt;, when the number of observed tanks, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle K&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle k&lt;/math&gt;, and the maximum serial number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m&lt;/math&gt;. The answer to this problem depends on the choice of prior for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N&lt;/math&gt;. One can proceed using a proper prior, e.g., the Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution, where closed formula for the posterior mean and posterior variance can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Höhle|first=M.|last2=Held|first2=L.|date=2006|title=Bayesian Estimation of the Size of a Population|url=https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/2094/1/paper_499.pdf|journal=Technical Report SFB 386, No. 399, Department of Statistics, University of Munich|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative is to proceed using direct calculations as shown below.

For brevity, in what follows, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (N=n\mid M=m,K=k)&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (n\mid m,k)&lt;/math&gt;

===Conditional probability===
The rule for [[conditional probability]] gives
:&lt;math&gt;(n\mid m,k)(m\mid k) = (m\mid n,k)(n\mid k)= (m,n\mid k)&lt;/math&gt;

===Probability of ''M'' knowing ''N'' and ''K''===
The expression 
:&lt;math&gt; (m \mid n,k)=(M=m \mid N=n,K=k)&lt;/math&gt; 
is the conditional probability that the maximum serial number observed, ''M'', is equal to ''m'', when the number of enemy tanks, ''N'', is known to be equal to ''n'', and the number of enemy tanks observed, ''K'', is known to be equal to ''k''.

It is
:&lt;math&gt;
  (m\mid n,k) =
    \binom{m - 1}{k - 1}\binom{n}{k}^{-1}[k\le m][m\le n]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \binom n k&lt;/math&gt; is a [[binomial coefficient]] and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle [k\le n]&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Iverson bracket]].

===Probability of ''M'' knowing only ''K''===
The expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (m\mid k)=(M=m\mid K=k)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the maximum serial number is equal to ''m'' once ''k'' tanks have been observed but before the serial numbers have actually been observed.

The expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (m\mid k)&lt;/math&gt; can be re-written in terms of the other quantities by marginalizing over all possible &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  (m\mid k)
    &amp;=(m\mid k)\cdot 1 \\
    &amp;=(m\mid k){\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n\mid m,k)} \\
    &amp;=(m\mid k){\sum_{n=0}^\infty(m\mid n,k)\frac {(n\mid k)}{(m\mid k)}} \\
    &amp;=\sum_{n=0}^\infty(m\mid n,k)(n\mid k)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Credibility of ''N'' knowing only ''K''===
The expression 
:&lt;math&gt;(n\mid k)=(N=n\mid K=k)&lt;/math&gt; 
is the credibility that the total number of tanks, ''N'', is equal to ''n'' when the number ''K'' tanks observed is known to be ''k'', but before the serial numbers have been observed. Assume that it is some [[discrete uniform distribution]]  
:&lt;math&gt;  (n\mid k) =     (\Omega - k)^{-1}[k \le n][n &lt; \Omega]&lt;/math&gt;

The upper limit  &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; must be finite, because the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) =\lim_{\Omega\rarr\infty}(\Omega - k)^{-1}[k \le n][n &lt; \Omega]=0&lt;/math&gt;
is not a mass distribution function.

===Credibility of ''N'' knowing  ''M'' and ''K''===
:&lt;math&gt;  (n\mid m,k) = (m\mid n,k)\left(\sum_{n=m}^{\Omega - 1} (m\mid n,k)\right)^{-1}[m \le n][n &lt; \Omega]&lt;/math&gt;

If ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sum_{n=m}^\infty(m\mid n,k)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and the unwelcome variable &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Omega&lt;/math&gt; disappears from the expression.

:&lt;math&gt;  (n\mid m,k) = (m\mid n,k)\left(\sum_{n=m}^{\infty} (m\mid n,k)\right)^{-1}[m \le n ]&lt;/math&gt;
For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 the [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of the distribution of the number of enemy tanks is ''m''.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, the credibility that the number of enemy tanks is ''equal to'' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is
:&lt;math&gt;
  (N=n\mid m,k) = (k - 1)\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}k^{-1}\binom n k^{-1}[m \le n ]
&lt;/math&gt;

The credibility that the number of enemy tanks, ''N'', is ''greater than n'', is
:&lt;math&gt;
 (N&gt;n\mid m,k)= \begin{cases}
    1                                              &amp;\text{if } n &lt; m \\
    \frac {\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom n {k - 1}} &amp;\text{if } n \ge m
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Mean value and standard deviation===
For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3, ''N'' has the finite [[mean value]]:
:&lt;math&gt;(m - 1)(k - 1)(k - 2)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;4, ''N'' has the finite [[standard deviation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;(k - 1)^{1/2}(k - 2)^{-1}(k - 3)^{-1/2}(m - 1)^{1/2}(m + 1 - k)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
These formulas are derived below.

===Summation formula===
The following [[Binomial coefficient#Identities involving binomial coefficients|binomial coefficient identity]] is used below for simplifying [[series (mathematics)|series]] relating to the German Tank Problem.
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac 1 {\binom n k} = \frac k{k - 1}\frac 1 {\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

This sum formula is somewhat analogous to the integral formula
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{n=m}^\infty \frac {dn}{n^k} = \frac 1{k - 1}\frac 1{m^{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

These formulas apply for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

===One tank===
Observing one tank randomly out of a population of ''n'' tanks gives the serial number ''m'' with probability 1/''n'' for ''m''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', and zero probability for ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''. Using [[Iverson bracket]] notation this is written
:&lt;math&gt;(M=m\mid N=n,K=1) = (m\mid n) = \frac{[m \le n]}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the conditional probability mass distribution function of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m&lt;/math&gt;.

When considered a function of ''n'' for fixed ''m'' this is a likelihood function.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(n) = \frac{[n\ge m]}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[maximum likelihood]] estimate for the total number of tanks is ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''.

The total likelihood is [[Infinity|infinite]], being a tail of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]].

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n \mathcal{L}(n) = \sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac{1}{n} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

but
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum_n \mathcal{L}(n)[n &lt; \Omega]
    &amp;= \sum_{n=m}^{\Omega - 1} \frac{1}{n} \\[5pt]
    &amp;= H_{\Omega-1} - H_{m - 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[harmonic number]].

The credibility mass distribution function depends on the prior limit &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Omega&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N=n\mid M=m,K=1) \\[5pt]
  = {} &amp;(n\mid m) = \frac{[m\le n]}{n} \frac{[n&lt;\Omega]}{H_{\Omega - 1} - H_{m - 1}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The mean value of  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum_n n\cdot(n\mid m) &amp;= \sum_{n=m}^{\Omega - 1} \frac{1}{H_{\Omega - 1} - H_{m - 1}} \\[5pt]
                     &amp;= \frac{\Omega - m}{H_{\Omega - 1} - H_{m - 1}} \\[5pt]
                     &amp;\approx \frac{\Omega - m}{\log\left(\frac{\Omega - 1}{m - 1} \right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Two tanks===
If two tanks rather than one are observed, then the probability that the larger of the observed two serial numbers is equal to ''m'', is

:&lt;math&gt;(M=m\mid N=n,K=2) = (m\mid n) = [m \le n]\frac{m - 1}{\binom{n}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

When considered a function of ''n'' for fixed ''m'' this is a [[likelihood function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(n) = [n \ge m]\frac{m - 1}{\binom{n}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The total likelihood is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum_{n}\mathcal{L}(n) &amp;= \frac{m - 1}{1} \sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac{1}{\binom n 2} \\
                         &amp;= \frac{m - 1}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{2 - 1} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom {m - 1}{2 - 1}} \\
                         &amp;= 2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and the credibility mass distribution function is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N=n\mid M=m,K=2) \\
  = {} &amp;(n\mid m) \\
  = {} &amp;\frac{\mathcal{L}(n)}{\sum_n \mathcal{L}(n)} \\
  = {} &amp;[n \ge m]\frac{m - 1}{n(n - 1)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[median]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tilde{N}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n [n \ge \tilde{N}](n\mid m) = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

so
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m - 1}{\tilde N - 1} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and so the median is
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{N} = 2m - 1&lt;/math&gt;

but the mean value of ''N'' is infinite
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \sum_n n \cdot (n\mid m) = \frac{m - 1}1\sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac{1}{n - 1} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

===Many tanks===

====Credibility mass distribution function====
The conditional probability that the largest of ''k'' observations taken from the serial numbers {1,...,''n''}, is equal to ''m'', is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(M=m\mid N=n,K=k\ge 2) \\
  = {} &amp;(m\mid n,k) \\
  = {} &amp;[m\le n]\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{n}{k}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The likelihood function of ''n'' is the same expression
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(n) = [n \ge m]\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{n}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

The total likelihood is finite for ''k'' ≥ 2:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum_n \mathcal{L}(n)
    &amp;= \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{1} \sum_{n=m}^\infty {1 \over \binom n k} \\
    &amp;= \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{1} \cdot \frac{k}{k-1} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}} \\
    &amp;= \frac k{k - 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The credibility mass distribution function is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N=n\mid M=m,K=k \ge 2) = (n\mid m,k) \\
  = {} &amp;\frac{\mathcal{L}(n)}{\sum_n \mathcal{L}(n)} \\
  = {} &amp;[n\ge m]\frac{k-1}{k} \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom n k} \\
  = {} &amp;[n\ge m]\frac{m-1}{n} \frac{\binom{m - 2}{k - 2}}{\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}} \\
  = {} &amp;[n\ge m]\frac{m-1}{n} \frac{m - 2}{n - 1} \frac{k - 1}{k - 2}  \frac{\binom{m - 3}{k - 3}}{\binom{n-2}{k-2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[complementary cumulative distribution function]] is the credibility that ''N'' &gt; ''x''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N&gt;x\mid M=m,K=k) \\
  = {} &amp;\begin{cases}
                                    1 &amp;\text{if }x   &lt; m \\
          \sum_{n=x+1}^\infty (n\mid m,k) &amp;\text{if }x \ge m
        \end{cases} \\
  = {} &amp;[x&lt;m] + [x \ge m]\sum_{n=x+1}^\infty \frac{k - 1}{k}\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{N}{k}} \\
  = {} &amp;[x&lt;m] + [x \ge m]\frac{k - 1}{k} \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{1} \sum_{n=x+1}^\infty \frac{1}{\binom{n}{k}} \\
  = {} &amp;[x&lt;m] + [x \ge m]\frac{k - 1}{k} \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{1} \cdot \frac{k}{k - 1} \frac{1}{\binom{x}{k - 1}} \\
  = {} &amp;[x&lt;m] + [x \ge m]\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{x}{k - 1}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[cumulative distribution function]] is the credibility that ''N'' ≤ ''x''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N\le x\mid M=m,K=k) \\
  = {} &amp;1 - (N&gt;x\mid M=m,K=k) \\
  = {} &amp;[x \ge m]\left(1 - \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{x}{k - 1}}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====Order of magnitude====

The order of magnitude of the number of enemy tanks is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mu &amp;= \sum_n n\cdot(N=n\mid M=m,K=k) \\&amp;
       = \sum_n n [n\ge m]\frac {m-1}n \frac {\binom{m-2}{k-2}}{\binom{n-1}{k-1}}  \\&amp;
       = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{\binom{m-2}{k-2}}1\sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac 1{\binom{n-1}{k-1}}\\&amp;
       = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{\binom{m-2}{k-2}}1 \cdot \frac{k-1}{k-2}\frac {1}{\binom{m-2}{k-2}}\\&amp;
       = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{k-1}{k-2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====Statistical uncertainty====

The statistical uncertainty is the standard deviation ''σ'', satisfying the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 + \mu^2 = \sum_n n^2 \cdot (N=n\mid M=m,K=k)&lt;/math&gt;

So
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sigma^2+\mu^2-\mu &amp;= \sum_n n(n-1)\cdot(N=n\mid M=m,K=k)\\&amp;
                      = \sum_{n=m}^\infty n(n-1)\frac{m-1}n \frac{m-2}{n-1} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \frac{\binom{m-3}{k-3}}{\binom{n-2}{k-2}}\\&amp;
                      = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{m-2}1 \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \frac{\binom{m-3}{k-3}}1 \sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac 1{\binom{n-2}{k-2}}\\
&amp; = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{m-2}1 \frac{k-1}{k-2} \frac{\binom{m-3}{k-3}}1 \frac{k-2}{k-3} \frac 1{\binom{m-3}{k-3}}\\
&amp; = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{m-2}1 \frac{k-1}{k-3}\\&amp;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sigma &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{m-1}1 \frac{m-2}1 \frac{k-1}{k-3}+\mu-\mu^2} \\&amp;
          = \sqrt{\frac{(k-1)(m-1)(m-k+1)}{(k-3)(k-2)^2}} \\&amp;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[variance-to-mean ratio]] is simply
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma^2}\mu = \frac{m - k + 1}{(k - 3)(k - 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7276">The '''Grit, not grass hypothesis''' is an evolutionary hypothesis that explains the evolution of high-crowned teeth, particularly in New World mammals. The hypothesis is that the ingestion of gritty [[soil]] is the primary driver of [[hypsodont]] tooth development, not the [[silica]]-rich composition of [[grass]], as was previously thought.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jardine|first1=Phillip E.|last2=Janis|first2=Christine M.|last3=Sahney|first3=Sarda|last4=Benton|first4=Michael J.|authorlink4 = Michael Benton|title=Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=2012|volume=365-366|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional Coevolution Hypothesis==
Since the morphology of the hypsodont tooth is suited to a more abrasive diet, hypsodonty was thought to have evolved concurrently with the spread of [[grasslands]]. During the [[Cretaceous]] Period (145-66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] called the [[Western Interior Seaway]] which began to recede during the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Paleocene]] (65-55 million years ago), leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain. During the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs (25 million years), the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new [[Ecological niche|niche]] for mammals, including many [[ungulate]]s that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Grass contains silica-rich phytoliths (abrasive granules), which wear away dental tissue more quickly. So the spread of grasslands was linked to the development of high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth in grazers.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Modern Evolutionary Hypothesis==
===Early Evidence===
In 2006 Strömberg examined the independent acquisition of high-crowned cheek teeth (hypsodonty) in several ungulate lineages (e.g., [[camelid]]s, [[equid]]s, rhinoceroses) from the early to middle Miocene of North America, which had been classically linked to the spread of grasslands She showed habitats dominated by [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 grasses]] (cool-season grasses) were established in the [[Central Great Plains]] by early late [[Arikareean]] (≥21.9 Million years ago), at least 4 million years prior to the emergence of hypsodonty in [[Equidae]].&lt;ref name="Stromberg2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Caroline A. E. Strömberg | year=2006 | title=Evolution of hypsodonty in equids: testing a hypothesis of adaptation | journal=Paleobiology | volume=32 | pages=236–258|url=http://depts.washington.edu/strmbrgl/StrombergLab_website/Publications_files/Stromberg_2006.pdf | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2006)32[236:eohiet]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Mendoza and Palmqvist determined the relative importance of grass consumption and open habitat foraging in the development of hypsodont teeth using a dataset of 134 species of [[artiodactyl]]s and [[perissodactyl]]s. The results suggested that high-crowned teeth represent are adapted for a particular feeding environment, not diet preference. &lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=M.|last2=Palmqvist|first2=P.|title=Hypsodonty in ungulates: an adaptation for grass consumption or for foraging in open habitat?|journal=Journal of Zoology|date=February 2008|volume=274|issue=2|pages=134–142|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00365.x|url=http://webpersonal.uma.es/de/ppb/Hypsodonty%20in%20ungulates.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===
Further, examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes.&lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"&gt;{{Citation | author=Billet, Blondel, and Muizon | title=Dental microwear analysis of notoungulates (Mammalia) from Salla (Late Oligocene, Bolivia) and discussion on their precocious hypsodonty| journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of dental microwear patterns of hypsodont [[notoungulates]] from the Late Oligocene Salla Beds of Bolivia showed shearing movements are associated with a diet rich in tough plants, not necessarily grasses. That the relationship between high-crowned mammals and the source of tooth wear in the fossil record may not be straightforward, hence the spread of grasslands in South America, traditionally linked with the development of notoungulate hypsodonty, is in question.&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009" /&gt;

Observations of hypsodonty development in Cenozoic mammals is also supported by the evolution of hypsodonty in other groups. For example, [[hadrosaurs]], a group of herbivorous [[dinosaurs]], likely grazed on low-lying vegetation and microwear patterns show that their diet contained an abrasive material, such as grit or silica. Grasses had evolved by the Late Cretaceous, but were not particularly common, so this study concluded that grass probably did not play a major component in the hadrosaur's diet.&lt;ref name="AP0629"&gt;{{Citation  |title=Hadrosaur chowdown — grind, grind, grind |journal=Associated Press | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal Discontinuity===
Most importantly, evidence has shown, that the development of hypsodonty is out of sync with the flourishing of grasslands both in North America and South America, where grasslands spread 10 millions years earlier.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"/&gt;

==Hypsodonty==
Hypsodonty is observed both in the fossil record and the modern world. It is a characteristic of large [[clades]] (equids) as well as subspecies level specialization. For example, the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]] and the [[Javan rhinoceros]] both have [[brachydont]], lophodont cheek teeth whereas the [[Indian rhinoceros]], has hypsodont dentition. A mammal may have exclusively hypsodont molars or have a mix of dentitions. Hypsodont dentition is characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=John J.|last2=Wyss|first2=André R.|last3=Charrier|first3=Reynaldo|author-link3=Reynaldo Charrier|title=South America's Missing Mammals|journal=Scientific American|date=May 2007|volume=296|issue=5|pages=68–75|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0507-68|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v296/n5/full/scientificamerican0507-68.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwan-Tufts"&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:HEXAGONALPHASE1.JPG|thumb|right|Schematic of the molecular organisation in a type I hexagonal lyotropic liquid crystalline phase.]]
A '''hexagonal phase''' of [[lyotropic liquid crystal]] is formed by some amphiphilic molecules when they are mixed with water or another polar solvent. In this phase, the [[amphiphile]] molecules are aggregated into cylindrical structures of indefinite length and these cylindrical aggregates are disposed on a hexagonal lattice, giving the phase long-range orientational order.

In [[normal topology]] hexagonal phases, which are formed by [[type I amphiphiles]], the hydrocarbon chains are contained within the cylindrical aggregates such that the polar-apolar interface has a positive [[mean curvature]]. [[Inverse topology]] hexagonal phases have water within the cylindrical aggregates and the hydrocarbon chains fill the voids between the hexagonally packed cylinders. Normal topology hexagonal phases are denoted by H&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; while inverse topology hexagonal phases are denoted by H&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;. When viewed by [[polarization microscopy]], thin films of both normal and inverse topology hexagonal phases exhibit [[birefringence]], giving rise to characteristic optical textures. Typically, these textures are smoke-like, fan-like or mosaic in appearance. The phases are highly viscous and small air bubbles trapped within the preparation have highly distorted shapes. Size and shapes of lamellar, micellar and hexagonal phases of [[lipid bilayer phase behavior]] and mixed [[lipid polymorphism]] in aqueous dispersions can be easily identified and characterized by [[negative staining]] transmission electron microscopy too.&lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3111">The '''Institute of Jewish Affairs''' (IJA) was founded in February 1941 as a research institute to provide analysis of political, legal and economic issues affecting Jewish life.

==History==
The Institute of Jewish Affairs was launched and sponsored by the [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC) and the [[American Jewish Congress]]. IJA’s headquarters were situated in [[New York City]] until 1965 when the institution relocated to [[London]]. In 1994 it was reestablished in London as [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Troen, Selwyn Illan (1999) “Jewish Centers and Peripheries: Europe Between America and Israel Fifty Years After World War II,” Transaction Publishers, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute’s founder Dr [[Jacob Robinson]] argued that Jewish leaders, struggling for the interests of the Jewry after [[World War I]], “were hampered by the lack of up-to-date information on the situation of the Jews and no less by the lack of research into relevant legal and political options.”&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, Cohen (2010 a). "Dr. Jacob Robinson, the Institute of Jewish Affairs and the Elusive Jewish voice in Nuremberg," David Bankier and Dan Michman (eds.), Holocaust and Justice: representation and Historiography of the Holocaust in Post-War Trials, Yad Vashem and Berghahn Books, Jerusalem, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The IJA was established to bridge the gap. The Institute’s research focused on the analysis of the political, legal and economic aspects of Jewish life since [[World War I]]. Their reports examined a number of topics including: the situation of Jewish communities in various countries, [[anti-Semitism]], human rights related to minorities and migration, and the [[Holocaust]] and its aftermath.  The organization was also involved in formulating a postwar policy to secure Jewish rights and freedom internationally.

Dr [[Jacob Robinson]], IJA’s founder, served as its first director (1941–1947). He was succeeded by [[Nehemiah Robinson]] (1947–1964) and [[Oscar Karbach]] (1964–1973).&lt;ref name="AJA"&gt;American Jewish Archives (2002) A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982 (bulk 1940-1980).

[[File:2002-10-26 11-15 (Andalusien &amp; Lissabon 263) Lissabon, Belém, Torre de Belém.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Tower of Belém]], in Lisbon, is one of the most representative examples of Manueline style.]]
[[File:View from the Cloisters in the Jerónimos Monastery.JPG|thumb|300px|Manueline ornamentation in the cloisters of [[Jerónimos Monastery]], Belem, Portugal]]

The '''Manueline''' ({{lang-pt|estilo manuelino}}, {{IPA-pt|ɨʃˈtilu mɐnweˈɫinu|IPA}}), or '''Portuguese late Gothic''', is the sumptuous, composite [[Portugal|Portuguese]] style of architectural ornamentation of the first decades of the 16th century, incorporating maritime elements and representations of the discoveries brought from the voyages of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]. This innovative style synthesizes aspects of Late [[Gothic architecture]] with influences of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Plateresque]] style, [[Mudéjar]],  [[Italy|Italian]] urban architecture, and [[Flanders|Flemish]] elements. It marks the transition from [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] to Renaissance. The construction of churches and monasteries in Manueline was largely financed by proceeds of the lucrative [[spice trade]] with Africa and India.

The style was given its name, many years later, by [[Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen]], Viscount of Porto Seguro, in his 1842 book, ''Noticia historica e descriptiva do Mosteiro de Belem, com um glossario de varios termos respectivos principalmente a architectura gothica'', in his description of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]]. Varnhagen named the style after [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]], whose reign (1495–1521) coincided with its development. The style was much influenced by the astonishing successes of the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]] of Portuguese navigators, from the coastal areas of Africa to the discovery of Brazil and the ocean routes to the Far East, drawing heavily on the style and decorations of East Indian temples.

Although the period of this style did not last long (from 1490 to 1520), it played an important part in the development of Portuguese art. The influence of the style outlived the king. Celebrating the newly maritime power, it manifested itself in architecture (churches, monasteries, palaces, castles) and extended into other arts such as sculpture, painting, works of art made of precious metals, [[faience]] and furniture.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Convento Cristo December 2008-11.jpg|thumb|upright|The window of the Convent of Christ in Tomar is a well-known example of Manueline style]]
[[Image:Mosteiro dos Jeronimos - Igreja 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Manueline interior of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in [[Lisbon]]]]

This decorative style is characterized by virtuoso complex ornamentation in portals, windows, columns and arcades. In its end period it tended to become excessively exuberant as in Tomar.

Several elements appear regularly in these intricately carved stoneworks:
* elements used on ships: the [[armillary]] sphere (a navigational instrument and the personal emblem of Manuel I and also symbol of the [[cosmos]]), spheres, anchors, anchor chains, ropes and cables.
* elements from the sea, such as shells, pearls and strings of seaweed.
* botanical motifs such as laurel branches, oak leaves, acorns, poppy capsules, corncobs, thistles.
* symbols of Christianity such as the cross of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] (former Templar knights), the military order that played a prominent role and helped finance the first voyages of discovery. The cross of this order decorated the sails of the Portuguese ships.
* elements from newly discovered lands (such as the tracery in the ''Claustro Real'' in the [[Monastery of Batalha]], suggesting Islamic [[filigree]] work, influenced by buildings in India)
* columns carved like twisted strands of rope
* semicircular arches (instead of Gothic pointed arches) of doors and windows, sometimes consisting of three or more convex curves
* multiple pillars
* eight-sided capitals
* lack of symmetry
* conical [[pinnacle]]s
* bevelled crenellations
* ornate portals with niches or [[canopy (building)|canopies]].

==Examples==
When King Manuel I died in 1521, he had funded 62 construction projects. However, much original Manueline architecture in Portugal was lost or damaged beyond restoration in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] and subsequent [[tsunami]]. In [[Lisbon]], the [[Ribeira Palace]], residence of King Manuel I, and the [[Hospital Real de Todos os Santos]] (''All-Saints Hospital'') were destroyed, along with several churches. The city, however, still has outstanding examples of the style in the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] (mainly designed by [[Diogo Boitac]] and [[Juan de Castillo|João de Castilho]]) and in the small fortress of the [[Belém Tower]] (designed by [[Francisco de Arruda]]). Both are located close to each other in the [[Belém, Lisbon|Belém neighbourhood]]. The portal of the [[Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição Velha]], in [[Baixa Pombalina|downtown Lisbon]], has also survived destruction.

[[File:Jerónimos April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|Manueline exterior of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in [[Lisbon]].]]
Outside Lisbon, the church and chapter house of the [[Convent of the Order of Christ]] at [[Tomar]] (designed by [[Diogo de Arruda]]) is a major Manueline monument. In particular, the large window of the chapter house, with its fantastic sculptured organic and twisted rope forms, is one of the most extraordinary achievements of the Manueline style.

Other major Manueline monuments include the arcade screens of the Royal Cloister (designed by [[Diogo Boitac]]) and the Unfinished Chapels (designed by [[Mateus Fernandes]]) at the [[Monastery of Batalha]] and the [[Palace of Sintra|Royal Palace of Sintra]].

Other remarkable Manueline buildings include the church of the [[Monastery of Jesus of Setúbal]] (one of the earliest Manueline churches, also designed by Diogo Boitac), the [[Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]], the main churches in [[Golegã]], [[Vila do Conde]], [[Moura Municipality|Moura]], [[Caminha]], [[Olivenza|Olivença]] and portions of the cathedrals of [[Braga Cathedral|Braga]] (main chapel), [[Viseu]] (rib vaulting of the nave) and [[Catedral da Guarda|Guarda]] (main portal, pillars, vaulting). Civil buildings in Manueline style exist in [[Évora]] (home to the  Évora Royal Palace of 1525, by Pedro de Trillo, Diogo de Arruda and Francisco de Arruda) and the [[Castle of Évoramonte]] of 1531), [[Viana do Castelo, Portugal|Viana do Castelo]], [[Guimarães]] and some other towns.

The style was extended to the decorative arts and spread throughout the [[Portuguese Empire]], to the islands of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], enclaves in [[North Africa]], [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], [[Goa]] in [[Portuguese India]] and even [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], China. Its influence is apparent in southern Spain, the Canary Islands, North Africa and the former Spanish colonies of Peru and Mexico.

In [[electronics]], '''Mason's invariant''', named after [[Samuel Jefferson Mason]], is a measure of the quality of [[transistor]]s.

"When trying to solve a seemingly difficult problem, Sam said to concentrate on the easier ones first; the rest, including the hardest ones, will follow," recalled [[Andrew Viterbi]], co-founder and former vice-president of [[Qualcomm]]. He had been a thesis advisee under Samuel Mason at [[MIT]], and this was one lesson he especially remembered from his professor.&lt;ref name='news_office'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Entrepreneur endows chair; Rivest is holder | date=2000-08-09 | publisher=MIT | url =http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/rivest-0809.html | work =MIT News | pages = | accessdate = 2007-05-08 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years earlier, Mason had heeded his own advice when he defined a unilateral [[power gain]] for a linear [[two-port network|two-port]] device, or U. After concentrating on easier problems with power gain in feedback [[amplifier]]s, a [[figure of merit]] for all three-terminal devices followed that is still used today as Mason's Invariant.&lt;ref name='Gupta'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Power Gain in Feedback Amplifiers, a Classic Revisited |journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques |date=May 1992 |first=Madhu |last=Gupta |coauthors= |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=864–879 |id= |url=http://rfic.eecs.berkeley.edu/~niknejad/ee217sp05/mason.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-08 |doi=10.1109/22.137392 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418064920/http://rfic.eecs.berkeley.edu/~niknejad/ee217sp05/mason.pdf |archivedate=2007-04-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

In 1953, [[transistors]] were only five years old, and they were the only successful, three-terminal [[passivity (engineering)|active device]]. They were beginning to be used for [[Radio frequency|RF]] applications, and they were limited to [[VHF]] frequencies and below. Mason wanted to find a figure of merit to compare transistors, and this led him to discover that the unilateral power [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of a linear [[two-port network|two-port]] device was an invariant figure of merit.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

In his paper ''Power Gain in Feedback Amplifiers'' published in 1953, Mason stated in his introduction, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"A [[vacuum tube]], very often represented as a simple [[transconductance]] driving a passive impedance, may lead to relatively simple amplifier designs in which the input impedance (and hence the [[power gain]]) is effectively infinite, the voltage gain is the quantity of interest, and the input circuit is isolated from the load. The transistor, however, usually cannot be characterized so easily."&lt;ref name='Mason'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Power Gain in Feedback Amplifiers|journal=IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory|date=June 1954|first=Samuel|last=Mason|coauthors=|volume=1|issue=2|pages=20–25|id= |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/8148/23422/01083579.pdf?arnumber=1083579|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-08|doi=10.1109/TCT.1954.1083579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; He wanted to find a metric to characterize and measure the quality of transistors since up until then, no such measure existed.  His discovery turned out to have applications beyond transistors.

== Derivation of U ==

Mason first defined the device being studied with the three constraints listed below.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

# The device has only two ports (at which power can be transferred between it and outside devices).
# The device is linear (in its relationships of currents and voltages at the two ports).
# The device is used in a specified manner (connected as an [[amplifier]] between a linear [[one-port]] source and a linear one-port [[Electrical load|load]]).

Then, according to Madhu Gupta in ''Power Gain in Feedback Amplifiers, a Classic Revisited'', Mason defined the problem as "being the search for device properties that are invariant with respect to transformations as represented by an embedding network" that satisfy the four constraints listed below.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

# The embedding network is a four-port.
# The embedding network is linear.
# The embedding network is lossless.
# The embedding network is reciprocal.

He next showed that all transformations that satisfy the above constraints can be accomplished with just three simple transformations performed sequentially. Similarly, this is the same as representing an embedding network by a set of three embedding networks nested within one another. The three mathematical expressions can be seen below.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

1. Reactance padding:
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z'_{11} &amp; Z'_{12} \\
	Z'_{21} &amp; Z'_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z_{11}+jx_{11} &amp; Z_{12}+jx_{12} \\
	Z_{21}+jx_{21} &amp; Z_{22}+jx_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

2. Real Transformations:
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z'_{11} &amp; Z'_{12} \\
	Z'_{21} &amp; Z'_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	n_{11} &amp; n_{12} \\
	n_{21} &amp; n_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z_{11} &amp; Z_{12} \\
	Z_{21} &amp; Z_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	n_{11} &amp; n_{12} \\
	n_{21} &amp; n_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

3. Inversion:
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z'_{11} &amp; Z'_{12} \\
	Z'_{21} &amp; Z'_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	Z_{11} &amp; Z_{12} \\
	Z_{21} &amp; Z_{22}
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Mason then considered which quantities remained invariant under each of these three transformations. His conclusions, listed respectively to the transformations above, are shown below. Each transformation left the values below unchanged.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

1. Reactance padding:
&lt;math&gt;
\left [ Z-Z_{t} \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;
\left [ Z+Z^{*} \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

2. Real transformations:
&lt;math&gt;
\left [ Z-Z_{t} \right ]
\left [ Z+Z^{*} \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{\det{\left [ Z-Z_{t} \right ]}}{\det{\left [ Z+Z^{*} \right ]}}
&lt;/math&gt;

3. Inversion:
The magnitudes of the two determinants and the sign of the denominator in the above fraction remain unchanged in the inversion transformation. Consequently, the quantity invariant under all three conditions is:&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U &amp; =\dfrac{|\det{\left [ Z-Z_t \right ]}|}{\det{\left [ Z+Z^{*} \right ]}} \\
&amp; =
\dfrac{|Z_{12}-Z_{21}|^{2}}{4 (\operatorname{Re}[Z_{11}] Re[Z_{22}]-\operatorname{Re}[Z_{12}] \operatorname{Re}[Z_{21}])} \\
&amp; =
\dfrac{|Y_{21}-Y_{12}|^{2}}{4 (\operatorname{Re}[Y_{11}] \operatorname{Re}[Y_{22}]-\operatorname{Re}[Y_{12}] \operatorname{Re}[Y_{21}])}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Importance ==

Mason's Invariant, or U, is the only device characteristic that is invariant under lossless, reciprocal embeddings. In other words, U can be used as a figure of merit to compare any two-port active device (which includes three-terminal devices used as two-ports). For example, a factory producing [[BJT]]s can calculate U of the transistors it is producing and compare their quality to the other BJTs on the market. Furthermore, U can be used as an indicator of activity. If U is greater than one, the two-port device is active; otherwise, that device is passive. This is especially useful in the [[microwave]] engineering community. Though originally published in a circuit theory journal, Mason's paper becomes especially relevant to microwave engineers since U is usually slightly greater than or equal to one in the microwave frequency range. When U is smaller than or considerably larger than one, it becomes relatively useless.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

While Mason's Invariant can be used as a figure of merit across all operating frequencies, its value at '''''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''' is especially useful.  '''''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the maximum [[oscillation]] frequency of a device, and it is discovered when &lt;math&gt;U(f_\max) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. This frequency is also the frequency at which the maximum stable gain G&lt;sub&gt;ms&lt;/sub&gt; and the maximum available gain G&lt;sub&gt;ma&lt;/sub&gt; of the device become one. Consequently, '''''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''' is a characteristic of the device, and it has the significance that it is the maximum frequency of oscillation in a circuit where only one active device is present, the device is embedded in a passive network, and only single [[sinusoidal]] signals are of interest.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

== Conclusion ==
In his revisit of Mason's paper, Gupta states, "Perhaps the most convincing evidence of the utility of the concept of a unilateral power gain as a device figure of merit is the fact that for the last three decades, practically every new, active, two-port device developed for high frequency use has been carefully scrutinized for the achievable value of U..."&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt; This assumption is appropriate because "U&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;" or "maximum unilateral gain" is still listed on transistor specification sheets, and Mason's Invariant is still taught in some undergraduate electrical engineering curricula. Though now it has been over five decades, Mason's finding of an invariant device characteristic still plays a significant role in transistor design.

'''Motion planning''' (also known as the '''navigation problem''' or the '''piano mover's problem''') is a term used in [[robotics]] for the process of breaking down a desired movement task into discrete motions that satisfy movement constraints and possibly optimize some aspect of the movement.

For example, consider navigating a [[mobile robot]] inside a building to a distant waypoint.  It should execute this task while avoiding walls and not falling down stairs.  A motion planning algorithm would take a description of these tasks as input, and produce the speed and turning commands sent to the robot's wheels.  Motion planning algorithms might address robots with a larger number of joints (e.g., industrial manipulators), more complex tasks (e.g. manipulation of objects), different constraints (e.g., a car that can only drive forward), and uncertainty (e.g. imperfect models of the environment or robot).

Motion planning has several robotics applications, such as [[Autonomous robot|autonomy]], [[automation]], and robot design in [[CAD software]], as well as applications in other fields, such as animating [[digital character]]s, [[video game]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[architectural design]], [[robotic surgery]], and the study of [[biological molecule]]s.

==Concepts==
[[Image:Motion planning workspace 1.svg|thumb|Example of a workspace.]]
[[Image:Motion planning workspace 1 configuration space 1.svg|thumb|Configuration space of a point-sized robot. White = ''C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;'', gray = ''C&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;''.]]

A basic motion planning problem is to produce a continuous motion that connects a start configuration S and a goal configuration G, while avoiding collision with known obstacles.  The robot and obstacle geometry is described in a 2D or 3D ''workspace'', while the motion is represented as a path in (possibly higher-dimensional) [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].

===Configuration space===
A configuration describes the pose of the robot, and the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] C is the set of all possible configurations.  For example:
* If the robot is a single point (zero-sized) translating in a 2-dimensional plane (the workspace), C is a plane, and a configuration can be represented using two parameters (x, y).
* If the robot is a 2D shape that can translate and rotate, the workspace is still 2-dimensional.   However, C is the special Euclidean group '''SE'''(2) = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; '''SO'''(2) (where '''SO'''(2) is the [[special orthogonal group]] of 2D rotations), and a configuration can be represented using 3 parameters (x, y, θ).
* If the robot is a solid 3D shape that can translate and rotate, the workspace is 3-dimensional, but C is the special Euclidean group '''SE(3)''' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; '''SO'''(3), and a configuration requires 6 parameters: (x, y, z) for translation, and [[Euler angles]] (α, β, γ).
* If the robot is a fixed-base manipulator with N revolute joints (and no closed-loops), C is N-dimensional.

===Free space===
The set of configurations that avoids collision with obstacles is called the free space C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;.  The complement of C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; in C is called the obstacle or forbidden region.

Often, it is prohibitively difficult to explicitly compute the shape of C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;.  However, testing whether a given configuration is in C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; is efficient.  First, [[forward kinematics]] determine the position of the robot's geometry, and [[collision detection]] tests if the robot's geometry collides with the environment's geometry.

===Target space===
Target space is a [[linear subspace]] of free space which denotes where we want the robot to move to. In global motion planning, target space is observable by the robot's sensors. However, in local motion planning, the robot cannot observe the target space in some states. To solve this problem, the robot goes through several virtual target spaces, each of which is located within the observable area (around the robot). A virtual target space is called a sub-goal.

==Algorithms==
Low-dimensional problems can be solved with grid-based algorithms that overlay a grid on top of configuration space, or geometric algorithms that compute the shape and connectivity of C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;.

Exact motion planning for high-dimensional systems under complex constraints is computationally [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]].  Potential-field algorithms are efficient, but fall prey to local minima (an exception is the harmonic potential fields).  Sampling-based algorithms avoid the problem of local minima, and solve many problems quite quickly.
They are unable to determine that no path exists, but they have a probability of failure that decreases to zero as more time is spent.

Sampling-based algorithms are currently considered state-of-the-art for motion planning in high-dimensional spaces, and have been applied to problems which have dozens or even hundreds of dimensions (robotic manipulators, biological molecules, animated digital characters, and legged robots).

===Grid-based search===
Grid-based approaches overlay a grid on configuration space, and assume each configuration is identified with a grid point.  At each grid point, the robot is allowed to move to adjacent grid points as long as the line between them is completely contained within C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; (this is tested with collision detection).  This discretizes the set of actions, and [[search algorithms]] (like [[A* search algorithm|A*]]) are used to find a path from the start to the goal.

These approaches require setting a grid resolution.  Search is faster with coarser grids, but the algorithm will fail to find paths through narrow portions of C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;.  Furthermore, the number of points on the grid grows exponentially in the configuration space dimension, which make them inappropriate for high-dimensional problems.

Traditional grid-based approaches produce paths whose heading changes are constrained to multiples of a given base angle, often resulting in suboptimal paths. [[Any-angle path planning]] approaches find shorter paths by propagating information along grid edges (to search fast) without constraining their paths to grid edges (to find short paths).

Grid-based approaches often need to search repeatedly, for example, when the knowledge of the robot about the configuration space changes or the configuration space itself changes during path following. [[Incremental heuristic search]] algorithms replan fast by using experience with the previous similar path-planning problems to speed up their search for the current one.

===Interval-based search===
These approaches are similar to grid-based search approaches except that they generate a paving covering entirely the configuration space instead of a grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaulin|first=L.|title=Path planning using intervals and graphs|journal=Reliable Computing|year=2001|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/paper_cameleon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paving is decomposed into two [[subpaving]]s X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;,X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; made with boxes such that X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ⊂ C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Characterizing C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; amounts to solve a [[set inversion|set inversion problem]]. [[Interval arithmetic|Interval analysis]] could thus be used when C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be described by linear inequalities in order to have a guaranteed enclosure.

The robot is thus allowed to move freely in X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and cannot go outside X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. To both subpavings, a neighbor graph is built and paths can be found using algorithms such as [[Dijkstra's algorithm|Dijkstra]] or [[A* search algorithm|A*]]. When a path is feasible in X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, it is also feasible in C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;. When no path exists in X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from one initial configuration to the goal, we have the guarantee that no feasible path exists in C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;. As for the grid-based approach, the interval approach is inappropriate for high-dimensional problems, due to the fact that the number of boxes to be generated grows exponentially with respect to the dimension of configuration space.

An illustration is provided by the three figures on the right where a hook with two degrees of freedom has to move from the left to the right, avoiding two horizontal small segments. [[File:Graph2displaycolor.jpg|thumb|Motion from the initial configuration (blue) to the final configuration of the hook, avoiding the two obstacles (red segments). The left-bottom corner of the hook has to stay on the horizontal line, which makes the hook two degrees of freedom.]] 
[[File:Graph1sivia.jpg|thumb|Decomposition with boxes covering the configuration space: The subpaving X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the union all red boxes and the subpaving X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the union of red and green boxes. The path corresponds to the motion represented above.]]
[[File:Graph3cameleon.jpg|thumb|This figure corresponds to the same path as above but obtained with many fewer boxes.The algorithm avoids bisecting boxes in parts of the configuration space that do not influence the final result.]]
The decomposition with subpavings using interval analysis also makes it possible to characterize the topology of C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; such as counting its number of connected components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delanoue|first1=N.|last2=Jaulin|first2=L.|last3=Cottenceau|first3=B.|title=Counting the Number of Connected Components of a Set and Its Application to Robotics|journal=Applied Parallel Computing, Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2006|volume=3732|issue=1|url=http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/delanoueCounting.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reward-based algorithms===
Reward-based algorithms assume that the robot in each state (position and internal state, including direction) can choose between different actions (motion). However, the result of each action is not definite. In other words, outcomes (displacement) are partly random and partly under the control of the robot. The robot gets positive reward when it reaches the target and gets negative reward if it collides with an obstacle. These algorithms try to find a path which maximizes cumulative future rewards. The [[Markov decision process]] (MDP) is a popular mathematical framework that is used in many reward-based algorithms. The advantage of MDPs over other reward-based algorithms is that they generate the optimal path. The disadvantage of MDPs is that they limit the robot to choose from a finite set of actions. Therefore, the path is not smooth (similar to grid-based approaches).

===Artificial potential fields===
One approach is to treat the robot's configuration as a point in a potential field that combines attraction to the goal, and repulsion from obstacles.  The resulting trajectory is output as the path.  This approach has advantages in that the trajectory is produced with little computation.  However, they can become trapped in [[local minima]] of the potential field and fail to find a path, or can find a non-optimal path. The artificial potential fields can be treated as continuum equations similar to electrostatic potential fields (treating the robot like a point charge), or motion through the field can be discretized using a set of linguistic rules.

===Sampling-based algorithms===
Sampling-based algorithms represent the configuration space with a roadmap of sampled configurations.
A basic algorithm samples N configurations in C, and retains those in C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; to use as ''milestones''.  A roadmap is then constructed that connects two milestones P and Q if the line segment PQ is completely in C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;.  Again, collision detection is used to test inclusion in C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;.  To find a path that connects S and G, they are added to the roadmap.  If a path in the roadmap links S and G, the planner succeeds, and returns that path.  If not, the reason is not definitive: either there is no path in C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;, or the planner did not sample enough milestones.

These algorithms work well for high-dimensional configuration spaces, because unlike combinatorial algorithms, their running time is not (explicitly) exponentially dependent on the dimension of C.  They are also (generally) substantially easier to implement.  They are probabilistically complete, meaning the probability that they will produce a solution approaches 1 as more time is spent.  However, they cannot determine if no solution exists.

Given basic ''visibility'' conditions on C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;, it has been proven that as the number of configurations N grows higher, the probability that the above algorithm finds a solution approaches 1 exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visibility is not explicitly dependent on the dimension of C; it is possible to have a high-dimensional space with "good" visibility or a low-dimensional space with "poor" visibility.  The experimental success of sample-based methods suggests that most commonly seen spaces have good visibility.

There are many variants of this basic scheme:
* It is typically much faster to only test segments between nearby pairs of milestones, rather than all pairs.
* Nonuniform sampling distributions attempt to place more milestones in areas that improve the connectivity of the roadmap.
* [[Quasirandom]] samples typically produce a better covering of configuration space than [[pseudorandom]] ones, though some recent work argues that the effect of the source of randomness is minimal compared to the effect of the sampling distribution.
* It is possible to substantially reduce the number of milestones needed to solve a given problem by allowing curved eye sights (for example by crawling on the obstacles that block the way between two milestones &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* If only one or a few planning queries are needed, it is not always necessary to construct a roadmap of the entire space.  Tree-growing variants are typically faster for this case (single-query planning).  Roadmaps are still useful if many queries are to be made on the same space (multi-query planning)

==Completeness and performance==
A motion planner is said to be complete if the planner in finite time either produces a solution or correctly reports that there is none. Most complete algorithms are geometry-based. The performance of a complete planner is assessed by its [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]].

''Resolution completeness'' is the property that the planner is guaranteed to find a path if the resolution of an underlying grid is fine enough.  Most resolution complete planners are grid-based or interval-based.  The computational complexity of resolution complete planners is dependent on the number of points in the underlying grid, which is O(1/h&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;), where h is the resolution (the length of one side of a grid cell) and d is the configuration space dimension.

''Probabilistic completeness'' is the property that as more “work” is performed, the probability that the planner fails to find a path, if one exists, asymptotically approaches zero.  Several sample-based methods are probabilistically complete.  The performance of a probabilistically complete planner is measured by the rate of convergence.

''Incomplete'' planners do not always produce a feasible path when one exists.  Sometimes incomplete planners do work well in practice.

==Problem variants==
Many algorithms have been developed to handle variants of this basic problem.

[[File:Clippy-letter.PNG|frame|''Clippit'' (known as Clippy), the default assistant in Office 2000/XP/2003 (after the makeover). Clippit is asking if the user needs help.]]
The '''Office Assistant''' was an [[intelligent user interface]] for [[Microsoft Office]] that assisted users by way of an interactive animated character, which [[user interface|interfaced]] with the Office help content. It was included in [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft Office for Windows]] (versions 97 to 2003), in [[Microsoft Publisher]] and [[Microsoft Project]] (versions 98 to 2003), and [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft Office for Mac]] (versions 98 to 2004).

The default assistant in the English Windows version was named '''Clippit''' (commonly nicknamed '''Clippy'''), after a [[paperclip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/02/25/you_got_grammar/|title=Finding the grammar checker's frailties|first=Jan|last=Freeman|work=The Boston Globe|date=2007-02-25|accessdate=2007-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=designer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oddisgood.com/pages/cd-clippy.html |title=Clippy |website=Oddisgood.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was designed by Kevan J. Atteberry on a [[Macintosh]] computer.&lt;ref name=designer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xyj55a/microsoft-clippy-creator-interview-kevin-atteberry|title=Clippy’s Designer Wants to Know Who Got Clippy Pregnant|date=2017-04-26|work=Motherboard|access-date=2018-08-12|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clippit was the default and by far the most notable Assistant (partly because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other assistants), which also led to it being called simply the '''Microsoft Paperclip'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newrisingmedia.com/all/2012/6/2/the-microsoft-paperclip-is-back.html |title=The Microsoft Paperclip Is Back |website=Newrisingmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Clippit in [[Microsoft Office 97|Office 97]] was given a new look in [[Microsoft Office 2000|Office 2000]].

The feature drew a strongly negative response from many users.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/apr/11/advertising2 |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Microsoft cuts 'Mr Clippy' |first=Claire |last=Cozens |date=2001-04-11 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-05-03-clippy-campaign.htm |work=USA Today |title=Microsoft banks on anti-Clippy sentiment |date=2002-02-06 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft turned off the feature by default in [[Microsoft Office XP|Office XP]], acknowledging its unpopularity in an ad campaign spoofing Clippy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Luening |first=Erich |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-255671.html |title=Microsoft tool "Clippy" gets pink slip |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature was removed altogether in [[Microsoft Office 2007|Office 2007]] and [[Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac|Office 2008 for Mac]], as it continued to draw criticism even from Microsoft employees.

The default assistant Clippit has been heavily mocked in popular culture, being [[parody|parodied]], appearing in [[Internet meme|memes]], and even being made fun of by Microsoft themselves from 2001 onwards.

==Overview==
According to [[Alan Cooper]], the "Father of Visual Basic," the concept of Clippit was based on a "tragic misunderstanding" of research conducted at [[Stanford University]], showing that the same part of the [[brain]] in use while using a [[computer mouse|mouse]] or [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] was also responsible for emotional reactions while interacting with other [[human|human being]]s and thus is the reason people yell at their [[computer monitor]]s.&lt;ref name="AlanCooper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/g4tv.com-video4080|title=g4tv.com-video4080: Why People Yell at Their Computer Monitors and Hate Microsoft's Clippy|first=|last=G4TV. com|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2016|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software.&lt;ref name="AlanCooper"/&gt; As people already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.&lt;ref name="AlanCooper"/&gt;

First introduced in [[Microsoft Office 97]],&lt;ref name="97rtm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/1996/11/19/microsoft-office-97-released-to-manufacturing/ |title=Microsoft Office 97 Released to Manufacturing |publisher=Microsoft |date=1996-11-19 |accessdate=2016-11-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125060125/http://news.microsoft.com/1996/11/19/microsoft-office-97-released-to-manufacturing/ |archivedate=2014-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/techtalk/archive/2005/12/16/504872.aspx |title=PM at Microsoft |author=Steven Sinofsky |publisher=blogs.msdn.com |date=2005-12-16 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared when the program determined the user could be assisted with using Office wizards, searching help, or advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear with the message, "''It looks like you're writing a [[Letter (message)|letter]]. Would you like help?''".

===Assistants===
Apart from Clippit, other Office Assistants were also available:
*The Dot (a shape-shifting [[smiley]]-faced red ball)
*Hoverbot (a robot)
*The Genius (a caricature of [[Albert Einstein]], removed in Office XP but available as a downloadable add-on)
*Office Logo (a jigsaw puzzle)
*Mother Nature (a globe)
*Scribble (an origami-esque cat)
*Power Pup (a superhero dog)
*Will (a caricature of [[William Shakespeare]]).

In many cases the Office installation [[Compact Disc|CD]] was necessary to activate a different Office assistant character, so the default character, Clippit, remains widely known compared to other Office Assistants.

In Office 2000, the ''Hoverbot'', ''Scribble'' and ''Power Pup'' assistants were replaced by:
*F1 (a robot)
*Links (a cat)
*Rocky (a dog)

The Clippit and Office Logo assistants were also redesigned. The removed assistants later resurfaced as downloadable add-ons.

The Microsoft Office XP Multilingual Pack had two more assistants, {{Nihongo|''Saeko Sensei''|冴子先生|}}, an animated secretary, and a version of the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]] ({{zh|t=孫悟空}}) for Asian language users in non-Asian Office versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiyou-k.jp/fumiovol14.htm |title=フミオ君のボヤキ 第14回 『ワード』のイルカ |publisher=Kaiyou-k.jp |date=2004-07-18 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native language versions provided additional representations, such as Kairu the [[dolphin]] in Japanese.

[[File:Clippy_Hidden_in_office.png|thumb|right|Clippit, hidden.]]
A small image of Clippit can be found in Office 2013 or newer, which could be enabled by going to Options and changing the theme to "School Supplies". Clippit would then appear on the ribbon.

==Technology==
The Office Assistant used technology initially from [[Microsoft Bob]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watters|first1=Audrey|title=Clippy and the History of the Future of Educational Chatbots|url=http://hackeducation.com/2016/09/14/chatbot|website=Hacked Education|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Microsoft Agent]], offering advice based on [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swartz|first1=Luke|title=Why People Hate the Paperclip: Labels, Appearance, Behavior and Social Responses to User Interface Agents|url=http://xenon.stanford.edu/~lswartz/paperclip/paperclip.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Office 2000 onwards, [[Microsoft Agent]] (.acs) replaced the [[Microsoft Bob]]-descended Actor (.act) format as the technology supporting the feature. Users can add other assistants to the folder where Office is installed for them to show up in the Office application, or install in the Microsoft Agent folder in [[Special folder#List of special folders|System32]] folder. Microsoft Agent-based characters have richer forms and colors, and are not enclosed within a boxed window. Furthermore, the Office Assistant could use the Lernout &amp; Hauspie TruVoice Text-to-Speech Engine to provide output speech capabilities to Microsoft Agent, but it required SAPI 4.0. The Microsoft Speech Recognition Engine allowed the Office Assistant to accept speech input&lt;small&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msagentring.org/setup.aspx|title=Microsoft Agent Ring|last=Bell|first=msagentring.org - Gordon Scott|website=msagentring.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibility===
The [[Microsoft Agent]] components it required were not included in [[Windows 7]] or later; however, they can be downloaded from the Microsoft website. Installation of Microsoft Agent on [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]] is also possible. When desktop compositing with [[Windows_Aero|Aero glass]] is enabled on Windows Vista or 7, or when running on Windows 8 or newer, the normally transparent space around the Office Assistant becomes solid-colored pink, blue, or green.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902074943/http://www.microsoft.com:80/products/msagent/main.aspx|title=Microsoft Agent home page|last=|first=|date=1 May 2009|website=|archive-url=http://www.microsoft.com:80/products/msagent/main.aspx|archive-date=2 September 2012|dead-url=|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional downloadable assistants==
&lt;!-- Hello. Before adding more assistants here please make sure that they were not included in any Office versions. If they were included as part of Office, list them in the above section. This section is for assistants which were exclusively available via download. Also note that some Office 97 assistants were bundled with later versions. Do not add them here. --&gt;

Since their introduction, more assistants have been released and have been exclusively available via download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/177929 |title=Office Assistant Animations Start Slowly |accessdate=2007-05-08|date=2004-10-29 |publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lis.dickinson.edu/Technology/Training/Tutorials/MsOffice/assistant.htm |title=Microsoft's Office Assistant |accessdate=2007-05-08 |publisher=Dickinson College |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212204645/http://lis.dickinson.edu/Technology/Training/Tutorials/MsOffice/assistant.htm |archivedate=2007-02-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and parodies==
[[File:Kevan Atteberry at ROFLCon II.jpg|thumb|left|Clippy creator Kevan Atteberry discussing his much-maligned character at [[ROFLCon]] II]]

The program was widely reviled among users as intrusive and annoying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6313439-1.html |title=Top 10 worst products |publisher=CNET.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626040617/http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6313439-1.html |archivedate=2006-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=publicblast |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/Microsoft_Word_2007/4505-3529_7-32143055.html |title=Microsoft Word 2007 Word processor reviews |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and was criticized even within Microsoft. Microsoft's internal codename TFC had a derogatory origin: [[Steven Sinofsky]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; states that "C" stood for "clown", while allowing his readers to guess what "TF" might stand for. ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'' called Clippit "one of the worst software design blunders in the annals of computing".&lt;ref&gt;Conniff, Richard. "What's Behind a Smile?" ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'', August 2007 pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine included Clippit in a 2010 article listing the fifty worst inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1991915_1991909_1991755,00.html |title=The 50 Worst Inventions: Clippy |author=Chris Gentilviso |date=May 27, 2010 |work=Time |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Clippy wikipedia parody.jpg|thumb|Clippit's manner, perceived as intrusive and obsequious, was easily and frequently parodied {{ffdc|1=Clippy wikipedia parody.jpg|log=2014 August 14|date=August 2014}}]] --&gt;
In July 2000, the online comic strip ''[[User Friendly]]'' ran a series of panels featuring Clippit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20000715 |title=UserFriendly Strip Comments |publisher=Ars.userfriendly.org |date=2000-07-15 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a Microsoft advertising campaign for [[Office XP]] included the (now defunct) website ''officeclippy.com'', which highlighted the disabling of Clippit in the software. It featured the animated adventures of Clippit (voiced by comedian [[Gilbert Gottfried]]) as he learned to cope with unemployment ("X… XP… As in, ex-paperclip?!") and parodied behaviors of the Office assistant. Curiously, one of these ("Clippy Faces Facts") uses the same punchline as one of the User Friendly comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20000721 |title=UserFriendly Strip Comments |publisher=Ars.userfriendly.org |date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These videos can be downloaded from Microsoft's website as self-contained [[Flash Player]] executables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/office/clippy/downloads.asp |title=Clippy downloads |publisher=Microsoft |date=2001-08-06 |accessdate=2011-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031010223455/http://www.microsoft.com/office/clippy/downloads.asp |archivedate=October 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clippit ends up in an office as a floppy disk ejecting pin.

There is a Clippit parody in the ''Plus! Dancer'' application included in [[Microsoft Plus! Digital Media Edition]] which is later included as ''Windows Dancer'' in [[Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005]]. The dancing character '''Boo Who'''?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/desktop/dancers.mspx |title=Microsoft.com |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=2017-09-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214030453/https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/desktop/dancers.mspx |archivedate=2005-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is wearing a ghost outfit, roughly having the shape of Clippit's body, with a piece of wire visible underneath. Occasionally, the white sheet slips, and reveals the thin curve of steel. The description mentions "working for a short while for a Redmond, WA based software company, where he continued to work until being retired in 2001". Clippit is also included as a player character in ''Microsoft Bicycle Card Games'' and ''Microsoft Bicycle Board Games''. It was also used in the "[[Word Crimes]]" music video by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gv0H-vPoDc&amp;t=119 Word Crimes video, by Weird Al Yankovic]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vigor (software)|Vigor]] is a Clippit-inspired parody software - a version of the [[vi]] text editor featuring a rough-sketched Clippit.

On April 1, 2014, Clippit appeared as an Office assistant in Office Online as part of an [[April Fools' Day]] joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jessica Catcher |url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/01/clippy-is-back/ |title=Clippy Returns in Microsoft Office April Fools' Day Gag |website=Mashable.com |date=2014-04-01 |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] was found in the then-preview version of [[Windows Phone 8.1]]. When asked if she likes Clippit, the personal assistant [[Microsoft Cortana|Cortana]] would answer "Definitely. He taught me how important it is to listen." or "What's not to like? That guy took a heck of a beating and he's still smiling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.windowscentral.com/cortana/275592-found-clippy-easter-egg-cortana.html |title=Found a Clippy Easter Egg in Cortana! - Windows Central Forums |website=Forums.windowscentral.com |date=2014-04-15 |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her avatar occasionally turned into a two-dimensional Metro-style{{clarify|date=February 2016}} Clippit for several seconds. This easter egg is still available in the full release version of the Windows Phone operating system and Windows 10.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On April 1, 2015, [[Tumblr]] created a parody of Clippit, Coppy, as an April Fools joke. Coppy is an anthropomorphized photocopier that behaved in similar ways to Clippit, asking the user if they want help. Coppy would engage the reader in a series of pointless questions, with a dialogue box written in [[Comic Sans MS]], deliberately designed to be extremely annoying.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the ninth episode of Season 3 of [[HBO]]'s ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'', originally aired in June, 2016, a new animated character called "Pipey", clearly based on Microsoft's Clippit, provides help to users of the Pied Piper platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Caleb |last=Pershan |url=http://sfist.com/2016/06/20/silicon_valley_hbo_season_3_episode_9.php |title=''Silicon Valley'' Ep. 3.9: 'Pipey' |website=sfist |date=June 20, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623092248/http://sfist.com/2016/06/20/silicon_valley_hbo_season_3_episode_9.php |archivedate=June 23, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
After featuring Clippit's tomb in a movie to promote Office 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dennis Liu |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUawhjxLS2I |title=Office 2010: The Movie |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the character was relaunched as the main character of the game ''[[Ribbon Hero 2]]'', which is an [[interactive tutorial]] released by Microsoft in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ribbonhero.com |title=Ribbonhero.com |publisher=Ribbonhero.com |accessdate=2011-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20110703064638/http%3A//www.ribbonhero.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, Clippy needs a new job and accidentally goes inside a time machine, travelling to different ages solving problems with [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] and [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]]. Other Office Assistant names are also featured during the "Future Age" as planets of the future solar system.

In "[[Search Committee]]," the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] finale of [[The Office]] aired in May 2011, Darryl calls Microsoft and asks whether they still have Clippy while trying to build a resume.

In 2015 a music video was released for the song "Ghost" (by [[Delta Heavy]]) in which the abandoned Clippit is stuck between the software of the mid-nineties but then travels to the contemporary web and regains his place by hacking himself into any digital system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Bristow |url=http://www.dadhat.com/DELTA-HEAVY-GHOST |title=Delta Heavy - Ghost |publisher=dadhat.com |date=July 2015 |accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clippit made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode "The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist, Part II", where he offered to help Wooldoor Sockbat with his suicide note.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Clippit is portrayed as a romantic interest in "Conquered by Clippy", a comedic/erotic story by Leonard Delaney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jasper Hamill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/science/man-earns-700-month-writing-5677394 |title=This man earns almost 700 pounds a month writing hardcore porn about the Apple Watch and Tetris |publisher=The Mirror UK |date=May 2015 |accessdate=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4727">'''Parts stress modelling''' is a method in [[engineering]] and especially [[electronics]] to find an expected value for the rate of [[failure]] of the mechanical and electronic components of a system. It is based upon the idea that the more components that there are in the system, and the greater stress that they undergo in operation, the more often they will fail.

'''Parts count modelling''' is a simpler variant of the method, with component stress not taken into account.

Various organisations have published standards specifying how parts stress modelling should be carried out. Some from electronics are:

* MIL-HDBK-217 (US Department of Defense)
* SR-332, Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-332&amp; SR-332, Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* HRD-4 ([[British Telecom]])
* SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-1171&amp; SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;
* and many others

These "standards" produce different results, often by a factor of more than two, for the same modelled system. The differences illustrate the fact that this modelling is not an exact science. System designers often have to do the modelling using a standard specified by a customer, so that the customer can compare the results with other systems modelled in the same way.

All of these standards compute an expected overall failure rate for all the components in the system, which is not necessarily the rate at which the system as a whole fails. Systems often incorporate [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] or [[fault tolerance]] so that they do not fail when an individual component fails.

Several companies provide programs for performing parts stress modelling calculations. It's also possible to do the modelling with a [[spreadsheet]].

All these models implicitly assume the idea of "random failure". Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate, analogous to the process of [[nuclear decay]]. One justification for this idea is that components fail by a process of wearout, a predictable decay after manufacture, but that the wearout life of individual components is scattered widely about some very long mean. The observed "random" failures are then just the extreme outliers at the early edge of this distribution. However, this may not be the whole picture.

All the models use basically the same process, with detailed variations.
* Identify the components in the system
** Such as R123, 10kOhm carbon film resistor
* For each component, determine the '''component model''' to use from the standard
** Such as "resistor, film, &lt; 1 Megohm" or "Connector, multi-pin"
* From the standard's component model, discover what, if any, '''complexity''' parameter is needed, and find the value of that parameter for this component
** Such as pin count for a connector or gate count for a chip
* From the standard's component model, discover what '''thermal stress curve''' applies, and find the value of the '''temperature''' in operation for this component
** The failure rate of connectors may change little with temperature, while that of capacitors may change greatly
* From the standard's component model, discover what, if any, '''part stress''' parameter is needed, what '''part stress curve''' applies, and find the value of that part stress parameter for this component in this application
** A part stress might be the applied power as a fraction of the component's rated power, or the applied voltage as a fraction of the rated voltage
* From the standard's component model, find the '''base failure rate''' for this component, and modify that according to the complexity parameter, the [[operating temperature]] and thermal stress curve, the part stress parameter and part stress curve, with arithmetic specified by the standard. This now is the expected failure rate for this component in this application
* Add up all the results for every component in the system to find the overall failure rate for all components in this system.

Other global modification parameters can be employed, which are assumed to have the same effect on every component failure rate. The most usual are the environment, such as '''ground benign''' or '''airborne, commercial''', and the purchasing quality assurance process. The standards specify overall multiplier factors for these various choices.

'''Pharyngeal slits''' are filter-feeding organs found in [[Invertebrate]] [[chordates]] ([[lancelets]] and [[tunicates]]) and [[hemichordates]] living in aquatic environments. Pharyngeal slits are repeated openings that appear along the pharynx caudal to the mouth. With this position, they allow for the movement of water in the mouth and out the pharyngeal slits. It is postulated that this is how pharyngeal slits first assisted in filter-feeding, and later with the addition of gills along their walls, aided in respiration of aquatic chordates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors = Kardong KV|title=Vertebrates : comparative anatomy, function, evolution|isbn=9780078023026|edition=Seventh |location=New York, NY|oclc=862149184|date = 2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These repeated segments are controlled by similar developmental mechanisms.  Some hemichordate species can have as many as 200 [[gill slits]].&lt;ref name= hemichordate&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerhart J, Lowe C, Kirschner M |title= Hemichordates and the origin of chordates |journal= Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=15|issue= 4|pages=461–467 |year= 2005|pmid= 15964754 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2005.06.004|hdl= 2060/20020085372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pharynx|Pharyngeal]] slits resembling gill slits are transiently present during the embryonic stages of [[tetrapod]] development.  The presence of gill-like slits in the neck of the developing human embryo famously led [[Ernst Haeckel]] to postulate that "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]"; this hypothesis, while false, contains elements of truth, as explored by Stephen Jay Gould in ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]''.&lt;ref name="Gould1977"&gt;{{cite book | title= Ontogeny and Phylogeny | author= Gould, S.J.| year=1977 | publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-63940-9| pages=vii–viii}}. Also {{ISBN|0-674-63941-3}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is now accepted that it is the vertebrate [[Pharyngeal pouch (embryology)|pharyngeal pouches]] and not the neck slits that are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the pharyngeal slits of invertebrate chordates. Gill slits are, at some stage of life, found in all chordates. One theory of their origin is the fusion of nephridia which opened both on the outside and the gut, creating openings between the gut and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.b.22645/epdf?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER The Nephridial Hypothesis of the Gill Slit Origin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharyngeal arches in Vertebrates==
{{main|Pharyngeal arch}}
In vertebrates, the pharyngeal arches are derived from all three [[germ layers]].&lt;ref name=dev&gt;{{cite journal |author=Graham A |title= Development of the pharyngeal arches |journal= Am J Med Genet A|volume= 119A|issue= 3|pages=251–256|year= 2003|pmid= 12784288 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.10980}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neural crest cells]] enter these arches where they contribute to craniofacial features such as bone and cartilage.&lt;ref name = dev /&gt; However, the existence of pharyngeal structures before neural crest cells evolved is indicated by the existence of neural crest-independent mechanisms of pharyngeal arch development.&lt;ref name= archevo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graham A, Smith A |title= Patterning the pharyngeal arches|journal= BioEssays|volume=23|issue= 1|pages=54–61|year= 2001|pmid=11135309 |doi=10.1002/1521-1878(200101)23:1&lt;54::AID-BIES1007&gt;3.0.CO;2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, most anterior [[first pharyngeal arch|pharyngeal arch]] gives rise to the oral jaw.

==Evolution of pharyngeal slits==
[[File:Phylogeny gill slit.png|thumb|right|350px |alt= phylogeny |A phylogeny showing when gill slits may have arisen. It is thought that gill slits were subsequently lost in echinoderms.]]

The presence of pharyngeal slits in hemichordates led to debates of whether this structure was homologous to the slits found in chordates or a result of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name=backbone&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gee H |title= Before the backbone. Views on the origin of vertebrates |journal=|volume=London |issue= Chapman &amp; hall|pages=|year=1996 |pmid= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the placement of hemichordates and [[echinoderms]] as a sister group to chordates, a new hypothesis has emerged-suggesting that pharyngeal gill slits were present in the [[deuterostome]] ancestor .&lt;ref name=phylogeny&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Winchell CJ, Sullivan J, Cameron CB, Swalla BJ, Mallatt J |title=Evaluating hypotheses of deuterostome phylogeny and chordate evolution with new LSU and SSU ribosomal DNA data |journal=Mol Biol Evol |volume= 19 |issue= 5|pages=762–776|year= 2002 |pmid= 11961109 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intriguingly, [[Extant taxon|extant]] echinoderms lack pharyngeal structures, but fossil records reveal that ancestral forms of echinoderms had gill-like structures.&lt;ref name=fossil&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shu D, Morris SC, Zhang ZF, Liu JN, Han J, Chen L, Zhang XL, Yasui K, Li Y |title= A new species of yunnanozoan with implications for deuterostome evolution|journal= Science |volume=299|issue= 5611|pages=1380–1384|year= 2003 |pmid= 12610301 |doi= 10.1126/science.1079846}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Comparative developmental and genetic studies of these pharyngeal structures between hemichordates and [[urochordates]] have brought about important insights regarding the evolution of the deuterostome [[body plan]].&lt;ref name=manworm&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown FD, Prendergast A, Swalla BJ |title= Man is but a worm: chordate origins |journal=Genesis |volume=46|issue=11|pages=605–613 |year= 2008|pmid= 19003926  |doi= 10.1002/dvg.20471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparative molecular biology has revealed that the ''Pax1/9'' genes (which encode for [[transcription factors]]) are expressed in similar patterns between hemichordates and urochordates; In vertebrates, ''Pax 1'' and ''Pax 9'' are expressed in the pharyngeal pouches and are important for [[thymus]] development.&lt;ref name=pax&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogasawara M, Wada H, Peters H, Satoh N |title= Developmental expression of Pax 1/9 genes in urochordate and hemichordate gills: insight into function and evolution of the pharyngeal epithelium |journal= Development |volume=126|issue=11|pages=2539–2550 |year= 1999|pmid= 10226012 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  applying excess [[retinoic acid]] (excess retincoic acid in vertebrates results in pharyngeal abnormalities) leads to the absence of gill slits in developing [[Amphioxus]], suggesting that retinoic acid may act through the same mechanism in vertebrates and amphioxus.&lt;ref name=retinoic&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holland LZ, Holland N |title= Expression of AmphiHox-1 and AmphiPax-1 in amphioxus embryos treated with retinoic acid: insights into evolution and patterning of the chordate nerve cord and pharynx |journal= Development |volume=122|issue=6|pages=1829–1838 |year= 1996|pmid= 8674422 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies indicate that the pharyngeal slits found in hemichordates and chordates are indeed homologous in a [[molecular]] sense.

A '''proof''' is  [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]] [[evidence]] or a sufficient [[argument]] for the [[truth]] of a [[proposition]].&lt;ref&gt;''Proof and other dilemmas: mathematics and philosophy'' by [[Bonnie Gold]], Roger A. Simons 2008 {{ISBN|0883855674}} pages 12–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Papers, Volume 2'' by Imre Lakatos, John Worrall, Gregory Currie, ISBN Philosophical Papers, Volume 2 by Imre Lakatos, John Worrall, Gregory Currie 1980 {{ISBN|0521280303}} pages 60–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Evidence, proof, and facts: a book of sources'' by Peter Murphy 2003 {{ISBN|0199261954}} pages 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Logic in Theology – And Other Essays'' by Isaac Taylor 2010 {{ISBN|1445530139}} pages 5–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept applies in a variety of disciplines,&lt;ref&gt;
Compare {{Bibleverse|1 Thessalonians|5:21|KJV}}: "Prove all things [...]."
&lt;/ref&gt;
with both the nature of the evidence or justification and the criteria for sufficiency being area-dependent. In the area of oral and written [[communication]] such as [[conversation]], [[dialog]], [[rhetoric]], etc., a proof is a [[persuasive]] [[perlocutionary act|perlocutionary]] [[speech act]], which demonstrates the truth of a proposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Langshaw Austin]]: ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]''. Cambridge (Mass.) 1962 – Paperback: [[Harvard University Press]], 2nd edition, 2005, {{ISBN|0-674-41152-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In any area of [[mathematics]] defined by its assumptions or [[axioms]], a proof is an argument establishing a [[theorem]] of that area via accepted [[rules of inference]] starting from those axioms and from other previously established theorems.&lt;ref&gt;Cupillari, Antonella. The Nuts and Bolts of Proofs. Academic Press, 2001. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject of [[logic]], in particular [[proof theory]], formalizes and studies the notion of [[formal proof]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Tarski, Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences (ed. Jan Tarski). 4th Edition. Oxford Logic Guides, No. 24. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994, xxiv + 229 pp. {{ISBN|0-19-504472-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some areas of [[theory of justification|epistemology]] and [[existence of god|theology]], the notion of [[Theory of justification|justification]] plays approximately the role of proof,&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[jurisprudence]] the corresponding term is [[evidence (law)|evidence]],&lt;ref&gt;
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/proof
&lt;/ref&gt;
with "burden of proof" as a concept common to both [[philosophic burden of proof|philosophy]] and [[legal burden of proof|law]].

==On proof==
In most disciplines, evidence is required to prove something. Evidence is drawn from experience of the world around us, with [[science]] obtaining its evidence from [[nature (science)|nature]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman00.pdf/$file/sciman00.pdf Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence], 2nd Ed. (2000), p. 71. Accessed May 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; law obtaining its evidence from [[witness]]es and [[forensics|forensic investigation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Henry Wigmore]], ''A Treatise on the System of  Evidence in Trials at Common Law,'' 2nd ed., Little, Brown, and Co., Boston, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.   A notable exception is mathematics, whose proofs are drawn from a mathematical world begun with axioms and further developed and enriched by theorems proved earlier.

Exactly what evidence is sufficient to prove something is also strongly area-dependent, usually with no absolute threshold of sufficiency at which evidence becomes proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3052837 |author1=Simon, Rita James |author2=Mahan, Linda.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1971 | title = Quantifying Burdens of Proof—A View from the Bench, the Jury, and the Classroom| journal = Law and Society Review | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 319–330 | jstor = 3052837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valpo.edu/mcs/pdf/ReasonableDoubtFinal.pdf |format=PDF|title=Distributions of Interest for Quantifying Reasonable Doubt and Their Applications |accessdate=2007-01-14 |author1=Katie Evans |author2=David Osthus |author3=Ryan G.

Pruss&lt;/ref&gt; In law, the same evidence that may convince one [[jury]] may not persuade another.  [[Formal proof]] provides the main exception, where the criteria for proofhood are ironclad and it is impermissible to defend any step in the reasoning as "obvious" (except for the necessary ability of the one proving and the one being proven to, to correctly identify any symbol used in the proof.);&lt;ref&gt;[[A. S. Troelstra]], H. Schwichtenberg (1996). ''Basic Proof Theory''.  In series ''Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-77911-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[well-formed formula]] to qualify as part of a formal proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus of some [[formal system]] to the previous well-formed formulae in the proof sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Geoffrey, Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic, University of California Pres, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofs have been presented since antiquity. [[Aristotle]] used the observation that patterns of nature never display the machine-like uniformity of [[determinism]] as proof that [[chance (Ancient Greek concept)|chance]] is an inherent part of nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle's Physics: a Guided Study'', Joe Sachs, 1995 {{ISBN|0813521920}} p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Thomas Aquinas]] used the observation of the existence of [[law of nature (science)|rich patterns in nature]] as proof that nature is ''not'' ruled by chance.&lt;ref&gt;''The treatise on the divine nature: Summa theologiae I'', 1–13, by Saint Thomas Aquinas, Brian J. Shanley, 2006 {{ISBN|0872208052}} p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofs need not be verbal.  Before [[Copernicus]], people took the apparent motion of the [[Sun]] across the sky as proof that [[geocentric model|the Sun went round the Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution, pp. 5–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Suitably incriminating evidence left at the scene of a [[crime]] may serve as proof of the identity of the perpetrator.  Conversely, a verbal entity need not assert a proposition to constitute a proof of that proposition.  For example, a [[signature]] constitutes direct proof of [[authorship]]; less directly, [[handwriting analysis]] may be submitted as proof of authorship of a document.&lt;ref&gt;''Trial tactics by Stephen A. Saltzburg, 2007 {{ISBN|159031767X}} page 47&lt;/ref&gt;  [[secret|Privileged information]] in a document can serve as proof that the document's author had access to that information; such access might in turn establish the location of the author at certain time, which might then provide the author with an [[alibi]].

'''The Quality of Government (QoG)-institute''' is an independent research institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]]. 

The institute was founded by Professors [[Bo Rothstein]] and [[Sören Holmberg]] in 2004 and is partly financed by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation ([[Riksbankens Jubileumsfond]]), the Swedish Science Council ([[Vetenskapsrådet]]), and the [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]]. 

The main objective the QoG institute´s research is to address the theoretical and empirical problem of how political institutions of high quality can be created and maintained. Another objective is to study the effects of Quality of Government on a number of policy areas, such as health, the environment, social policy, and poverty. 

Since its start in 2004, the QoG institute has continuously gathered various data related to its research field. Since 2008, the institute has also conducted their own web surveys among experts in the public administration. Today, the survey comprises data from 1053 experts over 135 countries. All data is compiled in different databases and are free to download on the institute’s website. On the institute’s website, there is also a data visualization tool available that makes it possible to create interactive maps and scatter plots.

The QoG institute participates in a number of international research projects. During the years 2012-2017, the institute is coordinating a large scale research project - [http://anticorrp.eu ANTICORRP] - financed  by the [[European Commission]]s [[Seventh Framework Programme]].

Most of the scientific articles, reports, and working papers that are produced by the institutes’ researchers are free to download on the institute’s [http://www.qog.pol.gu.se/publications website].

Different grades exist (e.g. thick or viscous, soft). The viscous one is used for standard stopcocks and ground joins. The soft grade is for large stopcocks and ground joints, [[desiccator]]s, and for lower temperature use. Ramsay grease consists of [[paraffin wax]], [[vaseline]], and crude [[natural rubber]], in ratio 1:3:7 to 1:8:16. Due to the rubber content it has less tendency to flow.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry|author=Brauer, G.|date=2012|issue=sv. 1|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780323161275|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaa2qeFRXmUC&amp;pg=PA29|page=29|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recipe for a grease usable up to 25&amp;nbsp;°C consists of 6 parts of vaseline, 1 part of paraffin wax, and 6 parts of [[Hevea brasiliensis|Pará rubber]].&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Laboratory Distillation|author=Krell, E.|date=1982|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780080875491|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfRoaG0EXCUC&amp;pg=PA488|page=488|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dropping point]] of Leybold-brand Ramsay grease is 56&amp;nbsp;°C; its maximum service temperature is 25-30&amp;nbsp;°C. Its vapor pressure at 25&amp;nbsp;°C is 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; torr (0.013 mPa), at 38&amp;nbsp;°C it is 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; torr (13 mPa).&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vacuum Technology|author=Roth, A.|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780444598745|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBqs3sr9r48C&amp;pg=PA391|page=391|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RBC process involves allowing the wastewater to come in contact with a biological medium in order to remove [[pollutant]]s in the wastewater  before discharge of the treated wastewater to the [[Natural environment|environment]], usually a body of water (river, lake or ocean). A rotating biological contactor is a type of secondary (Biological) treatment process. It  consists of a series of closely spaced, parallel discs mounted on a rotating shaft which is supported just above the surface of the waste water. Microorganisms grow on the surface of the discs where [[biological degradation]] of the wastewater pollutants takes place.

The rotating packs of disks (known as the media) are contained in a tank or trough and rotate at between 2 and 5 revolutions per minute. Commonly used plastics for the media are [[polyethylene]], [[PVC]] and expanded [[polystyrene]]. The shaft is aligned with the flow of wastewater so that the discs rotate at right angles to the flow, with several packs usually combined to make up a treatment train. About 40% of the disc area is immersed in the wastewater.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"&gt;{{cite book   | title = Fixed Biological Surfaces - Wastewater Treatment: The Rotating Biological Contactor | author= Ronald L. Antonie | publisher = CRC Press | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nLtHDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rotating+biological+contactor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU442JxsbZAhVGtlkKHUgUAO4Q6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Rotating%20biological%20contactor&amp;f=false | date = 2018 | page =   | isbn = 9781351088947  | accessdate = 27 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch 2}}

Biological growth is attached to the surface of the disc and forms a slime layer. The discs contact the wastewater with the atmospheric air for oxidation as it rotates. The rotation helps to slough off excess solids. The disc system can be staged in series to obtain nearly any detention time or degree of removal required. Since the systems are staged, the culture of the later stages can be acclimated to the slowly degraded materials.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"/&gt;{{rp|Ch 2}}

The discs consist of plastic sheets ranging from 2 to 4 m in diameter and are up to 10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Several modules may be arranged in parallel and/or in series to meet the flow and treatment requirements. The discs are submerged in waste water to about 40% of their diameter. Approximately 95% of the surface area is thus alternately submerged in waste water and then exposed to the atmosphere above the liquid. Carbonaceous substrate is removed in the initial stage of RBC. Carbon conversion may be completed in the first stage of a series of modules, with nitrification being completed after the 5th stage. Most design of RBC systems will include a minimum of 4 or 5 modules in series to obtain nitrification of waste water.

[[Biofilms]], which are biological growths that become attached to the discs, assimilate the organic materials in the wastewater. [[Aeration]] is provided by the rotating action, which exposes the media to the air after contacting them with the wastewater, facilitating the degradation of the pollutants being removed. The degree of wastewater treatment is related to the amount of media surface area and the quality and volume of the inflowing wastewater.

==History==
{{cleanup|reason=Requires citations, lacks flow and perhaps better in another section?|date=May 2016}}
The first RBC was installed in West Germany in 1959, later it was introduced in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"/&gt;{{rp|Ch 2:History}} In the United States, rotating biological contactors are used for industries producing wastewaters high in [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) (e.g., petroleum industry and dairy industry).

A properly designed RBC produced a very high quality final effluent. However both the organic and hydraulic loading had to be addressed. 

In the 1980's problems were encountered in the USA prompting the Environmental Agency to commission a number of reports.

These reports identified a number of issues and criticized the RBC process. One author suggested that since manufacturers were aware of the problem, the problems would be resolved and suggested that design engineers should specify a long life.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

However, this was only possible when the manufacturers became aware of the design problems and the stress to ensure a long life and since failures still occurred it was unlikely any design stresses were known.

Severn Trent Water Ltd, a large UK Water Company based in the Midlands, employed RBCs as the preferred process for their small works which amount to over 700 sites  Consequently, long life was essential to compliance.

This issue was successfully addressed by Eric Findlay C Eng when he was employed by Severn Trent Water Ltd in the UK following a period of failure of a number of plants. As a result, the issue of short life failure became fully understood in the early 1990s when the correct process and hydraulic issues had been identified to produce a high quality nitrified effluent. 


There are several other papers which address the whole issue of RBCs.
Findlay also developed a system for repairing defective RBCs enabling shaft and frame life to be extended up to 30 years based on the Cranfield designed frame. Where additional capacity was required intermediate  frames are used maximising minimising the need for duplication

==Secondary clarification== 
Secondary clarifiers following RBCs are identical in design to conventional humus tanks, as used downstream of [[trickling filter]]s. Sludge is generally removed daily, or pumped automatically to the primary settlement tank for co-settlement. Regular sludge removal reduces the risk of  anaerobic conditions from developing within the sludge, with subsequent sludge flotation due to the release of gases.

==Scope of a Safety Engineer==

The scope of a safety engineer is to perform their professional functions. Safety engineering professionals must have education, training and experience in a common body of knowledge. They need to have a fundamental knowledge of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[physiology]], [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[engineering mechanics]], [[industrial processes]], [[business]], [[communication]] and [[psychology]]. Professional safety studies include [[industrial hygiene]] and [[toxicology]], design of [[engineering hazard control]]s, [[fire protection]], [[ergonomics]], system and [[process safety]], [[system safety]],  safety and health program management, [[accident investigation]] and analysis, [[product safety]], [[construction safety]], education and training methods, measurement of [[safety performance]], [[human behavior]], [[environmental safety and health]], and safety, health and [[environmental law]]s, regulations and standards. Many safety engineers have backgrounds or advanced study in other disciplines, such as management and business administration, engineering, [[system engineering]] / [[industrial engineering]], [[requirements engineering]], [[reliability engineering]], [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], [[human factors]], operations, education, physical and [[social science]]s and other fields. Others have advanced study in safety. This extends their expertise beyond the basics of the safety engineering profession.

==Functions of a Safety Engineer==

The major areas relating to the protection of people, property and the environment are:


==Personality and role==

Oddly enough, personality issues can be paramount in a safety engineer. They must be personally pleasant, intelligent, and ruthless with themselves and their organization. In particular, they have to be able to "sell" the failures that they discover, as well as the attendant expense and time needed to correct them. They can be the messengers of bad news.

Safety engineers have to be ruthless about getting facts from other engineers. It is common for a safety engineer to consider software, chemical, electrical, mechanical, procedural, and training problems in the same day. Often the facts can be very uncomfortable as many safety related issues point towards mediocre management systems or worse, questionable business ethics.

==Teamwork==

It's difficult and expensive to retrofit safety into an unsafe system.  To prevent safety problems, an organization should therefore treat safety as an early design and "architecture" activity, using the principles of [[Inherent safety]], rather than as a "paperwork requirement" to be cleaned up after the real design is done.

Safety engineers also must work in a team that includes other engineering specialties, quality assurance, quality improvement, regulatory compliance specialists, educators and lawyers.

Subpar safety and quality problems often indicate underlying deficiencies in an organization's goals, recruitment, succession, training, management systems and business culture.

Safety often works well in a true matrix-management organization, in which safety is a managed discipline integrated into a project plan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">'''Semiotic democracy''' is a phrase first coined by [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], a [[media studies]] [[professor]], in his seminal media studies book ''Television Culture'' (1987).&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;John Fiske, ''Television Culture'' (Routledge, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Fiske defined the term as the "delegation of the production of meanings and pleasures to [television's] viewers."&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt;{{rp|236}} Fiske discussed how rather than being passive couch potatoes that absorbed information in an unmediated way, viewers actually gave their own meanings to the shows they watched that often differed substantially from the meaning intended by the show's producer.

Subsequently, this term was appropriated by the technical and legal community in the context of any re-working of [[cultural imagery]] by someone who is not the original author. Examples include [[fan fiction]] and [[slash fiction]].

Legal scholars are concerned that just as technology eases the process of cheaply making and distributing derivative works imbued with new cultural meanings available to wide public, [[copyright]] and [[right-to-publicity]] law is clamping down on and limiting these works, thus reducing their promulgation, and limiting semiotic democracy.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Siva Vaidhyanathan, 'Critical Information Studies: A Bibliographic Manifesto' (2006) 20 ''Cultural Studies'' 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. [[Terry Fisher]] of [[Harvard Law School]] has written about semiotic democracy in the context of the crisis facing the entertainment industry and in terms of the ability of people to use the Internet in creative new ways.&lt;ref&gt;William W Fisher, ''Promises to Keep: Technology, Law and the Future of Entertainment'' (Stanford University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Underwater Historical Research''' (SUHR) was an amateur [[maritime archaeology]] organisation operating in [[South Australia]] (SA). It was formed in 1974 by [[Recreational diving|recreational scuba divers]] and other persons to pursue an interest in [[maritime archaeology]] and [[maritime history]]. The SUHR was renamed as the [[South Australian Archaeology Society]] in March 2012 as part of a plan to expand its activities beyond maritime archaeology to include other archaeological disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Steve; (2012) 'Club News' in ''SDF News Sheet – June 2012” (Scuba Divers Federation of South Australia), at http://www.sdfsa.net/newsletters/2012/2012-06-News-Sheet.pdf, retrieved 11/06/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The SUHR was founded in September 1974 by recreational scuba divers principally from the Underwater Explorers Club of South Australia (UEC) and [[Professional diving|occupational scuba divers]] from government agencies such as the [[South Australian Museum]] and the [[South Australia Police|South Australian Police]], as well as a number of individuals interested in [[maritime history]].&lt;ref&gt;Brock, A.E., 1977, ‘The Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia’, In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, ''Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology'', Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Jeffery  | first =B.  | author-link =   | title =South Australian Maritime Heritage Program 1970s – 2002 Projects, Activities and Bibliography

The origin of the SUHR is due in part to the positive public response to the aftermath of a successful expedition in 1973 to locate and recover 2 [[anchor]]s discarded during 1803 by the [[HMS Investigator (1798)|HMS ''Investigator'']] whilst under the command of [[Matthew Flinders]] off the coast of what is now Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, A.E., 1977, ‘The Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia’, In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, ''Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology'', Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recovery of the anchors and their connection to the voyage of the HMS ''Investigator'' is commemorated in the inclusion of the best bower anchor and the outline of the Australian continent on the SUHR emblem.&lt;ref&gt;‘Second Annual Report, September 1976’, pp.2, in Cowan, David (editor), (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
After its formation in 1974, the SUHR was initially managed by a committee consisting of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and the following specialist officers – Research Officer, Registrar of Relics (added in 1976), an officer to liaise with the responsible part of the South Australian Government which was initially the South Australian Museum, and an officer to liaise with the South Australian Police Force (removed in 1978). By the late 1970s, it had evolved into a project-based organisation whose work consisted of activities such as planning, research, exploration, logistics, photography, survey and the publication of reports. Activities such as recovery and conservation, while historically significant, ceased to be carried out in the late 1980s except where permitted by archaeological practice.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, David; (2007), 'About the SUHR', in Cowan, David (editor); (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'' , Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA. pages 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1982, a group within the membership who were unhappy with the increasing level of professionalization, resigned and founded a competing organisation known as the [[Nautical Archaeology Association of South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Letter to Society for Underwater Historical Research Committee’ in the SUHR Newsletter for April 1982, Cowan, David (editor); (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Minutes of the General Meeting held … on Tuesday 27 April 1982’ in SUHR Newsletter for May 1982, Cowan, David (editor); (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'' , Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, after nearly a decade of stagnation, new life was breathed in the organisation via new funding opportunities and interest in membership from undergraduate and postgraduate archaeology students.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, N. &amp; Lewczak, C., (2002), ''Back to the Bay: An overview of the Holdfast Bay Project 1974-2000 and the reinvigoration of avocational maritime archaeology in South Australia'', Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology Vol. 26, pp. 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''telial stage''' is one of the stages in the life cycle of a [[parasitic]] [[heteroecious]] [[fungus]]. It is discernible by the formation of large [[teliospore]]s that the fungi produces to overwinter. The telial stage of heteroecious parasitic fungi is spent on the secondary host plant. A primary aecial stage is spent parasitizing a separate host plant which is a precursor in the life cycle of heteroecious fungi. Spores are released from the telia in the spring. The [[spore]]s can spread many kilometers through the air, however most are spread near the host plant (Brand, 2004).

==Host plants==
There are a number of plants that can be infected by the telial stage. Therefore, the telial stage is considered a [[pathogen]] to those plants. A few specific plant pathogenic species are listed here with their [[Host (biology)|hosts]].
# ''[[Puccinia graminis]]'' or known commonly as black stem rust. It infects many different cereal crops.
# ''[[Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae]]''. It infects the eastern red cedar (Volk, 1999). This is shown to the right.
# ''[[Gymnosporangium sabinae]]''. It infects pear trees.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Spore stages==
The life cycle of rust fungi can have up to five different spore stages and can get quite complex (Schumann and D'Arcy, 2010). These stages are:
* Stage 0: [[Pycniospore]]s
* Stage I: [[Aeciospore]]s
* Stage II: [[Urediniospore]]s
* Stage III: [[Teliospore]]s
* Stage IV: [[Basidiospore]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2223">'''The Group''' was an informal but highly influential [[Not-for-profit arts organization|art association]] formed in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] in 1927. Initially begun by ex-students from [[Ilam School of Fine Arts|Canterbury College of Art]], its aim was to provide a freer, more experimental alternative to the academic salon painting exhibitions of the [[Canterbury Society of Arts]]. The Group exhibited annually for 50 years, from 1927 to 1977, and was continuously at the forefront of New Zealand art's [[avant-garde]] scene.

Many of the country's best-known artists were associated at some time with The Group, among them [[Colin McCahon]], [[Doris Lusk]], [[Toss Woollaston]], [[Rita Angus]], [[Olivia Spencer Bower]], [[Leo Bensemann]], [[Rata Lovell-Smith]], [[Philip Trusttum]], and [[Douglas MacDiarmid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 15.  – Canterbury region – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/page-15|website = www.teara.govt.nz|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en|first = New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last = Taonga}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of The Group extended into other areas of New Zealand culture through the collaborations and friendship of members with the likes of writer and editor [[Charles Brasch]] and composer [[Douglas Lilburn]].&lt;ref name="Bensemann"&gt;http://www.nzportraitgallery.org.nz/whats-on/leo-bensemann-friends-portraiture-and-the-group&lt;/ref&gt; Its influence was such that it is occasionally referred to as "[[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] South".&lt;ref name="Bensemann"/&gt;

'''''Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970–1986''''' (Original Russian title: '''''Martyrolog''''') are the diaries of the [[Russians|Russian]] [[filmmaker]] [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]. They cover his life and work in the Soviet Union and the time of his exile in Western Europe. After the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup]] several memos surfaced that alleged that the [[KGB]] had at times access to the diaries. Although Tarkovsky did not openly oppose the Soviet system, his work heavily emphasized spiritual themes, that were at conflict with the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official anti-religious atheist ideology]], prompting the KGB to open a file on him.&lt;ref&gt;Komsolmoskaya Pravda, "New Tarkovsky documents surface", 15 September 1995, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Diaries==

Tarkovsky called his diaries ''Martyrolog'' (Translated by Tarkovsky's official English translator Kitty Hunter-Blair as ''Martyrology''). He said about this title in 1974: "Pretentious and false as a title, but let it stay as a reminder of my ineradicable, futile worthlessness." The diaries are deeply personal and were intended mainly for Tarkovsky himself. They cover his life and work in the Soviet Union and during the time of his exile. Sometimes entries are seemingly trivial, as for example shopping lists or entries on his health. Another frequent topic are other film directors or artists, which Tarkovsky generally regarded with a negative attitude. At other time Tarkovsky discusses philosophical or film theoretical questions, not necessarily related to day-to-day events. Tarkovsky kept his diary until shortly before his death on December 29, 1986. The last entry was on December 15, 1986. His last words were "But now I have no strength left – that is the problem".

* 1550 &amp;mdash; [[Gerolamo Cardano]] writes about electricity in ''De Subtilitate'' distinguishing, perhaps for the first time, between electrical and magnetic forces.

==17th century==
* 1600 &amp;mdash; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] publishes ''De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure'' ("On the Magnet and Magnetic bodies, and on that Great Magnet the Earth"), Europe's then current standard on electricity and magnetism. He experimented with and noted the different character of electrical and magnetic forces. In addition to known ancient Greeks' observations of the electrical properties of rubbed amber, he experimented with a needle balanced on a pivot, and found that the needle was non-directionally affected by many materials such as alum, arsenic, hard resin, [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], glass, gum-mastic, mica, rock-salt, sealing wax, slags, sulfur, and precious stones such as amethyst, [[beryl]], diamond, opal, and sapphire. He noted that electrical charge could be stored by covering the body with a non-conducting substance such as silk. He described the method of artificially magnetizing iron. His [[terrella]] (little earth), a sphere cut from a lodestone on a metal lathe, modeled the earth as a lodestone (magnetic iron ore) and demonstrated that every lodestone has fixed poles, and how to find them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=2 |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeII/chap18.html |chapter=Part IV.

He experimented with such physical models in an attempt to explain problems in [[navigation]] due varying properties of the [[magnetic compass]] with respect to their location on the earth, such as [[magnetic declination]] and magnetic inclination. His experiments explained the [[Dip circle|dipping of the needle]] by the magnetic attraction of the earth, and were used to predict where the vertical dip would be found. Such magnetic inclination was described as early as the 11th century by [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' and further investigated in 1581 by retired mariner and [[Compasssmith|compass maker]] [[Robert Norman]], as described in his pamphlet, ''The Newe Attractive.'' The gilbert, a unit of [[magnetomotive force]] or [[magnetic potential]], was named in his honor.

This has been described as the beginning of electrical communication.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=David H.|last2=Clark|first2=Stephen P.H.|title=Newton's tyranny : the suppressed scientific discoveries of Stephen Gray and John Flamsteed|date=2001|publisher=Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9780716747017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} This was also the first distinction between the roles of conductors and insulators (names applied by [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desaguliers]], mathematician and [[Royal Society]] member, who stated that Gray "has made greater variety of electrical experiments than all the philosophers of this and the last age.")&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} Georges-Louis LeSage built a [[electrical telegraph|static electricity telegraph]] in 1774, based upon the same principles discovered by Gray.
* 1732 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] Shows that all objects, except metals, animals, and liquids, can be electrified by rubbing them and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an electrostatic generators
* 1734 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay|Charles François de Cisternay DuFay]] (inspired by Gray's work to perform electrical experiments) dispels the effluvia theory by his paper in Volume 38 of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,'' describing his discovery of the distinction between two kinds of electricity: "resinous," produced by rubbing bodies such as amber, copal, or [[Lac|gum-lac]] with silk or paper, and "vitreous," by rubbing bodies as glass, rock crystal, or precious stones with hair or wool. He also posited the principle of mutual attraction for unlike forms and the repelling of like forms and that "from this principle one may with ease deduce the explanation of a great number of other phenomena." The terms resinous and vitreous were later replaced with the terms "positive" and "negative" by [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] and Benjamin Franklin.
* 1737 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] and [[Francis Hauksbee the younger]]{{fact|date=May 2013}} independently discover two kinds of frictional electricity: one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin (later identified as positive and negative electrical charges).
* 1740 &amp;mdash; [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], in ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', explains the process of [[refraction]].
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of Leiden (Leyden) independently discovers the [[Leyden jar|Leyden (Leiden) jar]], a primitive [[capacitor]] or "condenser" (term coined by Volta in 1782, derived from the Italian ''condensatore''), with which the transient electrical energy generated by current friction machines could now be stored. He and his student Andreas Cunaeus used a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed. He charged the jar by touching a wire leading from the electrical machine with one hand while holding the outside of the jar with the other. The energy could be discharged by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally his hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. He also found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on a table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with one hand and touching the wire connected to the electrical machine with the other.
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] of independently invents the capacitor: a glass jar coated inside and out with metal. The inner coating was connected to a rod that passed through the lid and ended in a metal sphere. By having this thin layer of glass insulation (a [[dielectric]]) between two large, closely spaced plates, von Kleist found the energy density could be increased dramatically compared with the situation with no insulator. [[Daniel Gralath]] improved the design and was also the first to combine several jars to form a battery strong enough to kill birds and small animals upon discharge.
* 1746 &amp;mdash; [[Leonhard Euler]] develops the wave theory of light refraction and dispersion
* 1747 &amp;mdash; [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], while experimenting with a Leyden jar, observes that a discharge of static electricity causes [[electric current]] to flow and develops the concept of an electrical potential ([[voltage]]).
* 1752 &amp;mdash; [[Benjamin Franklin]] establishes the link between lightning and electricity by the flying a kite into a thunderstorm and transferring some of the charge into a Leyden jar and showed that its properties were the same as charge produced by an electrical machine. He is credited with utilizing the concepts of positive and negative charge in the explanation of then known electrical phenomenon. He theorized that there was an electrical fluid (which he proposed could be the [[Luminiferous ether#The history of light and aether|luminiferous ether]], which was used by others before and after him, to explain the [[Light#Wave_theor|wave theory of light]]) that was part of all material and all intervening space. The charge of any object would be neutral if the concentration of this fluid were the same both inside and outside of the body, positive if the object contained an excess of this fluid, and negative if there were a deficit. In 1749 he had documented the similar properties of lightning and electricity, such as that both an [[electric spark]] and a lightning flash produced [[light]] and sound, could kill animals, cause fires, melt metal, destroy or reverse the polarity of magnetism, and flowed through conductors and could be concentrated at sharp points. He was later able to apply the property of concentrating at sharp points by his invention of the lightning rod, for which he intentionally did not profit. He also investigated the Leyden jar, proving that the charge was stored on the glass and not in the water, as others had assumed.
* 1753 &amp;mdash; C. M. (of Scotland, possibly Charles Morrison, of Greenock or Charles Marshall, of Aberdeen)  proposes in the 17 February edition of Scots Magazine, an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet and each connected to electrostatic machines. The receiving charged end was to electrostatically attract a disc of paper marked with the corresponding letter.
* 1767 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Priestley]] proposes an electrical inverse-square law
* 1774 &amp;mdash; [[Georges-Louis LeSage]] builds an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires conducting Leyden-jar charges to pith-ball electroscopes, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. Its range was only between rooms of his home.
* 1784 &amp;mdash; [[Henry Cavendish]] defines the [[electromagnetic induction|inductive capacity]] of [[dielectrics]] (insulators) and measures the specific inductive capacity of various substances by comparison with an air condenser.
* 1785 &amp;mdash; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Charles Coulomb]] introduces the [[Coulomb's law|inverse-square law of electrostatics]]
* 1786 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers "animal electricity" and postulates that animal bodies are storehouses of electricity. His invention of the voltaic cell leads to the invention the electric battery.
* 1791 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers galvanic electricity and [[bioelectricity]] through experiments following an observation that touching exposed muscles in frogs' legs with a scalpel which had been close to a static electrical machine caused them to jump. He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the [[Battery (electricity)|galvanic battery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=3|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeIII/chap46.html |chapter=VII.

* 1799 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]], following Galvani's discovery of galvanic electricity, creates a [[voltaic pile|voltaic cell]] producing an electric current by the chemical action of several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs "piled" and separated by cloth or cardboard which had been soaked brine (salt water) or acid to increase conductivity. In '''1800''' he demonstrates the production of light from a glowing wire conducting electricity. This was followed in 1801 by his construction of the first [[electric battery]], by utilizing multiple voltaic cells. Prior to his major discoveries, in a letter of praise to the Royal Society 1793, Volta reported Luigi Galvani's experiments of the 1780s as the "most beautiful and important discoveries," regarding them as the foundation of future discoveries. Volta's inventions led to revolutionary changes with this method of the production of inexpensive, controlled electric current vs. existing frictional machines and Leyden jars. The electric battery became standard equipment in every experimental laboratory and heralded an age of practical applications of electricity.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} The unit [[volt]] is named for his contributions.
* 1800 &amp;mdash; [[William Herschel]] discovers [[infrared radiation]] from the Sun.
* 1800 &amp;mdash; [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], [[Anthony Carlisle]] and [[Johann Ritter]] use electricity to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen, thereby discovering the process of [[electrolysis]], which led to the discovery of many other elements.
* 1800 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]] invents the [[voltaic pile]], or "battery", specifically to disprove Galvani's animal electricity theory.

==19th century==

===1801-1850===
* 1801 &amp;mdash; [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter|Johann Ritter]] discovers [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the Sun
* 1801 &amp;mdash; [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] demonstrates the [[wave nature]] of light and the principle of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]
* 1802 &amp;mdash; [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]], Italian legal scholar, discovers that electricity and magnetism are related by noting that a nearby voltaic pile deflects a magnetic needle. He published his account in an Italian newspaper, but this was overlooked by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martins|first=Roberto de Andrade|chapter=Romagnosi and Volta’s pile: early difficulties in the interpretation of Voltaic electricity|editor-last1=Bevilacqua|editor-first1=Fabio|editor-last2=Fregonese|editor-first2=Lucio|title=Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times|location=
Pavia |publisher=Ulrico Hoepli |volume=3 |pages=81–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1803 &amp;mdash; Thomas Young develops the [[Double-slit experiment]] and demonstrates the effect of [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]].
* 1806 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]] employs a voltaic pile to decompose potash and soda, showing that they are the oxides of the previously unknown metals potassium and sodium. These experiments were the beginning of [[electrochemistry]].
* 1808 &amp;mdash; [[Étienne-Louis Malus]] discovers [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] by reflection
* 1809 &amp;mdash; Étienne-Louis Malus publishes the law of Malus which predicts the light intensity transmitted by two polarizing sheets
* 1809 &amp;mdash; [[Humphry Davy]] first publicly demonstrates the electric [[arc lamp|arc light]].
* 1811 &amp;mdash; [[François Jean Dominique Arago]] discovers that some quartz crystals continuously rotate the electric vector of light
* 1816 &amp;mdash; [[David Brewster]] discovers stress [[birefringence]]
* 1818 &amp;mdash; [[Siméon Poisson]] predicts the [[Arago spot|Poisson-Arago bright spot]] at the center of the shadow of a circular opaque obstacle
* 1818 &amp;mdash; [[François Jean Dominique Arago]] verifies the existence of the Poisson-Arago  bright spot
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], Danish physicist and chemist, unites the separate sciences of electricity and magnetism. He develops an experiment in which he notices a compass needle is deflected from [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]] when an electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off, convincing him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a live wire just as light and heat do, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. He also observes that the movement of the compass-needle to one side or the other depends upon the direction of the current. Following intensive investigations, he published his findings, proving that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[oersted]] unit of magnetic induction is named for his contributions.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]], professor of mathematics at the Ecole Polytechnique, a short time after learning of Ørsted's discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, conducts experiments and publishes a paper in ''[[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]]'' attempting to give a combined theory of electricity and magnetism. He shows that a coil of wire carrying a current behaves like an ordinary magnet and suggests that electromagnetism might be used in telegraphy. He mathematically develops [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]] describing the magnetic force between two electric currents. His mathematical theory explains known electromagnetic phenomena and predicts new ones. His laws of electrodynamics include the facts that parallel conductors currying current in the same direction attract and those carrying currents in the opposite directions repel one another. One of the first to develop electrical measuring techniques, he built an instrument utilizing a free-moving needle to measure the flow of electricity, contributing to the development of the [[galvanometer]]. In '''1821''', he proposed a telegraphy system utilizing one wire per "galvanometer" to indicate each letter, and reported experimenting successfully with such a system. However, in '''1824''', [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] reported its maximum distance was only 200 feet, and so was impractical.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In '''1826''' he publishes the ''Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience'' containing a mathematical derivation of the electrodynamic force law. Following Faraday's discovery of  electromagnetic induction in 1831, Ampère agreed that Faraday deserved full credit for the discovery.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger]], German chemist, physicist, and professor, builds the first sensitive galvanometer, wrapping a coil of wire around a graduated compass, an acceptable instrument for actual measurement as well as detection of small amounts of electric current, naming it after Luigi Galvani.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]] announces his theory of electrodynamics, predicting the force that one current exerts upon another.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] discovers the [[thermoelectric effect]].
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] derives a mathematical demonstration that polarization can be explained only if light is ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin Fresnel]] phenomenologically explains optical activity by introducing circular birefringence
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[William Sturgeon]], founder of the first English Electric Journal, ''Annals of Electricity'', found that an iron core inside a helical coil of wire connected to a battery greatly increased the resulting magnetic field, thus making possible the more powerful [[electromagnet]]s utilizing a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] core. Sturgeon also bent the iron core into a U-shape to bring the poles closer together, thus concentrating the magnetic field lines. These discoveries followed Ampère's discovery that electricity passing through a coiled wire produced a magnetic force and that of [[François Arago|Dominique François Jean Arago]] finding that an iron bar is magnetized by putting it inside the coil of current-carrying wire, but Arago had not observed the increased strength of the resulting field while the bar was being magnetized.
* 1826 &amp;mdash; [[Georg Simon Ohm]] states his [[Ohm's law]] of [[electrical resistance]] in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, and also published in his landmark pamphlet ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet'' in '''1827'''. The unit [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (Ω) of electrical resistance has been named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/ohmlawexperiments.html |title=Georg Simon Ohm: The Discovery of Ohm's Law |publisher=Juliantrubin.com |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1829 &amp; 1830 &amp;mdash; [[Francesco Zantedeschi]] publishes papers on the production of electric currents in closed circuits by the approach and withdrawal of a magnet, thereby anticipating Michael Faraday's classical experiments of 1831.
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] began experiments leading to his discovery of the law of [[electromagnetic induction]], though the discovery may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi. His breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary electric current was induced in the other coil. He then found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, or vice versa, an electric current also flowed in the wire. He then used this principle to construct the [[Dynamo|electric dynamo]], the first electric power generator. He proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor, but did not complete that work. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields. That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which were to dominate the 19th century. His demonstrations that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field,  mathematically modeled by [[Faraday's law of induction]], would subsequently become one of [[Maxwell's equations]]. These consequently evolved into the generalization of [[Field (physics)|field theory]].
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Macedonio Melloni]] uses a [[thermopile]] to detect infrared radiation
* 1832 &amp;mdash; [[Pavel Schilling|Baron Pavel L'vovitch Schilling]] (Paul Schilling) creates the first electromagnetic telegraph, consisting of a single-needle system in which a code was used to indicate the characters. Only months later, Göttingen professors [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] constructed a telegraph that was working two years before Schilling could put his into practice. Schilling demonstrated the long-distance transmission of signals between two different rooms of his apartment and was the first to put into practice a binary system of signal transmission.
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] states [[Lenz's law]]: if an increasing (or decreasing) magnetic flux induces an [[Electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]], the resulting current will oppose a further increase (or decrease) in magnetic flux, i.e., that an induced current in a closed conducting loop will appear in such a direction that it opposes the change that produced it. Lenz's law is one consequence of the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. If a magnet moves towards a closed loop, then the induced current in the loop creates a field that exerts a force opposing the motion of the magnet. Lenz's law can be derived from [[Faraday's law of induction]] by noting the negative sign on the right side of the equation. He also independently discovered [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]] in '''1842'''; to honor his efforts, Russian physicists refer to it as the "Joule-Lenz law."
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] announces his law of [[Electrochemical_equivalent#Electrochemical_equivalents|electrochemical equivalents]]
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] determines the direction of the induced [[electromotive force]] (emf) and [[Electric current|current]] resulting from [[electromagnetic induction]]. [[Lenz's law]] provides a physical interpretation of the choice of sign in [[Faraday's law of induction]] (1831), indicating that the induced emf and the change in flux have opposite signs.
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Jean-Charles Peltier]] discovers the [[Peltier effect]]: heating by an electric current at the junction of two different metals.
* 1835 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Henry]] invents the [[relay|electric relay]], which is an electrical switch by which the change of a weak current through the windings of an electromagnet will attract an armature to open or close the switch. Because this can control (by opening or closing) another, much higher-power, circuit, it is in a broad sense a form of electrical amplifier. This made a practical electric telegraph possible. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon’s design, which used loosely coiled, uninsulated wire. He also discovered the property of [[self inductance]] independently of Michael Faraday.
[[File:International Morse Code.svg|right|thumb|180px|Chart of the [[Morse code]] letters and numerals.]]
* 1836 &amp;mdash; [[David Alter|Dr. David Alter]] invents and demonstrates to witnesses the first American electric telegraph in Elderton, Pennsylvania. In a later interview in the book, ''Biographical and Historical Cyclopedia of Indiana and Armstrong Counties'' he states: "I may say that there is no connection at all between the telegraph of Morse and others and that of myself...Professor Morse most probably never heard of me or my Elderton telegraph." In '''1840''' he invents an electric buggy, forerunner of the automobile. His inventions also include an electric clock and a short-range type of telephone, forerunner to Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He is also credited with the origins of Spectrum Analysis by his idea that every element has its own emission spectrum, and an expansion of spectrum analysis to include the optical properties of gases.
* 1837 &amp;mdash; [[Samuel Morse]] develops an alternative electrical telegraph design capable of transmitting long distances over poor quality wire. He and his assistant [[Alfred Vail]] develop the [[Morse code]] signaling alphabet. In '''1838''' Morse successfully tested the device at the Speedwell Ironworks near [[Morristown, New Jersey]], and publicly demonstrated it to a scientific committee at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. The first electric telegram using this device was sent by Morse on 24 May, '''1844''' from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., bearing the message "[[Book of Numbers|What hath God wrought]]?"
* 1838 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] uses Volta's battery to discover [[cathode ray]]s.
* 1839 &amp;mdash; [[Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] observes the [[photoelectric effect]] with an electrode in a conductive solution exposed to light.
* 1840 &amp;mdash; [[James Prescott Joule]] formulates [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]] (sometimes called the Joule-Lenz law) quantifying the amount of heat produced in a circuit as proportional to the product of the time duration, the resistance, and the square of the current passing through it.
* 1845 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] discovers that light propagation in a material can be influenced by external [[magnetic field]]s ([[Faraday effect]])
* 1849 &amp;mdash; [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Jean-Bernard Foucault]] measure the speed of light to be about 298,000&amp;nbsp;km/s

===1851-1900===
* 1852 &amp;mdash; [[George Gabriel Stokes]] defines the [[Stokes parameters]] of polarization
* 1852 &amp;mdash; [[Edward Frankland]] develops the theory of [[valence (chemistry)|chemical valence]]
* 1854 &amp;mdash; [[Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]], physicist and one of the founders of [[spectroscopy]], publishes [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Laws]] on the conservation of electric charge and energy, which are used to determine currents in each branch of a circuit.
* 1855 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] submits ''On Faraday's Lines of Force'' for publication containing a [http://archive.org/stream/scientificpapers01maxw#page/202/mode/2up mathematical statement] of [[Ampère's circuital law]] relating the curl of a magnetic field to the electrical current at a point.
* 1861 &amp;mdash; the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|first transcontinental telegraph system]] spans North America by connecting an existing network in the eastern United States to a small network in California by a link between Omaha and Carson City via Salt Lake City. The slower Pony Express system ceased operation a month later.
* 1864 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his papers on a dynamical theory of the [[electromagnetic field]]
* 1865 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his landmark paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]], in which [[Maxwell's equations]] demonstrated that electric and [[magnetism|magnetic]] forces are two complementary aspects of [[electromagnetism]]. He shows that the associated complementary electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetism travel through space, in the form of waves, at a constant velocity of 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. He also proposes that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and that waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments. Using available data, he obtains a velocity of 310,740,000&amp;nbsp;m/s and states "This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other [[radiation]]s if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws."

* 1905 &amp;mdash; [[Albert Einstein]] proposes the [[Special Relativity|Theory of Special Relativity]], in which he rejects the existence of the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] as unnecessary for explaining the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Instead, Einstein asserts ''as a [[postulate]]'' that the speed of light is constant in all [[inertial|inertial frames of reference]], and goes on to demonstrate a number of revolutionary (and highly counter-intuitive) consequences, including [[time dilation]], [[length contraction]], the [[relativity of simultaneity]], the [[relativistic mass|dependence of mass on velocity]], and the [[mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].

[[Image:wood truss plates.jpg|thumb|Metal connector plates.]]

A '''truss connector plate''', or gang plate, is a kind of [[tie (engineering)|tie]]. Truss Plates are light gauge metal plates used to connect prefabricated light frame wood trusses. They are produced by punching light gauge [[galvanized steel]] in order to have teeth on one side. The teeth will allow to join different trusses together by being embedded into the lumber using an [[hydraulic press]] or a roller.

Nail plates are used to connect timber of the same thickness in the same plane. When used on trusses, they are pressed into the side of the timber using special hydraulic tools. As the plate is pressed in, the nails are all "driven" simultaneously and the compression between adjacent nails reduces the tendency to split.

A truss connector plate is manufactured from [[ASTM]] A653/A653M, A591, A792/A792M, or A167 structural quality [[steel]] and is protected with [[zinc]] or zinc-aluminum alloy coatings or their [[stainless steel]] equivalent. Metal connector plates have integral teeth and are manufactured to various sizes (that is, length and width) and thickness or gauges and are designed to laterally transmit loads in wood. They are also known as stud ties, metal connector plates, mending plates, or nail plates. However, not all types of nail plates are approved for use in trusses and other structurally critical placements. &lt;ref&gt;"Truss Plates", Wood Design Manual 2010, Canadian Wood Council&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[John Calvin Jureit]] invented the truss connector plate and patented it in 1955 and forming the company Gang-Nails, Inc.

'''Urolagnia''' (also '''urophilia''', '''undinism''', '''golden shower''' and '''watersports''') is a form of [[salirophilia]] (which is a form of [[paraphilia]]) in which sexual excitement is associated with the sight or thought of urine or [[urination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/eight/000113596.htm|title=MerckEngage® - Healthy Living Tips and Health Information|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824034045/http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=%2Fppdocs%2Fus%2Fcommon%2Fdorlands%2Fdorland%2Feight%2F000113596.htm|archive-date=24 August 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has origins in the [[Greek language]] (from ''ouron'' – urine, and ''lagneia'' – lust).&lt;ref name="ency"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-urolagnia.html |title=A Dictionary of Psychology |last=Colman |first=Andrew M. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-280632-1 |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321150936/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-urolagnia.html |archivedate=March 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SexDev-googlebooks"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment |last=Laws |first=Dr. Richard |author2=William T.

==Overview==

As a [[paraphilia]], urine may be consumed or the person may bathe in it. Other variations include arousal from wetting or seeing someone else urinate in their pants or underclothes, or [[bedwetting|wetting the bed]]. Other forms of urolagnia may involve a tendency to be [[sexually aroused]] by smelling urine-soaked clothing or body parts. In many cases, a strong correlation or conditioning arises between urine smell or sight, and the sexual act. For some individuals the phenomenon may include a [[diaper]] fetish and/or arousal from [[Paraphilic infantilism|infantilism]].

Urolagnia is sometimes associated with, or confused with, arousal from having a full [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] or a sexual attraction to someone else experiencing the discomfort or pain of a full bladder, possibly a [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] inclination.

==Common variations==
* '''Clothes wetting''': The person is sexually aroused by wetting one's clothing or observing another person doing so. Usually that person prefers to stage the wetting so that his/her legs (or other body parts) become soaked with urine. The warm sensation felt when urine trickles on the body seems to give very relaxing and pleasurable feelings to the person. In many cases, that person is also aroused by smelling body parts that have a urine scent. Others get aroused by telling some people about when they lost control and wet themselves. Some prefer a particular type of clothing to urinate.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
* '''[[Exhibitionism]]''': Becoming noticeably desperate or wetting oneself with the express purpose of being seen by strangers. Practitioners have described going to public places such as a mall or a park. Some intend to create situations where others can see their wet clothing.
* '''Human urinal''': Within the [[BDSM]] community, some individuals desire to be used as a human urinal and some desire to use a human urinal.  The submissive  is usually strictly forbidden from placing their lips directly on the body of the dominant so the practice routinely involves them receiving much of the spray all over their face, hair and body; however, another way of doing this that applies mostly to male dominants, is to place the mouth on the head of the penis and [[Urophagia|drink the urine]] as it is released. One other, less common variation of this kink involves the dominant partner urinating inside the submissive partner's vagina or anus, which is usually followed up by the submissive partner ejecting the urine from their orifice(s).
* '''[[Omorashi]]''': The act of holding one's own urine until the need to urinate is urgent, making another hold in their urine, or watching another person with an urgent need to urinate. This fetish sometimes originates from childhood memories of needing, or of seeing another needing, to urinate. Arousal may be triggered by seeing the body movements or facial expressions of that person. It can also be heightened by the person saying that they have to urinate. The arousal from being desperate comes from the sensation of having a full bladder.
* '''Pussing''': British expression for an activity involving a consenting couple where the male partner watches the woman urinate otherwise undetected in a semi-public place, usually a toilet cubicle at a pub, hotel, restaurant, theatre/cinema, office, club, etc. The  strategies and tactics that are used to smuggle one of the couple into and out of the toilet undetected are as important or almost as important as the urination. The activity is done by itself or as a part of or prelude to other activities which many times involve sex.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''[[Voyeurism]]''': Seeing another urinate without the person's knowledge either through video taping by a hidden camera, or by lurking in locations where people are urinating or are likely to have an urge to urinate.

==Frequency==
Jennifer Eve Rehor of [[San Francisco State University]] points out that such data as exists on what she calls "unconventional" or "kink" sexual behavior is generally problematic because of the way that it has been collected, through criminal and clinical case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Eve Rehor (2015), "Sensual, Erotic, and Sexual Behaviors of Women from the ‘'Kink’ Community," Archives of Sexual Behavior 44:825–836, DOI 10.1007/s10508-015-0524-2&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior that appears neither in criminal trials nor in clinical studies (for example, because the individuals concerned do not commonly seek professional help) is therefore under-reported. Rehor therefore surveyed 1,764 female participants in "kink" behavior (mostly association with [[BDSM]]) in 2010-11, receiving 1,580 valid responses. What Rehor calls "urine play" is relatively infrequent, with only 36.52% of her sample reporting having done it or having had it done to them. In contrast, 93.99% of her sample reported having done [[spanking]] or having had it done to them, and  61.96% reported having used or been exposed to [[feathers]]/[[fur]].&lt;ref&gt;Rehor (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible to extrapolate Rehor's data onto the general population, but her study does give a guide to prevalence in the North American BDSM community.

'''''Vägmärken''''' ('''''Markings''''', or more literally '''''Waymarks'''''), published in 1963, is the only book by former [[UN secretary general]], [[Dag Hammarskjöld]].

== Personal significance ==
[[File:Dag-hammarskjold 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dag Hammarskjöld]], author of ''Markings'']]A collection of his diary reflections, the book starts in 1925, when he was 20 years old, and ends at his death in 1961. The typewritten manuscript was found in the bedside table of his New York apartment after Hammarskjöld's death in the Congo.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; As van Dusen writes: "His last night had been spent in the residency of Sture Linner ([[:sv:Sture Linner|sv]]), head of the [[Congo Crisis|United Nations mission to the Congo]]. He left there the copy of the German original of [[Ich und Du]] (I and Thou) presented to him by [[Martin Buber]] and the first dozen pages of his translation into Swedish...Beside the bed was the cherished copy of [[Thomas a Kempis]]' ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' which was always on the table of his [[New York City]] apartment next to his bed where the manuscript of ''Markings'' was found."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the entries in ''Markings'' describe Hammarskjöld's struggles to view his professional duty as a spiritual responsibility. The entry on June 11, 1961, for example, reads: "Summoned/To carry it,/Aloned/To assay it,/Chosen/To suffer it,/And free/To deny it,/I saw/For one moment/The sail/In the sun-storm,/Far off/On a wave-crest,/Alone,/Bearing from land./For one moment/I saw."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) [[Faber and Faber]] London 1964 p175&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammarskjöld died in a plane crash in [[Zambia]], near midnight, on September 17–18, 1961. The last entry of ''Markings'' is dated 24 August 1961: "Is it a new country/In another world of reality/Than Day's?/Or did I live there/Before Day was?/ I awoke/To an ordinary morning with grey light/Reflected from the street,/But still remembered/The dark-blue night/Above the tree line,/The open moor in moonlight,/The crest in shadow,/Remembered other dreams/Of the same mountain country:/Twice I stood on its summits,/I stayed by its remotest lake,/And followed the river/Towards its source./The seasons have changed/And the light/And the weather/And the hour./But it is the same land./And I begin to know the map/And to get my bearings."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 181&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual significance ==
''Markings'' was described by the late theologian Henry P. Van Dusen as "the noblest self-disclosure of spiritual struggle and triumph, perhaps the greatest testament of personal faith written ... in the heat of professional life and amidst the most exacting responsibilities for [[world peace]] and order."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p 5&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "among the approximately six hundred 'Road Marks' staked down along the "Way' of Dag Hammarskjöld's pilgrimage, almost exactly a hundred are concerned in greater or lesser measure with God."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p200&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammarskjöld writes, for example, "We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours. He who wills adventure will experience it—according to the measure of his courage. He who wills sacrifice will be sacrificed—according to the measure of his purity of heart." &lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry of 4 August 1959 reads: "To have humility is to experience reality, not ''in relation to ourselves'', but in its sacred independence. It is to see, judge, and act from the point of rest in ourselves. Then, how much disappears, and all that remains falls into place. In the point of rest at the centre of our being, we encounter a world where all things are at rest in the same way. Then a tree becomes a mystery, a cloud, a revelation, each man a cosmos of whose riches we can only catch glimpses. The life of simplicity is simple, but it opens to us a book in which we never get beyond the first syllable."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 148&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary significance ==
''Markings'' is characterised by Hammarskjöld's intermingling of prose and [[haiku]] poetry in a manner exemplified by the 17th-century Japanese poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Basho]] in his ''[[Narrow Roads to the Deep North]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p149&lt;/ref&gt; Representative examples include:

The Easter-lily's dew-wet calyx.&lt;br /&gt;
Drops pausing&lt;br /&gt;
Between earth and sky.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p150&lt;/ref&gt;

They laid the blame on him.&lt;br /&gt;
He didn't know what it was,&lt;br /&gt;
But he confessed it.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees quiver in the wind,&lt;br /&gt;
Sailing on a sea of mist&lt;br /&gt;
Out of earshot.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 157&lt;/ref&gt;

In his foreword to ''Markings'', the English poet [[W. H. Auden]] states: "''Markings'', however, was not intended to be read simply as a work of literature. It is also an historical document of the first importance as an account—and I cannot myself recall another—of the attempt by a professional man of action to unite in one life the ''Via Activa'' and the ''Via Contemplativa''." &lt;ref&gt;WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 23&lt;/ref&gt; Auden quotes Hammarskjöld as stating "In our age, the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action."&lt;ref&gt;WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5679">'''Water marble nails''' are a [[nail art]] technique involving dropping [[nail lacquer]]s into clear water and creating a pattern on the water surface, the pattern is then transferred to the nails.

== History ==
The water marble nail technique was originally developed by professional nail technicians in Japanese nail salons. In the 1990s, it was popularized by commercial publications released by shopping centers in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], [[Japan]]. In 2010, water marble nail art was adapted to use acrylic [[artificial nails]] and gels.

The water marble nail technique has gained popularity across the globe through features in magazines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nailpro.com/water-marble-manicure/ | title=Water Marble Manicure | work=Nail Pro | date=24 June 2011 | author=James, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt; websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nair|first=Sonia|title=Create Marble Nail Art Using Water|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/create-marble-nail-art-using-water.html|work=Buzzle|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denza|first=Diana|title=How To Create The Water Marble Nail Manicure|url=http://www.bettyconfidential.com/ar/ld/a/how-to-create-the-water-marble-nail-manicure.html/|work=Betty Confidential|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  polish makers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pupa.it/ita/pupa-nail-academy/Video-nail-academy/spring-flowers-con-tecnica-water-marble.aspx | title=Spring Flowers con Tecnica Water Marble | work=Pupa Milano | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagaraya|first=Sonal|title=DIY Marble Nail Art Stickers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5S2QGHfOH0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of water marble nail art methods: free-dragging and free-dropping. Free-dragging is more common.

===Free-dragging===
Dragged patterns range from simple circular shapes to complicated drawings. Patterns such as marble, hearts/peacocks,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The pattern called "hearts" is also called "peacock", the name of a professional nail art technique. Drawing a "peacock" is one challenge to professional nail artists sponsored by the Japan Nailist Association.&lt;/ref&gt; animals, flowers, leaves, parallel lines, [[Psychedelic art|psychedelics]], spiderwebs, and random patterns in the style of designer [[Emilio Pucci]] are generally performed with nail lacquers and some kind of tool.

===Free-dropping===
Dropped patterns range from colored shapes to complicated drawings such as spirals and geometric designs. The free patterns are created by colored drops of nail lacquer. For free-dropping, lacquer colors are dropped straight or diagonally onto the water. The pattern floats on the surface of the water.

== Technique ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2016}}
Water marble nail art requires clean water, nail lacquers for free-dropping, and a stick for drawing patterns. Before patterns are created, the nails are painted with a light-colored nail polish that establishes a good contrast with the colors chosen to create the water marble. Some techniques use a matte coat to provide contrast and maintain an even look.

After the base coat has dried, tape is put around the fingers to gather the excess nail polish after the marbling. One or two drops of colored lacquer are chosen for the design and are added to a cup of clean water. The drops will create a circle on the water surface. The next color is added on top of the circle created by the previous drop. The resulting pattern is ready for application to the nail, but it can still be modified with a stick or toothpick to create different shapes. The nail is dipped into the pattern on the water and kept under water as a [[Q-tip]] is used to "grab" the remaining polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Namuli|first1=Mary Janet|title=Water Marble Nails - What You Need To Know|url=http://www.designsauthority.com/water-marble-nails/|website=Designs Authority|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
