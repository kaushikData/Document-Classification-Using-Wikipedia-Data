The '''2001 Copa América''' was held in Colombia, from 11 to 29 July. It was organised by [[CONMEBOL]], South America's football governing body.

There is no qualifying for the final tournament. CONMEBOL's ten South American countries participate, along with two more invited countries, making a total of twelve teams competing in the tournament. Originally, [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and [[CONCACAF]] [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup|Champions]] [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] were invited.

Prior to the tournament, three meetings were held by [[CONMEBOL]] authorities who were concerned about potential security issues in Colombia. On 1 July they announced the cancellation of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vickery | first = Tim | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1463050.stm | title = Colombia seize first Copa crown | publisher = BBC | date = 30 July 2001 | accessdate = 24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=footballtimes&gt;{{cite new |url=http://thesefootballtimes.co/2015/02/16/honduras-legendary-copa-america-odyssey/ |title= 
Honduras’ Legendary Copa América Odyssey |author=Steven Scragg |publisher=These Football Times |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela offered to host the competition, but on 6 July CONMEBOL decided to reinstate the plans for Colombia, and the tournament was held on schedule.

When the tournament was originally cancelled, [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] disbanded its training camp and Canadian players returned to their club teams. The [[Canadian Soccer Association]] announced they would not be able to participate in the reinstated tournament.  With only a few days notice, [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] (CONCACAF) accepted an invite to take Canada's spot in the tournament.  The Costa Ricans advanced to the knockout stage, losing in the quarterfinals.

Complaining about the sudden reversal, and claiming that Argentine players had received death threats from terrorist groups, the [[Argentine Football Association]] decided to withdraw from the competition on 10 July, in spite of Colombian authorities proposing to implement additional protection measures.&lt;ref name=footballtimes/&gt; With the tournament starting the next day, [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] (CONCACAF) were invited, arriving with barely enough players on 13 July in an airplane provided by the [[Colombian Air Force]], after the tournament started and just a few hours before its first game.  The Hondurans performed well through the tournament, finishing in third place. 

Despite the pre-tournament concerns, there were no incidents of violence nor acts of assault towards any of the participating nations.

|}

The teams were divided into three groups of four teams each. The formation of the groups was made by [[CONMEBOL]], in a public drawing of lots.

Each team plays one match against each of the other teams within the same group. Three (3) points are awarded for a win, one (1) point for a draw and zero (0) points for a defeat.

First and second placed teams in each group advance to the quarter-finals.
The best third placed team and the second best third placed team, also advance to the quarter-finals.

* Tie-breaker
** If teams finish leveled on points, the following tie-breakers are used:
*# greater goal difference in all group games;
*# greater number of goals scored in all group games;
*# winner of the head-to-head match between the teams in question;
*# drawing of lots.

'''All-High Stadium''' (Robert E. Rich All-High Stadium) is a [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. It was opened in 1926, and received a Memorial Day dedication on May 29, 1929. The stadium was modeled after classic European soccer stadiums of the time. It is part of the [[Bennett High School, New York|Bennett High School]] complex. It is bounded by the high school and Main Street to the northwest, Manhattan Avenue to the northeast, Hill Street to the southeast, and Mercer Avenue to the southwest.

[[Image:All-High Stadium - The Natural.JPG|thumb|240px|right|All-High Stadium, altered for use&lt;br&gt; in ''The Natural'']]

==History==

===Filming===
The stadium was used in the filming of a key scene in ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'', a 1984 film set in the 1930s, as a stand-in for [[Wrigley Field]] in [[Chicago]], which was unavailable. Although there is some ivy along the walls suggesting Wrigley, the upper deck in the outfield is more suggestive of Chicago's other major ballpark of that era, [[Comiskey Park]]. In some portions of the scene, football lines are visible, which is not anomalous, as both Chicago parks served as homes to football teams at that time.

In fact, All-High Stadium has only a single level of stands with a roof. The upper deck in the film appears to have been inserted in post-production, and the scoreboard either matted in or built as a temporary structure over an existing tall smokestack on a building that stands at the north corner of the stadium, presumably part of Bennett High's heating plant. The actual Wrigley does not have smokestacks, but rather houses and small businesses serving as its backdrops.

Most of ''The Natural's'' baseball action scenes were filmed in [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]], which has since been demolished. All-High Stadium still stands, albeit substantially remodeled since ''The Natural'' filmed there.

===Professional tenants===
All-High Stadium is the current home of [[National Premier Soccer League|NPSL]] team [[FC Buffalo]] and [[United Women's Soccer|UWS]] team [[Western New York Flash]]. It served as the home pitch for the [[Buffalo Storm]] of the [[United Soccer League (1984–85)|United Soccer League]] in 1984. It is currently utilized by [[Medaille College]]'s men and women's soccer teams along with its men's and women's lacrosse teams.

===Renovation===
Renovations on the stadium were completed in 2007. As a result, the stadium lost much of its 30s film appearance during the processes.&lt;ref name="TOUR OF THE NATURAL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forgottenbuffalo.com/thenaturaltour.html | title=TOUR OF "THE NATURAL" SITES | publisher=FORGOTTEN BUFFALO | year=2007 | accessdate=February 5, 2012 | author=Forgotten Buffalo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, All-High is configured for a more intimate setting of nearly 5,000 spectators, 4,500 of which are covered seats.

As of 2010, All-High Stadium is one of three high school stadiums in regular use in the city of Buffalo, the second being one at [[Riverside Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Dave (2010-09-04).

[[WGRZ]]. Retrieved 2010-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt; and the third being [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|Johnnie B. Wiley Field at War Memorial Stadium]].

'''Bicentennial Park''' is a [[baseball]] and [[softball]] [[stadium]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].  The park, originally named after the [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial year]] in which it was renovated, was officially renamed '''Earl F. Hunsicker Bicentennial Park''' after Hunsicker's death in 1987;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.mcall.com/1988-06-07/news/2627005_1_formalized-sparkle-allentown-s-bicentennial-park&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.mcall.com/1988-06-03/news/2627591_1_patriots-renaming-bicentennial-park&lt;/ref&gt; it was renamed '''ECTB Stadium at Earl F. Hunsicker Bicentennial Park''' in 2005. ECTB is an acronym for the ''Elite Championship Tournament Baseball'', a youth baseball organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ectb.org/ectb/field_directions.asp?fieldid=21&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium and land around it are owned by the [[City of Allentown]] and currently leased to the ECTB, which in turn sub-lets the stadium to numerous community organizations which host events there throughout the year. The ballpark currently seats 4,600.

==Origins==
The ballpark opened in 1939 as '''Fairview Field''', home to the Allentown Dukes, a [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] [[Minor League]] farm team. The Dukes, a founding member of the [[Interstate League]], won both the regular-season pennant and defeated the Sunbury Senators in the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?id=4e618d93&lt;/ref&gt; The 1939 Dukes featured future [[Major League Baseball]] players [[Joe Antolick]], [[George Hennessey]] and [[Tony Parisse]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi?id=795d5d2a&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the Dukes were replaced by the Allentown Fleetwings, which were affiliated with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. In 1941, the team as taken over by the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and renamed again, as the Allentown Wings; they reverted to the Cardinals in 1944 and played their final season at Fairview in 1947. (Allentown would play for the Interstate League title three times in four years, in 1944, 1945 and 1947, but lost each time.) The team moved to [[Breadon Field]], a new ballpark just north of the city in [[Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|Whitehall Township]], on August 6, 1948 after playing on the road until then due to construction delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcall.com/sports/all-ironpigs-special-033008-history,0,1469.story?page=1 |title="Baseball has been down, but not out," ''Morning Call'', March 30, 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wfmz.com/features/historys-headlines/baseball-at-breadon-field-60-years-ago-was-once-place-to-be/16981160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bicentennial Park==
Fairview Field was renovated in the mid-1970s and re-opened as '''Bicentennial Park''' in 1976 for use as a softball field. The renovation effort was led by Earl F. Hunsicker who raised an estimated $1,400,000 over an 11-year period, aided by Mayor Joseph S.

After the [[Eastern League]]'s Allentown Red Sox played their final season in 1960, the city was without pro ball until the [[Allentown Ambassadors]] of the independent [[Northeast League]] arrived in 1997. However, dwindling attendance (hurt by increasingly poor on-field performance) led to owner Peter Karoly to fold the team shortly before the 2004 season; the franchise wound up as a travel team for a year (as the [[Northeast League Aces]]) before becoming the [[Worcester Tornadoes]] in 2005. Over its six seasons, twenty-one MLB players played for or managed the Ambassadors, including [[Ed Ott]], [[Luis Andujar]], [[Kim Batiste]], [[Scott Bullett]], [[Brian Drahman]], [[Angelo Encarnacion]], [[Mike Figga]], [[Jason McDonald]], [[Darryl Motley]], and [[Brad Pennington]]. 

From 2006-09, Bicentennial Park returned to a softball configuration to host the [[Philadelphia Force]] of [[National Pro Fastpitch]], despite the fact that Allentown is an hour-and-a-half's drive from Philly. 

2008 saw the opening of a new stadium just across town: [[Coca-Cola Park (Allentown)|Coca-Cola Park]], home of the newly-created [[Lehigh Valley IronPigs]], Triple A affiliate of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. This ended any realistic chance of the old ballpark returning to pro ball; instead, the Allentown Railers of the [[Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League]] began playing at ECTB in 2012. The Railers have been successful, winning league championships in 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acbl-online.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land dispute and proposed demolition==
In 2009, a controversy emerged over the land the stadium sits upon. [[LANTA]] (Lehigh And Northampton Transportation Authority), who at the time owned 0.2 acres of the property extending from the left field parking lot to the left field base line, announced plans to build a new garage using federal stimulus money and later expand the site and buy the remaining property the stadium sits on from the city of Allentown.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.mcall.com/2009-03-04/news/4322567_1_youth-baseball-lanta-garage&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, which would result in the demolition of the stadium, ran into opposition from the family of Earl Hunsicker as well as ECTB owner Terry Schadler, who tied up the proposal in the Allentown City Council. After a four-year lease renewal was awarded by City Council to new ECTB owner Dylan Dando in 2016, the matter was resolved in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcall.com/news/local/allentown/mc-allentown-lanta-land-swap-20170301-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wfmz.com/news/lehigh-valley/allentown-council-member-laments-sorry-conditions-at-bicentennial-park/18689880&lt;/ref&gt; The property in question was returned from LANTA to the City of Allentown in exchange for existing adjacent land which had been vacant and used for stadium parking, which LANTA intends to use for expansion of their existing facility near the stadium. The $13,000,000 expansion to the facility will add space vertically and allow for a compressed natural gas filling station on their property. This deal allows the stadium to remain open, although the Hunsicker family has expressed reservations based on the potential for disruption of parking at the site.

[[File:Respirator canister with ESLI for asid gases -6.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Combined gas and particulate respirator filter for 
protection against acid gases, the type of '''BKF''' (''БКФ''). It has a transparent body and special sorbent that changes color after the saturation. This color change may be used for timely replacement of respirators' filters (like End of Service Life Indicator ESLI). The filter is made, presumably, in the city of Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod region (RF).]]

A [[respirator]] '''cartridge''' or '''canister''' is a container that cleans pollution from air. [[Employees]] working in a polluted atmosphere use [[respirator]]s for health preservation. If the [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] in the [[workplace]] is polluted with noxious gases, but contains a lot of oxygen&lt;ref&gt;(&gt;19.5% in US; &gt;18% in RF)&lt;/ref&gt; they often use air-purifying [[respirator]]s (APR). These respirators provide employees breathable air by removing pollution from ambient air using canisters or cartridges. There are cartridges of different types, and they must be chosen correctly and replaced in a timely manner.

== The principles of purification of polluted air in APR ==
=== Absorption ===
Capture noxious gases may be accomplished by the [[sorbent]]s.&lt;ref name="Дубинин-1939" /&gt; These materials ([[activated carbon]], [[aluminium oxide]] etc.) have a large [[specific surface area]] and can [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] gases. Typically, such sorbents used in the form of [[Granular material|granules]], and cartridge case is filled with them. Contaminated air travels through the bed of sorbent granules in the cartridge, and movable harmful gas [[molecule]]s collide with the surface of the sorbent and remain therein. The sorbent has saturated the molecules caught and gradually loses its ability to capture the gases. So, contaminated air can pass through the saturated sorbent to the layers of fresh sorbent. The [[concentration]] of harmful substances in the purified air after prolonged use of the cartridge increases, and may exceed the Permissible Exposure Limit  [[Permissible exposure limit|PEL]]. Therefore, the service life of the cartridges is limited. The bond strength between the captured molecule and sorbent has a small, and the molecule is able to separate from the sorbent and get into the air again. The ability of the sorbent to capture the gases depends on: the properties of the gases and their concentrations, the [[Temperature|air temperature]], the air [[relative humidity]], the rate of air consumed by the employee, and many other factors. Activated carbon can be saturated with chemicals that make more stronger ties with molecules of trapped gases - to improve the capture of a number of harmful gases. The saturation of the activated carbon with [[iodine]] - improves the capture of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]; saturation of metal [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] - improves the capture of [[ammonia]]; saturation metal [[oxide]]s - improves capture [[acid gas]]es.&lt;ref name="Patty-1985" /&gt;

=== The [[chemical reaction]] between the gas and the absorber ([[chemisorption]]) ===
The ability of some harmful gases to react chemically with some other substances can be used to capture them. For example, the authors&lt;ref name="Дубинин-1939" /&gt; describe the ability of [[copper]] salts to form complex compounds with ammonia. Creating strong links between the gas molecules and the sorbent may allow one the use of gas canisters repeatedly - if it has sufficient unsaturated sorbent.

=== The catalytic decomposition ===
Some harmful gases can be neutralized through [[catalytic oxidation]]. A [[hopcalite]] can oxidize toxic [[carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide, CO]] to harmless [[carbon dioxide]]. But the effectiveness of this [[catalyst]] strongly decreases with [[relative humidity]] increases. Therefore, there are some drier ([[desiccant]]) in the canisters (before such [[catalyst]]s). A polluted air always contains [[water vapor]], and after the saturation of the desiccant - [[catalyst]] ceases [[carbon monoxide]] neutralization.

=== Combined cartridges ===
If employer use combined (multigas) cartridges, that provide air purification from a combination of different harmful gases, they apply gas cartridges with such sorbents or/and catalysts, that is necessary to capture the gases; and such canister is subject to all relevant constraints.

== Classification and marking of cartridges ==

=== United States ===
In the U.S., manufacturers can certify cartridges intended for purifying workplace air from various gaseous contaminants.&lt;ref name="Color-code-42CFR84" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed" style="text-align:center"
! colspan="2" | Cartridges types in US
|-

|-

|-
| Organic vapors || Brown
|-
| Other gases and vapors, not listed above || Olive color
|-
| colspan="2" | '''†''' ''Gray shall not be assigned as the main color for a canister designed to remove acids or vapors''
|}
The orange color can be used for painting the entire cartridge housing, or as a strip. But this color is not in the table, and to determine from what protects the cartridge with such color one should read the inscription.

The legislation requires the employer to select cartridges '''using only labels''' and not the color of the markings (to reduce the risk of error).

=== European Union and RF ===
In the EU and in RF (Russian Federation),&lt;ref name="ГОСТ-193" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ГОСТ-231" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ГОСТ-232" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ГОСТ-235" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ГОСТ-245" /&gt; manufacturers can certify cartridges intended for cleaning air of various gaseous contaminants.  The codes are covered by [[EN14387]], additionally particulate codes P1, P2 and P3 are used.  For example, A1P2 is the code for commonly used filters in industry and agriculture that provide protection against A type gases and commonly occurring particulates.

Cartridges AX, SX and NOP3 not distinguish on the sorption capacity (as in the US) when they are classified and certified.

If the cartridge is designed to protect from several different types of harmful gases, in the designation contains the list of designations for specific types of perceived harmful gases, for example: '''A2B1''', color - brown and grey.

== Choice and timely replacement of cartridges ==
[[File:Индикатор окончания срока службы ESLI.jpg|thumb|300px|right|End of Service Life Indicator ('''ESLI'''). The saturation of the sorbent mercury vapor leads to the change of the color (circle in the center) from orange to brown]]
{{anchor|Replacement}}Selection of the cartridge should be carried out after determining the composition of the atmosphere in the workplace. To choose the right types of cartridges in the U.S., the employer may use the NIOSH guide&lt;ref name="NPG-2007" /&gt; or the recommendations of the manufacturers. The service life of all types of cartridges is limited. Therefore, the employer is obliged to replace them in a timely manner.

=== Old methods ===

==== The use of subjective reactions of an employee’s sensory system ====
{{anchor|WarningP}}The use of cartridges in the contaminated atmosphere leads to saturation of the sorbent (or the dryer — when using catalysts). The concentration of harmful gases in the purified air gradually increases. The ingress of harmful gases in the inhaled air can lead to the reaction of the employee’s [[sensory system]]: [[odor]], [[taste]], [[irritation]] of the [[respiratory system]], [[dizziness]], [[headaches]], and other health impairments (up to loss of [[consciousness]]).&lt;ref name="Учебник по выбору" /&gt;

These signs (known in the U.S. as "warning properties" - p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;ref name="Учебник по выбору" /&gt;) indicate that one must leave the polluted workplace area, and replace the cartridges with a new one. (This can also be a symptom of a loose fit the mask to one [[face]] and the leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and the face). Historically, this method is the oldest.
[[File:ESLI-after-Hg-exposure.jpg|thumb|400px|Respirator cartridge (3M 6009) for protection against mercury vapor and chlorine. This cartridge has an indicator that progressively changes color (from yellow to black, 1-2-3-4) when it is exposed to mercury vapor.]]
The advantages of this method – if harmful gases have warning properties at concentrations less than 1 [[Permissible exposure limit|PEL]], the replacement will be produced in a timely manner (''in most cases, at least''); the application of this method does not require the use of special cartridges (more expensive) and accessories; replacement happens when one needs to do it – after the sorbent saturation, and without any calculations; the sorption capacity of the cartridges is fully expired (which reduces costs for respiratory protection).

The disadvantage of this method is that some of harmful gases have no warning properties. For example, there is a list of more than 500 harmful gases in the&lt;ref name="Справочник-2008" /&gt; and more than 60 of them have no warning properties, and there are '''no any''' such information for more than one hundred of them. So, if one uses warning properties to replace cartridges, this leads to breathiing air with excess harmful gas concentration in some cases. The table contains a list of the chemicals that have no warning properties.

If the threshold odor of [[pentaborane]] is 194 PEL; and if its concentration is only 10 PEL, one cannot timely change cartridges with using smell - they could be "used" forever ''(but they cannot protect forever).''

Practice has shown that the presence of warning properties not always leads to the timely replacement of cartridges.&lt;ref name="Учебник-по-выбору-1987" /&gt; A study&lt;ref name="Amoore-1983" /&gt; showed that on average 95% of a group of people has an individual threshold of olfactory sensitivity in the range of from 1/16 to 16 from the mean. This means that 2.5% of people will not be able to smell harmful gases at a concentration 16 times greater than the average threshold of perception of a smell. The threshold of sensitivity of different people can vary by two orders of magnitude. That is, 15% of people do not smell at concentrations 4 times higher sensitivity threshold. The value of threshold smell greatly depends on how much [[attention]] people pay this, and on their health status.

The sensitivity of people may be reduced, for example - when [[Common cold|colds]] and other [[disease]]s. It turned out that worker's ability to detect the smell also depends on the nature of the work to be performed — if it requires concentration, an employee doesn't react to the smell. Prolonged exposure to harmful gases (for example, [[hydrogen sulfide]]) at low concentration can create a [[olfactory fatigue]], which reduces sensitivity. In all of these cases employees can be exposed to harmful substances with the concentration larger than 1 PEL, and it may lead to the development of [[occupational disease]]s.

This was the reason for the ban to use this method of cartridges replacement in the U.S. since 1996 (the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration ]] OSHA standard).&lt;ref name="Учебник по выбору" /&gt;

==== The increase in mass of the cartridges with desiccant ====
To protect workers from [[carbon monoxide]] often use cartridges with catalyst - [[hopcalite]]. This catalyst does not change its properties over time of use, but when it moistened, the degree of protection significantly reduced. Because water vapor is always present in the air, the polluted air is dehumidified in the cartridge (for use of the catalyst). Due to the fact that the mass of water vapor in the polluted air is much greater than the mass of harmful gases, trapping moisture from the air leads to a significantly higher increase in the mass of cartridges than the trapping gases. This is a substantial difference, and it can be used to determine whether to continue to use gas cartridges further without replacement. The cartridge was weighed, and a decision can be made based on the magnitude of increase of its mass. For example, the book&lt;ref name="Трумпайц" /&gt; describes gas cartridges (model "СО"), which were replaced after weight gain (relative to initial) on 50 grams.

==== Other ways of determining the need to replace cartridges ====
The documents&lt;ref name="Трумпайц" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Шкрабо-1982" /&gt; described Soviet cartridges (model "Г"), designed to protect from mercury. Their service life was limited to 100 hours of use (cartridges without particle filter), or 60 hours of use (cartridges with particle filter), after which it was necessary to replace the cartridges with a new one.

The documents&lt;ref name="Maggs-1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ballantyne-1981" /&gt; describe a non-destructive method of determining the remaining service life of used and new gas cartridges. The polluted air was pumped through the cartridge. The degree of purification of air depends on how much-unsaturated sorbent is in the cartridge. Therefore, accurate measurement of gas concentration in the cleaned air allows one to estimate the amount of the unsaturated sorbent. Polluted air ([[1-Bromobutane|1-bromobutane]]) was pumped for a very short time, and therefore, such tests do not reduce the service life considerably. The sorption capacity decreased due to absorption of this gas by the amount of about 0.5% of the sorption capacity of a new cartridge. The method was also used for 100% [[quality control]] of cartridges, manufactured by the English firm Martindale Protection Co (10 microliters 1-bromobutane injected into the air stream), and to check the cartridges issued to workers in firms Waring Ltd and Rentokil Ltd. This method was used in the [[Defence CBRN Centre|Chemical Defence Establishment]] in the early 1970s. The experts who developed this method, received a [[patent]].&lt;ref name="Patent" /&gt;

The document&lt;ref name="Капцов-1996" /&gt; briefly describes two methods of objective evaluation of the degree of saturation of the sorbent in the cartridges. It recommends using spectral and microchemical methods. The spectral method is based on determining the presence of harmful substances in the cartridge by sampling with subsequent analysis on a special device (стилоскоп - ''on Russian''). A microchemical method is based on a layer-by-layer determination of the presence of harmful substances in the sorbent by sampling with subsequent analysis by chemical method. If the air is contaminated with the most toxic substances, the book is recommended to limit the duration of use of the cartridges, and it recommended to apply the spectral method ([[arsine]] and [[phosphine]], [[phosgene]], [[fluorine]], [[organochloride]], [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic compounds]]), and microchemical methods ([[hydrogen cyanide]], [[cyanogen]]s).

Unfortunately, in both cases, there is no description of how to extract a sample of the sorbent from the cartridge housing (the housing is usually not detachable), and will it be possible to use the cartridge after this test, if the test shows that it is not a lot of saturated sorbents.

=== Modern methods of determining the necessity of cartridges replacement ===
[[File:ESLI-sensors.jpg|thumb|400px|Sensors for End of Service Life Indicator (ESLI), developed in US]]
Cartridges certification provides a '''minimum value''' of their sorption capacity. US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standard for [[1,3-Butadiene]] indicates the specific service life of the cartridges.&lt;ref name="29CFR1910-1051" /&gt;

==== Testing the cartridges in a laboratory ====
If the company has a [[laboratory]] that has the right equipment, specialists can skip the contaminated air through the cartridge and to determine a degree of it cleaning. This method enables one to determine the service life in an environment where the air is contaminated with a mixture of different substances that affect on their capture with a sorbent (one affects on another capture). Service life calculation methods for such conditions have been developed relatively recently. However, this requires accurate information on concentrations of noxious substances, and they often are not permanent.

Tests in laboratories can identify what is the balance of the service life of the cartridges after their use. If the remainder is large, similar cartridges in such circumstances can be used over a longer period of time. In some cases, large balance allows the use of cartridges repeatedly. This method does not require accurate information on concentrations of harmful substances. The cartridge replacement [[schedule]] is drawn upon the basis of the results of their testing in the laboratory. This method has a serious drawback. The company must have a complex and expensive equipment and trained professionals (for using it) - is not always possible. According to a poll,&lt;ref name="Обзор-2001" /&gt; cartridges replacement in the United States was carried out on the basis of their laboratory tests on approximately 5% of all organizations.

Research to determine whether it is possible to calculate the service life of respirator’s cartridges (if one know the conditions of their use) have been conducted in developed countries since the 1970s. This allows one to replace cartridges in a timely fashion - without the use of sophisticated and expensive equipment.

==== Computer programs for calculating the service life of the cartridge ====
The world's leading manufacturers of respirators offered its customers a [[computer program]] for calculating the service life already in the 2000.

[[3M]] program&lt;ref name="3M" /&gt; allowed to calculate the service life of the cartridges exposed with more than 900 harmful gases and their combinations (in 2013). The MSA program&lt;ref name="MSA" /&gt; allow to take into account hundreds of gases and their combinations. Same program was developed by Scott&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; and [[Dragerwerk]].&lt;ref name="Dragerwerk" /&gt; J. Wood developed a mathematical model and software which now allows one to calculate the service life of any cartridges with known properties.&lt;ref name="Wood-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GerryWood-IBUR" /&gt; Now OSHA uses it in program Advisor Genius.&lt;ref name="Advisor-Genius" /&gt;

The merit of this way of replacing the cartridges is that it allows an employer to use normal, "common" cartridges, and if they have the exact data, they may replace them in time. The downside is that because of air contamination is often not constant, and the nature of the work to be performed is not always stable (that is, the flow of air through the cartridges is not permanent), it is recommended to use working conditions for calculations, equal to the worst (for reliable protection of workers). But in all other cases, cartridges will be replaced with a partially used sorbent. This increases the costs of respiratory protection due to more frequent cartridges replacement.

In addition, calculation accuracy is reduced when very high [[relative humidity]], because the mathematical model does not take into account some of the physical effects in such cases.

==== End of Service Life Indicators (ESLI) ====
[[File:ESLI-NORTH-7700-RT41.jpg|thumb|250px|This file is the scheme of installation of the cartridge with End of Service Life Indicator ('''ESLI''') on a half-mask respirator so that the ESLI is visible during operation. The color change shows that the cartridges will cease to capture ammonia, and the employee should leave the workplace to replace the cartridges]]If the cartridges have a device that warns of an employee of the approaching expiration of the term of service life (End of Service Life Indicators, ESLI), the signals of such devices can be used for the timely replacement of cartridges. ESLI can be active&lt;ref name="ESLI+2005" /&gt; or passive.&lt;ref name="ESLI-2005" /&gt; Passive indicators often use sensor that changes [[color]]. This element is installed in the cartridge at some distance from the filtered air outlet (to color change occurred before the harmful gases begin to pass through the cartridge). An active indicator is used as a signal from a sensor to emit a light signal (or turn on a sound alarm) to inform an employee that he or she must leave the contaminated atmosphere and change the cartridge.

Active indicators used light or audible alarm for employee notification that is triggered by a sensor, that is usually installed in the cartridge. Such indicators allow one to replace the cartridges on time in any light and do not require the worker to pay attention to the color of the indicator. They can also be used by workers who badly distinguish different colors.[[File:Active-ESLI.jpg|thumb|250px|A NIOSH respirator with an active End of Service Life Indicator (ESLI).&lt;ref name="ESLI-2007" /&gt;|left]]

Despite the presence of solutions for technical problems, and the availability of the established certification requirements to the ESLI,&lt;ref name="42CFR84" /&gt; during the period from 1984 (first certification standard with requirements for active ESLI) until 2013 nor one cartridge with active ESLI was approved in the US. It turned out that the requirements for the cartridges are not quite exact, and requirements for employers are under no obligation to use these indicators quite specifically. Therefore, respirators’ manufacturers fear of [[Failure#Commercial failures|commercial failure]] when selling new unusual products - although they continue to carry out research and development work in this area.
[[File:ESLI 6051i 1-4.jpg|thumb|300px|Cartridge for protection against organic vapors. A gradual change in the appearance of the ESLI indicator is shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melissa Checky, Kevin Frankel, Denise Goddard, Erik Johnson, J.

But examination of the use of respirators showed that in the U.S. more than 200 thousand workers may be exposed to excessive harmful gases due to the late replacement of cartridges.&lt;ref name="Обзор-2001" /&gt; So, Laboratory of PPE ([[The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory|NPPTL]]) at the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] began to develop an active ESLI. After the completion of the work, by its results, the legal requirements will be clarified, the requirements of the employer will be formulated, and the resulting technology will be transferred to industry - for use in new improved RPD.&lt;ref name="ESLI-2005" /&gt;
[[File:Respirator canister with ESLI for asid gases -9.JPG|thumb|300px|Combined gas and particulate respirator filter for protection against acid gases, the type of BKF (БКФ). It has a transparent body and special sorbent that changes color after the saturation. This color change may be used for timely replacement of respirators' filters (like End of Service Life Indicator ESLI).]]

=== Reusing cartridges ===
If the cartridge contains a lot of the sorbent and if the concentration of contaminants is low; or if the cartridge was used for a short duration of time, after completion of its use, it still has a lot unsaturated sorbent (which can capture gases). This may allow using such cartridges again.

The molecules of an entrapped gases may de-absorb during storage of the cartridge. Due to the difference of concentrations inside the body of the cartridge (at the inlet concentration is greater; at the outlet for purified air concentration is lesser), these de-absorbed molecules migrate inside the cartridge to the outlet. The study of cartridges exposed to [[Bromomethane|methyl bromide]] showed that this migration can impede the re-use of storage.&lt;ref name="Maggs-1975" /&gt; The concentration of harmful substances in the purified air may exceed the PEL (even if clean air is pumped through the cartridge). To protect workers ' health, U.S. law does not allow reuse cartridges, when exposed to harmful substances, which are able to migrate (even if the cartridge has much non-saturated sorbent after the first use). According to the standards, "volatile" substances (able to migrate) are considered substances with a [[boiling point]] below 65&amp;nbsp;°C. But studies have shown that at the boiling point above 65&amp;nbsp;°C the reuse of the cartridge may be unsafe. Therefore, the manufacturer must provide the buyer with all the information required for the safe use of cartridges. So, if the period of a continuous service life of the cartridge (calculated by the program - see above) exceeds 8 hours (tables 4 and 5), the legislation may limit their use to one shift.

The paper &lt;ref name="Wood-2011" /&gt; provides a procedure for calculating the concentration of harmful substances in the purified air at the start of the re-use of cartridges (which allows one to determine exactly where they may be safely reused). But these scientific results are not yet reflected in any standards or guidelines on the use of respirators. The author of the article, working in the US, did not even try to consider the use of gas cartridges for the third time (or more). On the website of the author, one can download for free a computer program that allows one to calculate the concentration of harmful substances immediately after the start of re-use of the cartridge (which allows one to determine if this is safe).&lt;ref name="GerryWood-IBUR" /&gt;
== Regeneration gas cartridges ==
Molecules of harmful gases adsorbed by activated carbon, do not form strong bonds with them and can de-absorb. Some harmful gases react with the sorbent and form strong bonds. Special technologies have been developed for the recovery of used cartridges. They created conditions that have stimulated de-sorption caught earlier harmful substances. This used [[steam]] or heated air in the 1930s &lt;ref name="Торопов-1938" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Торопов-1940" /&gt; or other methods.&lt;ref name="Руфф-1936" /&gt; Processing of the sorbent was carried out after its removal from the body of the cartridge, or without removing.

Specialists tried to use as the absorber [[ion-exchange resin]] in 1967. The authors proposed to regenerate the sorbent by washing it in a solution of [[alkali]] or soda.&lt;ref name="БТП-1967" /&gt;

The study&lt;ref name="Maggs-1975" /&gt; also showed that cartridges can be effectively regenerated after exposure to methyl bromide (when they are blowing with hot air 100÷110&amp;nbsp;°C, flow rate 20 l/min, duration about 60 minutes).

The regeneration of sorbents used consistently and systematically in the [[chemical industry]], as it allows one to save money on the replacement of the sorbent, and as the regeneration of industrial gas cleaning devices can be carried out thoroughly and in an organized manner. But in the mass use of gas masks by different people in different conditions it is impossible to control the accuracy and correctness such regeneration of respirators’ cartridges. Therefore, despite the technical feasibility and commercial benefits, regeneration of respirators’ cartridges is not carried out.

== The legal requirements for the timely replacement of respirator’s cartridges ==

Since it is not always possible to replace cartridges in a timely manner through the [[#WarningP|use of their odor ets]],{{clarify|reason="ets" seems to be a misspelled word, possibly from poor translation. What was meant? From which side of the cartridge does one smell the odor in question?|date=May 2016}} [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] has banned the use of this method. The employer is obliged to use only two ways to replace cartridges:&lt;ref name="29CFR1910-134" /&gt; on schedule, and by using ESLI (because only these methods provide reliable preservation of workers’ health). Instructions to inspectors (OSHA) provides specific guidance on inspection of implementation of such requirements.&lt;ref name="CPL" /&gt; On the other hand, the state requires manufacturers to provide the consumer with all the necessary information about cartridges, that allows one to make a schedule for replacing them timely. Similar requirements exist in the standard on occupational safety, governing the selection and application of RPD in EU.&lt;ref name="EN-529" /&gt; In England a tutorial on the selection and use of respirators recommends obtain information from the manufacturer, and replace the cartridges on a schedule, or use ESLI, and prohibits reuse cartridges after exposure of volatile substances that can migrate.&lt;ref name="HSE-2013" /&gt;
* The US law required the employer to use exceptionally supplied air RPD (SAR) for protection against harmful gases, that have no warning properties.&lt;ref name="29CFR1910-134" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Учебник по применению" /&gt; The use of supplied air respirators may be the only way to reliably protect workers in circumstances when there is no ESLI, and it is impossible to calculate the service life.
* Legislation in the EU&lt;ref name="BS4275" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DIN" /&gt; allows an employer to use of only an supplied air respirators when employee works in conditions where air pollution is [[IDLH]] (because of the risk of not timely replacement of cartridges).

'''[[Costa Rica]]''' made its '''[[Paralympic Games]]''' début at the [[1992 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Barcelona]], sending just two representatives to compete in men's [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Paralympics|track and field]]. Absent in 1996, it returned in 2000, and has participated in every edition of the [[Summer Paralympics]] since then. Its delegations have always been small: a single athlete in track and field in 2000; a single swimmer in 2004; two table tennis players in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=CRC&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Costa Rica at the Paralympics], International Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rica has never taken part in the Winter Paralympics, and no Costa Rican has ever won a Paralympic medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=CRC&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Costa Rica at the Paralympics], International Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cuba national cricket team''' was the team that represented the [[Republic of Cuba]] in [[international cricket]]. The team was organised by the [[Cuban Cricket Commission]] (CCC), which became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) in 2002. However, the CCC had its membership revoked in 2013 for failing to adhere to ICC guidelines, so the team's current status is unclear.

Cuba was invited to participate in the 2008 edition of the [[Stanford 20/20]], and was drawn to play [[Sint Maarten national cricket team|Sint Maarten]] in its preliminary round match. However, the [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. embargo]] meant the team was forced to withdraw, as the tournament's primary organiser, [[Allen Stanford]], was an American citizen.&lt;ref&gt;(19 December 2007).

[[Image:Permian Basin Fair, Odessa, TX DSCN1289.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The Permain Basin Fair is held each year at the Ector County Coliseum.]]
It is home to the [[Odessa Jackalopes]] ([[North American Hockey League]])&lt;ref name="westex"/&gt; the [[Sand Hills Rodeo]], and the biennial [[Permian Basin International Oil Show]].&lt;ref name="poil2"/&gt;

Each January the arena hosts a major rodeo, and the animals are kept in a large hall at one end of the arena. This is the same area that, before hockey games, group picnics are served to as many as 500 people.&lt;ref name="hnight"/&gt;

==History==
The Coliseum was built in 1954 and was previously the home of the original [[Odessa Jackalopes (1997–2011)|Odessa Jackalopes]] team. The Coliseum was the oldest arena still being used for CHL games until the [[Fort Wayne Komets]] and their facility, the [[Allen County War Memorial Coliseum]], entered the league in 2010. It was home to the [[Odessa Roughnecks|West Texas Roughnecks]] ([[Indoor Football League]]) from 2004 until the team folded in 2012.

'''Ek Park''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Kitwe]], [[Zambia]].  The first recorded match on the ground came in 1957 when Northern Rhodesia played the touring [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]].&lt;ref name="OTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/92/1811_misc.html|title=Other matches played on Ek Park, Kitwe|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground later held its first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match in 1962 when [[Rhodesia cricket team|Rhodesia]] played a touring [[International XI cricket team in Rhodesia in 1961-62#Rhodesian cricket|International XI]], resulting in a drawn match.  The second first-class match held on the ground came later in 1962 when Rhodesia played the touring [[Commonwealth XI cricket team|Commonwealth XI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/92/1811_f.html|title=First-Class Matches played on Ek Park, Kitwe|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the match again ending in a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25806.html|title=Rhodesia v Commonwealth XI, 1962/63|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, what is today Zambia was administered as part of [[Northern Rhodesia]].  These two matches mark the only time first-class cricket has been played anywhere in what is today Zambia.

Following independence the ground has been used by the [[Zambia national cricket team]], who played [[county cricket|county]] opponents in the form of [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]], [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] and [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] at the ground in the 1970s, though the matches held no official status.&lt;ref name="OTH"/&gt;  Today, the ground is used by Nkana Cricket Club.

The '''Federation of International Cricketers’ Associations''' ('''FICA''') is an organisation that co-ordinates the activities of all the national players’ associations that represent  professional [[cricket]]ers. Founded in 1998, FICA serves as the voice of the players within international cricket as it has a representative on the [[International Cricket Council]]'s Cricketing "Playing" Committee, although its relationship with the ICC has not always been harmonious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/241902.html Cricinfo: ICC accused of "deliberate attempt to dilute player representation".] Retrieved 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The stated objectives of FICA are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepca.co.uk/fica.html The PCA: FICA.] Retrieved 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

*To promote the establishment of professional cricketers’ associations in countries where none currently exist.
*To develop communication between these associations across the world, encouraging contact between them so that they speak with one voice on matters affecting cricket.
*To ensure that individual associations are recognised by their domestic governing bodies and the ICC.
*Through their local governing bodies, cricketers should have an input to all decisions affecting the professional game.
*To protect the commercial interests of members of FICA.
*To assist individual associations to raise finance to ensure the development of projects which benefit their members, present and past.

The '''Ferenc Puskás Stadium''' ({{lang-hu|Puskás Ferenc Stadion}}), or formerly '''People's Stadium''' (''Népstadion'') was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in the [[Zugló|14th district]] (Zugló) of [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. It was situated between the [[Puskás Ferenc Stadion (Budapest Metro)|Puskás Ferenc Stadion]] and the [[Keleti pályaudvar (Budapest Metro)|Keleti pályaudvar]] metro stations. It was used mainly for [[association football|football]] matches. The stadium, which was an all-seater, had a capacity of 38,652, though its original capacity exceeded 100,000. The stadium was closed in 2016 and demolished in 2017 to give place to the [[Ferenc Puskás Stadium (2019)|new Ferenc Puskás Stadium]].

==History==
[[File:Népstadion bejárat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The entrance of the stadium]]
[[File:Népstadion makettje.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The plan of the stadium]]

The first plan of a national stadium were drafted as early as 1896 when there were chances that Budapest would host the first modern [[Olympic Games]].

In 1911 Budapest was one of the frontrunners to host the [[1920 Olympics]].  However, after [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in [[World War I]], the Games were awarded to [[Antwerp]] instead.

The location of the first plan included [[Budapest XI. kerülete|Budapest XI. district]] and [[Budapest X. kerülete|Budapest X. district]].

In 1924 the government imposed a sport tax which was supposed to be use for the construction of a new national stadium, but finally this money was not used for the construction.

The stadium was built between 1948 and 1953 using a large number of volunteers, including soldiers. It opened in 1953 as ''Népstadion''' ("People's Stadium").  Less than one year later, on 23 May 1954, the [[England national football team#Post-war|English football team]] suffered its worst ever defeat here (7–1).

On 14 August 2002 [[Zalaegerszegi TE]] moved their [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifying match first leg from their home ground to this stadium in order to host [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in order to accommodate a 40,000 crowd. They were rewarded with Zalaegerszeg scoring their most famous European victory, winning 1–0 with [[Béla Koplárovics]] becoming the hero with a 92nd-minute winner. Zalaegerszegi lost the return leg at [[Old Trafford]] 0–5 and went out of the competition 1–5 on aggregate.

In 2002, the stadium was renamed in honour of [[Ferenc Puskás]], widely regarded as the best striker in the world in his time and Hungary's greatest footballer ever, who was the star of the national team during its glory years of the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{hu}} [http://www.nemzetisport.hu/migralt_cikkek/20061130/a_puskas_ferenc-stadion/ A Puskás Ferenc-stadion]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Just Dance 2017''''' is a [[dance video game]] developed and published by [[Ubisoft]]. It was unveiled on June 13, 2016, during its [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dornbush|first1=Jonathon|title=E3 2016: Just Dance 2017 Announced, Coming to Nintendo NX|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/13/e3-2016-just-dance-2017-announced|website=IGN.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; press conference, and was released on October 25, 2016  for [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[Wii]], and [[Wii U]]. Ubisoft also announced that the game would be, for the first time, released on [[personal computer|PC]] via Uplay and [[Steam (software)|Steam]], as well as [[Nintendo Switch]].

== Gameplay ==
As in previous installments, players must mimic the routine of an on-screen dancer to a chosen song, scoring points based on their accuracy. For input, the game supports either the respective [[motion controller]] system for a particular console platform, or a [[smartphone]] with the game's companion [[mobile app]].&lt;ref name="wp-2017e3"&gt;{{cite web|title='Just Dance 2017' (ALL) Announced, Partial Track List Revealed - Screens|url=http://worthplaying.com/event/E3_2016/E3_2016_June_14/99769/|website=Worth Playing|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new "''Just Dance'' Machine" mode was added on current-generation console and PC versions, in which players must dance through sequences of different styles to help recharge an alien spaceship.&lt;ref name="wp-2017e3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just Dance 2017 is the first Western game to be announced for NX|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-13-just-dance-2017-is-the-first-western-game-to-be-announced-for-nx|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hg-review" /&gt;

Ubisoft confirmed that the Dance Quests, Sweat (workout and playlist modes), ''Just Dance'' TV, and World Dance Floor features would be retained on ''2017'', as well as the ''Just Dance Unlimited'' subscription service for versions of the game on current-generation consoles and PC, with additional content and playlist features.&lt;ref name="wp-2017e3"/&gt; The game's companion app was also updated to become "a hub for players' activities", with photo editing features and ''Just Dance'' TV content alongside the app's main purpose as a motion controller.&lt;ref name="wp-2017e3"/&gt;

Ubisoft discontinued online services for the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360 versions of the game on November 19, 2018.&lt;ref name="ubi-forum"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ubisoft Support Staff |title=Online Services Update Masterlist |url=https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1241617-Online-Services-Update-Masterlist-Forums |website=Ubisoft Forums |publisher=[[Ubisoft]] |accessdate=13 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113015025/https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1241617-Online-Services-Update-Masterlist-Forums |archivedate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Note:''' The Alternate routines available via Just Dance Unlimited are tie-ins with various franchises, with "Chiwawa" being a tie-in with [[Barbie]] for the movie ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie: Video Game Hero]]'' and "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" being a tie-in with ''[[The Emoji Movie]]'', which features the [[Just Dance Now]] app in a scene.

== Reception ==
Steve Hannley of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' thought that although Ubisoft had defied his prediction that ''Just Dance Unlimited'' would be the future of the franchise instead of physical releases, they had put a larger effort into the on-disc content of ''2017'' than ''2016'' (which he described as being a "last minute afterthought" to introduce ''Unlimited''). The ''Just Dance'' Machine mode was considered to be "pointless" due to being a basic concept driven by its presentation, but is "a concept that's never been done before in rhythm games and an example of the innovation the series needs to warrant another physical release". Hannley also praised the higher quality of the game's soundtrack, including more recent hit music, fewer [[novelty song|"joke" songs]], and surfacing Gigi Rowe's "impressive" debut single "Run the Night". In conclusion, Hannley continued to assert that Ubisoft should focus more on providing more immediate access to recent music rather than requiring players to wait for the next annual physical release, but that ''Just Dance 2017'' was "thankfully a marked improvement over its predecessor."&lt;ref name="hg-review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Just Dance 2017|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/11/01/review-just-dance-2017/233369/|website=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* * During the course of a 5000m race on 17 November 2013 in Salt Lake City, Russian skater [[Denis Yuskov]] recorded a 3000m split time at 3:36.40. Yuskov also recorded a 3000m time of 3:34.37 during a training race held on 2 November 2013. However, neither of these times count as the world record: in the first case because it was a split time, not an official 3000m race; and in the second case because it was ridden in a so-called 'quartet-start' (four riders on the track at the same time as opposed to the usual two) which means the time is ineligible to be counted as a world record under Article 221(2)(i) of the rules of the [[International Skating Union]].
* ** The average speed for the team pursuit race was calculated using a distance of 3098,88 meters for the men's race.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[:nl:Ploegenachtervolging (schaatsen)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The skaters only utilize the inner lane and the lap distance is accordingly less than the 400 meters of a regular lap skated with one inner curve and one outer curve. For comparison, the fastest known 400m lap was skated by [[Pavel Kulizhnikov]] on 20 November 2015 in Salt Lake City during his 500 meter world record race, with a lap time of 24.31 seconds and an average speed of {{convert|59.23|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Fastest400mLap&gt;[http://evertstenlund.se/fly.htm Best known Flying Laps as of 18-02-14]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This page reference is on the unofficial website of a guy called Evert Stenlund so I've a feeling it won't be allowed!--&gt;

* ** The average speed for the team pursuit race was calculated using a distance of 2324,16 meters for the women's race.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The skaters only utilize the inner lane and the lap distance is accordingly less than the 400 meters of a regular lap skated with one inner curve and one outer curve. For comparison, the fastest known 400m lap was skated by [[Zhang Hong (speed skater)|Zhang Hong]] during a 500m race in [[Salt Lake City]] on 20 November 2015, with a lap time of 25.93 seconds and an average speed of {{convert|55.51|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Fastest400mLap/&gt;
* *** unofficial world best (not recognized as a world record by ISU)

==Sea-level world bests==
Salt Lake City and Calgary, where all of the current world records were set (see above), are at comparatively high altitudes (greater than 1&amp;nbsp;km above sea level). Performance is better at these high altitudes because the lower oxygen levels are compensated by the reduced air resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidescience.org/content/why-speed-skaters-perform-better-higher-elevation/1560|title=Why Speed Skaters Perform Better At Higher Elevation|publisher=American Institute of Physics|work=Inside Science|date=10 February 2014|first=Chris|last=Gorski}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skating statisticians therefore record separate lists of "sea-level world bests" for speed skating records that are set at (or close to) sea level, where results in Salt Lake City and Calgary are excluded.

The '''Mermaid Stakes''' was an American [[Thoroughbred horse race]] run annually at [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]] in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]]. An important event for three-year-old fillies, the race was run on dirt over a distance of one mile and one furlong until 1910 when it was set at one mile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1900s/drf1909070701/drf1909070701_1_8  |title=The Mermaid Stakes Today |publisher=Daily Racing Form at University of Kentucky Archives |date=1909-07-07 |accessdate=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First run in 1880, there was no race from 1895 through 1901. During the twenty-four years the race was held, it was won by eight [[Eclipse Award|Champions]] of which four would be elected to the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]]. The final running in 1910 was won by [[Lilly A.

On June 11, 1908, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] controlled [[New York Legislature]] under [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] passed the [[Hart-Agnew Law|Hart-Agnew]] anti-betting legislation with penalties allowing for [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and up to a year in [[prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1900s/drf1908011801/drf1908011801_1_7 |title=Penalties in the New York Bills |publisher=Daily Racing Form at University of Kentucky Archives |date=1908-01-18|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners of Sheepshead Bay Race Track, and other racing facilities in New York State, struggled to stay in business without betting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1908/09/01/archives/keep-up-betting-ban-strict-enforcement-of-the-law-at-sheepshead-bay.html  |title=Keep Up Betting Ban |publisher=New York Times |date=1908-09-01 |accessdate=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racetrack operators had no choice but to drastically reduce the [[Purse distribution|purse money]] being paid out which by 1909 saw the Mermaid Stakes offering a purse that was as little as one-third of what it had been in earlier years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1910s/drf1910071601/drf1910071601_1_7 |title=Striking Falling off in Value of Ten Greatest Stakes |publisher=Daily Racing Form at University of Kentucky Archives |date= 1910-07-16 |accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further restrictive legislation was passed by the New York Legislature in 1910 which deepened the financial crisis for track operators and led to a complete shut down of racing across the state during 1911 and 1912. When a Court ruling saw racing return in 1913 it was too late for the Sheepshead Bay horse racing facility and it never reopened.

Sin worked as a [[lathe]] operator.&lt;ref name="Comment"&gt;{{cite journal|title=.|journal=Comment: Communist fortnightly review|publisher=Central Books|location=London|volume=2|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was separated from her father in 1950 during the [[Korean War]].

Excluding 1965, Sin was ranked in the top 10 in the world from 1959 to 1967 at 400 m,&lt;ref name="tfrank400"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/rankings/women/03-w400Rank.pdf|title=World Rankings — Women’s 400|publisher=Track and Field News|pages=1–2|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1960 to 1967 in 800m.&lt;ref name="tfrank800"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/rankings/women/04-w800Rank.pdf#page=2|title=World Rankings — Women’s 800|publisher=Track and Field News|year=2011|page=2|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1960, she surpassed the 400 metres world record with an unratified time of 53.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GZ5jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u80FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=sin-kim-dan&amp;pg=3162%2C4680044|author=[[Associated Press]]|title=Reds claim record|date=25 October 1960|work=[[Palm Beach Post]]|page=15|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won the 400 m at the [[Brothers Znamensky Memorial]] meeting in [[Luzhniki Stadium|Lenin Stadium, Moscow]], in 1961, 62, and 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=93YhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T4kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=sin-kim-dan&amp;pg=621%2C531867|title=American, Frenchmen star in Moscow meet|date=1 July 1963|author=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[Schenectady Gazette]]|page=17|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Pyongyang]] in 1962, she ran 400 m in 51.9 s, becoming the first woman to break the 53-second barrier and 52-second barrier.&lt;ref name="iaaf400landmarks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=4680.html|title=400 m Women Landmarks|publisher=IAAF|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of her eight claimed world record marks, this would be the only one ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=12th IAAF World Championships In Athletics: IAAF Statistics Handbook.

Sin represented North Korea at the [[GANEFO]] (Games of the New Emerging Forces) in 1963 and 1966, winning gold in the 200 m, 400 m, and 800 m at both games.&lt;ref name="genefo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/gang.htm|title=GANEFO Games|work=gbrathletics.com|publisher=Athletics Weekly|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her 1963 times of 51.4 (400 m) and 1:59.1 (800 m) bettered the world records, the latter the first woman under 2 minutes.&lt;ref name="iaaf800landmarks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=9385.html|title=800 m - Women Landmarks|publisher=IAAF|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were never ratified by the [[IAAF]], however, as GANEFO was not an approved competition.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/onthisday/sport/story/332.html|title=November 12 down the years|work=On This Day|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sin's personal bests were set in 1964 in [[Pyongyang]], at 51.2 for 400 m and 1:58.0 for 800 m.&lt;ref name="bioiaaf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt; The IAAF suspended GANEFO competitors, effectively barring Sin from the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="recorder"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uGRkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QnwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=sin-kim-dan&amp;pg=5727%2C4921177|title=Korean speedster out due to Games ban|author=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=3 October 1964|work=[[The Calgary Herald]]|page=14|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin was reunited with her father at [[Haneda Airport]] for a few minutes before being turned back from Japan.&lt;ref name="recorder"/&gt;  [[Ann Packer]] won [[Athletics at the 1964 Summer Olympics – Women's 800 metres|the Olympic 800 m]] in a new official world record of 2.01.1.&lt;ref name="guardianPacker"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/may/04/ann-packer-tokyo-olympics|title=No 27: Ann Packer wins 800m in 1964 |last=Nakrani|first=Sachin|date=4 May 2012|work=50 stunning Olympic moments|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=5 May 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] stated in an article on the introduction of [[gender verification in sports]]:&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836386,00.html|title=Track &amp; Field: Preserving la Difference|date=16 September 1966|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=5 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612003903/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836386,00.html |archivedate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Finally there was Sin Kim Dan, a delicate little North Korean lass who broke the women's records at both 400 meters and 800 meters two years ago; some time later, an overjoyed elderly gentleman in South Korea recognized Sin as the son he had lost in the war.
This claim has been repeated since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2782/switch-hitter|title=If a man has a sex change, can he compete in the Olympics as a woman?|publisher=[[The Straight Dope]]|accessdate=2009-08-19|date=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SchafferSmith2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=Kay|last2=Smith|first2=Sidonie|title=The Olympics at the Millennium: Power, Politics, and the Games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMzYdZpk8qMC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=5 May 2012|date=2000-08-01|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813528205|page=146|chapter=One Chromosome Too Many?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sin was one of the first awarded the title "People's Athlete" after its creation in 1966 by the [[Supreme People's Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yŏnhap Tʻongsin|first=|title=North Korea Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIlh9nNeadMC&amp;pg=PA495|accessdate=5 May 2012|year=2003|publisher=M.E.

The '''Great Australian Camel Race''' was an Australian event held in 1988. 

This event was the work of the Australian millionaire [[Arthur Earle]], who wanted to recognise the positive impact that [[camel]]s had on the development of Australia, and highlight the importance these animals had in the exploration and transport needs in the central Australian deserts.

It is said to have been the longest animal endurance race ever held.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

The event was {{convert|3,236|km|mi|abbr=on}} long spanning from the centre of Australia, starting at [[Ayers Rock]], to the East Coast of Australia ending on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. The race was broken down into six legs each with check points in between. The event was run like a car rally, where each competitor was timed on how long it took to complete a leg. Each leg as detailed in the Australasian geographical magazine ''Geo'' Volume 11 number 3 as below.

* Leg 1: Ayers Rock to [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Spring]] (Northern Territory 410&amp;nbsp;km)
* Leg 2: Alice Springs to [[Boulia, Queensland|Boulia]] (Northern Territory to Queensland 761&amp;nbsp;km)
* Leg 3: Boulia to [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]] (Queensland app. 604&amp;nbsp;km)
* Leg 4: Longreach to [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]] (Queensland app. 530&amp;nbsp;km)
* Leg 5: Charleville to [[Warwick, Queensland]] (Queensland app. 1242&amp;nbsp;km)
* Leg 6: Warwick to Gold Coast (Queensland app. 140&amp;nbsp;km)

For three months competitors battled disease, floods and competitor rivalry, as the mix of people in the event varied greatly. Australia's elite SASR ([[Special Air Service Regiment]] which came second overall) along with the a team from the 2/4 Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, competitors from the [[United States]], Australia's leading camel handlers and ex-[[marathon]] runners entered the event totaling 69 competitors.

A total of 28 competitors completed the event with details of finishing times for first second and third place as below.&lt;ref&gt;Sheratons Great Australian Camel Race Final Results&lt;/ref&gt;
#Gordon O'Connell 480 Hrs
#SASR 514 Hrs
#Steve French 542 Hrs

Calculating these times into a 24‑hour period, then gaining an average of distance traveled daily equates to Gordon O'Connell taking 20 days in total time to complete, covering 168&amp;nbsp;km every 24 hours as the average. (This includes meals, sleeping and animal feeding)

Gordon O'Connell won The Great Australian Camel race by approximately 34 hours ahead of his nearest competitor. In addition to this the distance he won by had been reached by the second leg of the race. Gordon won the first four of the six legs, even when he was hospitalised with kidney failure from Shiguella on the second leg going into Boulia.

The army was the team organising the legs and were there for the safety of all competitors along with competing themselves. In addition to this they were the best equipped for the event with hundreds of support personnel and vehicles. The clear leaders throughout the race were the SASR and Gordon O'Connell.

==Other social context==
It featured in the four-hour documentary produced by [[Orana Films]] and photographed in the Australasian geographical magazine ''[[Geo (magazine)|Geo]]'' Volume 11 number 3 page 97. 

The race was to also inject more celebration into [[Australia's Bicentennial]] year whilst raising funds for the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]].

==Notes==
&lt;references/&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;After the event Gordon went to retire the camel for her efforts when a dispute broke out over ownership of Carla. Because she had won one of the longest race events in history, the original person Gordon was involved with before the race, made claim to her and wanted to use her name to start his camel business. After close to six years Gordon was awarded ownership of the camel and she resides with him to this day in retirement.&lt;/small&gt;

==Plot==
César Faz ([[Clifton Collins, Jr.]]), moves to Monterrey, Mexico, after he is let go by the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] from his job as a clubhouse attendant. There he meets local children being led by [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Padre]] Esteban ([[Cheech Marin]]), enjoying [[baseball]]; he takes [[pitcher]] Ángel Macías ([[Jake T. Austin]]), under his wing and brags about his own pitching skills and how he used to coach the Cardinals. Ángel convinces César to help recruit and coach Monterrey's first-ever [[Little League Baseball|Little League]] team. With César's skills and Padre Esteban's support, the boys hone themselves into a competitive team worthy of international competition. At the final game of the World Series of Little League, Monterrey defeated the team of West [[La Mesa, California]], 4–0. Enrique Suárez ([[Jansen Panettiere]]), hit a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] [[home run]], and Ángel Macías pitched a [[perfect game]], a feat that has not since been repeated in [[Little League World Series]] history.

When the team arrives in the United States, they are met with [[racism]], a language barrier, and [[Visa (document)|visa]] troubles. Though the underdogs, the team scores a series of victories that endear them to the media, and new fans. They befriend a sports reporter, Frankie ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), and the groundskeeper, [[Cool Papa Bell]] ([[Louis Gossett Jr.]]), who then assist the boys in reaching the final game.

==Background==

{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=August 2012}}

The film is based on a true story about a group of [[boy]]s from [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]], who became the first non-U.S. team to win the [[Little League World Series]] in [[1957 Little League World Series|1957]]. Their team was [[Mexico in the Little League World Series#1957 Liga Peque.C3.B1a Industrial|Industriales de Monterrey]], nicknamed "Los pequeños gigantes" (The little giants). Before traveling to the United States, the Little League team of the Industriales de Monterrey Baseball Club, played two seasons on the local 4 team Little League circuit before qualifying, as the second Little League team coming from outside of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; they participated in the  [[South Region (Little League World Series)#South Region Champions .281957.E2.80.932000.29|southern area regional tournaments]], which qualified them for the [[Little League World Series]], held every August in [[South Williamsport, Pennsylvania|South Williamsport]], [[Pennsylvania]].

The Industriales won all qualifying tournaments, to many rather unexpectedly, and advanced to the Little League World Series as the first Mexican team. There, they made it to the finals and defeated the highly favored team from [[La Mesa, California]] by a score of 4-0. The pitcher from Monterrey, [[Angel Macías]], threw the first and only [[perfect game]] in championship history.&lt;ref name="NL1"&gt;

 |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Industriales de Monterrey little league team was so dominant that year, that they were able to repeat their success in the following year in the [[1958 Little League World Series]].

The film scenes in [[Monterrey]], which is the leading industrial center, one of the largest Mexican cities for over 100 years and a major center for science and research in Mexico, depicted the city as a two-burro village where the children played ball in the dirt choked streets with pigs and chickens serving as bases. The border between Mexico and [[Texas]] was portrayed as an out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere border crossing along a dirt road, instead of a bridge border-crossing over the [[Rio Grande]]. The digital work to recreate the separate looks for the United States and Monterrey in 1957 was done by Post Logic Studios.&lt;ref&gt;

==Reception==
&lt;!-- Please note, when updating Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and Movie Tab ratings, you should also update the "accessdate" field within the citation tags to reflect the date on which you have updated them. --&gt;The film has received mixed reviews. Patrick Goldstein of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said he felt that "the film did a nice job of telling the story of the surprise upset when a youth ball team from Monterrey, Mexico, won the 1957 Little League World Series." He also commented that, "although the story seems like a fable, it reflected true events." He further expressed concern over Lionsgate's suspending the original release date.&lt;ref name="LAT1"/&gt;  Ben Apatoff of MLB.com felt that the film was a strong family movie that appeals to baseball history buffs or any person who could relate to a child in love with the game.&lt;ref name="MLB1"/&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] wrote: "You sort of know how these underdog sports movies turn out. Doesn't matter. ''The Perfect Game'' so expertly uses the charisma and personalities of the actors, especially the young ones, that it's thrilling anyway."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Robert. suntimes.com, "[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100414/REVIEWS/100419988/1023 The Perfect Game]". Accessed 26 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' said, "[From] the second minute of the movie I knew every single thing that was going to happen and there was not a single surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080923184315/http%3A//bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/index.html |archivedate=2008-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote, "The movie feels fraudulent, whether it's sticking to the historical record or going its own way with the customary composites and revisions and fabrications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sc-mov-0413-quarter-perfect-game-20100415-7,0,4789716.column | work=Chicago Tribune | title='Perfect Game': Real-life baseball fable turns into an easy out | first=Michael | last=Phillips | date=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ranking website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 54% of critics have given ''The Perfect Game'' positive reviews, based upon a sample of 39.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1197992-perfect_game/ |title=The Perfect Game - Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=2010-04-27 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vanderbilt Stadium''' is a [[American football|football]] stadium located in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Completed in 1922 (then named '''Dudley Field''') as the first stadium in the [[American South|South]] to be used exclusively for college football, it is the home of the [[Vanderbilt University]] football team.&lt;ref name="vucommodores"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vanderbilt Stadium|url=http://vucommodores.cstv.com/facilities/vand-stadium.html|publisher=Vanderbilt Athletics|accessdate=September 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanderbilt Stadium hosted the [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee Oilers]] (now Titans) during the [[1998 NFL season]] and the first [[Music City Bowl]] in [[1998 Music City Bowl|1998]] and also hosted the Tennessee state high school football championships for many years.

Vanderbilt Stadium is the smallest football stadium in the [[Southeastern Conference]], and was the largest stadium in Nashville until the completion of the Titans' [[Nissan Stadium]] in 1999.

==History==

===Old Dudley Field===
Vanderbilt football began in 1892, and for 30 years, Commodore football teams played on the northeast corner of campus where Wilson Hall, Kissam [[quadrangle (architecture)|Quadrangle]], and a portion of the Vanderbilt University Law School now stand, adjacent to today's 21st Avenue South.&lt;ref&gt;See ''VUcommodores.com'', "History of Vanderbilt Stadium", ¶ 7. Online at http://vucommodores.cstv.com/facilities/vand-stadium.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first facility was named for [[William Lofland Dudley|William Dudley]], [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Vanderbilt University Medical School]] from 1885 until his death in 1914. Dudley was responsible for the formation of the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], the predecessor of the [[Southern Conference]] and [[Southeastern Conference]], in 1895, and was also instrumental in the formation of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="vucommodores"/&gt;

In 1922, after a 74.2 winning percentage during the 18-year tenure of Coach McGugin, the Commodores had outgrown old Dudley Field.&lt;ref name="vucommodores"/&gt;  The old field was re-christened '''Curry Field''', in honor of [[Irby Curry|Irby "Rabbit" Curry]], a standout football player from 1914–16, who left Vanderbilt to serve in the [[American Expeditionary Force]] to Europe in World War I and was killed while flying a combat mission over France in 1918.  The football team played two games on the renamed Curry Field before moving to New Dudley Field in 1922.

===New Dudley Field===
There was not enough room to expand old Dudley Field at its site near Kirkland Hall, so Vanderbilt administrators purchased land adjacent to what is today 25th Avenue South, on the west side of campus, for the new facility.&lt;ref name="vucommodores"/&gt;  The new stadium, the first in the South built solely for football, was christened "Dudley Field", and its capacity was 20,000.  As evidence of Vanderbilt's stature in the sport at the time, it dwarfed rival Tennessee's Shields-Watkins Field (now [[Neyland Stadium]]), which had opened a year earlier and seated only 3,200.

[[File:Dudley22.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dudley Field in 1922.]]
The first game played at Dudley Field was between the home-standing Commodores and the powerful [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]]. A goal-line stand by the Commodores preserved a 0-0 tie.&lt;ref name="vucommodores" /&gt; The following Friday, nearby [[Hume-Fogg High School]] played a game at Dudley. Senior [[Jimmy Armistead]] returned the opening kick for a touchdown, providing the first touchdown ever recorded in the stadium. Armistead would go on to a successful career at Vanderbilt and was the captain and starting [[quarterback]] for the [[1928 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|1928 team]].

In 1949, Vanderbilt officials built a modern press box at Dudley Field, replacing a platform that had been used prior to that.&lt;ref name="vucommodores.cstv.com"&gt;See "Key Dates in the History of Vanderbilt Stadium", VUcommodores.com. Online at http://vucommodores.cstv.com/facilities/vand-renovation-history-timeline.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional seating was also added to the western side of stadium, boosting capacity to 27,901.&lt;ref name="vucommodores.cstv.com"/&gt;

On September 25, 1954, Vanderbilt hosted the No. 10-ranked [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor Bears]] in the first night game ever played on the Dudley Field surface. The lights had been installed so that Dudley Field would be able to host the [[Billy Graham]] [[Billy Graham Crusade|Crusade]] on campus.&lt;ref name="vucommodores.cstv.com"/&gt;

In 1960, nearly 7,000 more seats are added to the stadium, with an expansion on the east side of the stadium near Memorial Gym.  Capacity jumped to 34,000.&lt;ref name="vucommodores.cstv.com"/&gt;

At a price of $250,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250000|1970}}}} today), officials installed what was then a state-of-the-art Astroturf synthetic surface in 1970.&lt;ref name="vucommodores.cstv.com"/&gt;

===Vanderbilt Stadium===

====Battleship gray====
Over the winter and spring of 1980&amp;ndash;81, most of the Dudley Field grandstand was demolished. The 12,088 seats on each sideline—the only vestige of the old stadium—were raised ten feet through the use of 22 hydraulic jacks on each side of the stadium. The "new" venue was rechristened Vanderbilt Stadium.  However, the playing surface itself is still called Dudley Field.

The rebuilt stadium and its Fred Russell Press Box (named for Vanderbilt alumnus, former football player, and sports journalist [[Fred Russell]]) were designed to resemble a United States naval vessel slicing through the water&amp;mdash;a nod to Vanderbilt's naval themed-mascot, the Commodore. Accordingly, the color scheme picked for the exterior of the stadium was battleship gray.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The stadium's maximum capacity after the 1980&amp;ndash;81 renovation was 41,000, consisting of a single-decked horseshoe grandstand filled in with wooden bleachers from the 1960 expansion. The project cost $10.1 million, and the Commodores celebrated a sold-out dedication by taking a 23&amp;ndash;17 comeback win over [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]] on September 12, 1981.

To enhance the gameday experience, officials increased capacity to 41,448 and added a [[Jumbotron]] video screen in the north end zone, adjacent to Kensington Place, in advance of the [[History of the Tennessee Titans#Tennessee Oilers era (1997–98)|Tennessee Oilers]] playing their 1998 home games in the facility.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

After the Oilers&amp;mdash;now the Titans&amp;mdash;left in 1999, the playing surface was returned to grass. In 2002 and 2003, the school removed the aging bleachers from the 1960 renovation from the north end zone, lowering capacity to 41,221 in 2002 and to 39,773 in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The bleachers from the north end zone were replaced with a visitors' concourse that affords any fan in the stadium a field-level, up-close experience with the playing surface. The metal frames for the bleachers were relocated to Mt. Juliet Christian School's football facility in suburban Nashville.

====Brick-and-iron====
After nearby [[Hawkins Field]], Vanderbilt's baseball stadium, was constructed in a classic brick-and-iron style in 2002, Vanderbilt administrators began to look at giving Vanderbilt Stadium a similar flavor. They also began to consider the construction of a football facility in place of the present concourse and JumboTron in the north end zone.&lt;ref name="vucommodores.cstv"&gt;See "Facilities Upgrade Central", VUcommodores.com.  Online at http://vucommodores.cstv.com/facilities/vand-renovation.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2007, Vanderbilt officials announced they were in the preliminary stages of a stadium renovation plan, with financing, design concept, and date of completion yet to be determined.&lt;ref name="vucommodores.cstv" /&gt;

Nine months later, on May 20, 2008, Vice Chancellor David Williams II announced, in a McGugin Center press conference, that the University was beginning a five-phased, multimillion-dollar program of renovations to Vanderbilt athletics facilities, including extensive renovations and additions to Vanderbilt Stadium.&lt;ref name="vucommodores.cstv" /&gt;

Under the plan announced by Williams, Vanderbilt Stadium was modified (in the first four phases) as follows:

On February 6, 2012, Williams announced Vanderbilt would be adding new [[FieldTurf]] and a new [[JumboTron]]. A large berm was constructed in the open end of Vanderbilt Stadium as a place for fans to watch games starting fall 2012. The project, in addition to other renovations, began after the Black &amp; Gold scrimmage on April 14, 2012.

With only 500 seats are available, the hillside is a first-come, first-served area in terms of picking a spot to sit. The berm does not reach the permanent seating on the sidelines to leave space in the corners of the end zone for fans to enter.

The fourth major project set for the stadium was improved lighting. Renovations were also completed at McGugin Center, with new meeting rooms and Olympic sport locker rooms built. The work was completed in the summer of 2014.

Since the 2007 season, midshipmen of the Vanderbilt [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps|Naval ROTC]] sound a foghorn, nicknamed "The Admiral", whenever the Commodores take the field, as well as after every score and win.  It is also sounded at intervals prior to the scheduled kickoff to encourage fans to go ahead and enter the stadium. After wins the Commodores raise a victory flag sporting the "Star V" emblem.

== Other team use ==
On September 15, 2018, while Vanderbilt was away playing [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], the [[Virginia Cavaliers]] played the [[Ohio Bobcats]] in Vanderbilt Stadium. The game was relocated from [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] due to the threat of [[Hurricane Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.roanoke.com/sports/uva/uva-football-cavaliers-run-over-ohio---in-relocated/article_4039224e-fe93-5489-97ca-b26242fab723.html|title=UVa football: Cavaliers run over Ohio 45-31 in relocated football game|last=981-3129|first=Doug Doughty doug.doughty@roanoke.com|work=Roanoke Times|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFL use==
Upon moving to Nashville, the Oilers/Titans franchise initially played at the larger [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] while [[Nissan Stadium]] (then called Adelphia Coliseum) was under construction in Nashville. Initially, the Oilers were unwilling to play at Vanderbilt Stadium while Nissan Stadium was being built. Not only was it thought to be too small even for temporary use, but university officials were unwilling to allow the sale of alcohol.

However, dismal attendance during the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]], due in part to both the unwillingness of many Nashville fans to make the trip to Memphis and Memphis fans' indifference to NFL football in general after years of failing to secure their own NFL franchise, led the Oilers to play their last season under that name in Nashville at Vanderbilt Stadium, although the university forbade the franchise from selling alcohol at home games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Teresa M. |title=Oilers to play at Vanderbilt |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E0weAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K8cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1315%2C599894 |accessdate=2016-02-15 |work=[[Times Daily]] |agency=Associated Press|date=1998-03-04 |location=Florence, Ala. |page=6D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanderbilt Stadium thus became the smallest home venue in the NFL since several similar-size stadiums were used in [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. (The merger agreement with the [[American Football League]] led the NFL to declare stadiums seating fewer than 50,000, such as [[Fenway Park]], to be inadequate for league play and after the 1970 NFL season none were used for NFL games on a long-term basis.) The [[Los Angeles Chargers]] are using a smaller venue, the 27,000-seat [[StubHub Center]] in [[Carson, California]], as their home for the 2018-19 and 2019-20 NFL seasons while a new stadium in the Los Angeles area is being built for the Chargers and [[Los Angeles Rams]], who are currently playing in the far larger [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], with opening scheduled in 2020.

==Non-sporting events==
Over its history, Vanderbilt Stadium has occasionally been used for concerts and major speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vucommodores.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/070111aab.html|title=JFK, The Stones...U2|publisher=Vanderbilt Athletics|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Videotron Centre''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Centre Vidéotron'') is an [[indoor arena]] in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The 18,259-seat arena replaced [[Colisée Pepsi]] as Quebec City's primary venue for indoor events. The new arena is primarily used for [[ice hockey]], serving as the home arena of the [[Quebec Remparts]] of the [[QMJHL]] and has been prospected as a venue for a [[Potential National Hockey League expansion#Quebec City|new or re-located]] [[National Hockey League]] team in Quebec City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quebecor Joins Arena Plan, Eyes NHL Team|first=Karine|last=Gagnon|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/hockey/2011/03/01/17451741.html|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Quebec Gravy Train Chugs Off Without Ottawa on Board for Once |first=Kelly |last=McParland |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/03/02/the-quebec-gravy-chain-chugs-off-without-ottawa-on-board-for-once/ |newspaper=[[National Post]] |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=April 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110311212859/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/03/02/the-quebec-gravy-chain-chugs-off-without-ottawa-on-board-for-once/ |archivedate=March 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of a [[Winter Olympic Games]] bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quebec City Plans $400 Million Arena to Attract NHL Team, Winter Olympics|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=4564924|work=[[ESPN]]|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quebecor Buys Management, Naming Rights to Proposed Quebec City Arena|first=Marianne|last=White|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Quebecor+invest+Quebec+City+arena+project/4366388/story.html|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=April 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303090738/http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Quebecor+invest+Quebec+City+arena+project/4366388/story.html|archivedate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quebec Ready for Nordiques Return|first=Stephen|last=Brunt|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2012/02/08/nhl_quebec_nordiques_brunt/|work=[[Sportsnet]]|date=February 8, 2012|accessdate=April 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412034240/http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2012/02/08/nhl_quebec_nordiques_brunt|archivedate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building opened on September 8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-citys-new-arena-opens-its-doors-to-public |title=Quebec City's new arena opens its doors to public |date=September 12, 2015 |work=[[Montreal Gazette]] |first=Caroline |last=Plante}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the [[List of ice hockey arenas by capacity|seventh-largest indoor arena in Canada]].

A groundbreaking ceremony for the new arena was held on September 3, 2012, attended by then-Quebecor Chairman [[Pierre Karl Péladeau]], then-Premier of Quebec [[Jean Charest]], and former [[Quebec Nordiques]] players [[Michel Goulet]], [[Peter Stastny]] and [[Alain Côté (ice hockey b. 1957)|Alain Côté]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former Hockey Greats Attend Quebec City Arena Groundbreaking|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/former-hockey-greats-attend-quebec-city-arena-groundbreaking-1.1283538|work=[[CBC News]]|date=September 3, 2012|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arena construction began on September 10, 2012.

The arena was expected to cost $400 million, but cost $370 million instead with the city and province covering the entirety of the cost of the arena; 50% of the cost each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quebec Officials Name Who Will Pay the Bill for Their New NHL-Friendly $400M Arena: Taxpayers |first=James |last=O'Brien |url=http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2011/02/10/quebec-officials-name-who-will-pay-the-bill-for-their-new-nhl-friendly-400m-arena-taxpayers/ |work=[[NBC Sports]] |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=April 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720043756/http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2011/02/10/quebec-officials-name-who-will-pay-the-bill-for-their-new-nhl-friendly-400m-arena-taxpayers/ |archivedate=July 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 2011 [[Quebecor]] entered into an agreement to acquire management rights to the new arena, a deal expected to be between $33 million and $63 million up front, plus between $3.15 million and $5 million in annual rent. The value of the deal will increase if an NHL franchise moves into the arena; Quebecor has actively backed an [[Potential National Hockey League expansion#Quebec City|expansion franchise for Quebec City]].&lt;ref name=tsn325/&gt;&lt;ref name="tvasports-gazette"&gt;{{cite web|last=Magder|first=Jason|title=New TVA Sports channel takes a shot at RDS|url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=2cbb638a-16e2-4a4c-af53-92775a09989f|publisher=The Montreal Gazette|accessdate=27 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115249/http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=2cbb638a-16e2-4a4c-af53-92775a09989f|archive-date=26 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement was made without public tender, for which the provincial government provided legal immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quebec City Arena Immune to Legal Challenge as Controversial Bill Becomes Law|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-city-arena-immune-to-legal-challenge-as-controversial-bill-becomes-law-1.700660|work=[[CFCF-DT|CTV Montreal]]|publisher=[[Bell Media]]|date=September 21, 2011|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the management contract, Quebecor also holds the arena's [[naming rights]]; on April 7, 2015, it was announced that the arena would carry the name of Quebecor-owned cable company [[Vidéotron]], and be known as the ''Videotron Centre'' (Centre Vidéotron in French).&lt;ref name=gandm-vtcentre&gt;{{cite news|title=Quebecor naming Quebec City hockey arena Videotron Centre|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/quebecor-naming-quebec-city-hockey-arena-videotron-centre/article23826452/|accessdate=13 May 2015|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena held its official opening on September 3, running public two-hour tours for the following three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/videotron-centre-opens-its-doors-in-quebec-city-1.3214542 |title=Videotron Centre opens its doors in Quebec City |work=[[CBC News]] |date=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, Videotron Centre broke the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] attendance record by attracting 18,259 spectators to a match between the [[Quebec City Remparts]] and the [[Rimouski Oceanic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2218046/quebec-city-inaugurates-hockey-arena-with-record-breaking-crowd/ |title=Quebec City inaugurates hockey arena with record-breaking crowd |publisher=[[Global News]] |date=September 13, 2015 |first=Jacques |last=Boissinot |agency=[[The Canadian Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after playing the last-ever event of its predecessor, [[Colisée Pepsi]], [[Metallica]] played the first-ever concert at Videotron Centre on September 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/metallica-historic-shows-quebec-city/|title=Metallica To Play Historic September Shows in Quebec City|website=Loudwire|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/metallica-will-close-the-colisee-pepsi-and-then-open-centre-videotron|title=Metallica will close the Colisée Pepsi and then rock at Centre Vidéotron|date=2015-06-25|work=Montreal Gazette|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

[[File:Les remparts de Quebec vs Les Cataractes de Shawinigan on Centre Videotron 01.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the arena during a pre-season ice hockey game between the [[Quebec Remparts]] and the [[Shawinigan Cataractes]]]]

The arena is comparable in size to [[PPG Paints Arena]], the home arena of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], and occupies approximately 64,000 square metres of space, down from the originally proposed 70,000 square metres. The design is also similar to [[Rogers Place]], the home arena of the [[Edmonton Oilers]].&lt;ref name=tsn325/&gt; A television studio, valued at between C$30 million and C$40 million, is constructed within the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Quebec City Arena Gets the Green Light|first=Marianne|last=White|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Quebec+City+arena+gets+green+light/6356842/story.html|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]|date=March 25, 2012|accessdate=April 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428164243/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Quebec+City+arena+gets+green+light/6356842/story.html|archivedate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for the American magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', [[Populous (company)|Populous]] architect and lead project designer Kurt Amundsen said that the arena was "absolutely a hockey-first design with the intention of them securing an NHL team in the near future."&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nhl/2015/06/12/quebec-city-new-centre-videotron-arena-designed-with-nhl-in-mind |title=Quebec City’s stunning new arena designed with NHL team in mind |first=Tim |last=Newcomb |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |date=June 12, 2015 |accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen added that the design was specific to Canadian hockey preferences:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a steeper and more intimate bowl than you see in the U.S. In Canada they are more about the game than the surrounding events and experiences. They were very adamant they wanted it as steep and tight as it could possibly get. . . . You feel like you are on top of the ice. It is about going into the arena and sitting in a seat and not getting up until the game is over.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The angle of the upper seating bowl is so steep that rails had to be installed at every row to satisfy local building code requirements.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

Three medals are awarded: [[gold medal|gold for first place]], [[silver medal|silver for second place]], and [[bronze medal|bronze for third place]]. [[Tie (draw)|Tie breakers]] have not been used in every year. In the event of a tie between two gymnasts, both names are listed, and the following position (second for a tie for first, third for a tie for second) is left empty because a medal was not awarded for that position. If three gymnastics tied for a position, the following two positions are left empty.

The '''Štark Arena''' (originally known as '''Belgrade Arena''') is a multi-purpose [[indoor arena]] located in [[Belgrade]], Serbia. It is designed as a universal hall for sports, cultural events and other programs. The venue is used for several different sports events, such as [[basketball]], [[concerts]], [[futsal]], [[handball]], [[judo]], [[table tennis]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]] and [[water polo]].

Its total floor area stands at 48,000 square meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=44326|title=Страница није пронађена.|website=Град Београд - Званична интернет презентација - Страница није пронађена.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sports, it has a seating [[Seating capacity|capacity]] of up to 18,386 seats, of which 860 seats are grouped in 70 luxury boxes.&lt;ref&gt;https://starkarena.co.rs/o-%D1%88/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Štark Arena is a member of the [[European Arenas Association]] (EAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanarenas.com/index.php|title=Official Website of European Arenas Association|publisher=[[European Arenas Association|EAA]]|accessdate=2016-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307094728/http://www.europeanarenas.com/index.php|archive-date=2016-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and influence==
The Belgrade Arena is situated in New Belgrade. Arena's parking is limited in spaces, though nearby residential areas provide enough room for vehicles.

It's a 10 min walk from [[Novi Beograd railway station]], which offers international train services from [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]], domestic train services (fast and regional trains) to and from [[Novi Sad railway station|Novi Sad]], [[Subotica railway station|Subotica]] and [[Šid railway station|Šid]] and urban rail services [[BG Voz]].

It takes a 15-minute drive from [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]] to the arena. Ride from downtown Belgrade would take the same amount of time, unless in rush-hour, when it could take up to 30 minutes to get to central [[Novi Beograd]], where the arena is located.

The construction of the arena has caused a substantial increase in prices for apartments in the surrounding area, which are mostly new. A new modern business district is scheduled to be constructed across the Belgrade Arena. Hotel IN was the first new hotel to be built near the arena however the venue is also within walking distance from [[Hyatt Regency Belgrade]] and [[Crowne Plaza Belgrade]].

==Name==
During its construction, the provisory name of the arena was "Hala Limes". Yet, when the construction of the arena was finished in 2004, it was given the official name ''Beogradska Arena'' (Belgrade Arena). In February 2007, Serbian basketball coach [[Božidar Maljković]] started an initiative to name the Arena after another renowned Serbian basketball coach, [[Aleksandar Nikolić]]. Maljković presented his initiative to the city officials and the president of Serbia [[Boris Tadić]], but the name change hasn't been accepted.&lt;ref name="„Areni" dati ime „Profesor Aleksandar Nikolić""&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/sport/145364/Profesor-Aleksandar-Nikolic-je-zasluzio-da-Arena-nosi-ime-po|title=Profesor Aleksandar Nikolić je zaslužio da 'Arena' nosi ime po|date=17 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in 2016, another Belgrade sports hall, ''Pionir Hall'' was renamed ''[[Hall Aleksandar Nikolić]]''.

[[File:kombank-arena.png|237px|thumb|Logo used for the arena from 2012 to 2017.]]
In June 2012, the arena officials signed a five-year agreement with [[Komercijalna banka]] to change the name to "Kombank Arena", and the name change became official in September 2012.&lt;ref name="Kombank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/new_name_for_serbias_belgrade_arena/|title=New name for Serbia’s Belgrade Arena|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During [[UEFA Futsal Euro 2016]], which has been held in February 2016, the Arena has been renamed from Kombank Arena to Belgrade Arena, for sponsorship reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/futsaleuro/season=2016/finals/venueguide/index.html |title=Belgrade Arena |publisher= [[UEFA]] |date=2015-09-25 |accessdate=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/sport.294.html:584981-%D0%A3%D0%95%D0%A4%D0%90-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0-%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%83 |title=UEFA prekrstila "Arenu"! |publisher= [[Večernje novosti]] |date=2016-01-08 |accessdate=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the arena was once again renamed, this time to Štark Arena, following the signing of a five-year sponsorship deal with [[Štark]], a food manufacturing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/124/drustvo/2902059/beogradska-arena-ce-pet-godina-nositi-naziv-stark-arena.html|title=Београдска арена ће пет година носити назив "Штарк арена"|publisher=RTS|date=12 October 2017|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Design and construction===
In 1989, The City of Belgrade was chosen to host the [[1994 FIBA World Championship|Basketball World Championship of 1994]].&lt;ref name="Diamond Ball preview"&gt;[http://www.24sec.net/article.asp?index=175 24sec.net - Basketball News - Diamond Ball preview!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019175934/http://www.24sec.net/article.asp?index=175 |date=2007-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was a condition for the city to build an all-new basketball arena. In the competition for the design of a new arena with seat capacity of at least 20,000, the winner was the design submitted by Belgrade architect Vlada Slavica from [[Energoprojekt]]&lt;ref name="planeta" /&gt;. In 1991 a location for the project was chosen – [[Blokovi|Blok 25]] in [[New Belgrade]].

The project was carried out amid significant difficulties. For starters, the construction of such a mega structure had to meet a very tight deadline, since it was only 3 years to the World Championships. A team of 126 companies was formed to be part of the arena committee, with [[Energoprojekt Visokogradnja]] and GP Napred as main contractors&lt;ref name="planeta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planeta.org.rs/10/arhitektura.htm|title=BEOGRADSKA ARENA: arhitekta VLADA SLAVICA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=309801|title=Dom za češanje}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Two architects were chosen to design the arena's roof. In 1992 construction started as the arena committee formed a partnership with American company [[Populous (company)|HOK]], experienced in building sporting venues. However, tough times were ahead. As the [[Yugoslav wars|disintegration of Yugoslavia]] started, the [[United Nations]] imposed sanctions on the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and HOK stopped all co-operation with the arena committee. Even with this setback, work on the Belgrade Arena continued.

In 1993, Belgrade suffered one of its worst economic years in modern history. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia experienced record inflation rates, and as a result of the sanctions and the conflicts in Yugoslavia, Belgrade lost the right to host the 1994 Basketball World Championships.&lt;ref name="Istorija arene"&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=13&amp;status=jedna&amp;vest=100673&amp;datum=2007-03-05 Novosti | Vecernje novosti | Sport&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the formal announcement by [[FIBA]], the arena's construction still continued for some time, though at a considerably slower pace due to the lack of material. However, sometime in 1995 the construction completely stopped.

Work on the arena re-commenced in 1998 as the city was chosen to host the [[1999 World Table Tennis Championships]] to be held in the Belgrade Arena. By this time the roof was already taking shape towards completion, part of the façade was done and the interior was half complete. Once again, Yugoslavia lost the privilege to host the competition as the city was [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|bombed by NATO forces]] the year the competition was supposed to be held. The first public event held in the Arena (which was still under construction at the time) was the final [[Slobodan Milošević]] (president of Yugoslavia at the time) [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election campaign rally]], which was held September 20, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2000&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_category=1&amp;nav_id=12114 |title=Centralna promocija liste kandidata SPS i JUL |publisher=[[B92]] |date=2000-09-20 |accessdate=2010-02-17|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last time Milošević has held a public speech.

===Completion===

After a change of government in Yugoslavia in 2000 and the lifting of all sanctions imposed on the country, the Arena, under new management, was completed in 2004 in time for the [[FIBA Diamond Ball|FIBA Diamond Ball tournament]] and Belgrade finally got the right to host [[EuroBasket 2005|The 2005 European Basketball Championship]].&lt;ref name="Belgrade to host EuroBasket 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arhiva.srbija.gov.rs/news/2002-03/09/323020.html|title=Belgrade to host EuroBasket 2005|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary licenses for public use expired in early 2006, following a series of sport events and concerts in 2005. Works on an automated fire prevention system and installation of elevators to meet European standards were completed by November 2006, while no events were held in the Arena in the meantime. The Belgrade Arena received its permanent public use license on November 4, 2006 and re-opened its doors as a result.&lt;ref name="Najskuplja kad je - prazna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=13&amp;status=jedna&amp;vest=100673&amp;datum=2007-03-04|title=Najskuplja kad je - prazna|website=www.novosti.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
[[File:Srb,Brz,Arena.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Serbia men's national volleyball team|Serbia]] - [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] [[FIVB World League 2009]] final, 22,680 spectators]]

The ''[[List of events held in Štark Arena]]'' lists both past and upcoming events.

The first event held in the Belgrade Arena was a [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] and [[Yugoslav Left]] final election campaign rally, held September 20, 2000 before the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia presidential election, 2000|2000 elections in Yugoslavia]]. The construction of the Arena wasn't finished at that time. The official opening came nearly four years later, July 31, 2004, when the ''[[FIBA Diamond Ball]]'' basketball tournament was held. Since Arena had only temporary license, only several events were held during the next two and a  half years. The first event held after getting permanent license was the [[50 Cent]] concert, on November 6, 2006.

One of the biggest events to take place in the Arena was the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]]. In the final night of the contest an audience of over 20,000 was present. Other big events held in the Arena include numerous sporting events, notably the European championships in [[basketball]] ([[EuroBasket 2005]]), [[volleyball]] ([[2005 Men's European Volleyball Championship]]), [[table tennis]] ([[Table Tennis European Championships|2007 European Table Tennis Championships]]), and [[judo]] ([[2007 European Judo Championships]]). The Belgrade Arena was also one of the 69 venues to take part in the [[2009 Summer Universiade|2009 Summer Universiade Games]], hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the [[Basketball at the 2009 Summer Universiade|basketball competition]].

Arena was the host venue for the concerts of the most significant artists of Serbia and former Yugoslavia, as well as major international stars, including [[50 Cent]], [[Anastacia]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Montserrat Caballe]], [[Nick Cave]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Steve Winwood]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Phil Collins]], [[The Cult]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Guano Apes]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Hurts]], [[Il Divo]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Jean Michel Jarre]], [[Elton John]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Massive Attack]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and [[The Pussycat Dolls]], [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Rammstein]], [[Chris Rea]], [[RBD]], [[Rihanna]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[Simple Minds]], [[Shakira]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Slayer]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Roger Waters]], [[Zaz (singer)|Zaz]], [[ZZ Top]], [[OneRepublic]] and many others.

Also, in several international competitions, the record attendance has been set at the Arena. On February 2, 2009, the [[2009 Fed Cup]] [[2009 Fed Cup World Group II|World Group II]], [[Serbia Fed Cup team|Serbia]] vs. [[Japan Fed Cup team|Japan]] [[tennis]] match set a record for an [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] event attendance with a crowd of 15,118 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Sport/Tenis/Ovacije-teniskim-junakinjama-u-Areni.lt.html |title=Ovacije teniskim junakinjama u "Areni" |publisher=Politika |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5, 2009, the first [[KK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] [[basketball]] game at Belgrade Arena was held, a [[Euroleague 2008–09|2008–09]] [[Euroleague]] [[Euroleague 2008–09#Top 16|Top 16]] match against [[A1 Ethniki|Greek]] powerhouse [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos]].
