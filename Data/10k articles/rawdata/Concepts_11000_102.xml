'''Ackermann set theory''' is a version of [[axiomatic set theory]] proposed by [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in 1956.

== The language==
Ackermann set theory is formulated in [[first-order logic]]. The language &lt;math&gt;L_A&lt;/math&gt; consists of one binary relation &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; and one constant &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (Ackermann used a predicate &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; instead). We will write &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\in(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. The intended interpretation of &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; is that the object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in the class &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The intended interpretation of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the class of all sets.

== The axioms==
The axioms of Ackermann set theory, collectively referred to as A, consists of the [[Universal quantifier|universal closure]] of the following formulas in the language &lt;math&gt;L_A&lt;/math&gt;

1) [[Axiom of extensionality]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y ( \forall z (z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y)
\rightarrow x = y).&lt;/math&gt;

2) [[Axiom of separation|Class construction axiom schema]]: Let &lt;math&gt;F(y,z_1, \dots, z_n)&lt;/math&gt; be any formula which does not contain the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; free. 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y (F(y, z_1, \dots, z_n) \rightarrow y \in V) \rightarrow \exists x \forall y (y \in x \leftrightarrow F(y,z_1, \dots, z_n) )&lt;/math&gt;

3) Reflection axiom schema: Let &lt;math&gt;F(y,z_1, \dots, z_n)&lt;/math&gt; be any formula which does not contain the constant symbol &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; or the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; free. If &lt;math&gt; z_1, \dots, z_n \in V&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y (F(y, z_1, \dots, z_n) \rightarrow y \in V) \rightarrow \exists x (x \in V \land \forall y (y \in x \leftrightarrow F(y, z_1, \dots, z_n))).&lt;/math&gt;

4) Completeness axioms for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \in y \land y \in V \rightarrow x \in V&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes called the axiom of heredity)
:&lt;math&gt;x \subseteq y \land y \in V \rightarrow x \in V.&lt;/math&gt;

5) [[Axiom of regularity|Axiom of regularity for sets]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x \in V \land \exists y ( y \in x) \rightarrow \exists y ( y \in x \land \lnot \exists z (z \in y \land z \in x)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory==
Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a [[First-order logic|first-order formula]] in the language &lt;math&gt;L_\in = \{\in\}&lt;/math&gt; (so &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; does not contain the constant &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;). Define the "restriction of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to the universe of sets" (denoted &lt;math&gt;F^V&lt;/math&gt;) to be the formula which is obtained by recursively replacing all [[sub-formulas]] of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;\forall x G(x,y_1\dots, y_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x \in V \rightarrow G(x,y_1\dots, y_n))&lt;/math&gt; and all sub-formulas of the form &lt;math&gt;\exists x G(x,y_1\dots, y_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\exists x (x \in V \land G(x,y_1\dots, y_n))&lt;/math&gt;. 

In 1959 [[Azriel Levy]] proved that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of &lt;math&gt;L_\in&lt;/math&gt; and A proves &lt;math&gt;F^V&lt;/math&gt;, then [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] proves &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;

In 1970 [[William Reinhardt (mathematician)|William Reinhardt]] proved that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of &lt;math&gt;L_\in&lt;/math&gt; and ZF proves &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then A proves &lt;math&gt;F^V&lt;/math&gt;.

== Ackermann set theory and Category theory ==
The most remarkable feature of Ackermann set theory is that, unlike [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], a [[proper class]] can be an element of another proper class (see Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel, Levy(1973), p. 153).

An extension (named ARC) of Ackermann set theory was developed by F.A. Muller(2001), who stated that ARC "founds Cantorian set-theory as well as category-theory and therefore can pass as a founding theory of the whole of mathematics".{{citation-needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Alice Stokes Paul''' (January 11, 1885 – July 9, 1977) was an American [[suffragist]], [[feminist]], and [[women's rights]] activist, and one of the main leaders and strategists of the campaign for the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits sex discrimination in the right to vote. Paul initiated, and along with [[Lucy Burns]] and others, strategized events such as the [[Woman Suffrage Procession]] and the [[Silent Sentinels]], which were part of the successful campaign that resulted in the amendment's passage in 1920.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Baker, Jean H., "[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/placards-white-house Placards At The White House]," [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']], Winter 2010, Volume 59, Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1920, Paul spent a half century as leader of the [[National Woman's Party]], which fought for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], written by Paul and [[Crystal Eastman]], to secure constitutional equality for women. She won a large degree of success with the inclusion of women as a group protected against discrimination by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Women's rights|Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

==Background==

===Early life===
Alice Paul was born on January 11, 1885, at [[Paulsdale]] in [[Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Paul|url=https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/alice-paul|website=National Women's History Museum|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Eve M. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/13/garden/group-seeks-to-buy-a-suffragist-s-home.html "Group Seeks to Buy a Suffragist's Home"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 13, 1989. Accessed July 12, 2008. "The Alice Paul Centennial Foundation plans to buy the house in Mount Laurel, but first the organization must raise $500,000 by Sept. 8.... The 2½-story, stucco-clad brick farmhouse was built in 1840 and once overlooked the Paul family's 173-acre Burlington County farm, east of Camden. Miss Paul was born in an upstairs bedroom in 1885 and lived in the house until she left for Swarthmore College in 1901."&lt;/ref&gt; She was the eldest of four children of William Mickle Paul I (1850–1902) and Tacie Paul (née Parry), and a descendant of [[William Penn]], the [[Quaker]] founder of [[Pennsylvania]]. Her siblings were Willam, Helen, and Parry. She grew up in the Quaker tradition of public service; her ancestors included participants in the [[New Jersey]] Committee of Correspondence in the Revolutionary era and a state legislative leader in the 19th century. Alice first learned about women's suffrage from her mother, a member of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA); Paul would sometimes join her mother in attending suffragist meetings.&lt;ref name=Institute&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Was Alice Paul|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909083624/http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|archivedate=September 9, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
[[File:AlicePaulHelenGardener.png|thumb|upright|290px|Alice Paul and Helen Gardener, ca. 1908–1915]]

Paul attended [[Moorestown Friends School]], where she graduated at the top of her class.&lt;ref name = Education&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/people/paul-alice-stokes/|title=Paul, Alice Stokes|work=Social Welfare History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Paul went to [[Swarthmore College]], an institution co-founded by her grandfather.  While attending Swarthmore, Paul served as a member on the Executive Board of Student Government, one experience which may have sparked her eventual excitement for political activism. Alice graduated from Swarthmore College with a bachelor's degree in biology in 1905.&lt;ref name=Institute/&gt;

Partly in order to avoid going into teaching work, Paul completed a fellowship year at a [[Settlement movement|settlement house]] in New York City after her graduation, living on the Lower East Side at the College Settlement House.  While working on settlement activities taught her about the need to right injustice in America, Alice soon decided that social work was not the way she was to achieve this goal: "I knew in a very short time I was never going to be a social worker, because I could see that social workers were not doing much good in the world... you couldn't change the situation by social work."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Paul in oral history compiled by Amelia Fry, [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6f59n89c/?brand=oac4 Online Archive of California], quoted in {{harvp|Adams|Keene|2008|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul then earned a master of arts from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1907, after completing coursework in political science, sociology and economics.&lt;ref name = Institute/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign|last=Adams|first=Katherine|last2=Keene|first2=Michael|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-252-07471-4|location=Urbana-Champaign|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued her studies at the [[Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre]] in [[Birmingham]], England, and took economics classes from the [[University of Birmingham]], while continuing to earn money doing social work. She first heard [[Christabel Pankhurst]] speak at Birmingham. When she later moved to London to study sociology and economics at the London School of Economics, she joined the militant suffrage group the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) led by Christabel and her mother, [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. She was arrested repeatedly during suffrage demonstrations and served three jail terms. After returning from England in 1910, Paul continued her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Ph.D. in sociology.  Her dissertation was entitled "The Legal Position of Women in Pennsylvania"; it discussed the history of the women's movement in Pennsylvania and the rest of the U.S., and urged woman suffrage as the key issue of the day.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{harvp|Adams|Keene|2008|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul later received her law degree (LL.B) from the [[Washington College of Law]] at [[American University]] in 1922, after the suffrage fight was over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcl.american.edu/history/alicepaul.cfm |title=Honoring Alice Paul |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Washington College of Law]] |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, she earned a [[master of laws]] degree, and in 1928, a doctorate in civil law from American University.&lt;ref name=Lakewood&gt;{{cite news|title=Alice Paul Biography. |work=Lakewood Public Library:  Women in History |url=http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/paul-ali.htm |accessdate=May 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619192543/http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/paul-ali.htm |archivedate=June 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Britain===

====Early work in British woman suffrage====
In 1907, after completing her master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania, Paul moved to England, where she eventually became deeply involved with the British women's suffrage movement, regularly participating in demonstrations and marches of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU). After a "conversion experience" seeing [[Christabel Pankhurst]] speak at the University of Birmingham, Paul became enamored with the movement. She first became involved by selling a Suffragist magazine on street corners. This was a particularly difficult task considering the animosity towards the Suffragists and opened her eyes to the abuse that women involved in the movement faced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These experiences, combined with the teachings of Professor [[Beatrice Webb]], convinced Paul that social work and charity could not bring about the needed social changes in society: this could only be accomplished through equal legal status for women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While in London, Paul also met [[Lucy Burns]], a fellow American activist who would become an important ally for the duration of the suffrage fight, first in England, then in the United States. The two women quickly gained the trust of prominent WSPU members and began organizing events and campaign offices. When [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] attempted to spread the movement to Scotland, Paul and Burns accompanied her as assistants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paul quickly gained the trust of fellow WSPU members through both her talent with visual rhetoric and her willingness to put herself in physical danger in order to increase the visibility of the suffrage movement. While at the WSPU's headquarters in Edinburgh, Paul and local suffragists made plans to protest a speech by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]]. For a week prior, they spoke with people on the streets to promote knowledge about why they were protesting against the Cabinet member. At the meeting, after Grey discussed proposed legislation he claimed would lead to prosperity, Paul stood up and exclaimed: “Well, these are very wonderful ideals, but couldn’t you extend them to women?”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Police responded by dragging her out of the meeting and through the streets to the police station where she was arrested. As planned, this act was viewed by many as a public silencing of legitimate protest and resulted in an increase of press coverage and public sympathy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later events involved even more risk of bodily harm. Before a political meeting at St. Andrew's Hall in Glasgow in August 1909, Paul camped out on the roof of the hall so that she could address the crowd below. When she was forced by police to descend, crowds cheered her effort. Later, when Paul, Burns, and fellow suffragettes attempted to enter the event, they were beaten by police as sympathetic bystanders attempted to protect them. After Paul and her fellow protesters were taken into custody, crowds gathered outside the police station demanding the women's release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fotheringham |first1=Ann |title=Thanks for the Memories: Glasgow's Votes for Women celebration at Mitchell |url=https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/16900627.thanks-for-the-memories-glasgows-votes-for-women-celebration-at-mitchell/ |website=Evening Times |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 1909, in honor of Lord Mayor's Day, the Lord Mayor of London hosted a banquet for cabinet ministers in the city's Guild Hall. Alice Paul planned the WSPU's response; she and Amelia Brown disguised themselves as cleaning women and entered into the building with the normal staff at 9:00 am. Once in the building, the women hid until the event started that evening. It was then that they came out of hiding and "took their stand." When Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith stood to speak, Brown threw her shoe through a pane of stained glass and both women yelled "Votes for women!" Following this event, both women were arrested and sentenced to one month hard labor after refusing to pay fines and damages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Civil disobedience ====
While associated with the Women's Social and Political Union, Paul was arrested seven times and imprisoned three times.&lt;ref name="Dodd"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodd|first=Lynda G.|year=2008|title=Parades, pickets, and prison: Alice Paul and the virtues of unruly constitutional citizenship|journal=Journal of Law &amp; Politics|volume=24|issue=4|pages=339–443|ssrn=2226351}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during her time in prison that Paul learned the tactics of civil disobedience from Emmeline Pankhurst. Chief among these tactics was demanding to be treated as a political prisoner upon arrest. This not only sent a message about the legitimacy of the suffragists to the public, but also had the potential to provide tangible benefits. In many European countries, including England, political prisoners were given a special status: "[T]hey were not searched upon arrest, not housed with the rest of the prisoner population, not required to wear prison garb, and not force-fed if they engaged in hunger strikes."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though arrested suffragettes often were not afforded the status of political prisoners, this form of civil disobedience provided a lot of press for the WSPU. For example, during a London arrest (after being denied political prisoner status), Paul refused to put on prisoner's clothing. After the prison matrons were unable to forcibly undress her, they requested assistance from male guards. This shockingly improper act provided extensive press coverage for the suffrage movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another popular civil disobedience tactic used by the Suffragettes was hunger striking. The first WSPU related hunger strike was conducted by sculptor [[Marion Wallace Dunlop]] in June 1909. By that fall it was being widely used by WSPU members because of its effectiveness in publicizing their mistreatment and gaining quick release from prison wardens. Refusing food worked in securing an early release for Paul during her first two arrests. However, during her third prison stint, the warden ordered twice daily force-feeding to keep Paul strong enough to finish out her month-long sentence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Though the prisons staunchly maintained that the force-feeding of prisoners was for their own benefit, Paul and other women described the process as torturous. At the end of her month in prison, Paul had developed severe [[gastritis]]. She was carried out of prison and immediately tended to by a doctor. However, after this event, her health was permanently scarred; she often developed colds and flu which would sometimes require hospitalization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alice Paul: Equality for Women|last=Lunardini|first=Christine|publisher=Westview Press|year=2012|isbn=9780813347615|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

After the ordeal of her final London imprisonment, Paul returned to the United States in January 1910 to continue her recovery and to develop a plan for suffrage work back home.&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt; Paul's experiences in England were well-publicized, and the American news media quickly began following her actions upon her return home. She drew upon the teachings of Woodbrooke and her religion and quickly decided that she wanted to embrace a single goal as a testimony. The single goal she chose was the recognition of women as equal citizens.

Paul re-enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing her Ph.D., while speaking about her experiences in the British suffrage movement to Quaker audiences and starting to work towards United States suffrage on the local level.  After completing her dissertation, a comprehensive overview of the history of the legal status of United States women, she began participating in [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) rallies, and in April 1910 was asked to speak at NAWSA's annual convention. After this major opportunity, Paul and Burns proposed to NAWSA leadership a campaign to gain a federal amendment guaranteeing the vote for women. This was wholly contrary to NAWSA's state-by-state strategy. Paul and Burns were laughed at by NAWSA leadership; the only exception was [[Jane Addams]], who suggested that the women tone down their plan. As a response, Paul asked to be placed on the organization's Congressional Committee.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession ====
[[File:Inez Milholland 1913 two.jpg|thumb|290px|[[Inez Milholland]] leading the [[Woman Suffrage Procession]] on horseback.]]
One of Paul's first big projects was initiating and organizing the 1913 [[Woman Suffrage Procession]] in Washington the day before President Wilson's inauguration. Paul was determined to put pressure on Wilson, because the President would have the most influence over Congress. She assigned volunteers to contact suffragists around the nation and recruit supporters to march in the parade. In a matter of weeks, Paul succeeded in gathering roughly eight-thousand marchers, representing most of the country. However, she had much more trouble gaining institutional support for the protest parade. Paul was insistent that the parade route go along Pennsylvania Avenue before President Wilson. The goal was to send the message that the push for women's suffrage existed before Wilson and would outlast him if need be. This route was originally resisted by DC officials, and according to biographer Christine Lunardini, Paul was the only one who truly believed the parade would take place on that route. Eventually the city ceded the route to NAWSA. However, this was not the end of the parade's troubles. The City Supervisor Sylvester claimed that the women would not be safe marching along the Pennsylvania Avenue route and strongly suggested the group move the parade. Paul responded by demanding Sylvester provide more police; something that was not done. On March 13, 1913 the parade gained a boost in legitimacy as Congress passed a special resolution ordering Sylvester to prohibit all ordinary traffic along the parade route and "prevent any interference" with the suffrage marchers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Official program - Woman suffrage procession March 3, 1913 - crop.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to the program for the 1913 [[Woman Suffrage Procession]] which Alice Paul organized]]
On the day of the event, the procession proceeded along Paul's desired route. The event, which was led by notable labor lawyer [[Inez Milholland]] dressed in white and riding a horse was described by the New York Times as "one of the most impressively beautiful spectacles ever staged in this country."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Multiple bands, banners, squadrons, chariots, and floats were also displayed in the parade representing all women's lives. One of the most notable sights was the lead banner in the parade which declared, "We Demand an Amendment to the United States Constitution Enfranchising the Women of the Country.&lt;ref name="Dodd" /&gt; "Over half a million people came to view the parade and with insufficient police protection, the situation soon devolved into a near-riot, with onlookers pressing so close to the women that they were unable to proceed. Police largely did nothing to protect the women from rioters. A senator who participated in the march later testified that he personally took the badge numbers of 22 officers who had stood idle, including 2 sergeants. Eventually, the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania national guards stepped in and students from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland Agricultural College]] provided a human barrier to help the women pass. Some accounts even describe Boy Scouts as stepping in and providing first aid to the injured. The incident mobilized public dialogue about the police response to the women's demonstration, producing greater awareness and sympathy for NAWSA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodd" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the parade, the NAWSA's focus was lobbying for a [[constitutional amendment]] to secure the right to vote for women. Such an amendment had originally been sought by suffragists [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] who, as leaders of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association|NWSA]], fought for a federal amendment to the constitution securing women's suffrage until the 1890 formation of NAWSA, which campaigned for the vote on a state-by-state basis.

==== National Woman's Party====

Paul's militant methods started to create tension between her and the leaders of NAWSA, who thought she was moving too aggressively in Washington. Eventually, disagreements about strategy and tactics led to a break with NAWSA. Paul formed the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage and, later, the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP) in 1916.{{sfnp|Zahniser|Fry|2014|pp=178–231}}

The NWP began introducing some of the methods used by the suffrage movement in Britain and focused entirely on achieving a constitutional amendment for woman suffrage.&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt; [[Alva Belmont]], a multi-millionaire socialite at the time, was the largest donor to Paul's efforts. The NWP was accompanied by press coverage and the publication of the weekly newspaper, ''[[The Suffragist]].''&lt;ref name=Lakewood/&gt;

====Silent Sentinels====

In the [[United States presidential election, 1916|US presidential election]] of 1916, Paul and the NWP campaigned in western states where women could already vote against the continuing refusal of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and other incumbent [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] to actively support the Suffrage Amendment. In January 1917, the NWP staged the first political protest and [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] at the [[White House]]. The pickets, participating in a [[nonviolent]] [[civil disobedience]] campaign known as the "[[Silent Sentinels]]," held banners demanding the right to vote.

After the United States entered [[World War I]] in April 1917, many people viewed the picketing Silent Sentinels as disloyal. In June 1917, picketers were arrested on charges of "obstructing traffic." Over the next six months, many, including Alice, were convicted and incarcerated at the [[Occoquan Workhouse]] in Virginia (which later became the Lorton Correctional Complex) and the [[District of Columbia]] Jail.&lt;ref name=Lakewood/&gt;

When the public heard the news of the first arrests some were surprised that leading suffragists and very well-connected women were going to prison for peacefully protesting. President Wilson received bad publicity from this event, and was livid with the position he was forced into. He quickly pardoned the first women arrested on July 19, two days after they had been sentenced, but reporting on the arrests and abuses continued. The ''Boston Journal'', for example, stated, "The little band representing the NWP has been abused and bruised by government clerks, soldiers and sailors until its efforts to attract the President's attention has sunk into the conscience of the whole nation."&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt;

Suffragists continued picketing outside the White House after the Wilson pardon, and throughout World War I. Their banners contained such slogans as "Mr. President, How Long Must Women Wait For Liberty?".&lt;ref name = Night&gt;{{cite web|first=Louise|last=Bernikow|date=October 30, 2004|url=http://womensenews.org/story/our-story/041029/night-terror-leads-womens-vote-1917#.U073a1xbtuY|title=Night of Terror Leads to Women's Vote in 1917|website=Women's eNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the suffragists protested peacefully, their protests were sometimes violently opposed.  While protesting, young men would harass and beat the women, with the police never intervening on behalf of the protesters.  Police would even arrest other men who tried to help the women who were getting beaten.  Even though they were protesting during wartime, they maintained public support by agitating peacefully. Throughout this time, more protesters were arrested and sent to Occoquan or the District Jail. Pardons were no longer offered.&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt;

===Prison, hunger strikes, passage of 19th Amendment===
[[File:Alice Paul cph.3a38295.jpg|thumb|Alice Paul in 1918]]
[[File:Alice paul.jpg|thumb|right|Alice Paul toasting (with grape juice) passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. August 26, 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|title=Who Was Alice Paul?|website=Alice Paul Institute|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In solidarity with other activists in her organization, Paul purposefully strove to receive the seven-month jail sentence that started on October 20, 1917. She began serving her time in the District Jail.{{sfnp|Zahniser|Fry|2014|pp=279–281}}

Whether sent to Occoquan or the District Jail, the women were given no special treatment as political prisoners and had to live in harsh conditions with poor sanitation, infested food, and dreadful facilities.&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt; In protest of the conditions at the District Jail, Paul began a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/11/07/102646016.pdf "Miss Alice Paul on Hunger Strike"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 7, 1917. Accessed June 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to her being moved to the prison's psychiatric ward and being [[Force-feeding|force-fed]] raw eggs through a feeding tube. "Seems almost unthinkable now, doesn't it?" Paul told an interviewer from [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']] when asked about the forced feeding. "It was shocking that a government of men could look with such extreme contempt on a movement that was asking nothing except such a simple little thing as the right to vote."&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Robert S., "[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/%E2%80%9Ci-was-arrested-course%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D I Was Arrested, Of Course…]", [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']], February 1974, Volume 25, Issue 2. Interview of Alice Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 1917, the suffragists who were imprisoned at Occoquan endured brutality which became known as the "[[Night of Terror (event)|Night of Terror]]". The National Woman's Party (NWP) went to court to protest the treatment of the women in Occoquan Prison. The women were later moved to the District Jail where Paul languished. Despite the [[Police brutality in the United States|brutality]] that she experienced and witnessed, Paul remained undaunted, and on November 27 and 28 all the suffragists were released from prison.{{sfnp|Zahniser|Fry|2014|pp=178–231}}

===Equal Rights Amendment===
Once suffrage was achieved in 1920 Paul and her party shifted attention to constitutional guarantees of equality through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]],&lt;ref name=Lakewood /&gt; which was written by Paul and [[Crystal Eastman]]. The larger rival the [[League of Women Voters]] (LWV) opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. The LWV also supported workplace legislation for women, whereas the NWP thought that workplace legislation restricted women's natural ability to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Decades of Discontent: The Women's Movement, 1920–1940|last = Scharf|first = Lois|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 1983|isbn = 0313226946|location = Westport|pages = 223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964 Civil Rights Act===
{{main article|Civil Rights Act of 1964#Women's rights}}

Paul played a major role in adding protection for women in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, despite the opposition of liberals who feared it would end protective labor laws for women.  The prohibition on sex discrimination was added to the Civil Rights Act by [[Howard W. Smith]], a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133.  For twenty years Smith had sponsored the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the House because he believed in equal rights for women, even though he opposed equal rights for blacks.  For decades he had been close to the National Woman's Party and especially to Paul.  She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/titlevii.htm |first1=Jo |last1=Freeman |title=How 'Sex' Got into Title VII: Persistent Opportunism as a Maker of Public Policy |journal=Law and Inequality |volume=9 |issue=2 |date=March 1991 |pages=163–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==

Paul had an active social life until she moved to Washington in late 1912. She enjoyed close relationships with women and befriended and occasionally dated men. Paul did not preserve private correspondence for the most part, so few details about her personal life are available. Once Paul devoted herself to winning the vote for women, she placed the suffrage effort first in her life. Nevertheless, Elsie Hill and Dora Kelly Lewis, two women whom she met early in her work for NAWSA, remained close to her all their lives. She knew William Parker, a scholar she met at the University of Pennsylvania, for several years; he may have tendered a marriage proposal in 1917. A more thorough discussion of Paul's familial relations and friendships is found in J.D. Zahniser's biography.{{sfnp|Zahniser|Fry|2014}}

Paul died at the age of 92 on July 9, 1977, at the Greenleaf Extension Home, a Quaker facility in [[Moorestown, New Jersey]], less than a mile from her birthplace and childhood home at [[Paulsdale]].&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; She is buried at Westfield Friends Burial Ground, [[Cinnaminson, New Jersey]], U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

==Legacy==
[[File:Alice Paul-unc-obv.jpg|thumb|Alice Paul was honored in 2012 on a $10 U.S. gold coin]]
In 1979 Paul was inducted, posthumously, into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/alice-paul/|title=Alice Paul|work=National Women's Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her alma mater, [[Swarthmore College]], named a dormitory Alice Paul Residence Hall in her honor. [[Montclair State University]] in New Jersey has also named a dormitory (Alice Paul Hall) in her honor.

Two countries have honored her by issuing a postage stamp: Great Britain in 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amazingwomenrock.com/alice-paul-suffragettepolitical-activist|title=Alice Paul (Suffragette/Political Activist)|last=Macaulay|first=Susan|website=amazingwomenrock.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States in 1995. The U.S. stamp was the $0.78  [[Great Americans series]] stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arago.si.edu/category_2043117.html|title=78-Cent Paul|last=|first=|date=6 July 1995|website=Arago: People, Postage &amp; The Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, a group of New Jersey women raised the money to purchase Alice Paul's papers when they came up for auction, so that an archive could be established. Her papers and memorabilia are now held by the [[Schlesinger Library]] in Boston and the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington D.C. In 1990, the same group, now the Alice Paul Institute, purchased the brick farmhouse, [[Paulsdale]], in Mount Laurel, New Jersey where Paul was born. Paulsdale is a National Historic Landmark, and is on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places.  The Alice Paul Institute keeps her legacy alive with their mission to promote gender equality.&lt;ref name = Institute/&gt;

[[Hilary Swank]] played Paul in the 2004 movie ''[[Iron Jawed Angels]]'', which portrayed the 1910 women's suffrage movement for passage of the 19th Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://suffrageandthemedia.org/source/iron-jawed-angels-film-suffrage-activists/|title=Iron Jawed Angels, a Film About Suffragist Alice Paul - Women's Suffrage and the Media|work=Women's Suffrage and the Media|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, she was posthumously inducted into the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/03/alice_paul_inducted_into_nj_ha.html|title=Alice Paul inducted into NJ hall of fame alongside historic nemesis Woodrow Wilson|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul appeared on a United States half-ounce $10 gold coin in 2012, as part of the First Spouse Gold Coin Series. A provision in the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program]]&lt;ref&gt;see {{USStatute|109|145|119|2664|2005|12|22}})&lt;/ref&gt; directs that Presidential spouses be honored. As President [[Chester A. Arthur]] was a widower, Paul is shown representing "Arthur's era".&lt;ref name="Alice Paul USC"&gt;Alice Paul is explicitly specified in {{uscsub|31|5112|o|3|D|i|II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of her papers are held in the [[Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America]], at Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. The archives of the Alice Paul Institute include papers and items from Paul's family history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library/collection/alice-paul|title=Alice Paul|date=2016-04-12|work=Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2016, President Barack Obama designated Sewall-Belmont House as the [[Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument]], named for Alice Paul and [[Alva Belmont]].&lt;ref name=hirschfeldnew&gt;{{cite news|last=Hirschfeld|first=Julie|title=House With Long Activist History Is Now Monument to Equality|work=The New York Times|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=April 13, 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/us/politics/obama-womens-equality-national-monument.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eilperinnew&gt;{{cite news|last=Eilperin|first=Juliet|title=A new memorial to tell 'the story of a century of courageous activism by American women'|work=The Washington Post|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=April 12, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/11/obama-to-designate-a-national-monument-in-d-c-to-honor-womens-equality-tuesday/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20160413_White_House_honors_Alice_Paul_s_Washington_headquarters.html|first=Jan|last=Hefler|title=White House honors Alice Paul's Washington headquarters|date=April 14, 2016|work=Philly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] announced in 2016 that an image of Alice Paul will appear on the back of a newly designed $10 bill along with [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and the [[1913 Woman Suffrage Procession]] that Paul initiated and organized. Designs for the new $5, $10, and $20 bills will be unveiled in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of American women winning the right to vote via the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0436.aspx |title= Treasury Secretary Lew Announces Front of New $20 to Feature Harriet Tubman, Lays Out Plans for New $20, $10 and $5 |date=April 20, 2016| publisher=Dept. of the Treasury |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Alice Paul was a central character in an episode of ''[[Timeless (TV series)|Timeless]]'' (Season 2, Episode 7&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Aarniokoski|first=Douglas|title=Mrs. Sherlock Holmes|date=2018-04-29|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6885540/|others=Abigail Spencer, Matt Lanter, Malcolm Barrett|accessdate=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which alludes to Paul giving an impassioned speech to President Woodrow Wilson during a march that ends in police violence upon the suffragist marchers. According to history, Paul was at the event, and was arrested, but there is no evidence that she spoke to Wilson on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/elementary-lesson-womens-suffrage-timeless-season-2-episode-7-recapped-180968915/|title=An Elementary Lesson in Women's Suffrage: 'Timeless' Season 2, Episode 7, Recapped|last=Kaufman|first=Rachel|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as "[[video game art]]".

==Overview==
A definition of the art game was first proposed by Professor [[Tiffany Holmes]] ([[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]]) in her 2003 paper for the [[Digital Arts and Culture|Melbourne DAC]] Conference, "Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre". Holmes defined the art game as "an interactive work, usually humorous, by a visual artist that does one or more of the following: challenges cultural stereotypes, offers meaningful social or historical critique, or tells a story in a novel manner." The paper stated that an art game must contain at least two of the following: "[1] a defined way to win or experience success in a mental challenge, [2] passage through a series of levels (that may or may not be hierarchical), [3] a central character or icon that represents the player."&lt;ref name=holmes2003/&gt; This definition was narrowed by Rebecca Cannon in an October 2003 paper where she highlighted the competitive, goal-oriented nature of the genre in defining art games as "compris[ing] an entire, (to some degree) playable game... Art games are always interactive&amp;mdash;and that interactivity is based on the needs of competing [...] Art games explore the game ''format'' primarily as a new mode for structuring narrative, cultural critique."&lt;!--emphasis in original--&gt;&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;&lt;ref name=bittanti&gt;Bittanti, Matteo. ''[http://mbf.blogs.com/files/gameart_eng-2.pdf Game Art]''. Mattscape. Retrieved 1 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 article, Colombian video game theorist Carlos Díaz placed importance on the "reflection experience" as an integral aspect of the art game.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Art Video Games: Ritual Communication of Feelings in the Digital Era|last = Díaz|first = Carlos Mauricio Castaño|date = 2015|journal = Games and Culture|doi = 10.1177/1555412014557543|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience can pertain to a variety of cultural avenues, but it transcends the medium and its structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Within the topic of the art game, further subdivisions have been proposed. In her 2003 paper, Holmes identified two common art game types as the "feminist art game" (an art game that generates thinking about gender and typecasting), and the "retro-styled art game" (an art game that juxtaposes low-[[Image resolution|resolution]] graphics with academic or theoretical content, and that creatively subverts the format of an arcade classic to support a conceptual creative agenda).&lt;ref name=holmes2003/&gt; In 2005, art theorist Pippa Tshabalala née Stalker broadly defined the art game as "a video game, normally PC as opposed to console based, that generally but not exclusively explores social or political issues through the medium of video games." She proposed two different categorical schemes to further subdivide the genre by theme and by type. Subdividing by theme, Stalker defined "aesthetic art games" to include "games that deal with using the game medium to express an artistic purpose," and she defined "political" or "agenda-based art games" as art games that "have some sort of ulterior motive other than aesthetics" and whose basis is in "using the medium of the computer games to bring an issue to the public's, or at least the art world's, attention in order to attract support and understanding for a cause."&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; Subdividing by type, Stalker identified the "[[art mod]]", the "physical manifestation art game" (the player is involved physically in the game, often experiencing physical consequences, such as pain, for their actions), "[[machinima]]", and "3D real-time [art] game" (an art game that displays all the characteristics of a complete level-based commercial game, both on the programming and commercial side).&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; The identification of art mods and machinima as forms of the art game conflicts with Cannon's definition of the art mod that highlights the non-interactive and non-competitive nature of these forms of media.

Distinctions are drawn in describing the art game as a genre compared to traditional video game genres (such as the [[Platform game|platformer]] or [[first-person shooter]]). Rather than describing the game on a surface level, descriptions focus on the ''artistic [[Intention|intent]],'' as well as the execution and implementation of the gameplay. For instance, Bethesda's 2008 release ''[[Fallout 3]]'' is considered to be a [[role-playing game]] with first-person shooter elements, but it could also be considered to have elements consistent with art games&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Games as Art and Kant's Moral Dilemma: What can Ethical Theory Reveal about the Role of the Game Designer as Artist?|last = Devine|first = Theresa Claire|date = 2014|journal = Games and Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;it implements moral player choices for the sole purpose of provoking emotion or thought in the player.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are several recent instances of video games that similarly involve the characteristics of art games, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]] ''and ''[[Undertale]].'' Games like these aren't necessarily created or marketed under the classification of "art game", but are still created for artistic purposes that transcend their respective structures. The potentials and limitations of the medium are increasingly discovered as the video game industry develops, therefore resulting in the recent popularity of art game elements. If nothing else, the genre can be seen as a means to push the medium to its conceptual limit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since the development of these early definitions, art theorists have emphasized the role of ''artistic intent''&amp;thinsp;&lt;ref name="stalker" /&gt; (of [[author]] ''or'' [[curator]])&lt;ref name="ploug"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artificial.dk/articles/artgamesintro.htm |title=Art Games - An Introduction |author=Ploug, Kristine|publisher=Artificial.dk |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further definitions have emerged from both the art world and the video game world that draw a clear distinction between the "art game" and its predecessor, "[[video game art]]".&lt;ref name="sharp"&gt;Sharp, John. ''A Curiously Short History of Game Art''. [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. Proceedings of the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games. Pp.26-32. 29 May - 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of the matter lies an intersection between [[art]] and the [[video game]]. Easily confused with its often non-interactive sibling art form video game art, and the concept of [[video games as an art form]] (irrespective of artistic intent), the essential position that art games take in relation to video games is analogous with the position that [[art film]] takes in relation to [[film]].&lt;ref name="stalker" /&gt; [[ACM SIGGRAPH]] opened an online exhibit "The Aesthetics of Gameplay" in March 2014, featuring 45 independently developed games selected via a nomination process, where the mechanics of gameplay are, in part, tied to the visuals and audio of the game. Greg Garvey, the curator of this exhibit, compared this to the concept of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' where the work attempts to encompass other art forms, though as Garvey comments, the "merger of interaction with the aesthetics" drives these games beyond this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gameartshow.siggraph.org/gas/curators-statement/ | title = The Aesthetics of Gameplay - Curator's Statement|  first = Greg | last = Garvey | date=  2014-03-24 | accessdate = 2014-03-24 | publisher = [[ACM SIGGRAPH]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Art game" versus "game art"===
Due to the contemporaneous improvement of [[Video game graphics|graphic capabilities]] (and other aspects of [[game art design]]) with the trend toward recognition of [[games as art]] and the increases in [[video game art]] production and art game releases, discussions of these topics are often closely interleaved. This has led to the drawing of a number of critical distinctions between the "art game" and the various kinds of "game art".

In drawing a distinction between games with artistic imagery and art games, commentators have compared the art to sculpture and have emphasized the concept of ''artistic intent'' in the creation of the art game. This difference has been described by [[Justin McElroy]] of ''[[Joystiq]]'' as "the same [as that] between a [[sculpture]] and a [[building]]. Though a building/game can be aesthetically pleasing, an art game/sculpture is using its very structure to produce some kind of reaction."&lt;ref name=format/&gt; This same comparison has been used by [[Jenova Chen]] in an interview discussing art games and the prominence of [[non-game]]s to the artistic [[gamer]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenova Chen|Chen, Jenova]]. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20100226073535/http://interactive.usc.edu/members/jchen/archives/009013.html Chat notes about Video Game, Art and Digital Medium]''. Jenova's Blog. 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with expanding on the notion of art games as comparable to architecture in a 2010 interview with [[Nora Young]] for ''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]'', [[Jim Munroe]] stated that whereas video games such as the "art game" are shifting in the direction of the "[[high arts]]" within the realm of art generally, traditionally video games have occupied a position in the "cultural gutter" (making up the "[[low arts]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Nora Young|Young, Nora]] &amp; Misener, Dan. ''[http://www.cbc.ca/spark/episodes/2011/10/14/repeat-of-spark-126---october-16-19-2011/ Repeat of Spark 126 – October 16 &amp; 19, 2011: Games as Art]'' (Podcast available: [http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 Games as Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029074320/http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 |date=2014-10-29 }}). ''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]''. 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key distinction that has been made between art games and games with artistic imagery (and indeed all [[games as art|games viewed as art]]) is that art games are intended as artistic creations from the outset whereas traditional games are often commercially motivated and [[ludology|play]]-oriented.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; Thus the "game" portion of "game art" is merely the means to an artistic end. This has been expanded by some commentators to include the artistic intention of the [[curator]] as well as the original creator.&lt;ref name=ploug/&gt; This distinction also brings into focus the concept of "serious play." Graham Coulter-Smith of Southampton Solent University defines serious play as "a mode of communication that is not instrumental and not overbearingly focused on the linguistic model,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Art games: Interactivity and the embodied gaze|last = Coulter-Smith|first = Graham|date = 2006|journal = Technoetic Arts|doi = 10.1386/tear.4.3.169/1|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a communicative medium that involves the concrete action of the participants rather than abstracts such as language. This holds significant implications for an artistic medium, as it facilitates communication of meaning through increasingly more empathetic and concrete means. Unlike other media, players of games must expend not only time but ''effort''&amp;mdash;in the form of problem-solving or the application of timed reflexes. This participatory element demonstrates that adding effort as an element in an art piece results in a higher degree of emotional investment, and therefore a higher potential impact of artistic intent on the participant.

In distinguishing between art games and video game art, the elements of ''interactivity'' and often ''competition'' (or goals) are frequently emphasized. Because art games are games and because games are interactive, definitions for the art game tend to require interactivity whereas video game art can be either interactive or non-interactive.&lt;ref name=holmes2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=cannon/&gt;&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; Beyond this, the questions of whether competition, rules, and goals are intrinsic to games and to what extent "play" is even definable in the context of an art game raise thorny problems for critics who compare a game like chess to a game like ''Sim City'' and who question the playfulness of a game like ''[[Escape From Woomera]]''.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; A number of commentators have included the concept of ''competition'' as part of the definition of the art game to distinguish it from video game art.&lt;ref name=cannon/&gt; An example of such a definition is offered by Professor John Sharp: "Artgames are games in the formal sense of maintaining the experiential and formal characteristics of videogames&amp;mdash;rules, game mechanics, goals, etc.&amp;mdash;as an expressive form in the same way other artists might use painting, film or literature."&lt;ref name=sharp/&gt; Thus [[video game art|game art pieces]] can be seen to employ traditional (non-art) games as the canvas or artistic medium whereas art games employ the formal qualities of the game as the artistic medium.&lt;ref&gt;Silfer, Kyle. ''[http://alibi.com/index.php?story=19721&amp;scn=feature&amp;submit_user_comment=y Applied Ludology: Art games and game art]''. Alibi. V.16, No.28. Feature Archive. July 12&amp;ndash;18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Art game" versus "art mod"===
The idea of a distinction between art games and artistic modifications to existing games is one that several commentators including Rebecca Cannon and Matteo Bittanti&lt;ref name=bittanti/&gt; have found useful in further discussing the related topics. Using Tiffany Holmes' original definition of the "art game" as a starting point, Cannon emphasized that whereas art games "always comprise an entire, (to some degree) playable game" and may be made from scratch, [[art mod]]s by definition "always modify or reuse an existing computer game but only rarely include a reward system, and if so, only when of thematic relevance." Likewise, whereas interactivity and playability are defining characteristics of the art game, they are often of no consequence for the art mod.&lt;ref name=cannon2007&gt;Cannon, Rebecca. "Meltdown" from ''Videogames and Art'' (Clarke, Andy and Grethe Mitchell, eds.). Bristol: Intellect Books. Pp.40-42. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84150-142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Cannon, the nature of a work as a [[Mod (video gaming)|modification]] is not alone determinative of the question of whether the work is an art game or an art mod. Some modifications are "art games" despite being mods according to her definition. In addressing the potential for confusion on this point, she has stated that at the most basic level, "art games explore the game format primarily as a new mode for structuring narrative and/or cultural critique, whilst art mods employ game media attributes for extensive artistic expressions." Thus, whereas art games explore the game ''format'', art mods explore game ''media'' and whereas art mods always exploit existing games, art games often replace them.&lt;ref name=cannon2007/&gt; [[Fluxus]] scholar Celia Pearce describes the art mod or "patch" as an "[[Art intervention|interventional strategy]],"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Games AS Art: The Aesthetics of Play|last = Pearce|first = Celia|date = 2006|journal = Visible Language|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; referencing the [[Dada]]ist concept. She argues that the art mod is an example of this pseudo-vandalism involving subversion and reflection within the cultural context of video games.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other art theorists including Pippa Tshabalala have rejected this narrow definition of the "art game" and have instead adopted a broad definition under the theory that the concept of the game is not limited to systems where the author has created rules and goals, but that games emerge whenever the observer self-limits play experience. Thus, observers experiencing the Jodi art mod, ''SOD'' (a modification of ''Wolfenstein 3D''), can experience it as an art game as soon as they decide that their goal will be to progress to the next level.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;

==History==

===Origins and first wave art games===
The art game genre has emerged most directly from the intersection of commercial culture (specifically commercial video games) and contemporary [[digital art]].&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; In attempting to determine the earliest origins of the genre, however, art theorists including [[Tiffany Holmes]] and [[Greg Costikyan]] have identified its earliest roots in [[Dada]] and the collaborative drawing games of the [[Surrealist]] artists of the 1920s.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; Others have drawn still broader connections to literary games invented by the author for the reader in 19th and 20th century literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoinette LaFarge|LaFarge, Antoinette]]. ''[https://archive.is/20100609233016/http://beallcenter.uci.edu/shift/essays/lafarge.html WINSIDE OUT: An Introduction to the Convergence of Computers, Games, and Art]''. [[University of California, Irvine]]. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; By treating the game as a topic of artistic utility, these earlier art movements legitimized the concept of the game as an artistically explorable form and as more than simply idle amusement.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;

At the Art History of Games conference in Atlanta, Georgia, Professor [[Celia Pearce]] further noted that since the [[Fluxus]] movement of the 1960s and [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s art productions, procedurality has taken a central position in certain forms of art. The artistically motivated imposition of strict rules of creation for an art piece (in this case the restriction by the author to the format or medium of the video game) brought video games and art into a collision resulting in the first true art games.&lt;ref name=pratt&gt;Pratt, Charles J. ''[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27133/The_Art_History_Of_Games_Games_As_Art_May_Be_A_Lost_Cause.php The Art History... Of Games? Games As Art May Be A Lost Cause]''. [[Gamasutra]]. 8 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although early game-like programs such as [[John Horton Conway|Conway]]'s [[zero-player game|zero-player]] ''[[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]'' (1970) were foundational to later art games,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Blow|Blow, Jonathan]].

February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearce identifies the earliest true art games as originating in a small wave in the early 1980s with games such as [[Bernie DeKoven]] and [[Jaron Lanier]]'s ''[[Alien Garden]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; Other early art games from this period include [[Jane Veeder]]'s ''[[Warpitout]]'' (1982),&lt;ref name=softalk&gt;Staff.

''[[Columbia College Chicago|Columbia College Chicago Profile]]''. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this period of activity, art game production would see a lull until the end of the 1990s.

Video games were first displayed in the art museum setting during the 1980s, in retrospective exhibitions like [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]]'s "ARTcade" (1983)&lt;ref name=blakeman&gt;Blakeman, Mary Claire. "The Art Side of Video Games." ''Video Games''. Vol.2, No.4. Pp.27-30.

"New York: It's Happening, It's ... Teen Town!" ''[[The Washington Post]]''. 23 April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; However, just as with the production of art games, the practice became much more common during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Exhibitions like the [[Walker Art Center]]'s "Beyond Interface" (1998),&lt;ref name=holmes2002&gt;Holmes, Tiffany. ''[http://www.crudeoils.us/artwrite/August2002/Holmes.htm Art games and Breakout: New media meets the American arcade]''. Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference (Tampere, Finland); Art Gallery, [[SIGGRAPH|Siggraph 2002]]. August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the online "Synreal" (1998)&lt;ref name=sharp/&gt; and "Cracking the Maze - Game Plug-Ins as Hacker Art" (1999),&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; [[shift e.V.]]'s "RELOAD" (1999),&lt;ref name=sharp/&gt; the [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] Beall Centre's "Shift-Ctrl" (2000),&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; and several others in 2001 were among the first wave of video game exhibitions that popularized the concept.&lt;ref name=holmes2002/&gt; This expanded to exhibitions heavily featuring or exclusive to art game content in the early 2000s with shows like [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art|MASS MoCA]]'s "GameShow" (2001)&lt;ref name=sharp/&gt; [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|San Francisco MOMA]]'s "010101: Art in Technological Times" (2001), the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]]'s "Bitstreams" (2001), and the New York Museum of the Moving Image's "&lt;ALT&gt; Digital Media" (2003).&lt;ref name=holmes2002/&gt;

===Rise of the "artist game"===
Drawing from the modern traditions of the 1970s [[New Games|New Games Movement]], where the playing of a game could be regarded as a form of [[performance art]], art pieces such as [[Frank Lantz]]' ''[[Pac-Manhattan|Pac Manhattan]]'',&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; [[Blast Theory]]'s ''[[Can You See Me Now?]]''&amp;thinsp;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Keith. ''[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/oct/04/blast-theory-survey-exeter Blast Theory brings interactive art to Exeter]''. [[The Guardian]]. 4 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and similar hybrid performance-art/art-games including ''[[Painstation]]'' (2001), ''[[Go Fish (art installation)|Go Fish]]'' (2001), and ''[[Ricardo Miranda Zuñiga#Vagamundo|Vagamundo]]'' (2002) came in the early years of the modern period of art game production. The burgeoning [[video game art]] movement also provided direct inspiration for art game development particularly in the creation of [[art mod]]s. Art theorist Rebecca Cannon identifies the earliest example of a purposeful art mod to be [[Iimura Takahiko]]'s 1993 ''AIUEOUNN Six Features'' (a modification of Sony's "System G"),&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;&lt;ref name=cannon2007/&gt; although the transgressive capability of [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]]s like ''Castle Smurfenstein'' (1983) had already been recognized during the first period of art game creation.&lt;ref&gt;Bogacs, Hannes. ''[http://web.student.tuwien.ac.at/~e0326417/game_mods/game_mods.pdf Game Mods: A Survey of Modifications, Appropriation and Videogame Art]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''. [[Vienna University of Technology|Vienna University of Technology - Design and Assessment of Technologies Institute]]. February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Online [[artist collective]]s including [[Jodi (art collective)|Jodi.org]] and the Australian [[SelectParks]] soon began production of art games in the studio setting, repurposing older games through the use of interactive art mods.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;

The use of mods within art games became one of the primary tools for art game creators who designed games with a message, such as the addition of female characters to a traditionally male-centric game, or to force the audience to re-examine a familiar work in a different light.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; Consequently, the early history of art games is intimately connected to the history of commercial video games and the establishment of video gaming [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], and significant events in the [[history of video games]] have corresponding significance to art games. This is true both in terms of the level of technological advancement that make up the substance of art games as well as by providing cultural touchstones (such as the classic arcade games and blockbuster titles from the 1990s like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Myst]]'') that art games may use referentially&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt; or as the subject of an homage.&lt;ref name=holmes2003/&gt; Art games of this kind have been defined by theorists as "artist games"&lt;ref name=stockburger&gt;Stockburger, Axel. "From Appropriation to Approximation". ''Videogames and Art'' (Clarke, Andy and Grethe Mitchell, eds.). Bristol: Intellect Books. Pp.29, 34-35. {{ISBN|978-1-84150-142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;art games created by non-developer [[contemporary art]]ists rather than by [[Video game developer|game developers]]. Typically produced on a smaller budget and with less technical (coding) knowledge than art games emerging from the game scene itself, "artist games" are often more explicit in terms of their artistic ambitions and commonly occupy "the grey area between modification and original game" because they are frequently based on classic arcade titles from the 1980s.&lt;ref name=stockburger/&gt; Early examples of this kind of game include [[Thompson and Craighead]]'s ''[[Trigger Happy (video game)|Trigger Happy]]'' (1998), [[Esc to Begin]]'s ''[[Font Asteroids]]'' (1999), and [[Natalie Bookchin]]'s ''[[The Intruder (video game)|The Intruder]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name=holmes2003/&gt;

As video games became increasingly common as a form of media throughout the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;Wasteland, Matthew. ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/09/opinion_tell_me_what_art_is_an.php Opinion: Tell Me What Art Is, and I'll Tell You What Games Are]''. [[GameSetWatch]]. 27 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; video games that deemphasized the [[ludology|game]] portion of the medium (such as [[serious game]]s, [[non-game]]s and art games) saw a rise in production. This in turn led to recognition of the game as a vehicle for ideas instead of simply an entertaining diversion. The term "art game" was first used in the scholarly setting by Professor Tiffany Holmes in her 2002 paper, "Art games and Breakout: New media meets the American arcade".&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Shuen-Shing. ''[http://www.gamestudies.org/0302/lee/ I Lose, Therefore I Think: A Search for Contemplation amid Wars of Push-Button Glare - 7. The Rise of Art Games]''. GameStudies.org. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes presented this paper at the Computer Games and Digital Cultures conference in Tampere, Finland, and at [[SIGGRAPH|Siggraph 2002]], later expanding it by defining the term in a 2003 paper for the [[Digital Arts and Culture|Melbourne DAC]] Conference.&lt;ref name=holmes2003/&gt; Further refinements to the definition were made by theorist Rebecca Cannon in her late 2003 paper, "Introduction to Artistic Computer Game Modification."&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;

===Rise of the indie art game===
Beginning in the early to mid-2000s with games such as ''[[Samorost]]'' (2003)&lt;ref name=ploug/&gt; and ''[[The Endless Forest]]'' (2005),&lt;ref name=carless_endlessforest&gt;[[Simon Carless|Carless, Simon]]. ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/11/the_endless_play_of_the_endles.php The Endless Play Of The Endless Forest]''. GameSetWatch. 6 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; a strong overlap developed between art games and [[indie game]]s. This meeting of the art game movement and the indie game movement brought art games to the attention of the [[video game culture]] at large,&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; and sparked large debates regarding whether or not [[video games as an art form|video games can be fairly considered as works of art]], as well as a [[#Criticism of the term "art game"|backlash against use of the term]]. These debates have in turn led to the retrospective determination of numerous older commercial video games (prior to the use of the term "art game") as art games. As indie art games have seen a dramatic rise in production in the late 2000s (especially from 2008 and onwards), indie game developers like [[Jenova Chen]], [[Molleindustria]], [[Jason Nelson]], [[Jason Rohrer]], and [[Tale of Tales (developer)|Tale of Tales]] have become established and "artist games" have become relatively less common.

Discussions over the commercial viability of art games have led to speculation concerning the potential for the commercial video game industry to fund the development of "prestige games" (games that are unlikely to be commercially successful but whose artistic vision marks them as important to the development of the medium). These considerations are generally regarded as premature, as the concept of "prestige" hasn't yet taken hold for [[video game publisher|publishers]] as it has for [[video game developer|developers]] in the nascent industry. Consequently, publishers are generally unwilling to take on commercially risky high-concept games the same way that major film studios (who often have arthouse divisions) might for art films that could enhance their prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Carless, Simon. ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2006/11/why_are_there_no_prestige_game.php Why Are There No Prestige Games?]''. GameSetWatch. 26 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The need for adequate funding to produce high quality art games has been recognized by art game creators like Florent Deloison and Mark Essen, who in 2011 joined designer game firms where individualized art games can be commissioned as luxury items by [[art patron]]s for a substantial price.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, Alice. "Playing around with real life ; Firm hopes to find niche with video games based on customers' histories." International Herald Tribune. 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term "art game"==
Alongside the growing use of the term "art game", numerous members of the [[video game culture]] have [[backlash (sociology)|reacted negatively]] to its application. Critics have noted that the term turns away a certain segment of the gamer population who reject the notion that [[games as art|games can be works of art]], and who equate "art games" with [[elitist]] gaming. This kind of reaction has in turn caused some game developers to reject the use of the term to describe their games, instead using terms like "not-game", "un-game", or simply refusing to accept any categorical label for their work. Some common criticisms of the term include:
*A view from some within the gaming community that describing a game as an art game means that it's pretentious and not fun.&lt;ref name=sterling&gt;Sterling, Jim. ''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/5993-The-Definition-of-Art-Games Jimquisition: The Definition of Art Games]''.

GameSetWatch. 9 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A view that those who play and enjoy art games (known as "art gamers") are [[snob]]by and not to be emulated.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Tim. ''[http://kotaku.com/5976067/the-hierarchy-of-video-game-haters-where-do-you-fit-in The Hierarchy of Video Game Haters]''. Kotaku. 21 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A view that the term "art game" needlessly introduces the distinction between [[high art]] and [[low art]] within video games where it has never existed previously.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.molleindustria.org/node/320/ An artist interview with Paolo Pedercini / Molleindustria]''. [[Molleindustria]]. 14 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A view that the term "art game" is over-broad and that it is incorrectly used synonymously with "indie game" thereby improperly co-opting the concept of innovation when innovation itself is not art.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Edward. ''[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/427544/20130124/why-games-matter-indie-movie-fez-meat.htm Why Games Matter Blog - Indie Games Aren't Art Games].''

*The idea that the term "art game" implies an exclusive claim to artistry within the medium of the video game and that art games are therefore superior to other forms.&lt;ref name=sterling/&gt;
*The idea that works today labeled as "art games" lack the formal properties to properly be called games&lt;ref&gt;Meer, Alec.

The policy is not written into the Athletic Bilbao rulebook&lt;ref name=bbcporque/&gt; but has become a philosophy of the club in order to promote local players under the ''[[cantera]]'' (homegrown) system.&lt;ref name=bbcporque/&gt;&lt;ref name=metro /&gt;&lt;ref name=copa /&gt; The policy also extends to Athletic's [[Athletic Bilbao B|reserves]], their [[farm team]] [[CD Basconia]], their [[Athletic Bilbao cantera|youth teams]] and their [[Athletic Club Femenino|women's football department]].&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite web|author=Neil Stacey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa90/2016/jan/15/athletic-club-bilbao-loyalty-spain-liga-basque |title=This is Athletic Bilbao: the club whose loyalty to local talent is not negotiable |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not apply to the coaching staff, with managers from England, Hungary, Germany, France and Argentina among those to have led the team at various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/coaches.html |title=Coaches |publisher=Athletic Bilbao |date=|accessdate=13 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in 1911, a dispute occurred between Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao regarding the latter fielding ineligible English players in the [[1911 Copa del Rey]];&lt;ref name=cien/&gt; they had also employed the services of several (non-Basque) players from [[Atlético Madrid]] which was then a branch of the Bilbao club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://memoriasdelfutbolvasco.wordpress.com/2014/03/30/manuel-garnica/ | title = Manuel Garnica, the "Saint" who scored a goal with Athletic | trans-title =Manuel Garnica, el “Santo” que metió un gol con el Athletic |language=es|website = Memorias del Fútbol Vasco (Memories of Basque Football) | date= 30 March 2014 |accessdate = 15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.abc.es/20120508/deportes-futbol/abci-historia-athletic-atletico-201205071903.html  | title = Athletic-Atlético, historia de dos parientes| trans-title= Athletic-Atlético, history of two relatives| language=es |newspaper = [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] | date=8 May 2012|accessdate = 10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] introducing a rule for the next year's competition that all players must be Spanish citizens.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vavel.com/es/futbol/2017/03/11/real-sociedad/764769-athletic-el-origen-de-la-filosofia.html|title=Athletic Club: el origen de la filosofía|trans-title=Athletic Club: origin of the philosophy| language=Spanish |publisher=[[Vavel]]| date=11 March 2017|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a large proportion of the players in that early era were Basque,&lt;ref name=special/&gt; relying on locals was no impediment to Athletic and they chose to maintain that approach even when the regulations were relaxed some years later.

As of 2018, Athletic's academy teams include a small number of players of an ethnic minority (mostly [[Afro-Spaniard]]) background, including Cameroon-born goalkeeper [[Chris Atangana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://as.com/futbol/2017/11/14/primera/1510687840_265078.html |title=Atangana surge entre los sucesores de Arrizabalaga |trans-title=Atangana emerges among the successors of Arrizabalaga |language=Spanish|publisher=Diario AS |date=14 November 2017 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forward Nico Williams (the younger brother of Iñaki),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/63256-nico-sigue-la-estela-de-inaki-williams |title=Nico sigue la estela de Iñaki Williams |trans-title=Nico follows in the wake of Iñaki Williams |language=Spanish|publisher=El Desmarque  |date=12 October 2017 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and defender Loic Boum, also of [[Cameroon]]ian origin, who having been orphaned as a child was a ward of the [[Government of Navarre]] when he moved to the club in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/noticias/201406/04/lezama-pide-permiso-gobierno-20140604171608.html|title=El Athletic, a por un infantil camerunés de Osasuna |trans-title=Athletic, in for a Cameroonian child from Osasuna |language=Spanish|publisher=El Correo |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lacanteradelezama.com/loic-boum-es-ya-nuevo-jugador-del-athletic/ |title=Loic Boum es ya nuevo jugador del Athletic |trans-title=Loic Boum is now a new Athletic player |language=Spanish|publisher=La Cantera de Lezama |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French players===
The club also rarely fielded players from the French [[Northern Basque Country]], with [[Bixente Lizarazu]] being the first French Basque to play for the club in 1996&lt;ref name=cien/&gt;&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voluntad/&gt; and [[Aymeric Laporte]] the first to successfully graduate from the [[youth system]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2014/dec/08/french-basque-country-rugby-heartland-deschamps-lizarazu |title=The French Basque Country: a rugby heartland with world-class footballers |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes/&gt;

Laporte's signing in 2009 prompted debate regarding the definitions of the policy, as he had no link to the Basque region through birth or residency, and a blood link only via [[Grandparent#Great-grandparents|great-grandparents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/36668-laporte-tengo-sangre-vasca-por-parte-de-mis-bisabuelos |title=Laporte: "Tengo sangre vasca por parte de mis bisabuelos" |trans-title=Laporte: "I have Basque blood through my great-grandparents" |publisher=El Desmarque |language=Spanish|date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=among&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlyfootball.fr/?p=513 |title=Aymeric Laporte, un Basque parmi les Basques |trans-title=Aymeric Laporte, a Basque among the Basques |publisher=Only Football |language=French|date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=butterflies&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sofoot.com/aymeric-laporte-a-arrete-de-regarder-les-papillons-173450.html |title=Aymeric Laporte a "arrêté de regarder les papillons" |trans-title=Aymeric Laporte "stopped watching the butterflies” |publisher=So Foot |language=French |date=26 September 2013|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes/&gt; He did join a team in the territory, [[Aviron Bayonnais FC|Aviron Bayonnais]],&lt;ref name=ownbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aymericlaporte.com/en/bio/|title=Biography - Athletic Bilbao signing and beginnings|trans-title=|work=Aymeric Laporte official website |date=|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=butterflies/&gt; but only by arrangement after the initial approach from Athletic, as he was too young to move to a club outside France at the time – he arrived formally in 2010.&lt;ref name=methods/&gt;

====Griezmann debate====
[[Antoine Griezmann]], the French forward developed by Real Sociedad, was the subject of debate regarding his eligibility for a theoretical move to Athletic as he emerged as an elite player in 2012.&lt;ref name=impossible/&gt; Hailing from [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté|Burgundy]], he arrived at the San Sebastián club aged 14&lt;ref name=antoine&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/griezmann-not-interested-bilbao-speculation|title=Griezmann not interested in Bilbao speculation|publisher=FourFourTwo|date=5 September 2013|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only to play football for their academy teams rather than for some other non-sporting reason, and has no connection to the French Basque Country other than attending school there after signing for Real.

The opinions of some (including Athletic's academy director [[José María Amorrortu]]) &lt;ref name=impossible&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2017/01/19/5880a91522601d4a498b4577.html |title=Athletic Club's impossible dream of signing Griezmann |newspaper=Marca|date=19 January 2017|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were that his training at a Basque club from a young age adhered to the policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.eus/es/deportes/futbol/athletic/detalle/900544/el-athletic-interesado-antoine-griezmann--real-sociedad/|title=¿Puede fichar el Athletic a Griezmann?|trans-title=Can Athletic sign Griezmann?|language=Spanish|publisher=EITB|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others insisted that he had the same (ineligible) status as any adult player transferred in by Real and the other local professional clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/es/news/4194/editoriales/2012/09/28/3407931/antoine-griezmann-no-entra-en-la-filosof%C3%ADa-del-athletic-de|title=Antoine Griezmann no entra en la filosofía del Athletic de Bilbao|trans-title=Antoine Griezmann does not enter the philosophy of Athletic Bilbao|language=Spanish|publisher=Goal|date=28 September 2012|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, Griezmann showed little interest in joining Athletic,&lt;ref name=antoine/&gt; subsequently moved on to [[Atlético Madrid]]&lt;ref name=impossible/&gt; and was voted the [[2016 Ballon d'Or|world's third best player]] in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/12/cristiano-ronaldo-ballon-dor-fourth-lionel-messi|title=Cristiano Ronaldo wins Ballon d’Or for the fourth time|date=12 December 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making any move to Bilbao unlikely in the medium term. In respect of any future players of a similar trajectory, Athletic's position on recruitment remains unconfirmed.

===Players of Basque descent===
[[File:Fernando Amorebieta.png|thumb|right|120px|[[Fernando Amorebieta]], born in Venezuela but raised in the Basque Country]]
In 1980 the club was believed to have given serious consideration to signing [[Iker Zubizarreta]], a young [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] of Basque heritage (his grandfather [[Félix Zubizarreta|Félix]] had starred for Athletic in the 1910s) who had impressed at the [[Football at the 1980 Summer Olympics|football tournament]] at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], but decided not to pursue it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.naiz.eus/en/hemeroteca/gara/editions/2015-08-06/hemeroteca_articles/iker-zubizarreta-el-nieto-de-leon-que-pudo-ser-cachorro|title=Iker Zubizarreta: el nieto de león que pudo ser cachorro |trans-title=Iker Zubizarreta: grandson of a lion who could have been a puppy|language=Spanish|publisher=[[Gara]]|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, media sources claimed that Athletic had shown interest in young [[Mexican people|Mexican]] midfielder [[Jonathan Espericueta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=[[Diario AS]] |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no such move materialised, and the player himself (who did later play in Spain with [[Villarreal CF B|Villarreal B]]) stated that his Basque connection was as distant as a great-great-grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elnuevoheraldo.com/deportes/le-dice-no-a-europa/article_2016b80d-0ccd-5b95-864d-f60cca06d84c.html |title=Le dice 'no' a Europa |trans-title=He says "no" to Europe |language=Spanish |publisher=[[El Nuevo Heraldo]] |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguayan international]] [[Diego Forlán]], whose paternal grandmother was Basque, claimed he had talks over a potential transfer to the club in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forlán afirma que negoció su fichaje por el Athletic|trans-title=Forlán confirms that he negotiated a transfer to Athletic|url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/noticias/2010-09-14/forlan-hubo-contactos-athletic-201009141353.html|accessdate=18 March 2017|work=[[El Correo]] |date=14 September 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this signing would have been incompatible with the club's current policy as Forlan was not born in a Basque region, nor did he play football as a youth (or at any point in his career) at a club in the territory.

In the years prior to the [[Spanish Civil War]], Athletic undertook a project named 'Operation Return', seeking players born in the Basque region who had emigrated to other countries. One of the few who actually made a competitive appearance for the club was [[:es:Nemesio Tamayo|Nemesio Tamayo]] who had begun his career in his adopted homeland of Chile and also played in Mexico before a brief spell in his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://jonrivas7.wixsite.com/athletic/single-post/2016/1/17/Tamayo-el-primero-de-la-Operaci%C3%B3n-Retorno |title=La Operación Retorno de 1934  |trans-title=The Operation Return of 1934 |work=El Mundo |language=es |via=Historia Rojiblancas |date=17 January 2016 |accessdate=23 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of Bilbao-born [[Emilio Aldecoa]] in 1947 was unusual as he had spent the past decade of his life in England, having been evacuated as a teenage refugee of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Spanish refugee boy 78 years ago blazed the trail for David Silva and Cesc Fabregas |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/a-spanish-refugee-boy-78-years-ago-blazed-the-trail-for-david-silva-and-cesc-fabregas-10488958.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=6 September 2015|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First foreign footballers: Spain’s Emilio Aldecoa|url=https://www.football365.com/news/first-foreign-footballers-spains-emilio-aldecoa |website=Football365|date=16 March 2018|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Into the ether: When football welcomed refugees|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/ether/when-football-welcomed-refugees |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=26 April 2017|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of that refugee group was the club's star goalkeeper of the era [[Raimundo Pérez Lezama]], although he had returned home much sooner on the outbreak of [[World War II]]; a third Basque refugee [[Sabino Barinaga]] turned down an offer from Athletic and joined [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El momento histórico|trans-title=The historic moment|url=http://algomasquefutbol.blogspot.pt/2007/02/el-momento-histrico.html||website=Algo Más que Fútbol|date=6 February 2007|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players from Biscay===
It was once the case that Athletic would usually recruit from the [[Biscay]] province surrounding [[Bilbao]]&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; while the other leading clubs Real Sociedad and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] would focus on players from their respective provinces [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Navarre]]. In recent decades (with the pool of potential players declining due to a low birth rate in the area),&lt;ref name=lehendakari/&gt; Athletic expanded their recruitment in these other areas in their efforts to accommodate the best players with any Basque links. This saw many talented players from [[San Sebastián]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://real-sociedad.diariovasco.com/noticias/201610/13/hasta-trece-transfugas-defendido-20161013005246-v.html|title=Real Sociedad: Hasta trece tránsfugas han defendido las dos camisetas|trans-title=Up to thirteen 'traitors' have defended the two shirts|newspaper=[[El Diario Vasco]]|language=Spanish|date=13 October 2016|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pamplona]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://real-sociedad.diariovasco.com/noticias/2011-02-10/chantrea-mejor-vivero-athletic-20110210.html |title=La Chantrea, el mejor vivero, es del Athletic |trans-title=Chantrea, Athletic's best nursery |language=Spanish |publisher=[[El Diario Vasco]]|date= 10 February 2011 |accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; join the club, and also caused Real Sociedad to abandon their own Basque policy in the face of the competition for signings.&lt;ref name=morboreview&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/mar/26/newsstory.sport13|title=Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football by Phil Ball (London: WSC Books, 2001)|date=26 March 2001|accessdate=15 November 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=[[Sid Lowe|Lowe]]|first=Sid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes/&gt;

That change of focus also led to fewer players from the home province being selected; in a 2011 fixture, none of the Athletic starters or substitutes were from Biscay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.footballwhispers.com/blog/athletic-bilbaos-transfer-policy| title = Football Whispers – Athletic Bilbao’s transfer policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/match-statistics/1_4456/2010-11_real-zaragoza_athletic-club.html| title = Real Zaragoza 2 Athletic Club 1 02/03/2011|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in subsequent years more local players made the grade, and the situation appears unlikely to occur again in the near future – twelve of the 25 players in the [[2016–17 Athletic Bilbao season#Squad|2016–17 squad]] were born in Biscay, and in November 2017 a study showed that 77% of players in the academy teams hailed from the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/64416-el-77-de-canteranos-del-athletic-son-vizcainos|title=El 77% de canteranos del Athletic son vizcaínos|trans-title=77% of Athletic homegrown players are from Biscay|language=Spanish|newspaper=El Desmarque|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players from outside the region===
On the other hand, the definitions of the philosophy are stretched occasionally to accommodate promising youngsters with little Basque connection, which does not always sit well with some of the club's followers.

[[Enric Saborit]], originally from [[Catalonia]], who graduated through the youth and reserve levels to reach the first team, caused questions to be asked when he signed in 2008; he had no connection with the region by birth or blood, but while already 16 years old and playing in [[RCD Espanyol]]'s ''cantera'' teams, he moved to [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] where his mother had relocated for work two years earlier. As soon as he became a resident of the territory, Saborit was deemed eligible by Athletic to play for the club.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archivo.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/1a_division/athletic/es/desarrollo/1094438.html |title=Saborit abre el debate de la filosofía del club |trans-title=Saborit opens debate on club philosophy |publisher=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abre/&gt;&lt;ref name=catalan&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/futbol/20170104/413083135665/saborit-catalan-athletic.html |title=Saborit, un catalán en el Athletic |trans-title=Saborit, a Catalan at Athletic|publisher=[[La Vanguardia]]|language=Spanish|date=5 January 2017 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2017, Athletic recruited Youssouf Diarra, an 18-year-old forward born in Mali who was raised in Catalonia and had spent the past two years playing for clubs in Navarre after moving these to continue his education, which the club deemed sufficient under the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacanteradelezama.com/youssouf-diarra-se-incorporara-al-basconia/|title=Youssouf Diarra se incorporará al Basconia

But prior to that, he had spent his teenage years living in [[Basauri]] just outside Bilbao and had featured for local teams (including [[CD Basconia|Basconia]], Athletic's farm team at semi-professional level who have a separate amateur and juvenile structure), meaning he too was eligible under the 'learned skills at a Basque club' aspect of the policy.&lt;ref name=abcficha&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.es/deportes/futbol/abci-athletic-ficha-ganea-primer-rumano-historia-201801151632_noticia.html|title=El Athletic ficha a Cristian Ganea, el primer rumano de su historia|trans-title=Athletic sign Cristian Ganea, the first Romanian in their history|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mundoficha&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/deportes/futbol/2018/01/15/5a5cac83ca47419e778b4645.html|title=El Athletic ficha al internacional rumano Cristian Ganea|trans-title=Athletic sign the Romanian international Cristian Ganea|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Authority''' has been considered in [[Sociological theory|sociological]] terms as indicating the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] or socially approved use of power. It is the legitimate power which one person or a group holds and exercises over another. The element of legitimacy is vital to the notion of authority and is the main means by which authority is distinguished from the more general concept of power. Power can be exerted by the use of force or [[violence]]. Authority, by contrast, depends on the acceptance by [[subordinate]]s of the right of those above them to give them orders or [[wiktionary:directive|directive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens, Sociology. London: Polity Press, 1997:581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber in "Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations for the 21st Century", translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters.  pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Authorities==
The types of political authority were first defined by [[Max Weber]] in his essay "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" and his other writings in 1919-1920.  In this essay he emphasized that the political authority that controlled the state can be composed of the following types of authority, or what is called in German, ''Herrschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Traditional authority|Traditional Authority]]:''' Power legitimized by respect for long-established cultural patterns.

'''[[Charismatic authority|Charismatic Authority]]:''' Power legitimized by extraordinary personal abilities that inspire devotion and obedience.

'''[[Rational-legal authority|Rational-Legal Authority]]:''' Also known as bureaucratic authority, is when power is legitimized by legally enacted rules and regulations such as governments.

==Max Weber on authority==&lt;!-- [[Herrschaft (sociology)]] redirects here --&gt;
{{See also|Monopoly on violence}}
[[Max Weber]], in his sociological and philosophical work, identified and distinguished three types of legitimate domination (''Herrschaft'' in German, which generally means 'domination' or 'rule'), that have sometimes been rendered in English translation as types of authority, because [[Dominance (ethology)|domination]] is not seen as a political concept in the first place.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Weber defined domination (authority) as the chance of commands being obeyed by a specifiable group of people.  Legitimate authority is that which is recognized as legitimate and justified by both the ruler and the ruled.Legitimated rule results in what Weber called the monopoly over the use of coercive violence in a given territory.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 136&lt;/ref&gt;  In the modern world, such authority is typically delegated to a police and court system.

Weber divided legitimate authority into three types:

*The first type discussed by Weber is ''[[rational-legal authority]]''. It is that form of authority which depends for its [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] on formal rules and established laws of the state, which are usually written down and are often very complex. The power of the rational legal authority is mentioned in the constitution. Modern societies depend on legal-rational authority. Government officials are the best example of this form of authority, which is prevalent all over the world.
*The second type of authority, ''[[traditional authority]]'', derives from long-established customs, habits and social structures. When power passes from one generation to another, it is known as traditional authority. The rule of hereditary [[Monarchy|monarchs]] furnishes an obvious example. The [[Tudor dynasty]] in England and the ruling families of [[Mewar]] in [[Rajasthan]] (India) are some examples of traditional authority.
* The third form of authority is ''[[charismatic authority]]''. Here, the charisma of the individual or the leader plays an important role. Charismatic authority is that authority which is derived from the leader's claims to a higher power or inspiration that is supported by his or her followers. Examples in this regard can be [[NT Rama Rao]], a matinee idol, who went on to become one of the most powerful Chief Ministers of [[Andhra Pradesh]].

History has witnessed several [[Social movement|social movements]] or [[Revolution|revolutions]] against a system of traditional or legal-rational authority started by Charismatic authorities. According to Weber, what distinguishes authority from [[coercion]], [[Force (law)|force]] and [[Coercion|power]] on the one hand, and leadership, [[persuasion]] and [[Social influence|influence]] on the other hand, is legitimacy. Superiors, he states, feel that they have a right to issue commands; subordinates perceive an obligation to obey. Social scientists{{who|date=November 2010}} agree that authority is but one of several resources available to incumbents in formal positions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} For example, a Head of State is dependent upon a similar nesting of authority. His legitimacy must be acknowledged, not just by citizens, but by those who control other valued resources: his immediate staff, his cabinet, military leaders and in the long run, the administration and political apparatus of the entire society.

Authority can be created expressly when public entities act publicly, using the same means to communicate the grant of authority to their agents that they use to communicate this to third parties, apparent authority describes the situation when a principal has placed restrictions on an agent that are not known to a third party, and restrictions on government agents are accomplished in the open, through laws and regulations. In this setting, all parties concerned is assumed or supposed to know the laws and regulations of government.

Recently the concept of authority has also been discussed as a guiding principle in human–machine interaction design.&lt;ref&gt;Flemisch, F., Heesen, M., Hesse, T., Kelsch, J., Schieben, A., &amp; Beller, J. (2011). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x63032819hx560m3/ Towards a Dynamic Balance between Humans and Automation: Authority, Ability, Responsibility and Control in Cooperative Control Situations]. ''Cognition, Technology and Work''. Advance online publication. doi: 10.1007/s10111-011-0191-6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children and the Three Authority Attributes ==
Authority and its attributes have been identified as of particular relevance to children as they regard their parents and teachers. The three attributes of authority have been described as ''status'', ''specialist skills'' or ''knowledge'', and ''social position''. Children consider the type of command, the characteristics of the authority figure, and the social context when making authority conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Laupa, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although children regard these three types of authority attributes, they firstly assess the legitimacy of the authority figure in question using the nature of the commands they give. For example, a teacher that does not appear to have legitimate power from the child’s perspective (perhaps because she or he cannot control the class well) will not be obeyed. Regarding parenting, authoritative parents who are warm and high in behavioural control but low in psychological control are more likely to be seen as having legitimate authority by the child, and will believe themselves that they have a duty to obey them and internalise their values.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, Cumsille &amp; Martínez, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bersih 3.0 rally''' (also called '''Sit In''' rally or '''Duduk Bantah''' in [[Malay language|Malay]]) was the largest democratic protest in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malaysia-chronicle.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=32760:malaysians-brace-for-nations-largest-ever-peoples-rally-bersih-30&amp;Itemid=2#axzz35wvCpPqx&lt;/ref&gt;  This rally was organised as a follow-up to the [[Bersih 2.0 rally|2011 Bersih rally]] and the [[2007 Bersih rally]]. The rally, organised by the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections ([[Bersih]]), was supported by [[Pakatan Rakyat]], the coalition of the three largest opposition parties in Malaysia along with other small political parties like [[Parti Sosialis Malaysia]] and social organisations such as [[Malaysian Trades Union Congress]], [[Human Rights Commission of Malaysia|Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM)]] and [[Malaysian Bar]].  In addition, Bersih 3.0 was endorsed by 84 NGOs. In particular, it was joined by [[Himpunan Hijau]] (Green Assembly), a civil movement protesting the [[Lynas]] rare earth project in Malaysia. In addition to the main rally at Kuala Lumpur, smaller rallies were held in 10 other cities in Malaysia, as well as in 34 other countries. Following the last rally in 2011, the [[government of Malaysia]] organised a Public Select Committee (PSC) to look into electoral reforms in Malaysia, which released their proposals in April 2012. Seven of the eight demands by the Bersih have been included in the 22 recommendations submitted by the PSC. PSC Committee member [[P. Kamalanathan]] said only one demand by Bersih, on a minimum 21 days campaign period, was not included because it was not suitable to be implemented in [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]. However, the matter was still being considered, where the current campaign period of seven days had been extended to 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://my.news.yahoo.com/seven-demands-bersih-included-psc-recommendations-electroral-reforms-161012891.htm| title=Seven demands by Bersih included in PSC recommendations on electoral reforms Bersih|accessdate=15 May 2012|author=|date=27 April 2012|publisher=[[Bernama]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bersih claimed that PSC proposals were half-hearted and accused the [[Election Commission of Malaysia]] (EC) of being insincere in introducing electoral reforms.  Bersih has stated that they would call off the rally if the Malaysian government gave a guarantee that electoral reforms take place before the next Malaysian general elections.

== Background ==

===Bersih===

[[Bersih]], short for the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections ({{lang-ms|Gabungan Pilihanraya '''Bersih''' dan Adil}}), is a coalition of 62 non-governmental organisations founded in November 2006.&lt;ref name="endorsees"&gt;{{cite web |title=Endorsees |url=http://bersih.org/?page_id=360 |publisher=Bersih |accessdate=14 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408101727/http://bersih.org/?page_id=360 |archivedate=8 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |title=About BERSIH |url=http://bersih.org/?page_id=352 |publisher=Bersih |accessdate=21 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622172238/http://bersih.org/?page_id=352 |archivedate=22 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, Bersih has been supported by the three main opposition parties, [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR), PAS, and DAP.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; ''Bersih'' is the Malay word for "clean."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bersih |url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=bersih |work=Dictionary |publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bersih, is chaired by former [[Malaysian Bar|Bar Council]] president [[Ambiga Sreenevasan]]. Ambiga served as president of the Bar from 2007 to 2009 and is a recipient of the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]]'s International Women of Courage Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presidents' Roll |url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/past_presidents.html |publisher=Malaysian Bar |accessdate=21 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Remarks by Clinton on International Women of Courage Awards |url=http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2009/March/20090312132025xjsnommis0.1997949.html&amp;distid=ucs#ixzz1PtAnEl7f |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2007 Bersih rally|first Bersih rally]] on 10 November 2007 was estimated to have drawn between 30,000 and 50,000 people.&lt;ref name="aje1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Police block Malaysia protest |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2007/12/2008525131234195960.html |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was broken up by police using [[tear gas]] and chemical-laced [[water cannon]]s.&lt;ref name="aje1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia police break up protest |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7088877.stm |work=BBC News   |date=10 November 2007 |last=Brant |first=Robin |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was said to play a major role in helping the opposition parties make big gains in the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]].&lt;ref name="asiatimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysian politics take to the streets |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/MF24Ae02.html |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=24 June 2011 |last=Netto |first=Anil |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2011 Bersih rally|second rally on 9 July 2011]] was met with similar force by the police after they tried to make their way to [[Stadium Merdeka|the Merdeka Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110710010645/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F7%2F7%2Fnation%2F9050421&amp;sec=nation Bersih insists on holding rally at Stadium Merdeka] The Star Online&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lead up to the rally ==

=== Announcement ===
Early in April 2012, the Public Select Committee released a report of their findings on electoral reform.  The speaker in the [[Dewan Rakyat]], or House of Representatives, passed the report with no debate between the opposition and ruling parties.  An opposition minority report was not included in the final report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2012/04/14/bersih-3-0-wants-to-sit-down-and-protest/ Bersih 3.0 wants to sit down and protest] New Mandala&lt;/ref&gt; So far none of Bersih's demands have been met, and with indications that the Malaysian Government would be calling a general election without any electoral reforms, Bersih announced a third rally for clean and fair elections for 28 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/sideviews/article/bersih-3.0-wants-to-sit-down-and-protest-dahlia-martin/ Bersih 3.0 wants to sit down and protest — Dahlia Martin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416061232/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/sideviews/article/bersih-3.0-wants-to-sit-down-and-protest-dahlia-martin/ |date=16 April 2012 }} The Malaysian Insider&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-government organisations ===
Bersih has been backed by the [[Malaysian Bar|Bar Council of Malaysia]] and [[Human Rights Commission of Malaysia|Suhakam]]
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/04/28/suhakam-bar-council-show-support-for-bersih-3-0/ Suhakam, Bar Council show support for Bersih 3.0] Free Malaysia Today&lt;/ref&gt; The Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST) supports the Bersih's right for a peaceful assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysia-chronicle.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=32736:interfaith-group-support-bersih-30-all-religions-demand-fair-play-and-transparency&amp;Itemid=2 Interfaith group: Support Bersih 3.0, all religions demand fair play and transparency] Malaysia Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;
Bersih 3.0 was also backed by Pertubuhan IKRAM Malaysia (IKRAM), an Islamic missionary NGO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikram.org.my/v2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=617:ikram-menyokong-bersih-30&amp;catid=1:berita-pusat&amp;Itemid=9/ IKRAM Menyokong BERSIH 3.0]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111920/http://www.ikram.org.my/v2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=617%3Aikram-menyokong-bersih-30&amp;catid=1%3Aberita-pusat&amp;Itemid=9%2F |date=29 July 2013  }} Pertubuhan IKRAM Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government reaction ===
Home Minister Hishammuddin Hussein stated that the government over-reacted in its response to the Bersih rally in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/195665 We overreacted to Bersih 2.0, says Hisham] Malaysiakini&lt;/ref&gt; Hishammuddin has said that the government does not view the Bersih 3.0 rally as a security threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v6/newsgeneral.php?id=661031 Bersih Rally Not Security Threat – Hishammuddin] BERNAMA&lt;/ref&gt; He offered two alternative venues to that of Dataran Merdeka, [[National Stadium, Bukit Jalil|Bukit Jalil National Stadium]] and [[Stadium Merdeka]], but these were rejected by Bersih.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20120425-341945.html 2 stadiums offered as alternate Bersih rally venue] AsiaOne News&lt;/ref&gt;

Information, Communications and Culture Minister Rais Yatim has described the Bersih ("clean") rally as "dirty", saying they do not respect the laws of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/04/28/rais-calls-it-a-dirty-gathering/ Rais calls Bersih ‘dirty’ gathering] Free Malaysia Today&lt;/ref&gt;

After several meetings between Bersih and DBKL, no compromise was made regarding the choice of venue for the rally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaily.my/news/360023 DBKL and Bersih in deadlock over Dataran] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506115538/http://www.thesundaily.my/news/360023 |date=6 May 2012 }} the Sun Daily&lt;/ref&gt;[[Kuala Lumpur City Hall|DBKL]] erected barricades to prevent the sit-in rally by Bersih.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/04/27/dbkl-shuts-down-dataran-merdeka/ DBKL locks down Dataran Merdeka] Free Malaysia Today&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Court orders ===
The Malaysian High Court instructed the Hishammuddin to clarify whether Bersih is a banned organisation, especially since his recent statements were inconsistent regarding the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/04/25/court-orders-hisham-to-clarify-bersih-ban/ Court orders Hisham to clarify Bersih ban] Free Malaysia Today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/court-orders-hisham-to-state-if-bersih-still-banned Court orders Hisham to state if Bersih still banned] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428023352/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/court-orders-hisham-to-state-if-bersih-still-banned |date=28 April 2012 }} The Malaysian Insider&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malaysian police received an order from Kuala Lumpur Magistrate Court barring any entry by Bersih into [[Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur|Dataran Merdeka]] and any rally gathering there would be considered illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaily.my/news/361941 Court order issued against Bersih 3.0] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506115022/http://www.thesundaily.my/news/361941 |date=6 May 2012 }}  The Sun Daily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v6/newsindex.php?id=662493 Court Grants Restraining Order Barring Entrance Into Dataran Merdeka] BERNAMA&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further revelations ===
During the lead up to the rally,  it was revealed by PKR secretary-general Saifuddin Nasution Ismail in a Malay daily, that the Election Commission (EC) chairman and deputy chairman were UMNO members, leading to claims of conflict of interest. The United Malays National Organisation (abbreviated as UMNO), is Malaysia's largest political party. Bersih stated they would give the two men the benefit of the doubt until more information surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/04/27/ec-umno-ties-ambiga-shocked/ EC-UMNO ties: Ambiga shocked] Free Malaysia Today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ec-chief-deputy-admit-they-could-have-been-umno-members/ EC chief, deputy admit they ‘could have been’ UMNO members] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430055002/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ec-chief-deputy-admit-they-could-have-been-umno-members/ |date=30 April 2012 }} The Malaysian Insider&lt;/ref&gt;

Saifuddin alleged that EC chairman, Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof is a member of Bunga Daisy UMNO branch under the Putrajaya division and his deputy, Datuk Wan Ahmad Wan Omar is a member of Kubang Bunggor UMNO branch under the Pasir Mas Kelantan Division. Wan Ahmad denied the allegations and in slamming the PKR secretary-general for the "big lie", he wanted the former to apologise for slandering him. In  response to the demand to step down by the opposition, EC chairman said under the Constitution, the chairman and the deputy were appointed by the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|King]], in line with advice from the [[Malay rulers]].

== Protest ==
Despite the police roadblocks, the organiser claimed  up to 300,000&lt;ref name=malaysiakini-196344/&gt; people turned up for the Bersih rally in and around Kuala Lumpur city centre.  Close to 58 roads leading into the city were blocked by the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/04/28/15000-at-city-centre-despite-kl-lockdown/ 80,000 at city centre despite KL lockdown] Free Malaysia Today&lt;/ref&gt; Protestors gathered at several points in the city such as [[National Mosque of Malaysia|Masjid Negara]], Masjid India, [[Central Market, Kuala Lumpur|Pasar Seni]], [[Suria KLCC|Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre]] (KLCC), [[Brickfields]] and Jalan Sultan before proceeding to Dataran Merdeka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/04/27/court-order-and-barriers-wont-stop-bersih/ Court order and barriers won’t stop Bersih] Free Malaysia Today&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Statements of Malaysian Prime Minister ===
The [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Najib Razak]], gave remarks in the aftermath of the rally. Najib claimed that Bersih activists merely wanted to paint a negative image of the Government to the world and confront the police so that they could throw allegations of [[police brutality]] to the public. Najib also claimed that the organizers are not concerned about fair and clean elections, that the rally was  politically motivated, and that it was conducted by supporters of [[Pakatan Rakyat]] in an attempt to take over [[Putrajaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/4/29/nation/11200011&amp;sec=nation|title=Opposition not concerned about free and fair elections, says Najib|accessdate=29 April 2012|author=|date=29 April 2012|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502074501/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2012%2F4%2F29%2Fnation%2F11200011&amp;sec=nation|archivedate=2 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International observers have described the Bersih rally as 'peaceful', 'festive' and 'exemplary'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-protesters-exemplary-say-international-observers/ Bersih protesters ‘exemplary’, say international observers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501224138/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-protesters-exemplary-say-international-observers/ |date=1 May 2012 }} The Malaysian Insider&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unprofessional conduct by the police force===
According to an interim report by the Malaysian Bar Council, police brutality was widespread, with instances of savage beatings of civilians as well as arbitrary use of tear gas and water cannons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/police-brutality-more-widespread-during-bersih-3.0-says-bar-council/ Police brutality more widespread during Bersih 3.0, says Bar Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503044335/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/police-brutality-more-widespread-during-bersih-3.0-says-bar-council/ |date=3 May 2012 }} The Malaysian Insider&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same report admits that demonstrators had consistently provoked the police. The council noted that the demonstrators had booed, jeered and insulted with derogatory words but no retaliation from the policemen.&lt;ref name="Bar Council's report" /&gt; Home Minister, [[Hishammudin Hussein]] defend the police as "professional in controlling NGO rally ,supported by opposition which turn as a chaos"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mstar.com.my/cerita.asp?sec=mstar_berita&amp;file=/2012/4/29/mstar_berita/20120428211813&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 9.30&amp;nbsp;am to 2.30&amp;nbsp;pm, majority of Bar Council monitors observed the police force (including FRU team) appeared unperturbed by the participants, and some were courteous towards the participants. Around 12.00&amp;nbsp;pm, near the KLCC – between Jalan P Ramlee and Jalan Raja Chulan, crowds marched towards the direction of Jalan Tun Perak. Along the way, traffic police gave full co-operation and managed the traffic for the crowd to march. Monitors observed there was no disturbance at all. And for hours the police stood aside, looking relaxed and doing nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/4/29/nation/11199930&amp;sec=nation|title=A riot at peaceful rally|accessdate=17 May 2012|author=|date=29 April 2012|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502074608/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2012%2F4%2F29%2Fnation%2F11199930&amp;sec=nation|archivedate=2 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peaceful rally later descended into chaos when police officers retaliated after the demonstrators removed the barbed wire and barriers at Dataran Merdeka and storm into the square, access to which was barred by a magistrate's court restraining order.&lt;ref name="Bar Council's report" /&gt; [[Inspector General of Police]] Tan Sri [[Ismail Omar]] in a statement after the riots had pointed that the water cannon and tear gas was only fired to disperse rioters so that they will break through police barricades, an action which will make them breach the law, violate a court order and ignore the spirit of Peaceful Assembly Act 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.422164334460546.106650.161086313901684&amp;type=3| title=Kenyataan Ketua Polis Negara|accessdate=17 May 2012|author=|date=30 April 2012|publisher=[[PDRM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bar Council's report also noted that:
# The rally was peaceful until around 3 pm when the police unleashed water cannon and tear gas on the crowd;
# The use of force by the police without any obvious provocation or cause, was far worse, indiscriminate, disproportionate and excessive;
# Police brutality was more widespread;
# There was a concerted effort by the police to prevent and stop any recording of their actions and conduct;
# Police fired tear gas directly at the crowd and their firing pattern was to box in the participants rather than allow them to disperse quickly
# After which pockets of retaliatory behaviour was exhibited by some participants of the rally to the wrongful use of force by the police;
# The police were observed taunting and mocking the crowd;
# When items were thrown by some of the participants at the police, the police stooped to return like for like; and
# Not all police personnel were wearing and displaying their police identification number on their uniforms.

The Bar Council further stated that the authorities had disregarded provisions within the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (UNBPUFF), the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (UNCC), and Amnesty International guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/print/malaysia/police-brutality-more-widespread-during-bersih-3.0-says-bar-council/ Police brutality more widespread during Bersih 3.0, says Bar Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505161156/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/print/malaysia/police-brutality-more-widespread-during-bersih-3.0-says-bar-council/ |date=5 May 2012 }} The Malaysian Insider&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence and arrests of journalists ===
Several journalists were attacked by police officers, where some photographers had their cameras and memory cards destroyed after taking photos of alleged police brutality. Malaysiakini photographer Koh Jun Lin was arrested and his camera equipment confiscated. Malay Mail confirmed that its photographer Arif Kartono was punched by police and his camera destroyed. [[Al-Jazeera]]'s crew was roughed about and their camera damaged after they tried to film an officer beating up a protester.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/04/29/journalists-want-answers-on-police-brutality/ Journalists want answers on ‘police brutality’] Free Malaysia Today&lt;/ref&gt; The Inspector-General of Police, Ismail Omar promised that there will be investigations and refuted an earlier statement made by the Home Minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, who claimed that the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of the police allows them to seize media equipment including cameras or memory cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/04/30/hisham-wrong-about-sop-says-igp/ Hisham wrong about SOP, says IGP] Free Malaysia Today&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ) stated that there was significantly less print media coverage on Bersih 3.0, in comparison to Bersih 2.0 in 2011. CIJ began monitoring articles on Bersih 3.0 on 14 April 2012, two weeks before the scheduled 28 April rally, matching an identical study conducted which began two weeks before 9 July 2011 rally. CIJ monitored articles in four newspapers – ''Utusan Malaysia'', ''New Straits Times'', ''The Star'' and ''theSun'' – and showed between 90% to 60% drop in the volume of news coverage. Neutrality of the articles were also disputed, with two major newspapers providing largely negative view of the event. Overall, given the significance of Bersih 3.0, it was assumed that the major newspapers were deliberately toning down their Bersih coverage – either of their own accord, or due to interference from the government or the political parties which own them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottingham.edu.my/Modern-Languages/Newsitems/Centre-for-Independent-Journalism-Malaysia-Alarmed-at-Media-Blackout-of-Bersih-30.aspx/ Centre for Independent Journalism Malaysia Alarmed at Media Blackout of Bersih 3.0; Website Hacked] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825063602/http://www.nottingham.edu.my/Modern-Languages/Newsitems/Centre-for-Independent-Journalism-Malaysia-Alarmed-at-Media-Blackout-of-Bersih-30.aspx/ |date=25 August 2014 }} Nottingham University&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bristol Bus Boycott''' of 1963 arose from the refusal of the [[Bristol Omnibus Company]] to employ Black or Asian bus crews in the city of [[Bristol]], [[England]], [[UK]]. In common with other British cities at the time, there was widespread racial discrimination in housing and employment at that time against "Coloureds". Led by youth worker [[Paul Stephenson (civil rights campaigner)|Paul Stephenson]] and the West Indian Development Council, the [[boycott]] of the company's buses by Bristolians lasted for four months until the company backed down and overturned their discriminative [[colour bar]] policy.

The boycott drew national attention to racial discrimination in Britain, and the campaign was supported by national politicians, with interventions being made by church groups and the [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] for [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The Bristol Bus Boycott was considered by some to have been influential in the passing of the [[Race Relations Act 1965]] which made "racial discrimination unlawful in public places" and the [[Race Relations Act 1968]], which extended the provisions to employment and housing.

==Background==
[[Bristol]] in the early-1960s had an estimated 3,000 residents of [[West Indian]] origin, some of who had served in the [[British military]] during [[World War II]] and some who had emigrated to the UK more recently. A large number lived in the area around City Road in [[St Pauls, Bristol|St Pauls]]. They suffered [[discrimination]] in housing and employment, and some encountered violence from [[Teddy Boy]] gangs of [[White British]] youths.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; This community set up their own churches and associations, including the West Indian Association, which began to act as a representative body.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 12"&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

One of their foremost grievances was the colour bar operated by the Bristol Omnibus Company, which had been a [[Nationalization|nationalised]] company owned by the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] since 1950, and operated through the [[Transport Holding Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel 1989, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was a reported labour shortage on the buses, Black prospective employees were refused employment offers as bus crews, although they were employed in lower paid positions in workshops and in canteens. The ''[[Bristol Evening Post]]'' and the ''[[Western Daily Press]]'' both ran series on the colour bar, which was blamed by company management on the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU), which represented bus workers.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Local union officials denied that there was any colour bar, but in 1955 the Passenger Group of the TGWU had passed a resolution that "coloured" workers should not be employed as bus crews. Andrew Hake, curator of the Bristol Industrial Mission, recalled that: "The TGWU in the city had said that if one black man steps on the platform as a conductor, every wheel will stop."&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 12" /&gt;

The bus workers' concern, apart from [[racism]], was that a new competitive source of labour could reduce their earnings. Pay was low and workers relied on overtime to get a good wage. One [[shop steward]] said, "people were fearful of an influx of people from elsewhere (on the grounds it) would be reducing their earnings potential."&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dispute==

===Boycott===
Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, formed an action group, later to be called the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of progress in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and [[Boys' Brigade]] officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the interview was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the refusal of [[Rosa Parks]] to give up her seat on a bus in [[Alabama]] and the ensuing [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] in the [[United States]] in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;

Their action was announced at a press conference on 29 April 1963. The following day, they claimed that none of the city's West Indians were using the buses and that many White people supported them.&lt;ref name="BEP630430"&gt;{{cite news|title=W. Indians claim 100 p.c. support for bus boycott|last=Staff writer|date=30 April 1963|work=Bristol Evening Post|publisher=Bristol United Press|location=Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial, the ''[[Bristol Evening Post]]'' pointed out that the TGWU opposed the [[apartheid]]  system in South Africa and asked what trade union leaders were doing to counteract racism in their own ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; When reporters questioned the bus company about the boycott, the general manager, Ian Patey, said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The advent of coloured crews would mean a gradual falling off of white staff. It is true that London Transport employ a large coloured staff. They even have recruiting offices in Jamaica and they subsidise the fares to Britain of their new coloured employees. As a result of this, the amount of white labour dwindles steadily on the London Underground. You won't get a white man in London to admit it, but which of them will join a service where they may find themselves working under a coloured foreman? ... I understand that in London, coloured men have become arrogant and rude, after they have been employed for some months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T8277175859&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T8277175862&amp;cisb=22_T8277175861&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=169745&amp;docNo=1|title=Paul Stephenson|subscription=yes|work=Bristol Evening Post, archived at [[LexisNexis]]|location=Bristol|date=6 July 2005|publisher=Bristol United Press|accessdate=11 January 2010|last=Staff writer}}

Behind the people, at street level, motor cars and buses can be seen.|[[University of Bristol|Bristol University]] students march in support of the boycott.]]
Students from [[Bristol University]] held a protest march to the bus station and the local headquarters of the TGWU on 1 May, which attracted heckling from bus crews as they passed through the city centre, according to the local press. Local [[MPs#United Kingdom|MP]] [[Tony Benn]] contacted then [[Leader of the Opposition|Labour Opposition leader]] [[Harold Wilson]], who spoke out against the colour bar at an [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] rally in London.&lt;ref name=Dresserp26&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 May, local [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Alderman#In the United Kingdom|Alderman]] Henry Hennessey spoke of the apparent collusion between bus company management and the TGWU over the colour bar. On 3 May, the ruling Labour Group on the [[History of local government in Bristol|city council]] threatened him with expulsion, despite his honourable service of over forty years.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Benn, [[Fenner Brockway]] and former cricketer [[Learie Constantine]] also condemned the bus company.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 21–28"&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 21–28&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine was then serving as [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] for [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Constantine wrote letters to the bus company and Stephenson and spoke out against the colour bar to reporters when he attended the cricket match between the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] at the [[County Cricket Ground, Bristol|County Ground]], which took place from 4 to 7 May.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The West Indies team refused to publicly support the boycott, saying that sport and politics did not mix. During the game, local members of the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination (CARD) distributed leaflets urging spectators to support the action.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 21–28"/&gt;

The local branch of the TGWU refused to meet with a delegation from the West Indian Development Council, and an increasingly bitter war of words was fought out in the local media. Ron Nethercott, South West Regional Secretary of the union, persuaded a local black TGWU member, Bill Smith, to sign a statement which called for quiet negotiation to solve the dispute. It condemned Stephenson for causing potential harm to the city's Black and Asian population.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 21–28"/&gt; Nethercott launched an attack on Stephenson in the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' newspaper, calling him dishonest and irresponsible. This led to a libel case in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], which awarded Stephenson damages and costs in December 1963.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We seriously regret that what may prove an extended racial conflict arising from this issue has apparently been deliberately created by a small group of West Indians professing to be representative. We also deplore the apparent fact that social and economic fears on the part of some white people should have placed the Bristol Bus Company in a position where it is most difficult to fulfil the Christian ideal of race relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This in turn was criticised by Robert Davison, an official at the [[Jamaica]]n [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commission]], who stated that it was "nonsense to describe a group of West Indians as unrepresentative when no representative West Indian body existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

At a [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] rally, held on Sunday 6 May in [[Eastville, Bristol|Eastville]], local [[Labour council|Trades Council]] members publicly criticised the TGWU. On the same day Paul Stephenson had organised a demonstration march to [[St Mary Redcliffe]] church, but there was a poor turnout. Some local West Indians said they should not ripple the water and, according to Roy Hackett, they may have feared victimisation.&lt;ref name="Dresser 1986, p. 29-32"&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 29–32&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute led to what has been described as one of the largest mailbags that the ''Bristol Evening Post'' had ever received, with contributors writing in support of both sides of the issue.

===Resolution===
The union, the city Labour establishment and the [[Bishop of Bristol]], [[Oliver Stratford Tomkins]], ignored Stephenson and tried to work with Bill Smith of the TGWU to resolve the dispute. Learie Constantine continued with his support for the campaign, meeting with the [[Lord Mayor]] of Bristol and [[Frank Cousins]], leader of the Transport and General Workers Union. In addition, he went to the Bristol Omnibus Company's parent, the [[Transport Holding Company]], and persuaded them to send officials to talk with the union. The company chairman told Constantine that racial discrimination was not company policy.&lt;ref&gt;

Negotiations between the bus company and the union continued for several months until a mass meeting of 500 bus workers agreed on 27 August to end the colour bar. On 28 August 1963, Ian Patey announced that there would be no more discrimination in employing bus crews.&lt;ref name=Dresser42-47&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 42–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bus firm drops colour bar|last=Western Daily Press Reporter|date=29 August 1963|work=Western Daily Press|publisher=Bristol United Press|location=Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on the same day that [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] made his famous "I Have a Dream" speech at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]]. On 17 September, Raghbir Singh, a [[Sikh]], became Bristol's first non-White bus conductor. A few days later two [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] and two [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] men joined him.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser 1986, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 1965, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Parliament]] passed a [[Race Relations Act 1965|Race Relations Act]], which made "racial discrimination unlawful in public places."&lt;ref&gt;

[[Unite the Union|Unite]], the successor to the Transport and General Workers Union, issued an apology in February 2013. Laurence Faircloth, the union's South West secretary said of the union's stance at the time, "It was completely unacceptable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3479">The '''Catalan time system '''is the traditional manner in which to tell time in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and it is exclusive to this language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torres i Vilatarsana|first=Marta|date=2001|title=L'expressió de les hores en català: Anàlisi contrastiva|url=http://www.comunicaciodigital.com/rellotge_catala/pdf/analisi_contrastiva.pdf|journal=Revista Internacional de Filologia |volume=30|language=Catalan|publisher=Caplletra|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telling the time through this system works by dividing it in fractions of a quarter and half a quarter of an hour. Hour-fractions refer to the starting hour, taking into account that when a clock reaches a whole hour (e.g. three o'clock) it actually indicates its end.

[[File:RellotgeHorariCatala.jpg|thumb|Catalan-system watch telling the time]]

The order is ''quarts-minuts-hora posterior'' (quarters-minutes-next hour). Hence, for example, 10:15 h would be ''un quart d'onze'' ("a quarter of eleven"); 12:30 h, ''dos quarts d'una'' ("two quarters of one"), and 19:52 h would be ''tres quarts i set minuts de vuit'' ("three quarters and seven minutes of eight"). Additionally, there are little variations by which the expression ''dos quarts'' ("two quarters") is shortened to just ''quarts'' ("quarters"); also, ''mig quart'' ("half a quarter") is used as an approximation in place of the too specific ''set minuts i mig'' ("seven minutes and a half").

== Notation examples ==

[[File:CardedeuAjuntament.JPG|thumb|Cardedeu's town council has a Catalan-system clock on its façade, telling the time in quarters.]]
* "Quarters" (''quarts'') examples:
: 01:15 ''un quart de dues'' ("a quarter of two")
: 01:30 ''dos quarts de dues'' ("two quarters of two")
: 01:45 ''tres quarts de dues'' ("three quarters of two")
* Whenever it's clear that you are referring specifically to the time (for example, when someone's asking it), you can give the time by leaving out the ''quarts'' ("quarters"), thus shortening the notation as follows:
: 07:45 ''tres de vuit'' ("three [quarters] of eight")
: 16:30 ''dos de cinc'' ("two [quarters] of five")
* "Half a quarter" (''mig quart'') examples:
: 02:07:30 ''mig quart de tres'' (half a quarter of three)
: 02:22:30 ''un quart i mig de tres'' (a quarter and a half of three)
: 02:37:30 ''dos quarts i mig de tres'' (two quarters and a half of three)
: 02:52:30 ''tres quarts i mig de tres'' (three quarters and a half of three)
: 
The Catalan time system is restricted to [[12-hour clocks]]; if necessary, one can specify if it's an hour of the [[morning]] (''matinada'' or ''matí''), [[noon]] (''migdia''), [[afternoon]] (''vesprada''), [[evening]] (''vespre'') or [[night]] (''nit'').

'''Catholic peace traditions''' begin with its biblical and classical origins to the current practice in the 21st century. Because of its long history and breadth of geographical and cultural diversity, this Catholic tradition encompasses many strains and influences of both religious and secular [[peacemaking]] and many aspects of [[Christian pacifism]], [[just war]] and [[nonviolence]].

Catholic tradition as a whole supports and favors peacemaking efforts.&lt;ref name=Kemmetmueller&gt;[http://www.monitor.upeace.org/pdf/Peace_Catholicism.pdf Kemmetmueller, Donna Jean. "Peace: The Challenge of Living the Catholic Tradition", ''Peace and Conflict Monitor''. May 9, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Peacemaking is an integral part of [[Catholic Social Teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicsocialteaching.org.uk/principles/glossary/#Peace "Glossary", CatholicSocialTeaching.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[File:2008. Донецк 122.jpg|thumb|2008. Angel of peace in Donetsk]]

The history of peacemaking in the Catholic tradition reflects the religious meanings of peace, tied to positive virtues, such as love, and to the personal and social works of justice. The Greek word for peace is ''eirene''; Roman ''pax'', and in the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''shalom''.

For the earliest Romans, "pax" meant to live in a state of agreement, where discord and war were absent. In his ''Meditations'', or ''To Himself,'' the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] expresses peace as a state of unperturbed tranquility. The English word "peace" derives ultimately from its root, the Latin "pax".

Shalom ({{lang-he|שלום}}) is the word for peace in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (''[[Tanakh]]'' or {{lang-he|תנ"ך}}), and has  other meanings also pertaining to well being, including use as a greeting.

===''Eirene''===
The Greek meaning for peace, contained in the word ''eirene'', evolved over the course of Greco-Roman civilization from such agricultural meanings as prosperity, fertility, and security of home contained in [[Hesiod]]’s ''Works and Days'', to more internal meanings of peace formulated by the Stoics, such as [[Epictetus]].

''Eirene'' is the word that the New Testament generally uses for peace, one of the twenty words used by the [[Septuagint]], the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible used in the largely Greek-speaking Jewish communities throughout the Greco-Roman world. It is chiefly through the Septuagint’s use of Greek that the Greek word ''eirene'' became infused with all the religious imagery and richness of the word ''shalom'' in the Hebrew Bible that had evolved over the history of the Jewish people. Subsequently, the use of the Greek Bible as the basis for [[St. Jerome]]’s [[Vulgate]] translation into Latin then brought all the new meanings of ''eirene'' to the Latin word ''pax'' and transformed it from a term for an imposed order of the sword, the ''Pax Romana'', into the chief image of peace for Western Christianity.&lt;ref name=Musto&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rzItAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Eirene Musto, Ronald G., ''The Catholic Peace Tradition'', Orbis Books, 1986] {{ISBN|9780883442630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -31- - Kiss of Judas.jpg|thumb|130px|Christ in Gethsemane commands Peter to lay down his sword (fresco by [[Giotto]])]]

The Gospels present the birth of Jesus as ushering in a new age of peace. In Luke, [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] celebrates his son [[John the Baptist|John]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God by which the daybreak from on high will visit us to shine on those who sit in darkness and death's shadow, to guide our feet into the path of peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PWK.HTM "Luke 1: 76-79", ''The New American Bible'', United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And later, the angels appear to the shepherds at Bethlehem, "And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying: 'Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests'"{{sfn|NAB, Luke 2:13-14}} – a peace distinct from the [[Pax Romana]].{{sfn|NAB, Luke 2, n.6}}
 
The [[Sermon on the Mount]] (Mt. 5:1-16) and the [[Sermon on the Plain]] (Lk. 6:20-45) combine with the call to "love your enemies" (Mt. 5:38-48) to encapsulate Jesus' teachings on peacemaking. According to [[Gabriel Moran]], the Sermon on the Mount does not advocate submission to oppressors, but rather a strategy to "de-hostilize enemies in order to win them over".&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/NONVIOLENCE.pdf Moran, Gabriel. "Roman Catholic Tradition and Passive Resistance", New York University]&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the healing of the centurion's servant suggests to John Eppstein that Jesus did not view military service as sinful, since rather than reprove the soldier for his profession, Jesus praised him for his faith. Nor did [[Saint Peter|Peter]] require Cornelius to resign his commission or desert upon being baptized.&lt;ref name=Eppstein&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IESe7m8Obe4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Catholic+peace+traditions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SjsJVNrRAfOAsQT3rYDIAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Catholic%20peace%20traditions&amp;f=false Eppstein, John. ''The Catholic Tradition of the Law of Nations'', Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1935]&lt;/ref&gt; John the Baptist's advice to soldiers was, "Do not practice extortion, do not falsely accuse anyone, and be satisfied with your wages." {{sfn|NAB, Luke 3:14}}

==Early Church==
Early Christianity was relatively pacifist.&lt;ref name=McCormick&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/schools/lsoe/cce/highered/iache/Institutereadingmaterials/jcr%3Acontent/content/download_3/file.res/McCormick.pdf McCormick, Patrick. "Catholic Social Teaching &amp; the Catholic Intellectual Tradition", The Catholic University]&lt;/ref&gt; Clement of Alexandria wrote, "“If you enroll as one of God’s people, heaven is your country and God your lawgiver. And what are his laws? You shall not kill, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. To him that strikes you on the one cheek, turn to him the other also.” (Protrepticus 10)

The early Christians anticipated the eminent return of the Lord in glory, even to the extant that [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] had to tell some of them to get back to work.{{sfn|NAB, 2 Thess 3: 10}} Generally they were not deeply involved in the larger community. As it became apparent that a more nuanced understanding was called for, Christians came to realize that if they were to survive socially they could not remain within the confines of their own community.&lt;ref name=Massaro&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TXTGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Christians+in+the+Roman+Army+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tdtV9iGu5S&amp;sig=IjL4vvTD3nBHwv2KToyhJidpETs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hDcKVLTIO7TCsATHrYCYBg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Christians%20in%20the%20Roman%20Army%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Massaro, S.J. and Shannon, Thomas A., ''Catholic Perspectives on Peace and War'', Sheed &amp; Ward, 2003] {{ISBN|9781461667421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christians in the Roman Army ===
[[File:Simone Martini 028.jpg|thumb|left|120px|St Martin leaves the life of chivalry and renounces the army (fresco by [[Simone Martini]])]]
St. Paul wrote, "Let every person be subordinate to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been established by God. ...This is why you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Pay to all their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due, toll to whom toll is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due."{{sfn|NAB, Romans 13: 1-7}}

The early Christian church believed that Christians should not take up arms in any war,&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt; and so struggled attempting to balance the obligation to be a good citizen and the question of whether it was permissible to take up arms to defend one's country. There developed a gap between the reasoning of the moral theorists and the practice of the private citizen.

As early as second century, Christians began to participate in Roman military, police, and government in large numbers.&lt;ref name=Philpott/&gt; Military service was one way available to make a living, and on the borders of the empire there was a need to defend against barbarian incursions. As the army came to take on duties more in the line of police work: traffic and customs control, firefighting, the apprehension of criminals and bandits, maintaining the peace, quelling street brawls, and performing the roles of engineering, clearance, and other works of building for which the Roman army was well known, this choice became less problematic.&lt;ref name=Massaro/&gt; The numbers of soldiers that came to be counted among the later martyrs indicates that many Christians served in the military, despite their abhorrence of war.&lt;ref name=Eppstein/&gt;

From about the middle of the second century, officers in the Roman army were expected to participate in the Imperial Cult and sacrifice to the emperor. During the reign of Diocletian this obligation was extended to the lower ranks, as a test for those suspected of being Christian. Christians were therefore counseled not to enlist so as to avoid needless blood guilt and the risk of idolatry, but should nonetheless continue to pray for the civil authorities.&lt;ref name=Eppstein/&gt;
  
Among the better-known soldier saints are [[Saint Marinus]], [[Marcellus of Tangier]], and [[Maximilian of Tebessa]], and [[Martin of Tours]].

===Martyrdom as non-violent protest===
[[File:LawrenceRavenna.jpg|thumb|[[St. Lawrence]]. Mosaic from the Mausoleum of [[Galla Placidia]], [[Ravenna]], Italy]]
Persecutions were sporadic and the third century, largely local. By and large the Roman government didn’t pay much attention to Christianity.&lt;ref name=Philpott/&gt;

Christians sought to live the injunction to love their enemies while resisting their evil, even if this involved persecution and death: these were the [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]]. The word ''“martyr”'' is the Greek for “witness.” The early martyrs followed a long-standing tradition; [[John the Baptist]] was beheaded for "speaking truth to power". They also had as examples St. [[Stephen]], the apostles [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], and [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], and others.&lt;ref name=Philpott&gt;[http://ocw.nd.edu/peace-studies/catholicism-and-politics/lectures/the-early-church Philpott, Daniel. "The Early Church", Notre Dame University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906020731/http://ocw.nd.edu/peace-studies/catholicism-and-politics/lectures/the-early-church |date=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sufferings of the martyrs were therefore not an act of suicide or some masochistic form of passive weakness that found its fulfillment in torture and death at the hands of the Romans. Theirs was an act of commitment carried out in the public arena, designed to show the enemy that what is worth living for is also worth dying for. According to [[Josephine Laffin]], martyrdom demonstrated to all that Christ had overcome  death, and that the Holy Spirit sustained the Church in its fight against darkness and evil.&lt;ref name=Laffin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W1lmLyFzdkIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Martyrs+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k0kKVLTrIsTlsAT8rgE&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Martyrs%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Laffin, Josephine.

====Martyrs of Cordoba====
[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Mosque in Cordoba. Photo:Timor Espallargas]]
 
The [[Martyrs of Córdoba]] were forty-eight Christian martyrs living in the 9th century Muslim-ruled Al-Andalus. Their hagiography describes in detail their executions for deliberately sought capital violations of Muslim law in Al-Andalus. The martyrdoms recorded by [[Eulogius of Cordoba|Eulogius]] took place between 851 and 859; with few exceptions, the Christians invited execution by making public statements tactically chosen to invite martyrdom by appearing before the Muslim authorities to denounce Islam. The martyrs caused tension not only between Muslims and Christians, but within the Christian community. In December 852 Church leaders called a council in Cordoba, which honored those fallen but called on Christians to refrain from seeking martyrdom.

Recent historical interpretation of the martyr movement reflect questions on its nature. Kenneth Baxter Wolf sees its cause in “spiritual anxiety” and the penitential aspect of 9th century Iberian Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Kenneth Baxter. ''Christian Martyrs in Muslim Spain,'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Clayton J. Drees&lt;ref&gt;“Sainthood and Suicide. The Motives of the Martyrs of Córdoba, A.D. 850-859,” ''Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies'' 20, 1, 1990: 59-89&lt;/ref&gt; sees their motives in a “pathological death-wish, the product of unexpressed hatred toward society that had turned inward against themselves” and other innate “psychological imbalances.” Jessica A. Coope suggests that it reflects a protest against the process of assimilation, and that the martyrs demonstrated a determination to assert Christian identity.&lt;ref name=Coope&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=vf1JAz1g-cgC&amp;q=Perfectus#v=snippet&amp;q=Perfectus&amp;f=false Coope, Jessica A., ''The Martyrs of C¢rdoba: Community and Family Conflict in an Age of Mass Conversion", p. 14, University of Nebraska Press, 1995] {{ISBN|9780803214712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Constantine===
[[File:Rome-Capitole-StatueConstantin.jpg|thumb|130px|Bust of Constantine. (Rome, Capitoline Museum)]]

With the triumph of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] as sole Roman emperor in 313, the church of the martyrs now found itself an accepted and favored religion, soon to become the official religion of the state. Constantine had an emblem inscribed on the shields of his soldiers that has been various described as representing the "Unconquerable Sun" or as a [[Chi-Rho]]. [[Eileen Egan]] quotes Burkhardt's observation that this was "an emblem which every man could interpret as he pleased, but which the Christians would refer to themselves."&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt;

As the religion of the empire, its survival was tied to the fate of the Empire. The threat of increased barbarian incursions therefore threatened both, and defense of the Empire was appropriate in order to protect Christianity.  The early trend toward pacifism became muted.&lt;ref name=Massaro/&gt;

[[Ambrose of Milan]], former Pretorian Prefect of northern Italy before being elected bishop of Milan, preserved the Christian presumption against the use of violence, unless it was needed to protect important social values. While rejecting resorting to violence in self-defense, he argued that charity demanded one protect one’s neighbour.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;[http://www.socialjustice.catholic.org.au/publications/discussion-guides/133-the-struggle-to-develop-a-just-war-tradition-in-the-west Duncan C.Ss.R., Bruce. "The Struggle to Develop a Just War Tradition in the West", Australian Catholic Social Justice Council, April 8, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; "He who does not ward off injury from his comrade, when he is able to, is just as guilty as he who does the injury."&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nRxLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Constantine+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NlMKVPi0Koq1sQSYmoCgDw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Constantine%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Egan, Eileen. ''Peace Be with You: Justified Warfare or the Way of Nonviolence'', Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2004] {{ISBN|9781592447978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Empress Justina sought to have the new basilica in Milan turned over to the Arians, Ambrose, supported by the faithful, occupied it himself in what Egan identifies as an example of non-violent resistance.&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt;

=== Augustine of Hippo ===
{{Main article|Just war theory}}
Following Ambrose, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] thought that the Christian, in imitation of Jesus, should not use violence to defend himself, but  however, had an obligation to aid a victim under attack.&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt;

Augustine of Hippo agreed strongly with the conventional wisdom of his time, that Christians should be pacifists philosophically, but that they should use defense as a means of preserving peace in the long run. He routinely argued that pacifism did not prevent the defence of innocents. In essence, the pursuit of peace might require fighting to preserve it in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html St. Augustine of Hippo], Crusades-Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Such a war must not be preemptive, but defensive, to restore peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jknirp.com/mattox.htm Saint Augustine and the Theory of Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine drew on Roman tradition to view a "just war" as one prosecuted under lawful authority for a just cause, i.e., repelling aggression or injury, retaking something wrongly seized, or to punish wrongdoing. Later other theorists expanded on this. War must be the last resort, have a reasonable chance of success, and produce more good than harm. The church also argued that non-combatants must be protected.&lt;ref name=McCormick/&gt;

Augustine drew no distinction between offensive and defensive wars, since remedying injuries was a just cause apart from defence.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; Against the threat of chaos and breakdown of civil order, a man may wage war justly but lament his unavoidable duty.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, R.A., "Saint Augustine’s Views on the 'Just War'", ''Sacred and Secular: Studies on Augustine and Latin Christianity'', p.9-10, (Variorum, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barbarian Invasions===
During Augustine's last days Vandals invaded North Africa. Barbarian incursions which later swept Europe in succeeding centuries resulted in a collapse of learning and culture, and population decline.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; There is a long historical tradition that has collected ample evidence to show that the Roman Empire itself was undergoing profound social, economic, and spiritual changes that were only hastened by the invasions. As the Western Empire crumbled the Church became the stabilizing force for order and peace.

The Christian peacemakers of this period were not the dominant cultural or political force of their time, but were either marginalized minorities — as in the case of the Roman Empire or — as in the case of the missionaries who evangelized the barbarians — were actually reaching out from an oppressive and collapsing world to an anarchic one that offered the seeds of a new society. Among the more important figures of active peacemaking or of intellectual life worth further study were [[Martin of Tours]], [[Salvian of Marseilles]], [[Nicetas of Remesiana]], [[Germanus of Auxerre]], [[Severinus of Noricum]], [[St. Patrick]], [[St. Genevieve]] of Paris, [[Columban]], and [[St. Boniface]] of Crediton.

==Monasticism==
[[File:Tentation de Saint Antoine.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Hieronymous Bosch, Temptation of St. Anthony. Madrid, Prado Museum]]

It is no coincidence that the appearance of the first monks comes within a few years of Constantine’s assumption of power and the alliance of church and empire that he forged. [[Thomas Merton]] identified one of the reasons individuals sought out the desert. was that they "declined to be ruled by men, but had no desire to rule over others themselves'.&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Thomas. ''The Wisdom of the Desert'', New Directions Publishing, 1970, {{ISBN|9780811201025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others sought to imitate Jesus' own time spent in the desert.

Monasticism was, in a sense, a continuation of martyrdom, reaffirming the contradiction between the Church and the world, by fleeing from the corruption of civilization in order to seek a greater treasure.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8nt_n7wuugAC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Monasticism+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_3kKVJqTNdXbsATyn4Io&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Monasticism%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Hitchcock, James. ''History of the Catholic Church: From the Apostolic Age to the Third Millennium'', Ignatius Press, 2012] {{ISBN|9781586176648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian monasticism started in Egypt, then spread to Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, and finally to Italy and southern Gaul. [[Anthony the Hermit]] (c.251-356), the founder of monasticism, and [[Pachomius]] (c.290-346) were the prototypes.

=== Penitentials ===
The penitentials, written by Irish monks, were a series of manuals designed for priests who heard confessions that specified certain penances for certain categories of sins. These “penitentials” borrowed inspiration and specific regulations from the early church councils, monastic rules, and the letters of popes and bishops. Many of the regulations at first paralleled those aimed at insuring the special status of the clergy, including its nonviolence, but were gradually extended to the lay population. Penances ranged from fasting on bread and water for week, paying compensation to victims in money, goods or property, exile, pilgrimage, and excommunication. Readmission to Christian community was possible only after the completion of the prescribed penance.

These manuals proved to be such a concise and effective method for conceptualizing and standardizing notions of sin and repentance that they spread from Ireland to the Continent in a wide variety of collections that became enshrined in official collections of church law by the twelfth century. The penitentials are of great value for studying early medieval notions of violence, its seriousness and its consequences in a variety of actions, circumstances, and classes of victims.

The texts assign penances for killing in wartime, even under the lawful command of legitimate authority.&lt;ref name=Winwright&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IT0jKKtIasUC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Penitentials+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DYwKVJaDE6_jsASQg4HQDw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Penitentials%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Winwright, Tobias.

Eerdmans Publishing, 2007, 9780802825957]&lt;/ref&gt; Penances lasting from forty days to a year for killing someone in battle, were not uncommon. Following Augustine, war was seen as inherently sinful, and at best the lesser of two evils.&lt;ref name=Allman&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WYRDduxlVf4C&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=Penitentials+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cZAKVNWIFMjhsATQ0IDoDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Penitentials%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Allman, Mark.

==The Middle Ages==
[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|Charles the Bald with Popes Gelasius I and Gregory I. From the Sacramentary of Charles the Bald (ca. 870)]]

The Carolingian period saw the emergence of both a renewed Roman Empire of the West and the beginning of fresh barbarian invasions from the north and east and the rise of Islam. Internal efforts to legislate the life of the Christian Republic were therefore matched by its external defense against invasions by the [[Vikings]], [[Magyars]], and [[Saracens]]. The problems and conditions were in many ways similar to those of Christian thinkers under the late Roman Empire when the state was identified with Christian society. The [[Carolingian Empire]] thus brought a renewed militarization of society that sought to protect Christendom from external threat, while it used the hierarchical bonds of [[feudal]] oaths and [[vassalage]] to bring the new class of mobile horse warriors, the ''milities'', to some semblance of central authority. War took on a religious dimension as evidenced by liturgical formulae for the blessings of armies and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_CCjUVzFWI4C&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Medieval+Peace+of+God&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XT9FAGLsG_&amp;sig=ShgxrRhPueknMezp6bMD-M_It_Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DeYNVO3XM_KTsQSexIHoBw&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Medieval%20Peace%20of%20God&amp;f=false "Peace and War in Early eleventh Century Acquitaine", ''Medieval Knighthood IV: Papers from the Fifth Strawberry Hill Conference 1990'', p. 169, Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1992] {{ISBN|9780851153193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The close identification of the Carolingian Empire with the extent of Western Christianity revived the late Roman associations of ''Christianitas'' ([[Christendom]]) with the ''orbis Romanus'' or ''oikoumene'' (the Roman world). On the most official levels Christian peace necessitated its defense against the attacks of external enemies.

Christian peace involved the monastic or ascetic peace of a pure heart and life devoted to prayer; the episcopal peace, or pax ecclesiae, of a properly functioning free and unified church; and the social or imperial peace of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Renna, Thomas. “The Idea of Peace in the West,” Journal of Medieval History 6 (1980): 143–67&lt;/ref&gt; These often overlapped.

Carolingian theory established two, separate, ecclesiastical and secular spheres of authority within Christian society, one to lead the body and one the spirit. Monastic life was supported, and encouraged; while late Roman prohibitions against clerical participation in the army were repeated again and again. Among the thinkers and writers on issues of peace and peacemaking were [[Alcuin of York]], [[Smaragdus of Saint-Mihiel]], [[Paschasius Radbertus]], and [[Hincmar of Rheims]]. In keeping with their time, these offered various interpretations of peace as an inner tranquillity, legal guidelines to war and the curbing of military violence, or the image of peace as an ideal Christian state.

===The Cain Adomnan=== 
{{Main article|Cain Adomnan}}
The '''''Cáin Adomnáin''''' (Law of Adomnán), also known as the ''Lex Innocentium'' (Law of Innocents) was promulgated amongst a gathering of [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Dál Riata]]n and [[Picts|Pictish]] notables at the [[Synod of Birr]] in [[697 in Ireland|697]]. It is named after its initiator [[Adomnán of Iona]], ninth [[Abbot of Iona]] after St. [[Columba]]. As a successor of Columba of Iona, Adomnán had sufficient prestige to assemble a conference of ninety-one chieftains and clerics from Ireland, Dál Riata, and Pictland at Birr to promulgate the new law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://birrhistsoc.com/Hist.htm#cain "Cain Adomnan", Birr Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being the site of a significant monastery, associated with Saint [[Brendan of Birr]], Birr was close to the boundary between the Uí Néill-dominated northern half of Ireland, and the southern half, where the kings of Munster ruled. It therefore represented a neutral ground where the rival kings and clerics of north and south Ireland could meet.

This set of laws were designed, among other things, to guarantee the safety and immunity of various types of non-combatants in warfare.&lt;ref name=foghlam&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/britonsgaelsvikings/lawoftheinnocents/index.asp "Law of the Innocents", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002105207/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/britonsgaelsvikings/lawoftheinnocents/index.asp |date=2014-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws provided sanctions against the killing of children, clerics, clerical students and peasants on clerical lands; against rape, against impugning the chastity of a noblewoman, and prohibited women from having to take part in warfare. Various factors, including Marian devotion in seventh- and eighth-century Ireland, may have contributed to inspire Adomnán to introduce these laws. Many of these things were already crimes, under the Irish [[Early Irish Law|Brehon Laws]]. The law described both the secular fines which criminals must pay, and the ritual curses to which law-breakers were subject.

The indigenous [[Brehon Laws]] were committed to parchment about the 7th century, most likely by clerics. Most scholars now believe that the secular laws were not compiled independently of monasteries. Adomnan would have had access to the best legal minds of his generation.&lt;ref name=Grigg/&gt; Adomnan's ''Cain'' combined aspects of the traditional Brehon laws with an ecclesiastical approach. Following Ambrose and Augustine, bystanders who did nothing to prevent a crime were as liable as the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=Grigg&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/5817305/Aspects_of_the_Cain_Adomnans_Lex_Innocentium Grigg, Julianna. "Aspects of the Cain: Adomnan's Lex Innocentium", ''Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association'', Vol.1, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; "Stewards of the Law" collected the fine and paid it to the victim or next of kin.

Adomnán's initiative appears to be one of the first systematic attempts to lessen the savagery of warfare among Christians. In it he gave local expression, in the context of the Gaelic legal tradition, to a wider Christian movement to restrain violence.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travels-in-time.net/e/scotland12arteng.htm "Adomnán's Law of the Innocents",''Travels in Time'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was an early example of international law in that it was to be enforced in Ireland and northern Scotland, for it was the kings of those regions who were in attendance and signed as guarantors of the Law.

===Peace of God===
{{Main article|Peace and Truce of God}}
As Carolingian authority began to erode, especially on the outskirts of power, as in southern [[Gaul]], the episcopate took steps to protect their congregations and their holdings against the encroachments of local nobles. The Peace of God originated in the conciliar assemblies of the late Carolingian period. It began in [[Aquitaine]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and [[Languedoc]], areas where central authority had most completely fragmented.

A limited ''Pax Dei'' was decreed at the Synod of Charroux in 989 and spread to most of Western Europe over the next century,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Head, "The Development of the Peace of God in Aquitaine (970-1005)" ''Speculum'' ''74''.3 (July 1999), pp. 656-686.&lt;/ref&gt; surviving in some form until at least the thirteenth century.

A great crowd of many people (''populus'') gathered from the [[Poitou]], the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]], and neighboring regions. Relics of saints were displayed and venerated. The participation of large, enthusiastic crowds marks it as one of the first popular religious movements of the Middle Ages. In the early phase, the blend of relics and crowds, and enthusiasm stamped the movement with an exceptionally popular character.&lt;ref name=Landes&gt;[http://www.mille.org/people/rlpages/paxdei.html Landes, Richard. "Peace of God: ''Pax Dei'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Peace of God'' or ''Pax Dei'' was a proclamation issued by local clergy that decreed immunity from armed violence to noncombatants who could not defend themselves, beginning with the peasants (''agricolae'') and the clergy. It included the clergy and their possessions; the poor; women; peasants along with their tools, animals, mills, vineyards, and labor; and later pilgrims and merchants: in short, the vast majority of the medieval population who neither bore arms, nor were entitled to bear them. Children and  women were added to the early protections.  Merchants and their goods were added to the protected groups in a synod of 1033.

The ''Pax Dei'' prohibited nobles from invading churches, beating the defenseless, and burning houses. [[Excommunication]] would be the punishment for attacking or robbing a church, for robbing peasants or the poor of farm animals and for robbing, striking or seizing a priest or any man of the clergy ''who is not bearing arms''. Making compensation or reparations could circumvent the anathema of the Church.

After a lull in the first two decades of the eleventh century, the movement spread to the north with the support of king Robert, the Capetian. There, the high nobility sponsored Peace assemblies throughout Flanders, Burgundy, Champagne, Normandy, Amienois, and Berry.&lt;ref name=Landes/&gt; By 1041 the Peace had spread throughout France and had reached Flanders and Italy. From c.1018 the Peace was extended to [[Catalonia]] and reached [[Barcelona]], [[Girona]], and [[Urgel]]. Assemblies were repeated all over western Europe into the 1060s.

=== Truce of God ===
The '''Truce of God''' or ''Treuga Dei'' had its origin in Normandy in the city of Caen.&lt;ref name=Watkin&gt;[http://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/12600/document.pdf?sequence=1 Watkin, William Ward. "The Middle Ages: The Approach to the Truce of God", ''The Rice Institute Pamphlet'', Vol. XXIX, No. 4, October, 1942]&lt;/ref&gt; It dates from the eleventh century.&lt;ref name=Moeller/&gt;

While the Truce of God was a temporary suspension of hostilities, as distinct from the Peace of God which was permanent, the jurisdiction of the Truce of God was broader. The Peace of God prohibited fighting on Sundays, and ferial days (feast days on which people were not obliged to work). It was the sanctification of Sunday which gave rise to the Truce of God, for it had always been agreed not to do battle on that day and to suspend disputes in the law-courts.&lt;ref name=Moeller/&gt;

It confirmed permanent peace for all churches and their grounds, the monks, clerks and chattels; all women, pilgrims, merchants and their servants, cattle and horses; and men at work in the fields. For all others peace was required throughout Advent, the season of Lent, and from the beginning of the Rogation days until eight days after Pentecost.&lt;ref name=Watkin/&gt; This prohibition was subsequently extended to specific days of the week, viz., Thursday, in memory of the Ascension, Friday, the day of the Passion, and Saturday, the day of the Resurrection (council 1041). By the middle of the twelfth century the number of proscribed days was extended until there was left some eighty days for fighting.

The Truce soon spread from France to Italy and Germany; the oecumenical council of 1179 extended the institution to the whole Church by Canon xxi, "De treugis servandis", which was inserted in the collection of canon law, Decretal of Gregory IX, I, tit., "De treuga et pace".&lt;ref name=Moeller&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15068a.htm Moeller, Charles. "Truce of God." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15.

In his ''Summa Theologica'', Thomas Aquinas expands Augustine's arguments to define the conditions under which a war could be just:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0029.html The Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;
* War must occur for a good and just purpose rather than the pursuit of wealth or power.
* Just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state.
* Peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of Christianity|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|year=1984|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Crusades==
Religious thinkers and secular writers attempted to incorporate the controls of the Peace and Truce of God into the existing warrior ethic by “Christianizing” it into the Crusades and the cult of [[chivalry]]. Beginning in the 11th century, knighthood developed a religious character. Prospective knights underwent rigorous religious rituals in order to be initiated. An initiate had to fast, confess his sins, was given a symbolic bath, had his hair cut to represent humility, and he spent a night praying, his weapons upon an altar representing the dedication of his weapons to the Church and God. Advancements in metallurgy allowed inscriptions and pictures of holy symbols to be engraved on helmets, swords, shields, and other equipment. The symbols allowed for a physical reminder to knights and military men that God was supporting their efforts, providing protection to those soldiers as well as the assurance of a victory over their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/religiousobjects/knights "Religious Devotions of Knights", Medieval Literature and Material Culture, University of Michigan]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis IX of France]] is equally famous for his failed [[Seventh Crusade|crusades]] and for the settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace within Christian lands. He issued the first extant ordinance indefinitely prohibiting warfare in France, a text dating from January 1258 that outlawed guerrae omnes as well as arson, and disturbances to carts and to agricolae who work with carts or plows. Those who transgressed this prohibition were to be punished as peace-breakers (fractores pacis) by the king's officer and the bishop-elect of le Puy-en-Velay. Louis IX promulgated this text as a simple royal act on the basis of his authority as king.&lt;ref name=Firnhaber&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ems/summary/v023/23.1firnhaber-baker.html Firnhaber-Baker, Justine.

=== Alternatives to the Crusades ===
Christian missionary work was presented as a viable alternative to the violence of the crusaders. Majorcan Franciscan Blessed [[Ramon Llull]] (1232-1315) argued that the conversion of Muslims should be achieved through prayer, not through military force, and pressed for the study of Arabic to prepare potential missionaries. He traveled through Europe to meet with popes, kings, and princes, trying to establish special colleges to prepare them.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Richard Blum: Philosophy of Religion in the Renaissance.

[[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] laid a foundation for [[religious toleration]]. In ''De libero arbitrio'', he noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, "because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived." Gary Remer writes, "Like [[Cicero]], Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors." &lt;ref&gt;Remer, Gary, ''Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration'' (University Park: University of Pennsylvania Press 1996) p. 95 {{ISBN|0-271-02811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, "It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him." &lt;ref&gt;Froude, James Anthony

{{See also|School of Salamanca}}
[[Francisco de Vitoria]] was a Spanish Dominican philosopher, considered one of the founders of early international law. He was educated at the College Saint-Jacques in Paris, where he was influenced by the work of Desidarius Erasmus. In 1524, he held the Chair of theology at the [[University of Salamanca]], where a number of missionaries returning from the New World expressed concern regarding treatment of the indigenous inhabitants. In three lectures held between 1537 and 1539 Vitoria concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes. A supporter of the [[just war theory]], in ''De iure belli'' Fransico pointed out that the underlying predicate conditions for a "just war" were "wholly lacking in the Indies".&lt;ref name=Salas&gt;[http://legacy.avemarialaw.edu/lr/assets/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf Salas Jr., Victor M., "Francisco de Vitoria on the ''Ius Gentium'' and the American Indios", ''Ave Maria Law Review'', 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911001651/http://legacy.avemarialaw.edu/lr/assets/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf |date=2014-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitoria adopted from Aquinas the Roman law concept of ''ius gentium'' ("the law of nations"). His defense of American Indians was based on a Scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.

Dominican friar [[Pedro de Córdoba]] OP (c.1460–1525) was a Spanish missionary on the island of Hispaniola. He was first to denounce the system of forced labor known as the Encomienda, imposed on the native inhabitants.

Other important figures include [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] and [[Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur]]

=== Catholic Universalism ===
[[Émeric Crucé]] was a French monk who took the position that wars were the result of international misunderstandings and the domination of society by the warrior class, both of which could be reduced through commerce, as that brought people together.&lt;ref&gt;Oneal, John R., Oneal, Frances H., Maoz, Zeev; and Russett, Bruce. "The Liberal Peace: Interdependence, Democracy, and International Conflict, 1950-85", ''Journal of Peace Research'', Vol. 33, No. 1 (Feb., 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The genesis of the idea of a meeting of representatives of different nations to obtain by peaceful arbitration a settlement of differences has been traced to Crucé's 1623 work entitled ''The New Cyneas'', a discourse showing the opportunities and the means for establishing a general peace and liberty of conscience to all the world, addressed to the monarch and the sovereign princes of the time. He proposed that a city, preferably Venice, should be selected where all the Powers had ambassadors including all peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11596a.htm Smith, Walter George.

== Modern Church (to c.1945) ==

===Kulturkampf===
From 1871 to 1878, Chancellor Bismarck, who controlled both the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, launched the "[[Kulturkampf]]" in Prussia to reduce the power of the Catholic Church in public affairs, and keep Polish Catholics under control. Thousands of priests and bishops were harassed or imprisoned, with large fines and closures of Catholic churches and schools. German was declared to be the only official language, but in practice the Poles only adhered more closely to their traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard |last=Blanke |title= Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871–1900) | year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics were angry at his systematic attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ayako Bennette, ''Fighting for the Soul of Germany: The Catholic Struggle for Inclusion after Unification'' (Harvard U.P. 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Unanimous in their resistance, they organized themselves to fight back politically, using their strength in other states such as Catholic [[Bavaria]].  There was little or no violence, and the new Roman Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]] won a quarter of the seats in the ''Reichstag'' (Imperial Parliament), and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=David |last=Blackbourn | title=The Political Alignment of the Centre Party in Wilhelmine Germany: A Study of the Party's Emergence in Nineteenth-Century Württemberg | journal=Historical Journal | volume=18 | issue=4 |date=Dec 1975 | pages=821–850 | jstor = 2638516 | doi=10.1017/s0018246x00008906| url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3629315/blackbourn_polalignment.pdf?sequence=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The culture war gave secularists and socialists an opportunity to attack all religions, an outcome that distressed the Protestants, including Bismarck. After the death of [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1878 Bismarck opened negotiations with [[Pope Leo XIII]], which led to his gradual abandonment of the Kulturkampf in the early 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Christopher | last=Clark | title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947 | year=2006 | pages=568–576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caritas===
The first Caritas organisation was established by Lorenz Worthmann 9 November 1897 in Germany.&lt;ref name=CaritasDE&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.caritas-germany.org/57320.html |title=The History of Caritas in Germany |publisher=Caritas Deutschland |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020123903/http://www.caritas-germany.org/57320.html |archivedate=20 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national Caritas organisations were soon formed in Switzerland (1901) and the United States (Catholic Charities, 1910). It has since grown into "Caritas Internationalis", a confederation of 165 Roman Catholic relief, development and social service organizations operating in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.

Caritas Australia is involved in peacebuilding and reconciliation programs in Sri Lanka, The Philippines, Papua New Guinea and elsewhere, including Movimento de Defesa do Fevelado (MDF) which trains youth to be peacebuilders in São Paulo, Brazil in response to an increasing number of children becoming involved in drugs, organised crime and murders.

=== Fascism and Nazism ===
{{See also|Catholic resistance to Nazism}}

Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]] was one of the most firm and consistent of senior Catholics to oppose the Nazis. He and Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]], along with Cardinal Secretary of State [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], were part of a committee that drafted the 1937 encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' which warned Catholics that the growing Nazi ideology, which exalted one race over all others, was incompatible with Catholic Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Vidmar, John (2005). The Catholic Church Through the Ages. Paulist Press. {{ISBN|0-8091-4234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian Bishop Gfoellner of Linz had the encyclical read from the pulpits of his diocese. Bishop Gfoellner indicated that the dangers of German Catholics were also the dangers of Austrian Catholics: "What I wrote in my pastoral of January 21, 1933. 'It is impossible to be at once a good Catholic and a good National-Socialist,' is confirmed today."&lt;ref&gt;"Austrian Bishop's Plain Words: Can't Be Good Nazi and Good Catholic", Catholic Herald, 16 April 1937 [http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/16th-april-1937/3/austrian-bishops-plain-words-cant-be-good-nazi-and]&lt;/ref&gt; The release of ''Mit brennender Sorge'' precipitated an intensification of the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]].&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 381"&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W.

Sommer coordinated Catholic aid for victims of racial persecution&amp;nbsp;– giving spiritual comfort, food, clothing, and money. She gathered intelligence on the deportations of the Jews, and living conditions in concentration camps, as well as on SS firing squads, writing several reports on these topics from 1942.&lt;ref name="Margarete Sommer"&gt;[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Margarete Sommer]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgian Cardinal [[Jozef-Ernest van Roey]] was deeply opposed to [[Nazi Germany]], and once said, "With [[Germany]] we step many degrees downward and reach the lowest possible depths. We have a duty of conscience to combat and to strive for the defeat of these dangers...Reason and good sense both direct us towards confidence, towards resistance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772854,00.html "Prelates Against Hitler", ''TIME Magazine'', 15 December 1941]&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal van Roey intervened with the authorities to rescue Jews from the Nazis, and encouraged various institutions to aid Jewish children. One of his acts of rescue was to open a geriatric centre in which Jews were housed, at which kosher Jewish cooks would be required who could therefore be given special passes protecting them from deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; {{ISBN|0385 60100X}}; p.258&lt;/ref&gt; Papal Nuncio [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]] used diplomatic couriers, papal representatives and the [[Congregation of Notre-Dame de Sion|Sisters of Our Lady of Zion]] to transport and issue baptismal certificates, immigration certificates and visas – many of them forged – to Hungarian Jews.

Pallottine priest [[Franz Reinisch]] was beheaded SAC for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to Hitler.

Pope [[John XXIII]] (1958–63) set off a revolution in Roman Catholic thought and life that harkened back to an earlier period for its models and inspiration and brought the church into a new age. Through his policy of ''aggiornamento'' the pope opened the church to the modern world. Russell Hittinger describes the encyclical ''Pacem in Terris'' "as a kind of magna charta of the Catholic Church’s position on human rights and natural law".&lt;ref name=Hittinger&gt;[http://www.pass.va/content/dam/scienzesociali/pdf/acta18/acta18-hittinger.pdf Hittinger, Russell.

In the 1980s the Polish Solidarity movement grew out of labor strikes in the shipyard at Gdańsk. It was the first non-Communist Party-controlled trade union in a Warsaw Pact country, and became a broad social movement, using [[civil resistance]] to advance the causes of workers' rights and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Smolar, '"Self-limiting Revolution": Poland 1970-89', in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, pp. 127-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian [[Timothy Garton Ash]], observed shortly after Pope John Paul II's death, " ...without the Polish Pope, no Solidarity revolution in Poland in 1980; without Solidarity, no dramatic change in Soviet policy towards eastern Europe under Gorbachev; without that change, no [[Velvet Revolution|velvet revolutions]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/04/catholicism.religion13?INTCMP=SRCH |title=The first world leader |publisher=The Guardian |date=4 April 2005 |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially founded as the War Relief Services, the original purpose of [[Catholic Relief Services]] was to aid the refugees of war-torn Europe. The continuing support of the American Catholic helped CRS expand operations and in 1955 its name was officially changed to Catholic Relief Services. Over time the agency learned that to supply emergency aid without addressing the underlying problems might prolong conflict by providing new resources to the warring parties. In light of that, CRS has re-evaluated how best to focus their activities. In some countries CRS works on providing peace education for children in refugee camps or improving relations between refugees and local inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crs.org/peacebuilding/ "Peacebuilding", CRS]&lt;/ref&gt; It works in ninety-three countries in programs that address hunger, the provision of clean water, and health issues.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crs.org/about/history/|publisher=Catholic Relief Services|title=Catholic Relief Services History|year=2013|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papal diplomacy and arbitration==
The institutional church, and especially the papacy, long sought to use its authority to promote peace and justice, and like all human institutions, has met with mixed results. The first was primarily in the area of international diplomacy; the second was the realm of canon law and of theology, in attempts to define the limits of war and violence; and the third, among the [[Scholastics]] who investigated the boundaries of individual conscience.

For Medieval Europe, canon law served as a code of international law.&lt;ref name=Mattingly&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GxbnOGK9lMwC&amp;q=Papacy#v=snippet&amp;q=Papacy&amp;f=false Mattingly, Garrett. ''Renaissance Diplomacy'', 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Garret Mattingly, &lt;blockquote&gt;...since the eleventh century, the canonists had been pre-occupied with many of the problems which we think of as belonging to public international law, with the definition of sovereignty, with the sanctity of treaties, with the preservation of peace, with the rights of neutrals and noncombatants, and with the mitigation of the rigours of war.&lt;ref name=Mattingly/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the thirteenth century the Papacy became the first Western power to make a systematic use of diplomacy.&lt;ref name=Mattingly/&gt; 
The papacy, in fact, can be regarded as the originator of many of the most basic elements of modern diplomacy and international law: the protection and safe conduct of ambassadors, the secrecy of diplomatic negotiations, the insistence that treaties and their terms, once made, are to be strictly adhered to, the condemnation of violations, provisions for the release of prisoners and hostages and their humane treatment while in detention, the protection of exiles, aliens, and racial minorities, and the condemnation of unjust wars all derive from the papal position both as the leader of Christian society and as a force for international unity among secular states.

The papacy’s association of peace with justice that motivated its active arbitration in international relations also prompted its interest in another area associated with justice, that of ''jus'' or law. In the international sphere this brought the papacy to adopt the ancient Roman theories of the'' jus gentium'', a body of custom and agreements among peoples and sovereign princes, from the tenth century linked with the revival of Roman law in Italy. Closely associated with Roman law and custom was the notion of the just war, which was Christianized by [[Augustine|St. Augustine]] and handed on to the Middle Ages through [[Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore of Seville]].

*[[Pope Nicholas I]] (858-67) against the backdrop of Carolingian conquest Nicholas penned what is both a “classic summary of Christian faith and discipline” and a harsh condemnation of war. In his ''Reply to the Inquiry of the Bulgars,'' written in 866, Nicholas condemns conversion by force, branding war as a diabolical fraud. While Nicholas concedes that war may be permissible in cases of inescapable necessity, in self-defense, he warns that “in itself it is the devil’s work.” He advises that deserters (c. 22) and those who refuse to obey orders to kill (c. 23) be treated leniently and gives Boris examples of numerous martyrs who fled in the face of violence. In response to Boris’ question as to how Christians are to prepare for war, Nicholas answered that one must employ all the Christian works of mercy that make peace, affirm life, and negate the motives for and works of war.

In condemning World War I as a whole without taking sides, the pope did not reason in terms of traditional church teaching about just and unjust wars. He was able to see that modern technology — especially the novelty of aerial bombardment — had made traditional moral calculations and distinctions between combatants and noncombatants increasingly meaningless. Pope Benedict’s influence on his successors is clear in Pope Pius XII’s attempts to use diplomacy to forestall World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://easttexascatholic.com/2014/08/29/wartime-pontiff-started-tradition-of-papal-peacemaking/ Rocca, Francis X., "Wartime pontiff started tradition of papal peacemaking", Catholic News Service, August 29, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906222744/http://easttexascatholic.com/2014/08/29/wartime-pontiff-started-tradition-of-papal-peacemaking/ |date=September 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cause and effect are an important topic in all schools of [[Vedanta]]. These concepts are discussed in ancient and medieval texts of [[Hinduism]], and other Indian religions, using synonymous terms. Cause is referred to as ''{{IAST|kāraṇa}}'' (कारण),  ''nidana'' (निदान), ''hetu'' (हेतु) or ''mulam'' (मूलम्), while effect is referred to as ''{{IAST|kārya}}'' (कार्य), ''phala'' (फल), ''parinam'' (परिणाम) or ''Shungam'' (शुङ्ग).&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+cause&amp;trans=Translate cause], [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=effect&amp;script=&amp;direction=ES&amp;link=yes effect], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|authorlink=Paul Deussen|title=The System of the Vedanta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DI7cCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA264|year=2015|publisher=Reprint: KB (Original: 1912, Oxford)|isbn=978-1-5191-1778-6|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gadjin M.

==Causality==
{{See also|Samkhya#Causality|l1=Satkāryavāda|Ajativada}}

All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of ''[[Satkaryavada|Satkāryavāda]]'',&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/bhed-ved/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Bhedābheda Vedānta'']&lt;/ref&gt; which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are different views on the causal relationship and the nature of the empirical world from the perspective of metaphysical Brahman. The ''Brahma Sutras'', the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedanta,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt; as well as Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy,&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda" /&gt; support ''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Parinamavada]]'', the idea that the world is a real transformation (''parinama'') of Brahman.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}

Scholars disagree on the whether [[Adi Shankara]] and his [[Advaita Vedanta]] explained causality through ''vivarta''.&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=25-27}} According to Andrew Nicholson, instead of ''parinama-vada'', the competing causality theory is ''[[Vivartavada]]'', which says "the world, is merely an unreal manifestation (''vivarta'') of Brahman. Vivartavada states that although Brahman appears to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are unreal manifestation, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts". The advocates of this illusive, unreal transformation based causality theory, states Nicholson, have been the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} "Although the world can be described as conventionally real", adds Nicholson, "the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman’s effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated".&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;

However, other scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker disagree.{{refn|group=note|According to Hugh Nicholson, "the definitive study on the development of the concept of ''vivarta'' in Indian philosophy, and in Advaita Vedanta in particular, remains Hacker's ''Vivarta''.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|p=266 note 20, 167-170}}}} Hacker and others state that Adi Shankara did not advocate ''Vivartavada'', and his explanations are "remote from any connotation of illusion". According to these scholars, it was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman who gave a definition to ''Vivarta'', and it is Prakasatman's theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara's position.{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=25-27}} To Shankara, the word ''maya'' has hardly any terminological weight.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|p=266 note 21}} Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the ''vivarta-vada'' isn't Shankara's theory, that Shankara's ideas appear closer to ''parinama-vada'', and the ''vivarta'' explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later.&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;

According to Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta states that from "the standpoint of Brahman-experience and Brahman itself, there is no creation" in the absolute sense, all empirically observed creation is relative and mere transformation of one state into another, all states are provisional and a cause-effect driven modification.{{Sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=40-43}}

==Nimitta kāraṇa and Upādāna kāraṇa==
Two sorts of causes are recognised:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lipner | first=Julius J. | authorlink=Julius J. Lipner|title=Ancient Banyan: an Inquiry into the Meaning of `Hinduness' | journal=Religious Studies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=32 | issue=01 | year=1996 | pages=109–126 | doi=10.1017/s0034412500024100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST|Nimitta kāraṇa}}, the [[efficient cause]].
# {{IAST|Upādāna kāraṇa}}, the [[material cause]].

=={{IAST|kārya-kāraṇa ananyatva}}==
Advaita states that effect ({{IAST|''kārya''}}) is non-different from cause ({{IAST|''kāraṇa''}}), but the cause is different from the effect:
:{{IAST|''kārya''}} is not different from {{IAST|''kāraṇa''}}; however {{IAST|''kāraṇa''}} is different from {{IAST|''kārya''}}

This principle is called {{IAST|''kārya-kāraṇa ananyatva''}}.

===Effect is not different from cause===
When the cause is destroyed, the effect will no longer exist. For example, cotton cloth is the effect of the cotton threads, which is the material cause. Without threads there will be no cotton cloth. Without cotton there will be no thread.

According to Swami Sivananda, in his comments on the {{IAST|Brahmasūtra-Bhāṣya}} 2.1.9, Adi Shankara describes this as follows:
{{quote|Despite the non-difference of cause and effect, the effect has its self in the cause but not the cause in the effect.&lt;br&gt;The effect is of the nature of the cause and not the cause the nature of the effect.&lt;br&gt;Therefore the qualities of the effect cannot touch the cause.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/bs_2/bs_2.1.03.html |title=Brahma Sutras by Swami Sivananda |publisher=Swami-krishnananda.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110612173736/http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/bs_2/bs_2.1.03.html| archivedate= 12 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|{{IAST|''ananyatve'pi kāryakāraṇayoḥ kāryasya kāraṇātmatvaṃ na tu kāraṇasya kāryātmatvaṃ''}}}}}}

The practice of '''charity''' means the voluntary giving of help to those in need, as a [[humanitarian]] act.

== Etymology ==
The word ''charity'' originated in late [[Old English]] to mean a "[[Christian]] love of one's fellows,"&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of English |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=293 |date=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up until at least the beginning of the [[20th century]], this meaning remained synonymous with ''charity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of current English |date=1912 |pages=137–138 |url=https://archive.org/stream/conciseoxforddic00fowlrich#page/136/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Charity, or Christian Love. A sermon, etc |date=1837 |last=Crisp |first=Thomas Steffe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7fOBKf1YPEC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Christian love : or charity an essential element of true Christian character |date=1850 |last=Wise |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Wise (author) |url=https://archive.org/details/christianloveorc00wise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Charity and Its Fruits: Or, Christian Love as Manifested in the Heart and Life |date=1852 |orig-year=1738 |last=Edwards |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Edwards (theologian) |url=https://archive.org/details/christianloveorc00wise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this original meaning, ''charity'' is etymologically linked to Christianity, with the word originally entering into the [[English language]] through the [[Old French]] word "''charité''", which was derived from the [[Latin]] "''caritas''", a word commonly used in the [[Vulgate]] [[New Testament]] to translate the Greek word ''[[agape]]'' ({{linktext|ἀγάπη}}), a distinct form of "''[[Love (religious views)#Christian|love]]''"&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/charity |date=2018 |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |title=Charity origin and meaning |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see the article: [[Charity (virtue)]]).

Over time, the meaning of ''charity'' has shifted from one of "Christian love" to that of "providing for those in need; generosity and giving,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Charity |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/charity |publisher=Merriam-Webster |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt; a transition which began with the Old French word ''charité''.&lt;ref name="etymonline"/&gt; Thus, while the older [[Douay-Rheims Bible|Douay-Rheims]] and [[King James Version|King James]] versions of the [[Bible]] translate instances of "''agape''" (such as those that appear in [[1 Corinthians 13]]) as "''charity''", modern English versions of the Bible typically translate "''agape''" as  "''love.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm |title=1 Corinthians 13:1 |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charitable giving is the act of giving money, goods or time to the unfortunate, either directly or by means of a [[charitable trust]] or other worthy cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|date=2016-10-01|title=Institutional Equivalence: How Industry and Community Peers Influence Corporate Philanthropy|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|journal=Organization Science|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1325–1341|doi=10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|issn=1047-7039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charitable giving as a religious act or duty is referred to as almsgiving or alms. The name stems from the most obvious expression of the [[virtue]] of charity; giving the recipients of it the means they need to survive. The impoverished, particularly those widowed or orphaned, and the ailing or injured, are generally regarded as the proper recipients of charity. The people who cannot support themselves and lack outside means of support sometimes become "[[Begging|beggars]]", directly soliciting aid from strangers encountered in public.

Some groups regard charity as being distributed towards other members from within their particular group. Although giving to those nearly connected to oneself is sometimes called charity—as in the saying "Charity begins at home"—normally charity denotes giving to those not related, with [[filial piety]] and like terms for supporting one's family and friends.  Indeed, treating those related to the giver as if they were strangers in need of charity has led to the figure of speech "as cold as charity"—providing for one's relatives as if they were strangers, without affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Alison|title=As 'cold as charity'?:* poverty, equity and the charitable trust|journal=Legal Studies|volume=20|issue=2|pages=222–240|doi=10.1111/j.1748-121X.2000.tb00141.x|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most forms of charity are concerned with providing basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, healthcare and shelter, but other actions may be performed as charity:  visiting the imprisoned or the homebound, ransoming captives, educating orphans, even social movements. Donations to causes that benefit the unfortunate indirectly, such as donations to fund cancer research, are also charity.

With regards to religious aspects, the recipient of charity may offer to pray for the benefactor. In medieval Europe, it was customary to feast the poor at the funeral in return for their prayers for the deceased.  Institutions may commemorate benefactors by displaying their names, up to naming buildings or even the institution itself after the benefactors.  If the recipient makes material return of more than a token value, the transaction is normally not called charity.

In the past{{which|date=March 2016}} century, many [[charitable organization]]s have created a "charitable model" in which donators give to conglomerates give to recipients. Examples of this include the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Make a Wish Foundation]] (John Cena holds the title for most wishes granted by a single individual, with over 450 wishes) and the [[World Wildlife Fund]]. Today some charities have modernized, and allow people to donate online, through websites such as [[JustGiving]]. Originally charity entailed the benefactor directly giving the goods to the receiver.  This practice was continued by some individuals, for example, "[[CNN Heroes|CNN Hero]]" [[Sal Dimiceli]], and service organizations, such as the [[Jaycees]]. With the rise of more [[social peer-to-peer processes]], many charities are moving away from the charitable model and starting to adopt this more direct donator to recipient approach. Examples of this include [[Global Giving]] (direct funding of community development projects in developing countries), [[DonorsChoose]] (for US-based projects), [http://purecharity.org/ PureCharity], [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] (funding loans administered by microfinance organizations in developing countries) and [[Zidisha]] (funding individual microfinance borrowers directly).

Institutions evolved to carry out the labor of assisting the poor, and these institutions, called [[Charitable organization|charities]], provide the bulk of charitable giving today, in terms of monetary value.  These include [[orphanage]]s, [[food bank]]s, [[religious institute]]s dedicated to care of the poor, [[hospital]]s, organizations that visit the homebound and imprisoned, and many others.  Such institutions allow those whose time or inclination does not lend themselves to directly care for the poor to enable others to do so, both by providing money for the work and supporting them while they do the work.  Institutions can also attempt to more effectively sort out the actually needy from those who fraudulently claim charity.  Early Christians particularly recommended the care of the unfortunate to the charge of the local bishop.

There have been examinations of who gives more to charity.  One study conducted in the United States found that as a percentage of income, charitable giving increased as income decreased.  The poorest fifth of Americans, for example, gave away 4.3% of their income, while the wealthiest fifth gave away 2.1%.  In absolute terms, this was an average of $453 on an average income of $10,531, compared to $3,326 on an income of $158,388.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009253657_charity23.html "America's poor are its most generous donors"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527080829/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009253657_charity23.html |date=May 27, 2009 }}, by Frank Greve, McClatchy Newspapers as appears in the ''Seattle Times'', published May 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Critics of charitable giving contend that simply transferring gifts or money to disadvantaged people has negative long-term effects.  The online microlending organization [[Zidisha]] published a blog post which contended that providing handouts can actually cause harm by incentivizing lack of progress out of poverty, and by creating a dependence mentality among recipients.  According to Zidisha, microfinance lending is a better alternative than donations, because it incentivizes successful investment of the funds and creates a can-do mentality on the part of recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-kurnia/about-to-send-a-donation_b_4623503.html|title = About to send a donation? Think twice. |date = January 18, 2014|publisher = Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A philosophical critique of charity can be found in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man]]'', where he calls it "a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution . . . usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to tyrannise over [the poor's] private lives", as well as a remedy that prolongs the "disease" of poverty, rather than curing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Oscar Wilde |title=The Soul of Man under Socialism |year=1891 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilde's thoughts are cited with approval by [[Slavoj Žižek]], and the Slovenian thinker adds his description of the effect of charity on the charitable:

When, confronted with the starving child, we are told: "For the price of a couple of cappuccinos, you can save her life!", the true message is: "For the price of a couple of cappuccinos, you can continue in your ignorant and pleasurable life, not only not feeling any guilt, but even feeling good for having participated in the struggle against suffering!"
|{{cite book |author=Slavoj Žižek |title=[[Living in the End Times]] |publisher=Verso |year=2010 |page=117}}}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], in his [[The Condition of the Working Class in England|1845 treatise]] on the condition of the working class in [[England]], points out that charitable giving, whether by governments or individuals, is often seen by the givers as a means to conceal suffering that is unpleasant to see. Engels quotes from a letter to the editor of an English newspaper who complains that

::streets are haunted by swarms of beggars, who try to awaken the pity of the passers-by in a most shameless and annoying manner, by exposing their tattered clothing, sickly aspect, and disgusting wounds and deformities. I should think that when one not only pays the poor-rate, but also contributes largely to the charitable institutions, one had done enough to earn a right to be spared such disagreeable and impertinent molestations.

The English bourgeoisie, Engels concludes,

::is charitable out of self-interest; it gives nothing outright, but regards its gifts as a business matter, makes a bargain with the poor, saying: "If I spend this much upon benevolent institutions, I thereby purchase the right not to be troubled any further, and you are bound thereby to stay in your dusky holes and not to irritate my tender nerves by exposing your misery. You shall despair as before, but you shall despair unseen, this I require, this I purchase with my subscription of twenty pounds for the infirmary!" It is infamous, this charity of a Christian bourgeois!&lt;ref&gt;''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' (1845), Penguin edition (1987), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] published a report in 2012 called "Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why", which criticised the phenomenon of governments funding charities which then lobby the government for changes which the government wanted all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iea.org.uk/publications/research/sock-puppets-how-the-government-lobbies-itself-and-why/|title=Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why|author=|date=|website=Institute of Economic Affairs|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charity in Christianity ==
In medieval Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, Latin [[Christendom]] underwent a charitable revolution.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Brodman, ''Charity and Religion in Medieval Europe'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Rich patrons founded many leprosaria and hospitals for the sick and poor. New [[confraternities]] and religious orders emerged with the primary mission of engaging in intensive charitable work. Historians debate the causes. Some argue that this movement was spurred by economic and material forces, as well as a burgeoning urban culture. Other scholars argue that developments in spirituality and devotional culture were central. For still other scholars, medieval charity was primarily a way to elevate one's social status and affirm existing hierarchies of power.&lt;ref&gt;Adam J. Davis, "The Social and Religious Meanings of Charity in Medieval Europe" ''History Compass'' (2014) 12#12 pp 935–950&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tzedakah in Judaism ==
[[File:Jewish cemetery Otwock Karczew Anielin IMGP6721.jpg|thumb|Sandstone vestige of a Jewish gravestone depicting a [[Tzedakah]] box (pushke). [[Jewish cemetery]] in [[Otwock]] (Karczew-Anielin), Poland.]]
In [[Judaism]], ''[[tzedakah]]''—a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify ''charity''&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Hayim Halevy Donin; "To Be A Jew". Basic Books, New York; 1972, pp. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;—refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just.&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1079/jewish/The-Myth-of-Charity.htm; Tzedakah vs The Myth of Charity]; by [[Yanki Tauber]]; Retrieved 03-11-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is commanded by the [[Torah]] and not voluntary, the practice is not technically an act of charity; such a concept is virtually nonexistent in Jewish tradition. Jews give tzedakah, which can take the form of money, time and resources to the needy, out of "righteousness" and "justice" rather than benevolence, generosity, or charitableness.&lt;ref name="chabad" /&gt; The [[Torah]] requires that 10 percent of a Jew's income be allotted to righteous deeds or causes, regardless if the receiving party is rich or poor.

== Zakat and Sadaqa in Islam ==
In [[Islam]] there are two methods of charity.

One called [[Zakat]], the other is called [[Sadaqah|Sadaqa]].

Zakat is one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars]] upon which the Muslim religion is based, where 2.5% of one's saving is compulsory to be given as Zakat per Islamic calendar year, provided that the saving is beyond the threshold limit, called [[Nisab]], usually determined by the religious authority.

Sadaqa is voluntary charity or contribution. Sadaqa can be given using money, personal items, time or other resources. There is no minimum or maximum requirement for Sadaqa. Even smiling to other people is considered a Sadaqa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fortyessentialhadith.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/hadith-31-your-smile-to-your-brother-is-sadaqa/|title=Hadith 31: Your Smile to Your Brother is a Sadaqah|date=2011-05-09|website=Forty Essential Hadith|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dāna in Indian religions ==
The practice of charity is called ''[[Dāna]]'' or ''Daana'' in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It is the virtue of generosity or giving.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole (1991), Moral Issues in Six Religions, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0-435-30299-3}}, pages 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krma365&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 365–366.&lt;/ref&gt; Dāna has been defined in traditional texts, state Krishnan and Manoj,&lt;ref name=kandm3&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 361–382; [http://drsirswal.webs.com/documents/Indian%20Psychology%20of%20values.pdf summary of the article]&lt;/ref&gt; as “any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return”. [[Karna]], [[Mahabali]] and [[Harishchandra]] are heroes also known for giving charity.

The earliest known discussion of charity as a virtuous practice, in Indian texts, is in [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name=rthg&gt;[[s:The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 117|The Rig Veda]], Mandala 10, Hymn 117, [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]] (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rhdana&gt;R Hindery, Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol 2, Number 1, page 105.&lt;/ref&gt; According to other ancient texts of Hinduism, dāna can take the form of feeding or giving to an individual in distress or need.&lt;ref name=ganguli311&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/310/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LIX] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, pages 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.&lt;ref name=ganguli&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/306/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LVIII] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Published by P.C.

Reddy (2014), Hindu Pilgrimage: Shifting Patterns of Worldview of Srisailam in South India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-65997-0}}, page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dāna leads to one of the [[paramita|perfections]] (''pāramitā''). This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tsong-kha-pa |authorlink=Je Tsongkhapa |editor=Joshua Cutler |editor2=Guy Newland |others= |title= The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, Volume II |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2002|publisher= Snow Lion |location= Canada |language= |isbn= 1-55939-168-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}: 236, 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records, such as those by the Persian historian Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī who visited India in early 11th century, suggest ''dāna'' has been an ancient and medieval era practice among Indian religions.&lt;ref name=birunihind&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 2), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000157.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter LXVII, On Alms and how a man must spend what he earns], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), pages 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60513-7}}, pages 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12487">'''''Clausula rebus sic stantibus''''' ([[Latin]] for "things thus standing"), in [[public international law]], is the [[legal doctrine]] allowing for a [[treaty]] to become inapplicable because of a fundamental change of circumstances. The doctrine is essentially an "escape clause" to the general rule of ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (promises must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the doctrine is a risk to the security of treaties, as its scope is relatively unconfined, the conditions in which it may be invoked must be carefully noted.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Malanczuk, ''Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law'', 7th rev. edn (London: Routledge, 1997), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in international law==

The doctrine is part of [[customary international law]] but is also provided for in the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], under Article 62 (Fundamental Change of Circumstance). Although the doctrine is not mentioned by name,&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 62 provides the only justifications for its invocation: the circumstances that existed at the time of the conclusion of the treaty were indeed objectively essential to the obligations of treaty (sub-paragraph A), and the instance for the change of circumstances has had a radical effect on the obligations of the treaty (sub-paragraph B).

If the parties to a treaty had contemplated for the occurrence of the changed circumstances, the doctrine does not apply and the provision remains in effect. ''Clausula rebus sic stantibus'' relates to changed circumstances only if they had never been contemplated by the parties. That principle is clarified in the [[Cod Wars|Fisheries Jurisdiction Case]] (''United Kingdom v. Iceland'', 1973).

Although it is clear that a fundamental change of circumstances might justify terminating or modifying a treaty, the unilateral [[denunciation]] of a treaty is prohibited. A [[party (law)|party]] does not have the right to denounce a treaty unilaterally. (However, that has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==History==
A key figure in the formulation of ''clausula rebus sic stantibus'' was the Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]] (1563–1616), who is generally credited for coining the maxim ''omnis conventio intelligitur rebus sic stantibus'' ('every convention is understood with circumstances as they stand').&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 13, citing ''De iure belli libri tres'', lib. 111, cap. XIV.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss legal expert [[Emer de Vattel]] (1714–1767) was the next key contributor. Vattel promoted the view that 'every body bound himself for the future only on the stipulation of the presence of the actual conditions' and so 'with a change of the condition also the relations originating from the situation would undergo a change'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] came to reject the doctrine of ''clausula rebus sic standibus'', but Vattel's thinking continued to influence international law, not least because it helped reconcile 'the antagonism between the static nature of the law and the dynamism of international life'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; While individual cases invoking the doctrine were much disputed, the doctrine itself was little questioned. Its provision in the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] established the doctrine firmly but not without dispute as 'a norm of international law'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* According to [[Polybius]], in 211 BC, [[Lyciscus of Acarnania]] argued that the [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacedaemonians]] should abandon their treaty with the [[Aetolian League]] because of fundamentally changed circumstances. That is perhaps the earliest recorded example of the principle of ''rebus sic stantibus'' at work.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elizabeth I of England]] sought to amend the 1585 [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] on the grounds of fundamentally changed circumstances, but her efforts have not been well regarded by modern jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 'classic' case for the doctrine, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] attempted to change the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] on military shipping in the Black Sea. That happened in connection with the Treaty of London (1871), partly by invoking ''clausula rebus sic stantibus''. One important outcome was the insistence by other parties that unilateral termination of a treaty was not legal on those grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 59 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] made [[Batumi]] a [[free port]]. In 1886, Russia terminated the arrangement, partly on the grounds of a fundamental change in circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1881, the [[United States]] attempted to end the [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]] with the [[United Kingdom]]. Various arguments were advanced, including ''clausula rebus sic stantibus''. Although that principle ultimately did not apply in the resolution of the case, it is noteworthy as the first time that the US invoked the principle, as it had previously been opposed to it. The US went on to cite the doctrine again in its arguments for the revision of the [[Treaty of London (1915)]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 1908 [[Bosnian crisis]], [[Austria-Hungary]] renounced its rights and obligations under Article 25 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]]. Austria-Hungary's arguments have been seen as an invocation of fundamentally-changed circumstances. Moreover, despite protests at its actions, Austria-Hungary succeeded, arguably setting a precedent for the use of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 7 February 1923, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] issued an advisory opinion on a case between [[French Third Republic|France]] and the United Kingdom on the application to [[British nationals]] of [[French nationality law|French nationality decrees]] issued by the capitulatory regimes in [[Tunis]] and [[Morocco]]. France cited a fundamental change of circumstances, and the case seems to be the first example of a state invoking ''rebus sic stantibus'' before an international court. However, the states settled before the court was required to issue a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1924, [[Norway]] dissolved its 1907 treaty with [[Sweden]] that had arisen from the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]], citing changed circumstances including the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and Norway's entry into the [[League of Nations]]. Since the 1907 treaty was also time-limited, the case has been seen as a precedent for ''rebus sic stantibus'' applying not only to indefinite treaties.
* In 1926, China came to terms with Belgium after its efforts to denounce the Sino-Belgian Pact (1865), citing fundamentally changed circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 1923, France moved its customs office to [[Gex, Ain]], provoking the 'Freezones Controversy' with Switzerland. The matter was brought before the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], and France invoked ''rebus sic stantibus'', but Switzerland argued that the doctrine did not apply in respect of territorial rights. In 1932, the court found in favour of Switzerland on the basis of fact, but it did not reject that ''rebus sic stantibus'' might be a valid basis for France's argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcourts.com/pcij/eng/decisions/1929/1929.08.19_savoy_gex.htm Case of the Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex], Permanent Court of International Justice,  Parties: France &amp; Switzerland, August 19th, 1929, Initiated March 29th, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second time ''rebus sic stantibus'' had been argued before an international court.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Command–query separation''' ('''CQS''') is a principle of [[Imperative programming|imperative]] [[computer programming]]. It was devised by [[Bertrand Meyer]] as part of his pioneering work on the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel programming language]].

It states that every [[Method (computer science)|method]] should either be a ''command'' that performs an action, or a ''query'' that returns data to the caller, but not both. In other words, ''Asking a question should not change the answer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Meyer|first=Bertrand|title=Eiffel: a language for software engineering|url=http://laser.inf.ethz.ch/2012/slides/Meyer/eiffel_laser_2012.pdf|page=22|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, methods should return a value only if they are [[Referential transparency (computer science)|referentially transparent]] and hence possess no [[Side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s.

==Connection with design by contract==
Command–query separation is particularly well suited to a [[design by contract]] (DbC) methodology, in which the design of a [[Computer program|program]] is expressed as [[Assertion (software development)|assert]]ions embedded in the [[source code]], describing the [[State (computer science)|state]] of the program at certain critical times.  In DbC, assertions are considered design annotations – not program logic – and as such, their execution should not affect the program state. CQS is beneficial to DbC because any value-returning method (any query) can be called by any assertion without fear of modifying program state.

In theoretical terms, this establishes a measure of sanity, whereby one can reason about a program's state without simultaneously modifying that state. In practical terms, CQS allows all assertion checks to be bypassed in a working system to improve its performance without inadvertently modifying its behaviour. CQS may also prevent the occurrence of certain kinds of [[heisenbug]]s.

==Broader impact on software engineering==
Even beyond the connection with design by contract, CQS is considered by its adherents to have a simplifying effect on a program, making its states (via queries) and state changes (via commands) more comprehensible.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

CQS is well-suited to the [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] methodology, but can also be applied outside of object-oriented programming.  Since the separation of side effects and return values is not inherently object-oriented, CQS can be profitably applied to any programming paradigm that requires reasoning about side effects.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Command query responsibility segregation==
Command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) applies the CQS principle by using separate ''Query'' and ''Command'' objects to ''retrieve'' and ''modify'' data, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Greg|title=CQRS Documents|url=http://cqrs.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/cqrs_documents.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Martin|title=CQRS|url=http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html|accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
CQS can make it more difficult to implement [[Reentrant (subroutine)|reentrant]] and [[Multithreading (software)|multithreaded]] software correctly. This usually occurs when a non-thread-safe pattern is used to implement the command–query separation.

Here is a simple example of a pattern that breaks CQS principles but is useful for multi-threaded software. It breaks CQS principles because the function both mutates state and returns it:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
private int x;
public int increment_and_return_x() {
  lock x;   // by some mechanism
  x = x + 1;
  int x_copy = x;
  unlock x; // by some mechanism
  return x_copy;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a CQS-compliant pattern. However, it is safely usable only in single-threaded applications. In a multithreaded program, there is a race condition in the caller, between where &lt;code&gt;increment()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;value()&lt;/code&gt; would be called:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
private int x;
public int value() {
  return x;
}
void increment() {
  x = x + 1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Even in single-threaded programs, it is sometimes arguably significantly more convenient to have a method that is a combined query and command. [[Martin Fowler]] cites the &lt;code&gt;pop()&lt;/code&gt; method of a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Martin|title=CommandQuerySeparation|url=http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html|accessdate=5 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Committee for Civil Liberties and Legal Aid''' in short Civil Liberties Committee was a forum in Bangladesh formed by the members of civil society to restore the civil liberties and provide legal aid to the dissenting population of the country who were the victims of [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/11/10/d61110013527.htm|title= Enayetullah's first death anniversary today|publisher=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/in-the-shadows-under-the-gaze/|title= In the shadows, under the gaze|publisher=Dhaka Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by eminent poet [[Sikandar Abu Zafar]], the committee consisted a total of 33 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jugantor.com/old/sub-editorial/2014/02/23/71683|title= বিচারবহির্ভূত হত্যাকাণ্ডের ভয়াবহ নতুন পর্যায়|publisher=Daily Jugantor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forum was floated on 31 March 1974 through a press briefing at the National Press Club of capital city [[Dhaka]]. The committee was highly critical to the government and many of its member were either arrested of were compelled to go underground.

==Background==
After the [[Liberation War of Bangladesh]], [[Awami League]] formed the government ignoring the call from most of the political parties to form a government of national consensus. Soon after consolidating power, [[Awami League]] government established a new paramilitary force [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]] in March 1972 which was blamed for crushing anti-government protests brutally and getting engaged in deadly confrontations with the opposition parties.

===Political killing===
By 1973, according to President of [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal]] Major [[M. A. Jalil]], the number of politically motivated murders reached 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/164645464/Rising-Bangladesh-Unrest-Marked-by-2-000-Killings-and-The-Role-of-Sheikh-Mujibur-Rahman|title= Rising Bangladesh unrest marked by 2000 killings|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prominent politicians [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] Vice-President Mosharraf Hossain, [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] supported Krishak League leader Siddiq Master, Manikganj [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] Joint Secretary Sadat Hossain Badal, [[Jahangirnagar University]] Central Students' Union general secretary Borhanuddin Rokon were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prothom-alo.com/opinion/article/35332/%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B7%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%89%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8-%E0%A6%93-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BF|title= রক্ষীবাহিনী|publisher=Daily Prothom Alo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 18-years-old boy Shahjahan Sharif from Naria upazila of [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]] went missing from the Rakkhi Bahini custody in January 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Moudud, ''Era of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman'', First published 1983, p. 69, University Press Limited, Dhaka, {{ISBN|978-984-506-226-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disappearance of Shahjahan made his family to move to court and filed a case against [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]]. Justice Debesh Chandra Battacharya after hearing both the parties in his historical verdict said that,

{{quote|the irregularity and very unsatisfactory manner of the handling of the matter by the Rakkhi Bahini has created a situation that urgently calls for an effective action on the part of the authorities to clear the cloud and create a sense of assurance in the mind of the people.}}

===Special Power Act, 1974===
In February 1974, the parliament passed Special Power Act 1974 to make provisions for preventive detentions.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Moudud, ''Era of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman'', First published 1983, p. 180, University Press Limited, Dhaka, {{ISBN|978-984-506-226-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3 of the Special Power Act provided for preventive detentions. A person was to be detained if the Government was satisfied that it was necessary to do so.

===Ramna massacre===
''See More [[1974 Ramna massacre]]''

[[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] called for a meeting to protest the authoritarian rule of the Government on 17 March 1974. The meeting was followed by a march to surround the resident of Home Minister [[Muhammad Mansur Ali]] after the rally which subsequently went violent.

The incident claimed at least fifty lives when the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini was called on and eventually opened fire targeting the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Mahiuddin, ''জাসদের উত্থান ও পতনঃ অস্থির সময়ের রাজনীতি'', First published 2015, p. 111, Prothoma Prakashani, [[Dhaka]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of cases were filed against [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] politicians. [[A. S. M. Abdur Rab]], [[Shajahan Siraj]] and almost all the bigwigs of the party landed in jail. [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]] started a drive to hunt down all the supporters of Jasad after that. Police and Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini personnel raided the office of ''Ganakantha'' and arrested the editor, [[Al Mahmud]].

==Key personnel==

The committee was formed with 33 members of civil society. They were from different background that included teachers, engineers, lawyers, doctors, writers, poets and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jugantor.com/old/sub-editorial/2014/02/23/71683|title= বিচারবহির্ভূত হত্যাকাণ্ডের ভয়াবহ নতুন পর্যায়|publisher=Daily Jugantor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Mahiuddin, ''জাসদের উত্থান ও পতনঃ অস্থির সময়ের রাজনীতি'', First published 2015, p. 111, Prothoma Prakashani, [[Dhaka]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting of the committee was held at the National Press Club in [[Dhaka]] on 31 March 1974 and was presided over by Professor [[Ahmed Sharif]].

The prominent figures of the committee are:
 
* [[Sikandar Abu Zafar]] as President
* [[Mirza Ghulam Hafiz]] in charge of Legal analysis
* Professor [[Ahmed Sharif]] in charge of Publication
* Vinod Das Gupta in charge of Investigation
* Abdul Huq in charge of Legal aid
* [[A.Z.M. Enayetullah Khan]] as Treasurer
* [[Moudud Ahmed]] as general secretary
* Syed Zafar as Assistant general secretary
* [[Jasimuddin]] 
* [[Badruddin Umar]] 
* [[Muhammad Habibur Rahman]] 
* [[Ahmed Sofa]] 
* Mohiuddin Alamgir 
* Kamrunnahar Laili

==Demands==
The committee came under the same umbrella on some demands:&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Moudud, ''Era of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman'', First published 1983, p. 263, University Press Limited, Dhaka, {{ISBN|978-984-506-226-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Withdrawal of laws not consistent with the constitution and termination of attack on fundamental rights by the various government forces and administrative machineries
# Immediate repeal of undemocratic Special Powers Act
# Repeal of the Rakkhi Bahini Act and withdrawal of troops who were all engaged in brutal activities
# Release of all political prisoners detained in different jails of the country
# Restoration of freedom of press and release of all newspaper workers including [[Al Mahmud]]

==Activities==
The committee was vocal against the repression of the government and the offences of the government forces. Several meetings and dialogues were held under the banner of the committee.

One of the most discussed event of the committee was a large public meeting which was held in front of national mosque Baitul Muqarram in Dhaka to express solidarity with the suffering people. The committee held the [[Awami League]] responsible for the [[Bangladesh famine of 1974]].

Veteran journalist and a member of the committee, [[A.Z.M. Enayetullah Khan]], was highly critical to the government excesses in handling of the opposition parties and dissenting groups and wrote a series of editorials against the government. He was subsequently arrested for his articles. General Secretary of the committee [[Moudud Ahmed]] was also arrested for being critical to the government and providing legal aid to the victims of government agencies. 

[[Ahmed Sofa]] was chased by [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Bangabandhu]]'s son [[Sheikh Kamal]] in New Market area of [[Dhaka]] for criticising the government. He later went into hiding at [[Comilla]] [[Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development|BARD]].

==DAD curve==
The DAD (Dynamic aggregate demand) curve is in the long run a horizontal line called the EAD (Equilibrium aggregate Demand) curve.
The short run DAD curve at flexible [[Exchange rate|exchange rates]] is given by the equation:

&lt;math&gt;\pi=\mu-bY+bY_{-1}+h(\Delta i^W+\Delta \epsilon^e)&lt;/math&gt;

The short run DAD curve at fixed exchange rates is given by the equation:

'''Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal''' (27 November 1794, [[Xanten]] – 12 October 1866, [[Halle an der Saale|Halle]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[botanist]].

He studied in [[Berlin]], in 1819 becoming [[curator]] of the [[Botanical Garden in Berlin|Royal Herbarium]]. He was a professor of [[botany]] and director of the Botanical Gardens at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg]] from 1833 until his death in 1866.

The genus ''[[Schlechtendalia (plant)|Schlechtendalia]]'' (Asteraceae), from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, was named in his honor.

He was editor of the botanical journal ''Linnaea'' (from 1826), and with [[Hugo von Mohl]] (1805-1872), was publisher of the ''Botanischen Zeitung'' (from 1843).

He conducted important investigations of the then largely unknown [[Flora (plants)|flora]] of [[Mexico]], carried out in conjunction with [[Adelbert von Chamisso]] (1781-1838), and based on specimens collected by [[Christian Julius Wilhelm Schiede]] (1798-1836) and [[Ferdinand Deppe]] (1794-1861).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?mode=details&amp;id=84028 HUH Index of Botanists] Schlechtendal &amp; Chamisso&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=record_ID:siris_sil_373435 Collections Search Center] De plantis Mexicanis a G. Schiede / collectis nuntium adfert D.F.L. de Schlechtendal&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlechtendal was a critic of [[Darwinism]] but accepted a limited form of [[evolution]]. He advocated a form [[common descent]] of "some groups of very similar species, which also inhabit a limited area".&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1988). ''The Comparative Reception of Darwinism''.

DSDs are medical conditions involving the way the reproductive system develops from infancy (and before birth) through young adulthood. There are several types of DSDs and their effect on the external and internal reproductive organs varies greatly.

A frequently-used social and medical adjective for people with DSDs is "intersex".&lt;ref name="un-2016"&gt;{{Cite| last1 = UN Committee against Torture | author1-link = United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture | last2 = UN Committee on the Rights of the Child | author2-link = Committee on the Rights of the Child  | last3 = UN Committee on the Rights of People with Disabilities | author3-link = Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities | last4 = UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment | last5 = Juan Méndez, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment | author5-link = Juan E.

This helps reduce confusion about the differences between being intersex, being transgender, and being gay/lesbian.

The most common DSD is [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH), which results in a person with female (XX) chromosomes having genitals that look somewhat masculine. In mild cases, CAH results in a slightly enlarged clitoris, while in more severe cases it can be difficult to decide on observation whether a baby is male or female (ambiguous genitalia). CAH is caused by a problem with the adrenal glands and is usually treated by taking a daily medication to replace or supplement the missing adrenal hormones. (When this adrenal problem occurs in people with male (XY) chromosomes, the result is over-masculinization and premature puberty).

Another common DSD is [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS),also known as testicular feminising syndrome in which a person with male (XY) chromosomes does not respond to testosterone in the usual way. This results in a body that to some degree has a feminine appearance. In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) the result is a totally feminine appearance, including typical female breast development. Consequently, most young women with CAIS are unaware of their condition until the early teen years when they fail to menstruate. In the milder form, called partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), the genitals can vary from mostly female to almost completely male. Some people with PAIS think of themselves as women or girls, others regard themselves as men or boys, and some consider themselves [[genderqueer|nonbinary]].

One of the more uncommon DSDs is [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] (5ARD). It is caused by a shortage early in life of an enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT. DHT is required for the development of extrenal male genitilia. Therefore,In this condition, a person with male (XY) chromosomes has a body that appears female before puberty. After puberty begins, other testosterone-activating enzymes become available and the body soon takes on a masculine appearance, with the scrotum and penis usually reaching typical or nearly-typical size. If 5ARD is diagnosed at a young age, the child is often raised as a boy (a 1996 Brazilian study suggested that the majority of adults with this condition consider themselves men&lt;ref&gt;Mendoca et al (1996), "Male Pseudohermaphroditism Due to Steroid 5-alpha Reductase 2 Deficiency", ''Medicine'', Vol 75, No 2.&lt;/ref&gt; but this has been questioned in some more recent research).

In addition to CAH, CAIS, PAIS, and 5ARD there are several rarer types of DSDs, and in some cases, it is not possible to make a clear diagnosis of the underlying condition.

[[File:Quigley scale for androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|The [[Quigley scale]] is a method for describing genital development in AIS.]]
The penis (males) and clitoris (females) are essentially the same organ (differing only in size, and generically called the phallus). In typical males, the urethra is located at the tip of the penis, while in typical females the urethra is located below the base of the clitoris. When the phallus is of intermediate size, it is possible also to have a urethral opening located along the shaft; this condition is known as hypospadias which helps us raise a suspicion of DSD.

Open-minded parenting, appropriate and conservative [[intersex medical intervention|medical intervention]], and age-appropriate child involvement in the treatment plan contribute greatly to successful outcomes for the entire range of DSDs.&lt;ref name=Zderic&gt;{{cite book|first=Stephen |last=Zderic|title=Pediatric gender assignment : a critical reappraisal ; [proceedings from a conference ... in Dallas in the spring of 1999 which was entitled "pediatric gender assignment - a critical reappraisal"]|date=2002|publisher=Kluwer Acad. / Plenum Publ.|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0306467593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions==

*'''47,XXY females''' - There are case reports of 47,XXY females; in some cases SRY or androgen receptor abnormalities are detected.&lt;ref&gt;Röttger, S., K. Schiebel, G. Singer, S. Ebner, W. Schempp, and G. Scherer. Röttger, S., K. Schiebel, G. Singer, S. Ebner, W. Schempp, and G. Scherer.

U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2001. Web. 12 Aug. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''47,XXY males''' - see [[Klinefelter syndrome]] below
*'''[[48, XXXX]]''' (also known as '''tetrasomy X''', '''quadruple X''', and '''XXXX syndrome''') - A condition that describes a female with two extra female chromosomes. It is considered a variation of [[Triple X syndrome]]. Women with 48, XXXX may or may not have issues associated with the condition though most are developmentally delayed and only about 50% undergo puberty normally.
*'''[[XXYY syndrome|48, XXYY]]''' (also known as '''XXYY syndrome''') - A condition that describes a male with one extra female chromosome and one extra male chromosome. It occurs in 1 in 18,000 to 40,000 male births.&lt;ref name="pmid18481271"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tartaglia N, Davis S, Hench A |title=A New Look at XXYY Syndrome: Medical and Psychological Features |journal=Am.

*'''[[49, XXXXX]]''' (also known as '''pentasomy X''' and '''XXXXX syndrome''') - A condition that describes a female with three extra female chromosomes. It is considered a variant of [[Triple X syndrome]]. Women with 49, XXXXX usually suffer from numerous health issues such as [[patent ductus arteriosus]], [[scoliosis]], kidney [[hypoplasia]], and abnormal [[lobulation]] of the lungs. Physical deformities include [[microcephaly]], [[micrognathia]], and [[webbed neck|webbing of the neck]].
*'''[[49, XXXXY syndrome|49, XXXXY]]''' - A condition that describes a male with three extra female chromosomes. It is rare, occurring in 1 in 85,000 to 100,000 males.&lt;ref name="what"&gt;[http://www.xxxxysyndrome.com/what_is___.htm What is XXXXY syndrome?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327055333/http://xxxxysyndrome.com/what_is___.htm |date=2008-03-27 }} Retrieved March 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17062147"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Visootsak J, Graham JM |title=Klinefelter syndrome and other sex chromosomal aneuploidies |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=1 |issue= |pages=42 |year=2006 |pmid=17062147 |pmc=1634840 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-1-42 |url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/1//42|last2=Graham Jr }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a variation of [[Klinefelter syndrome]]. Men with 49, XXXXY syndrome often suffer from [[Intellectual disability|mental retardation]].
*'''[[5α-reductase deficiency]]''' (also known as '''5-ARD''') - An [[autosomal recessive]] condition caused by a mutation of the [[5-alpha reductase]] type 2 gene. It only affects people with Y chromosomes, namely genetic males. People with this condition are fertile, with the ability to father children, but may be raised as females due to amibiguous or feminized genitalia.
*'''[[17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency]]''' - A condition characterized by impaired androgen and estrogen synthesis in males and females, respectively. Results in pseudohermaphroditism/undervirilization in males and in excessive virilization of adult females.
*'''[[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]]''' (also known as '''AIS''') - A condition which affects a genetic male's virilization. A person with androgen insensitivity syndrome produces androgens and testosterone but their body does not recognize it, either partially or completely. [[Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]] generally causes no developmental issues and people with this form are raised as males. [[Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]] results in ambiguous genitalia and there is no consensus regarding whether to raise a child with this form as male or female. [[Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]] causes a genetic male to have a vagina (often incompletely developed, nearly always blind-ending), breasts, and a clitoris and people with this form are raised as females.
*'''[[Aphallia]]''' - A rare occurrence where a male is born without a [[penis]] or where a female is born without a [[clitoris]]. As of 2005, only 75 cases of aphallia have been documented.&lt;ref name="pmid16142564"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chibber PJ, Shah HN, Jain P, Yadav P |title=Male gender assignment in aphallia: a case report and review of the literature |journal=Int Urol Nephrol |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=317–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16142564 |doi=10.1007/s11255-004-7974-0|last2=Shah |last3=Jain |last4=Yadav }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with [[Genital modification and mutilation|intentional or accidental amputation of the genitalia]].
*'''[[Aposthia]]''' - A congenital defect where a male is born without a [[foreskin]].
*'''[[Aromatase deficiency]]''' - A disorder in which, in females, is characterized by androgen excess and estrogen deficiency, and can result in inappropriate virilization, though without pseudohermaphroditism (i.e., genitals are phenotypically appropriate) (with the exception of the possible incidence of [[clitoromegaly]]).
*'''[[Aromatase excess syndrome]]''' (also known as '''familial hyperestrogenism''') - A condition that causes excessive [[estrogen]] production, resulting in feminization without pseudohermaphroditism (i.e., male genitalia at birth and female secondary sexual characteristics at puberty) in males and hyperfeminization in females.
*'''[[Clitoromegaly]]''' - A [[clitoris]] that is considered larger than average. While clitoromegaly may be a symptom of an [[intersex|intersex condition]], it may also be considered a normal variation in clitoris size. Clitoromegaly causes no health issues. Surgical reduction of the clitoris or its complete removal may be performed to normalize the appearance of the genitalia. While [[female genital mutilation]] is outlawed in many countries, reduction or the removal of the clitoris in cases of clitoromegaly are generally exempt, despite the fact that it is a nontherapeutic and sexually damaging surgery. Clitoromegaly may also be caused by females using [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] or [[anabolic steroids]] for purposes related to [[trans man|female to male]] [[gender transition]] or [[bodybuilding]].
*'''[[Combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency]]''' - A condition in which presents as a combination of the symptoms of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] and [[isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency]]. See those two conditions for more information.
*'''[[Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]]''' (also known as '''CAIS''') - A condition which completely affects a genetic male's ability to recognize [[androgens]]. It is considered a form of [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] and is the most severe form. People with complete androgen insensitivity are raised as females and usually do not discover they are genetic males until they experience [[amenorrhoea]] in their late teens or they need medical intervention due to a [[hernia]] caused by their [[undescended testes]]. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome results in a genetic male having a vagina, clitoris, and breasts which are capable of [[breastfeeding]]. However, they will not have [[ovaries]] or a [[uterus]]. Because they do not have ovaries or sufficiently developed testicles, people with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are [[infertile]].
*'''[[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]''' (also known as '''CAH''') -  A condition that causes excessive [[androgen]] production, which causes excessive virilization. It is most problematic in genetic females, where severe virilization can result in her having vaginal agenesis (absence of vagina) and a functional penis which is capable of penetrative intercourse. Females with this condition are usually fertile, with the ability to become pregnant and give birth. The salt-wasting variety of this condition is fatal in infants if left untreated.
*'''[[Diphallia]]''' (also known as '''penile duplication''', '''diphallic terata''', and '''diphallasparatus''') - A condition where a male is born with two penises. It's extremely rare, with only 100 cases being recorded since 1609 and an occurrence rate of 1 in 5,500,000 in the United States. The penises may be side by side or one on top of the other, being of equal size or with one penis being distinctively larger than the other, and both penises may be suitable for urination and intercourse. Men with diphallia may be sterile.
*'''[[Estrogen insensitivity syndrome]]''' ('''EIS''') - The estrogen counterpart to androgen insensitivity syndrome. Extremely rare, with only one verified case having been reported; a biological male presented with tall stature, a heightened risk of osteoporosis, and sterility.
*'''[[Gonadal dysgenesis|Gonadal Dysgenesis]]''' - is any congenital developmental disorder of the reproductive system characterized by a progressive loss of [[primordial germ cells]] on the developing gonads of an embryo.
*'''[[Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency]]''' - A condition that is characterized by an either partial or complete inability to produce androgens and estrogens. Results in partial or complete feminization and undervirilization in males and in a delayed, reduced, or absent puberty in both sexes, in turn causing sexual infantilism and infertility, among other symptoms.
*'''[[Klinefelter syndrome]]''' (also known as '''47, XXY''' and '''XXY syndrome''') - A condition that describes a male born with at least one extra female chromosome. Though the most common variation is 47, XXY, a man may also be 48, XXXY or [[49, XXXXY syndrome|49, XXXXY]]. It is a common occurrence, affecting 1 in 500 to 1,000 men.&lt;ref name="The Focus Foundation"&gt;The Focus Foundation. ''X &amp; Y Variations.''

[[Testosterone]] therapy may be pursued by men who desire a more masculine appearance and those with gynecomastia may opt to undergo a [[reduction mammoplasty]]. Men who wish to father children may be able to do so with the help of [[IVF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fullerton G, Hamilton M, Maheshwari A.|title=Should non-mosaic Klinefelter syndrome men be labelled as infertile in 2009? |journal=Hum.

*'''[[Leydig cell hypoplasia]]''' - A condition solely affecting biological males which is characterized by a partial or complete inactivation of the [[luteinizing hormone receptor]], resulting in stymied androgen production. Patients may present at birth with a fully female phenotype, ambiguous genitalia, or only mild genital defects such as [[micropenis]] and [[hypospadias]]. Upon puberty, sexual development is either impaired or fully absent.
*'''[[Micropenis]]''' (also known as '''microphallus''') - A penis that measures 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) or less in length when erect. It is a common condition, occurring in 1 in 200 men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4071657.stm Op can boost size of micro-penis], [[BBC News]], Published December 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Micropenis may be the result of [[undervirilization]] during [[fetal development]] or may be caused by an underlying [[intersex]] condition, such as [[mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]], [[partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]], or [[Klinefelter syndrome]]. It may also be considered a natural variation of penis size. While the majority of men have no issues with having a micropenis, some may opt to use a [[prosthetic penis]] or undergo [[penile enlargement]] to increase the size of their penis.
*'''[[Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]''' - An endocrine disorder that arises from defects in the earliest stages of [[steroid hormone]] synthesis: the transport of [[cholesterol]] into the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and the conversion of cholesterol to [[pregnenolone]]—the first step in the synthesis of all [[steroid hormone]]s.
*'''[[Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]]''' (also known as '''MAIS''') - A condition which mildly affects a genetic male's ability to recognize [[androgens]]. It is considered a form of [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] and is considered the least severe form. While men generally do not need any specialized medical care related to this form, mild androgen insensitivity syndrome may result in [[gynecomastia]] and [[hypospadias]]. Neither gynecomastia nor hypospadias require surgerical intervention or adversely affect a man's health though some men may opt to undergo surgery to remove their breasts and/or repair their hypospadias. Men with mild androgen insensitivity syndrome may have reduced fertility.
*'''[[Mixed gonadal dysgenesis]]''' -  is a condition of unusual and asymmetrical gonadal development leading to an unassigned [[sex differentiation]]. A number of differences have been reported in the [[karyotype]], most commonly a [[mosaicism]] 45,X/ 46, XY.
*'''[[Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]]''' (also known as '''PAIS''') - A condition which partially affects a genetic male's ability to recognize [[androgens]]. It is considered a form of [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] and while it is not as severe as [[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]], it is more severe than [[mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]]. Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome causes major problems with [[gender assignment]] because it causes ambiguous genitalia such as a [[micropenis]] or [[clitoromegaly]] in addition to breast development. People with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome who are assigned as males may undergo testosterone therapy to virilize their body while those who are assigned as females may undergo surgical reduction of the clitoris and/ or estrogen therapy.
*'''[[Pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias]]''' (also known as '''PPSH''') - A form of ambiguous genitalia which results in a phallic structure that is smaller than a penis but larger than a clitoris, a [[chordee]], [[hypospadias]], and a shallow vagina.
*'''[[Swyer syndrome|Swyer Syndrome]]''' (Also known as '''Pure Gonadal Dysgenesis or XY gonadal dysgenesis''') is a type of [[hypogonadism]] in a person whose [[karyotype]] is 46,XY. The person is externally female with [[streak gonads]], and left untreated, will not experience [[puberty]]. Such gonads are typically surgically removed (as they have a significant risk of developing tumors) and a typical medical treatment would include [[hormone replacement therapy]] with female hormones.
*'''[[Triple X syndrome]]''' - A condition that describes a female born with an extra female chromosome, making her [[karotype]] 47, XXX. It is a common occurrence, affecting 1 in 1,000 females.&lt;ref name=ghr&gt;{{cite web |author=National Library of Medicine |title=Genetics Home Reference: Triple X syndrome |year=2007 |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=triplexsyndrome |accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally causes no health issues or abnormal development.
*'''[[Turner syndrome]]''' (also known as '''Ullrich-Turner syndrome''' and '''gonadal dysgenesis''') - A condition that describes a female born without a female chromosome or with an abnormal female chromosome, making her karotype 45, XO. It occurs in 1 in 2,000 to 5,000 females. Turner syndrome causes numerous health and development problems, including but not limited to short stature, [[lymphedema]], [[infertility]], [[webbed neck]], [[coarctation of the aorta]], [[ADHD]], [[amenorrhoea]], and [[obesity]].
*'''[[Uterus didelphys]]''' (also known as '''double uterus''') - A condition where a female is born with two [[uteri]]. It is often accompanied by two vaginas. It is generally not considered a health issue and women with uterus didelphys usually have normal sex lives and pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/double-uterus/DS00821 Double uterus] [[Mayo Clinic]], Published September 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Müllerian agenesis]]''' (also known as '''MRKH''' or '''Vaginal Agenesis''') - A condition that causes the uterus and other reproductive organs in a 46,XX female to be small or absent, as well as the vaginal canal itself. It affects 1 out of 4,500 to 5,000 females and can also come with skeletal or endocrine system issues at conception.

==Controversy==
{{further|Intersex human rights|Intersex medical interventions}}
The term DSD (and particularly its association with medical ''disorders'') has been controversial. The argument over terminology reflects a deeper disagreement over the extent to which intersex conditions require medical intervention, the appropriateness of certain interventions, and whether physicians and parents should make irreversible treatment decisions on behalf of young children if the condition is not life-threatening.

* Use of the term disorder of sex development (DSD) is controversial among many activists and [[Intersex civil society organizations|community organizations]] due to the label "disorders".&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = interACT| authorlink = Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth | title = interACT Statement on Intersex Terminology| work = [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth]]| accessdate = 30 May 2016| date = May 2016 | url = http://interactadvocates.org/interact-statement-on-intersex-terminology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Briffa| first = Tony| author-link = Tony Briffa | title = Tony Briffa writes on "Disorders of Sex Development"| date = 8 May 2014 | url = http://oii.org.au/26808/tony-briffa-on-dsd/ | publisher = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ukia.co.uk/ukia/dsd.html | title = Why Not "Disorders of Sex Development"? | work = UK Intersex Association | accessdate = 30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments and international institutions use the term 'intersex' in preference to 'DSD', or have called for the review of medical classifications.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iachr" /&gt;
* In the past the term "hermaphrodite" was sometimes erroneously used to describe people with intersex/DSD conditions. This term is no longer used to describe humans (or any other mammals). The correct technical definition of a hermaphrodite is a single organism that has complete sets of both male and female sexual organs, as is the case with most trees and flowering plants.
* Lee et al. in a 2006 ''Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders'' proposed a system of nomenclature based on "disorders of [[sex development]]" for clinical use, suggesting that "terms such as [[intersex]], [[pseudohermaphroditism]], [[hermaphroditism]], sex reversal, and gender based diagnostic labels are particularly controversial," may be perceived as pejorative, and are confusing to practitioners and parents alike.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; However, research by the [[Lurie Children's Hospital]], Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that affected persons, and care givers, object to the term, and that this may impact choice, access, and utilization of health care providers.&lt;ref name="johnson2017"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jpurol.2017.03.035| issn = 1477-5131| last1 = Johnson| first1 = Emilie K.| last2 = Rosoklija| first2 = Ilina| last3 = Finlayso| first3 = Courtney| last4 = Chen| first4 = Diane| last5 = Yerkes| first5 = Elizabeth B.| last6 = Madonna| first6 = Mary Beth| last7 = Holl| first7 = Jane L.| last8 = Baratz| first8 = Arlene B.| last9 = Davis| first9 = Georgiann| last10 = Cheng| first10 = Earl Y.| author9-link = Georgiann Davis | title = Attitudes towards "disorders of sex development" nomenclature among affected individuals| journal = Journal of Pediatric Urology| volume = 13| issue = 6| pages = 608.e1| date = May 2017| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1477513117301833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian sociological research on people born with atypical [[sex characteristics]], published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents choose the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services.

In 2013, [[Juan E. Méndez]], the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, condemned "irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents,  “in an attempt to fix their sex”" stating that "members of sexual minorities are disproportionately subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment because they fail to conform to socially constructed gender expectations".&lt;ref name="Mendez2013"&gt;{{Cite conference| last = Méndez| first = Juan| authorlink= Juan E.

In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement'' with the [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]]. Referencing the involuntary surgical "sex-normalising or other procedures" on "intersex persons", the report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/eliminating-forced-sterilization/en/ |title=Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement|work= [[World Health Organization]]|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dvādaśānta''' ([[Sanskrit]]: द्वादशान्त) or the ''Brahmarandhra'', meaning – having an end or limit of twelve, it is the ''twelve fingers’ breath'', the 12th centre (or ''[[Shakti|śakti]]'' in an individual) identified by some with the [[pituitary gland]], there being six centers in the brain and six below the brain. This term refers to – a) externally to the place where the breath dies away, b) internally to the crown of the skull and known as ''brahmarandhra'', and c) above the skull to the ''dvādaśānta'' which is twelve fingers breadth away from the ''brahmarandhra'', and when no longer identified with the body but with the all-pervading [[Shiva]] it is the Cosmic ''dvādaśānta'', a wheel with a thousand spokes, eternally present. ''Dvādaśānta'' is like the ''triśūla'' signifying three kinds of energy – of the will, of knowledge and of activity. The initial extremity (''ādi-koti'') is the heart (whence the breath rises) but the final extremity (''anta-koti'') is the ''dvādaśānta'' (where the breath finally dies away or rests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kundalini: The Energy of the Depths|author=Lilian Silbum|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=31, 49|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EYWmc0gfYyIC|date=1988|isbn=9780887068003|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pratyabhijna Philosophy|author=Ganesh vasudeo Tagare|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=104|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GW6UtkgT-CcC|date=2002|isbn=9788120818927|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abhinavagupta]] tells us that Shiva makes the [[sādhaka]] seek a worthy teacher and makes that teacher take up that task with extra responsibility and lead his [[Guru-shishya tradition|śiśya]] towards liberation. The ''ānavopāya'' ('atomic') method utilises the creative functions of Shiva and raises the ''sādhaka'' to ''śaktopāya'' ('method of power') that employs the cognitive functions of the Lord. In this and other two succeeding methods [[mantra]] transmitted by the teacher to the ''śiśya'' plays a vital role. According to the ''Devyā-yāmala- tantra'', the subtle breath composed of sound rising from the former’s heart moves through a series of centers to rest in the ''dvādaśānta'' which is the terminal point where the [[Nadi (yoga)|suśumnā]] ends and the central pathway of the three paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tantric Heart|author=Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega|publisher=SUNY Press|page=168|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ObmRkyVbgDUC|date=1989|isbn=9780887067860|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vijñānabhirava ([[Dhāraṇā]] 28 [[shloka]] 51) states:-
:यथा तथा यत्र तत्र द्वादशान्ते मनः क्षिपेत् |
:प्रतिक्षणं क्षीणवृत्तेर्वैलक्षण्यं दिनैर्भवेत् ||
which statement means that the ''ānavopāya'' involves fixation of the mind again and again at ''ūrdhava dvādaśānta'' or ''bāhya dvādaśānta'' or ''āntara dvādaśānta'' which is the incomparable and ineffable state of [[Bhairava]] (an aspect of Shiva).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga of Delight, Wonder and Astonishment|page=47|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=aVc5JCnO1VgC|date=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780791410738|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text had earlier in ''shloka'' 28 explained that meditation on ''prāṇaśakti'' arising from the ''[[Muladhara|mūladhārā chakra]]'' getting subtler and subtler dissolves in ''dvādaśānta'' to manifest Bhairava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consciousness|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=25|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2R2iSiMbuVwC|date=1979|isbn=9788120808201|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''apāna'' remains in the ''dvādaśānta'', it is known as the external ''[[kumbhaka]]'' (retention of breath as in a pot). When the '' [[Prana|prāṇa]] '' moves up to the nose-tip it is known as ''recaka'' and when it moves up to the extent of the ''dvādaśānta'' it is called ''external-recaka''. The ''apāna'' moving inwards without the ''prāṇa'' is the ''internal-kumbhaka'', and the ''apāna'' rising in the ''dvādaśānta'' attaining internal expansion is the ''internal-pūraka''.

'''Emanuel Haldeman-Julius''' (''né'' '''Emanuel Julius''') (July 30, 1889 – July 31, 1951) was a [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] [[History_of_the_socialist_movement_in_the_United_States#20th_century|socialist]] writer, [[atheist]] thinker, [[social reform]]er and [[publishing|publisher]]. He is best remembered as the head of Haldeman-Julius Publications, the creator of a series of pamphlets known as "[[Little Blue Book]]s," total sales of which ran into the hundreds of millions of copies.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Emanuel Julius was born July 30, 1889, in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the son of David Julius (''né'' Zolajefsky), a bookbinder. His parents were [[Jew]]ish emigrants who fled [[Odessa]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) and [[History_of_immigration_to_the_United_States#Immigration_1850_to_1930|emigrated]] to America to escape [[Anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire#1881.E2.80.9384|religious persecution]].&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;[[Susan Jacoby]], ''Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism.'' New York: [[Henry Holt and Company]], 2004; pg. 264. (See photograph of David [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:David_Julius,_father_of_Emanuel_Haldeman-Julius.jpg here].)&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal and maternal grandfathers had both been rabbis but his own parents were not religious. "[T]hey were indifferent, for which I thank them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Julie Herrada, "Emanuel Haldeman-Julius", ''The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=fsZ26vQxJKMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA374 p. 374].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy, Emanuel read voraciously. Literature and pamphlets produced by the socialists were inexpensive; Julius read them and was convinced by their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/portraits/haldeman_julius_marcet_and_emanuel.htm Marcet and Emanuel Haldeman-Julius - Kansapedia - Kansas Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; As he put it in 1913, "Only four years ago, I was a factory hand — slaving away in a textile mill in Philadelphia. I came upon the philosophy of Socialism and it put a new spirit into me. It lifted me out of the depths and pointed the way to something higher. I commenced to crave for expression. I felt that I have something to say. So, I scribbled things down. And, to my surprise, Socialist editors gave me a little encouragement."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Jack London, June 13, 1913, found [https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/culture/pubs/hjcc/2005/0509-hjcc-bbn06.pdf here], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Socialist Party USA|Socialist Party]] before [[World War I]]&lt;ref name="heritage"/&gt; and was the party's 1932 Senatorial candidate for the state of Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Gabe and C.S. Sullivant, ''Kansas Votes: National Elections, 1859-1956'' (Univ. Kansas, 1957), [https://archive.org/stream/kansasvotesnatio00cabe#page/92/mode/1up p. 92].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===

After working for various newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;These included the ''[[New York Call|New York Evening Call]]'', ''[[Milwaukee Leader]]'', ''Chicago World'', ''[[The Western Comrade|Western Comrade]]'' (issues online [https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/pubs/westerncomrade/index.htm here]) and ''[[New York Call]]'' (Julie Herrada, "Emanuel Haldeman-Julius", ''The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=fsZ26vQxJKMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA374 p. 374]).&lt;/ref&gt; Julius rose to particular prominence as an editor (1915-1922)&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;[http://www.haldeman-julius.org/historical-notes/haldeman-julius-chronology.html Haldeman-Julius Historical Notes: Chronology of Important Events]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|''Appeal to Reason'']], a [[socialist]] [[newspaper]] with a large but declining national circulation.  He and his first wife, [[Anna Marcet Haldeman|Marcet Haldeman]] (whose last name he adopted in hyphenate&lt;ref&gt;"In addition, they kept their individual incomes separate and split evenly their common expenses" (Herrada, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fsZ26vQxJKMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA375 p. 375]).&lt;/ref&gt;), purchased the [[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|''Appeal'']]'s printing operation in [[Girard, Kansas]] and began printing 3.5" x 5" pocket books on cheap pulp paper (similar to that used in [[pulp magazines]]), stapled in paper cover. These were first were called ''The Appeal's Pocket Series'' and sold in 1919 for 25 cents. The covers were either red or yellow. Over the next several years Haldeman-Julius changed the name successively to ''The People's Pocket Series'', ''Appeal Pocket Series'', ''Ten Cent Pocket Series'', ''Five Cent Pocket Series'', ''Pocket Series'' and finally in 1923, ''[[Little Blue Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Herrada [https://books.google.com/books?id=fsZ26vQxJKMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA375 gives] 1925 as the date for this.&lt;/ref&gt; The five cent price of the books remained in place for many years. Many titles of classic literature were given lurid titles in order to increase sales.&lt;ref&gt;"'The Tallow Ball" by Guy de Maupassant sold 15,000 copies one year, but 54,700 the next year after the title was changed to 'A French Prostitute's Sacrifice'" (from the Wikipedia Little Blue Books [[Little Blue Books|article]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, millions of copies per year were sold in the late 1920s.

In 1922 they renamed the ''Appeal'' as ''The Haldeman-Julius Weekly'' (known from 1929 to 1951 as ''The American Freeman''), which became the house organ. In 1924 they launched ''The Haldeman-Julius Monthly''&lt;ref&gt;See example cover [http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91SsSFZXGEL.jpg here].&lt;/ref&gt; (later renamed ''The Debunker''), which had a greater emphasis on [[Freethought]], and in 1932 added ''The Militant Atheist'', among other journals.

The novelist [[Louis L’Amour]] (1908-1988) described the Haldeman-Julius publications in his autobiography and their potential influence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Riding a freight train out of El Paso, I had my first contact with the Little Blue Books. Another hobo was reading one, and when he finished he gave it to me. The Little Blue Books were a godsend to wandering men and no doubt to many others. Published in Girard, Kansas, by Haldeman-Julius, they were slightly larger than a playing card and had sky-blue paper covers with heavy black print titles. I believe there were something more than three thousand titles in all and they were sold on newsstands for 5 or 10 cents each. Often in the years following, I carried ten or fifteen of them in my pockets, reading when I could.

Among the books available were the plays of [[Shakespeare]], collections of short stories by [[De Maupassant]], [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Jack London]],&lt;ref&gt;For Haldeman-Julius's own correspondence with Jack London, see [https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/culture/pubs/hjcc/2005/0509-hjcc-bbn06.pdf here], pp. 5-17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gogol]], [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Gautier le Leu|Gautier]], [[Henry James]], and [[Balzac]]. There were collections of essays by [[Voltaire]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], and [[Charles Lamb]], among others. There were books on the history of music and architecture, painting, the principles of electricity; and, generally speaking, the books offered a wide range of literature and ideas. […] In subsequent years I read several hundred of the Little Blue Books, including books by [[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Thomas Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;L’Amour ''Education of a Wandering Mann'' (NYC: Bantam, 1989), ch. 2 (paragraphs consolidated). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Personal life, death and legacy===

The couple had two children: Alice Haldeman-Julius Deloach (1917–1991) and Henry Haldeman-Julius (1919–1990;  he later changed his name to Henry Julius Haldeman). They adopted Josephine Haldeman-Julius Roselle (b. 1910).  Marcet and Emanuel legally separated in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Kansas Historical Society; see [http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/marcet-and-emanuel-haldeman-julius/12077 here].&lt;/ref&gt; Marcet died in 1941, and a year later Haldeman-Julius married Susan Haney, an employee.

In 1948 the [[FBI]] targeted and questioned Haldeman-Julius after his publication of ''The FBI - The Basis of an American Police State: The Alarming Methods of [[J. Edgar Hoover]].''&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; In June 1951  Haldeman-Julius was found guilty of income tax evasion by a Federal grand jury and sentenced to six months in Federal prison and fined $12,500.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; The next month he [[drowning|drowned]] in his [[swimming pool]].&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; His son Henry took over his father's publishing efforts, and the books continued to be sold until the printing house burned down on July 4, 1978.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">To '''fillet''' in the sense of [[literary editor|literary editing]] is a form of [[censorship]] or [[redaction]] effected by "cutting out" central letters of a word or name, as if the skeleton of a fish, and replacing them with [[dash]]es, to prevent full disclosure (e.g. ''{{nowrap|W——m P——t}}'' for "[[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]]"). It was frequently practiced in publications of the 18th century in England. Its purpose was to inform interested readers in an obfuscated manner whilst at the same time avoiding the risk of being sued for illegal publication or [[defamation]] or [[libel]] by the overt naming of persons as having committed certain acts or spoken certain words. It was used for example in [[Hansard|parliamentary reports]] published in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' from 1738 onwards under the title of the "Debates in the Senate of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Magna Lilliputia]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Harry |title=The Mother of Parliaments |location=[[Boston, Mass.]] |date=1911 |pages=279–80 |url=https://archive.org/stream/motherofparliame00grah/motherofparliame00grah_djvu.txt |via=[[Internet Archive]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which in order to circumvent the prohibition of the publication of parliamentary debates of the English Parliament the real names of the various orators were filleted or replaced by [[pseudonym]]s or [[anagram]]s;&lt;ref&gt;For example ''Sholmlng'' for [[Marquess of Cholmondeley|Cholmondeley]] and  ''Ptit'' for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, Sir [[Robert Walpole]] was thinly disguised as ''{{nowrap|Sr. R——t W——le}}''.&lt;ref name="Trewin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Trewin |first=J.C |title=Printer to the House: The Story of Hansard |year=1952 |publisher=The Chapel River Press |location=[[Andover, Hampshire]] |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was often performed not to avoid legal action but merely to show deference to the privacy of some great personage, or not to offend his imputed sense of modesty by naming him as the author of some great or worthy deed or act.

In [[social psychology]], '''fundamental attribution error''' ('''FAE'''), also known as '''correspondence bias''' or '''attribution effect''', is the concept that, in contrast to interpretations of their own behavior, people tend to (unduly) emphasize the agent's internal characteristics (character or intention), rather than external factors, in explaining other people's behavior. This effect has been described as "the tendency to believe that what people do reflects who they are".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/change/lecture/3m1nZ/9-5|title=Scripts and Schemas|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|date=|website=Coursera - Social Norms, Social Change II|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term and example==
The phrase was coined by [[Lee Ross]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in experimental social psychology|last=Ross|first=L.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1977|isbn=0-12-015210-X|editor-last=Berkowitz|editor-first=L.|volume=10|location=New York|pages=173–220|chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process}}&lt;/ref&gt; some years after a classic experiment by [[Edward E. Jones]] and Victor Harris (1967).&lt;ref name="JonesHarris67"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=E. E.|last2=Harris|first2=V.

Jones wrote that he found Ross' phrase "overly provocative and somewhat misleading", and also joked: "Furthermore, I'm angry that I didn't think of it first."&lt;ref name="gilbert2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attribution and social interaction: The legacy of E.

As a simple example of the behavior attribution error theory seeks to explain, consider the situation where Alice, a driver, is cut off in traffic by Bob. Alice attributes Bob's behavior to his fundamental personality, e.g. he thinks only of himself, he is selfish, he is a jerk, he is an unskilled driver; she does not think it is situational, e.g. he is going to miss his flight, his wife is giving birth at the hospital, his daughter is convulsing at school. Consider too the situation where Alice makes the same mistake and excuses herself by saying she was influenced by situational causes, e.g. I am late for my job interview, I must pick up my son for his dentist appointment; she does not think she has a flaw in her internal characteristics, e.g. I am such a jerk, I treat others in contempt, I am bad at driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/fundamental-attribution-error|title=Fundamental Attribution Error - Ethics Unwrapped|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic demonstration study: Jones and Harris (1967)===

Jones and Harris hypothesized, based on the [[correspondent inference theory]], that people would attribute apparently freely chosen behaviors to disposition and apparently chance-directed behaviors to situation. The hypothesis was confounded by the fundamental attribution error.&lt;ref name="JonesHarris67"/&gt;

Subjects in an experiment read essays for and against [[Fidel Castro]] and were asked to rate the pro-Castro attitudes of the writers. When the subjects believed that the writers freely chose positions for or against Castro, they would normally rate the people who spoke in liking of Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro. However, contradicting Jones and Harris' initial hypothesis, when the subjects were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss, they still rated writers who spoke in favor of Castro as having, on average, a more positive attitude towards Castro than those who spoke against him. In other words, the subjects were unable to properly see the influence of the situational constraints placed upon the writers; they could not refrain from attributing sincere belief to the writers. Therefore, the experimental group provided more internal attributions towards the writer.

== Tests of the error ==
The hypothesis that people tend to over-attribute behavior to traits, or at least do so for the behavior of others, has been contested. For instance Epstein and Teraspulsky &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Seymour|last2=Teraspulsky|first2=Laurie|title=Perception of cross-situational consistency.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.6.1152|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1152–1160|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.6.1152}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested whether subjects over-, under-, or correctly estimate the empirical correlation among behaviors. (These behavioral consistencies are what "traits" describe.) They found that estimates of correlations among behaviors correlated strongly with empirically observed correlations among these behaviors. Subjects were sensitive to even very small correlations, and their confidence in the association tracked how far they were discrepant (i.e., if they knew when they did not know), and was higher for the strongest relations. Subjects also showed awareness of the effect of aggregation over occasions and used reasonable strategies to arrive at decisions. Epstein concluded that "Far from being inveterate trait believers, as has been previously suggested, [subjects'] intuitions paralleled psychometric principles in several important respects when assessing relations between real-life behaviors."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While described as "robust, firmly established, and pervasive", [[meta-analysis]] of the 173 qualified studies of the actor-observer asymmetry available by 2005 established, surprisingly, an [[effect size]] of near zero.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These analyses allowed a systematic review of where, if at all, the effect holds. These analyses showed that the asymmetry was found only when 1. the other person was portrayed as being very unusual, 2. when hypothetical (rather than real) events were explained, 3. when people were intimate (knew each other well), or 4. when researcher-[[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] were high.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It appeared that in these circumstances two asymmetries were observed: negative events were asymmetrically attributed to traits in others, but the reverse held for positive events, supporting a [[Self-serving bias|self-serving]] bias rather than an actor–observer asymmetry.

==Explanations==

Several theories predict the fundamental attribution error, and thus both compete to explain it, and can be falsified if it does not occur. Leading examples include:
# '''[[Just-world fallacy]].''' The belief that people get what they deserve and deserve what they get, the concept of which was first theorized by [[Melvin J. Lerner]] (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Miller | first2 = D.

When we observe other people, the person is the primary reference point while the situation is overlooked as if it is nothing but mere background.

Therefore, when situational information is not sufficiently taken into account for adjustment, the uncorrected dispositional inference creates the fundamental attribution error.

Alternatively, individualist subjects may favor processing of focal objects, rather than contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masuda |first=T. |last2=Nisbett |first2=R. E. |year=2001 |title=Attending holistically vs. analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=922–934 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922 |pmid=11708567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others suggest Western individualism is associated with viewing both oneself and others as [[Self-determination theory|independent]] [[Agency (philosophy)|agents]], therefore focusing more on individuals rather than contextual details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markus |first=H.

==Versus correspondence bias==

The fundamental attribution error is commonly used interchangeably with "correspondence bias" (sometimes called "correspondence inference", although this phrase refers to a judgment which does not necessarily constitute a bias, which arises when the inference drawn is incorrect, e.g. dispositional inference when the actual cause is situational). However, there has been debate about whether the two terms should be distinguished from each other. Three main differences between these two judgmental processes have been argued:
# They seem to be elicited under different circumstances, as both correspondent dispositional inferences and situational inferences can be elicited spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. L. (1988). Causal attributions viewed from an information-processing perspective. In D. Bar-Tal &amp; A. W. Kruglanski (Eds.) ''The social psychology of knowledge''. (Pp. 369-385.) Cambridge, England, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Attributional processing, however, seems to only occur when the event is unexpected or conflicting with prior expectations. This notion is supported by a study conducted by Semin and Marsman (1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Semin | first1 = G. R. | last2 = Marsman | first2 = J. G. | year = 1994 | title = Multiple inference-inviting properties" of interpersonal verbs: Event instigation, dispositional inference and implicit causality | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 5| pages = 836–849 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.5.836}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that different types of verbs invited different inferences and attributions. Correspondence inferences were invited to a greater degree by interpretative action verbs (such as "to help") than state action or state verbs, thus suggesting that the two are produced under different circumstances.
# Correspondence inferences and causal attributions also differ in automaticity. Inferences can occur spontaneously if the behavior implies a situational or dispositional inference, while causal attributions occur much more slowly (e.g. Smith &amp; Miller, 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = E. R. | last2 = Miller | first2 = F. D. | year = 1983 | title = Mediation among attributional inferences and comprehension processes: Initial findings and a general method | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 492–505 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.3.492}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It has also been suggested that correspondence inferences and causal attributions are elicited by different mechanisms. It is generally agreed that correspondence inferences are formed by going through several stages. Firstly, the person must interpret the behavior, and then, if there is enough information to do so, add situational information and revise their inference. They may then further adjust their inferences by taking into account dispositional information as well.&lt;ref name="Gilbert1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krull | first1 = D. S. | last2 = Dill | first2 = J. C. | year = 1996 | title = Thinking first and responding fast: Flexibility in social inference processes | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 9| pages = 949–959 | doi=10.1177/0146167296229008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causal attributions however seem to be formed either by processing visual information using perceptual mechanisms, or by activating knowledge structures (e.g. schemas) or by systematic data analysis and processing.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. A., Krull, D. S., &amp; Weiner, B. (1996). Explanations: Processes and consequences. In E. T. Higgins &amp; A. W. Kruglanski (Eds.), ''Social psychology: Handbook of basic principles'' (pp. 221-296). New York, Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, due to the difference in theoretical structures, correspondence inferences are more strongly related to behavioral interpretation than causal attributions.

Based on the preceding differences between causal attribution and correspondence inference, some researchers argue that the fundamental attribution error should be considered as the tendency to make dispositional rather than situational explanations for behavior, whereas the correspondence bias should be considered as the tendency to draw correspondent dispositional inferences from behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. L. (1998). Dispositional and attributional inferences in person perception. In J. M. Darley &amp; J. Cooper (Eds.), ''Attribution and social interaction'' (pp. 99-114). Washington, DC, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krull2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krull|first1=Douglas S.|editor1-last=Moskowitz|editor1-first=Gordon B.|title=Cognitive Social Psychology: The Princeton Symposium on the Legacy and Future of Social Cognition|date=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=1135664250|pages=211–227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DE-cJ8F4rSMC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211|language=en|chapter=On partitioning the fundamental attribution error: Dispositionalism and the correspondence bias|location=Mahwah, New Jersey, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; With such distinct definitions between the two, some cross-cultural studies also found that cultural differences of correspondence bias are not equivalent to those of fundamental attribution error. While the latter has been found to be more prevalent in individualistic cultures than collectivistic cultures, correspondence bias occurs across cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Masuda, T., &amp; Kitayama, S. (1996). ''Culture-specificity of correspondence bias: Dispositional inference in Japan.''

'''German Romanticism''' was the dominant intellectual movement of German-speaking countries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, influencing philosophy, aesthetics, literature and criticism. Compared to English Romanticism, the German variety developed relatively late, and, in the early years, coincided with [[Weimar Classicism]] (1772–1805). In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety of Romanticism notably valued wit, humour, and beauty.

The early period, roughly 1797 to 1802, is referred to as ''Frühromantik'' or [[Jena Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Beiser, ix&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophers and writers central to the movement were [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]] (1773–1798), [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] (1775–1854), [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] (1772–1829), [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] (1767–1845), [[Ludwig Tieck]] (1773–1853), and [[Friedrich von Hardenberg]] (Novalis) (1772–1801).&lt;ref&gt;Beiser, 7&lt;/ref&gt; 

The early German romantics strove to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, by viewing the [[Middle Ages]] as a simpler period of integrated culture; however, the German romantics became aware of the tenuousness of the cultural unity they sought.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-232415/German-literature |title=German literature – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late-stage German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the daily world and the irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius. In particular, the critic [[Heinrich Heine]] criticized the tendency of the early German romantics to look to the medieval past for a model of unity in art and society.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

[[Image:Richard Wagner, Paris, 1861.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=alt text|[[Richard Wagner]], 1860]]
* [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. In his earlier works, Beethoven was a Classicist in the traditions of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] (his tutor), but his Middle Period, beginning with his third symphony (the '[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'), bridges the worlds of Classical and Romantic music. Because Beethoven wrote some of his greatest music after he became totally deaf, he embodies the Romantic ideal of the tragic artist who defies all odds to conquer his own fate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} His later works portray the triumph of the human spirit, most notably his 'Choral' Symphony No. 9; the stirring '[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ode to Joy]]' from this symphony has been adopted as the anthem of the [[European Union]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* [[Johannes Brahms]]. His works are cast in the formal moulds of Classicism; he had a profound reverence for Beethoven. Brahms was also attracted to the exoticism of Hungarian folk music, and used it in such pieces as his famous 'Hungarian Dances', the final movement of his Violin Concerto, and the 'Rondo alla zingarese' from his Piano Quartet No. 1, op. 25, in G minor.
* [[Franz Liszt]]. Liszt was by nationality a [[Hungary|Hungarian]], but nevertheless he spent many years in [[Germany]], and his first language was [[German language|German]]. Credited as the inventor of the [[tone poem]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In his old age, Liszt adopted a more dissonant, ominous flavour, characteristic works being 'la Lugubre Gondola' and 'Die Zelle in Nonnenwerth'—predating [[Impressionist music|Impressionism]] and 20th-century atonality.
* [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. A composer of the Early Romantic period, together with such figures as Schumann, Chopin and Liszt. One of the persons responsible for reviving interest in the almost-forgotten music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* [[Franz Schubert]]. His body of work consists mainly of song cycles and German [[Lieder]] set to poems by his contemporaries, many of which are among the most common repertoire in those categories performed today.
* [[Robert Schumann]]. His works recall the nostalgia of lost childhood innocence, first love, and the magnificence of the German countryside.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} As an influential critic, he played a major role in discovering new talents, among them [[Chopin]] and Brahms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* [[Richard Wagner]]. The greatest composer of German opera; was an exponent of [[Leitmotif]]. One of the main figures in the so-called [[War of the Romantics]].
* [[Carl Maria von Weber]]. Perhaps the very first of Romantic musicians, if we exclude Beethoven, in the sense that Weber was the first major composer to emerge wholly as a product of the Romantic school, as contrasted with Beethoven, who had started off as a Classicist.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The emotional intensity and supernatural, folklore-based themes in his operas presented a radical break from the Neoclassical traditions of that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!--In music, "neoclassical" usually refers to a 20th-century movement. Who refers to early 19th-century opera as "neoclassical"?--&gt;

== Information types ==
Various types of personal information often come under privacy concerns.

=== Internet ===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The ability to control the information one reveals about oneself over the internet, and who can access that information, has become a growing concern. These concerns include whether [[email]] can be stored or read by third parties without consent, or whether third parties can continue to track the websites that someone has visited. Another concern is if the websites that are visited can collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about users.

The advent of various [[Web search engine|search engines]] and the use of [[data mining]] created a capability for data about individuals to be collected and combined from a wide variety of sources very easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2006-06-18-data-mining-privacy_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Research explores data mining, privacy | date=2006-06-18 | accessdate=2010-05-05 | first=Brian | last=Bergstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/154986_privacychallenge02.html | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first=Brian | last=Bergstein | title=In this data-mining society, privacy advocates shudder | date=2004-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/21472572/u-s-demands-google-web-data | work=Information Management Journal | title=U.S. Demands Google Web Data | year=2006 | first=Nikki | last=Swartz }} Vol. 40 Issue 3, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC has provided a set of guidelines that represent widely accepted concepts concerning fair information practices in an electronic marketplace called the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

In order not to give away too much personal information, emails should be encrypted. Browsing of web pages as well as other online activities should be done trace-less via "anonymizers", in case those are not trusted, by open-source distributed anonymizers, so called [[mix net]]s, such as [[I2P]] or [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor – The Onion Router]].

Email isn't the only internet content with privacy concerns. In an age where increasing amounts of information are going online, social networking sites pose additional privacy challenges. People may be tagged in photos or have valuable information exposed about themselves either by choice or unexpectedly by others. Caution should be exercised with what information is being posted, as social networks vary in what they allow users to make private and what remains publicly accessible.&lt;ref name="SchneiderTheInter08"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1fQdrzxAPoC&amp;pg=PA17-IA137 |title=The Internet: Illustrated Series |author=Schneider, G.; Evans, J.; Pinard, K.T. |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=156 |year=2008 |isbn=9781423999386 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without strong security settings in place and careful attention to what remains public, a person can be profiled by searching for and collecting disparate pieces of information, worst case leading to cases of [[cyberstalking]]&lt;ref name="BocijCyber04"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age and How to Protect Your Family |author=Bocij, P. |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |pages=268 |year=2004 |isbn=9780275981181}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reputational damage.&lt;ref name="CannataciPrivacy16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGC_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Privacy, free expression and transparency: Redefining their new boundaries in the digital age |author=Cannataci, J.A.; Zhao, B.; Vives, G.T. et al. |publisher=UNESCO |page=26 |year=2016 |isbn=9789231001888 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cable television ===
This describes the ability to control what information one reveals about oneself over cable television, and who can access that information. For example, third parties can track IP TV programs someone has watched at any given time. "The addition of any information in a broadcasting stream is not required for an audience rating survey, additional devices are not requested to be installed in the houses of viewers or listeners, and without the necessity of their cooperations, audience ratings can be automatically performed in real-time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2010/0011389.html | work=FreePatentsOnline.com | title=System for Gathering TV Audience Rating in Real Time in Internet Protocol Television Network and Method Thereof| date=2010-01-14 | accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical ===
{{Main|Medical privacy}}

People may not wish for their medical records to be revealed to others. This may be because they have concern that it might affect their insurance coverages or employment. Or, it may be because they would not wish for others to know about any medical or psychological conditions or treatments that would bring embarrassment upon themselves. Revealing medical data could also reveal other details about one's personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2011_submissions/341/|title=The Economic Effect of Privacy Breach Announcements on Stocks: A Comprehensive Empirical Investigation|first1=Nicholas-Donald,|last1=Aurelia|first2=Matus, Jesus|last2=Francisco|first3=Ryu,|last3=SeungEui|first4=Mahmood, Adam|last4=M|date=1 June 2017|website=aisnet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three major categories of medical privacy: informational (the degree of control over personal information), physical (the degree of physical inaccessibility to others), and psychological (the extent to which the doctor respects patients’ cultural beliefs, inner thoughts, values, feelings, and religious practices and allows them to make personal decisions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Serenko|first=Natalia|author2=Lida Fan|title=Patients’ Perceptions of Privacy and Their Outcomes in Healthcare|journal=International Journal of Behavioural and Healthcare Research |year=2013|url=http://aserenko.com/IJBHR_Serenko_Fan.pdf|volume = 4|issue=2|pages= 101–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Physicians and psychiatrists in many cultures and countries have standards for [[doctor-patient relationship]]s, which include maintaining confidentiality. In some cases, the [[physician-patient privilege]] is legally protected. These practices are in place to protect the dignity of patients, and to ensure that patients will feel free to reveal complete and accurate information required for them to receive the correct treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/everyday-law-encyclopedia/doctor-patient-confidentiality|title=If a patient is below the age of 18-years does confidentiality still works or should doctor breach and inform the parents?15years girl went for... - eNotes|website=eNotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To view the United States' laws on governing privacy of private health information, see [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|HITECH Act]].

=== Financial ===
{{Main|Financial privacy}}
Information about a person's financial transactions, including the amount of assets, positions held in stocks or funds, outstanding debts, and purchases can be sensitive. If criminals gain access to information such as a person's accounts or credit card numbers, that person could become the victim of [[fraud]] or [[identity theft]].  Information about a person's purchases can reveal a great deal about that person's history, such as places he/she has visited, whom he/she has contacted with, products he/she has used, his/her activities and habits, or medications he/she has used. In some cases, corporations may use this information to target individuals with [[marketing]] customized towards those individual's personal preferences, which that person may or may not approve.

=== Locational ===
As location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are advancing ([[location-based service]]s), problems related to user privacy arise. Location data is among the most sensitive data currently being collected.&lt;ref name="AtaeiEphem16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BdADQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360 |title=Progress in Location-Based Services 2016 |chapter=Ephemerality Is the New Black: A Novel Perspective on Location Data Management and Location Privacy in LBS |author=Ataei, M.; Kray, C. |publisher=Springer |pages=357–374 |year=2016 |isbn=9783319472898 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of potentially sensitive professional and personal information that could be inferred about an individual knowing only his mobility trace was published recently by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blumberg, A. Eckersley, P.|title=On locational privacy and how to avoid losing it forever.|url=https://www.eff.org/wp/locational-privacy|publisher=EFF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the movements of a competitor sales force, attendance of a particular church or an individual's presence in a motel, or at an abortion clinic. A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by de Montjoye et al. showed that four spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

=== Political ===
{{Main|Political privacy}}
[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] is the simplest and most widespread measure to ensure that political views are not known to anyone other than the voters themselves—it is nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered to be a basic right of [[citizenship]]. In fact, even where other rights of [[privacy]] do not exist, this type of privacy very often does.

=== Educational ===
In the United Kingdom in 2012, the Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] described the [[National Pupil Database]] as a "rich dataset" whose value could be "maximised" by making it more openly accessible, including to private companies. Kelly Fiveash of ''[[The Register]]'' said that this could mean "a child's school life including exam results, attendance, teacher assessments and even characteristics" could be available, with third-party organizations being responsible for anonymizing any publications themselves, rather than the data being anonymized by the government before being handed over. An example of a data request that Gove indicated had been rejected in the past, but might be possible under an improved version of privacy regulations, was for "analysis on sexual exploitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/08/national_pupil_database_regulation_overhaul_in_private_sector_data_grab/|title=Psst: Heard the one about the National Pupil Database? Thought not|date=2012-11-08|accessdate=2012-12-12|work=[[The Register]]|last=Fiveash|first=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
{{Main|Information privacy law}}

The legal protection of the right to [[privacy]] in general – and of data privacy in particular – varies greatly around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&amp;context=bjil|title=Blurred Line: Zooming in on Google Street View and the Global Right to Privacy|last=Rakower|first=Lauren|date=2011|website=brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005101128/http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&amp;context=bjil|archive-date=2017-10-05|dead-url=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safe Harbor program and passenger name record issues ==
The [[United States Department of Commerce]] created the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] certification program in response to the [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|1995 Directive on Data Protection]] (Directive 95/46/EC) of the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/law/index_en.htm|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directive 95/46/EC declares in Chapter IV Article 25 that personal data may only be transferred from the countries in the [[European Economic Area]] to countries which provide [[adequate]] privacy protection. Historically, establishing adequacy required the creation of national laws broadly equivalent to those implemented by Directive 95/46/EU. Although there are exceptions to this blanket prohibition – for example where the disclosure to a country outside the EEA is made with the consent of the relevant individual (Article 26(1)(a)) – they are limited in practical scope.  As a result, Article 25 created a legal risk to organisations which transfer personal data from Europe to the United States.

The program regulates the exchange of [[passenger name record]] information between the EU and the US. According to the EU directive, personal data may only be transferred to third countries if that country provides an adequate level of protection. Some exceptions to this rule are provided, for instance when the controller himself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rules.

The [[European Commission]] has set up the "Working party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data," commonly known as the "Article 29 Working Party".  The Working Party gives advice about the level of protection in the European Union and third countries.

The Working Party negotiated with U.S. representatives about the protection of personal data, the [[Safe Harbor Principles]] were the result. Notwithstanding that approval, the self-assessment approach of the Safe Harbor remains controversial with a number of European privacy regulators and commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/sec-2004-1323_en.pdf|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Safe Harbor program addresses this issue in the following way: rather than a blanket law imposed on all organisations in the [[United States]], a voluntary program is enforced by the FTC. U.S. organisations which register with this program, having self-assessed their compliance with a number of standards, are "deemed adequate" for the purposes of Article 25. Personal information can be sent to such organisations from the EEA without the sender being in breach of Article 25 or its EU national equivalents.  The Safe Harbor was approved as providing adequate protection for personal data, for the purposes of Article 25(6), by the European Commission on 26 July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000D0520:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex – 32000D0520 – EN|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Safe Harbor, adoptee organisations need to carefully consider their compliance with the ''onward transfer obligations'', where personal data originating in the EU is transferred to the US Safe Harbor, and then onward to a third country. The alternative compliance approach of "[[binding corporate rules]]", recommended by many EU privacy regulators, resolves this issue.  In addition, any dispute arising in relation to the transfer of HR data to the US Safe Harbor must be heard by a panel of EU privacy regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/information_safe_harbour_en.pdf|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, a new, controversial,&lt;ref name=R89 /&gt; [[Passenger Name Record]] agreement between the US and the EU was made.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120112021643/http://www.libertysecurity.org/article1591.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NOTE: Archive-only. Domain usage has changed.--&gt; A short time afterwards, the [[Presidency of George W.

== Protecting privacy in information systems ==
As heterogeneous information systems with differing privacy rules are interconnected and information is shared, [[policy appliances]] will be required to reconcile, enforce, and monitor an increasing amount of privacy policy rules (and laws). There are two categories of technology to address privacy protection in [[Commerce|commercial]] IT systems: communication and enforcement.

;Policy communication
* [[P3P]] – The Platform for Privacy Preferences.  P3P is a standard for communicating privacy practices and comparing them to the preferences of individuals.

;Policy enforcement
* [[XACML]] – The Extensible Access Control Markup Language together with its Privacy Profile is a standard for expressing privacy policies in a machine-readable language which a software system can use to enforce the policy in enterprise IT systems.
* [[Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language|EPAL]] – The Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language is very similar to XACML, but is not yet a standard.
* WS-Privacy - "Web Service Privacy" will be a specification for communicating privacy policy in [[web service]]s.  For example, it may specify how privacy policy information can be embedded in the [[SOAP]] envelope of a web service message.

;Protecting privacy on the internet
On the internet many users give away a lot of information about themselves: unencrypted e-mails can be read by the administrators of an [[e-mail server]], if the connection is not encrypted (no [[HTTPS]]), and also the [[internet service provider]] and other parties [[packet analyzer|sniffing]] the network traffic of that connection are able to know the contents.
The same applies to any kind of traffic generated on the Internet, including [[web browsing]], [[instant messenger|instant messaging]], and others.
In order not to give away too much personal information, e-mails can be encrypted and browsing of webpages as well as other online activities can be done traceless via [[anonymizer]]s, or by open source distributed anonymizers, so-called [[mix network]]s.
Well known open-source mix nets include  [[I2P|I2P – The Anonymous Network]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

=== Improving privacy through individualization ===

Computer privacy can be improved through [[forensic identification|individualization]]. Currently security messages are designed for the "average user", i.e. the same message for everyone.  Researchers have posited that individualized messages and security "nudges", crafted based on users' individual differences and personality traits, can be used for further improvements for each person's compliance with computer security and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://blues.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/2015/08/26/the-myth-of-the-average-user-improving-privacy-and-security-systems-through-individualization-nspw-15/|title = The Myth of the Average User: Improving Privacy and Security Systems through Individualization (NSPW ’15) {{!}} BLUES|website = blues.cs.berkeley.edu|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
Īśvarapraṇidhāna is a Sanskrit compound word composed of two words ''īśvara'' (ईश्वर) and ''praṇidhāna'' (प्रणिधान).  ''Īśvara'' (sometimes spelled Īshvara) literally means "owner of best, beautiful", "ruler of choices, blessings, boons", or "chief of suitor, lover". Later religious literature in Sanskrit broadens the reference of this term to refer to God, the Absolute [[Brahman]], True Self, or Unchanging Reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php?input=HK&amp;output=SktDevaUnicode&amp;key=Izvara Izvara] ईश्वर, Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; ''Praṇidhāna'' is used to mean a range of senses including, "laying on, fixing, applying, attention (paid to), meditation, desire, prayer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monier-Williams|first1=Monier|title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php?input=HK&amp;output=SktDevaUnicode&amp;key=praNidhAna|website=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a religious translation of Patanjali's Eight-Limbed Yoga, the word ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' means committing what one does to a Lord, who is elsewhere in the [[Yoga Sūtras]] defined as a special person (puruṣa) who is the first teacher (paramaguru) and is free of all hindrances and karma. In more secular terms, it means acceptance, teachability, relaxing expectations, adventurousness.   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patanjali|title=Patanjalayogaśāstra|url=http://sarit.indology.info/exist/apps/sarit/works/p%C4%81ta%C3%B1jalayoga%C5%9B%C4%81stra.s%C5%AB.1.24.html?action=search#1.3.4.2.26.2.4|ref=PYS1.24|location=YS 1.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
===Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali===
''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' is mentioned in the [[Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali]] as follows:&lt;ref name=pys/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sanskrit: {{IAST|'''शौच संतोष तपः स्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि नियमाः''' ॥23॥}}&lt;br&gt;
– Yoga Sutras I.23&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This transliterates as, "[[Shaucha|Śauca]], [[Santosha|Santoṣa]], [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]], [[Svādhyāya]] and Īśvarapraṇidhāna are the Niyamas". This is the second limb in Patañjali's eight limb [[Raja yoga|Yoga]] philosophy is called ''niyamas'' which include virtuous habits, behaviors and ethical observances (the "dos").&lt;ref&gt;N Tummers (2009), Teaching Yoga for Life, {{ISBN|978-0736070164}}, page 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y Sawai (1987), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3270048 The Nature of Faith in the Śaṅkaran Vedānta Tradition], Numen, Vol. 34, Fasc. 1 (Jun., 1987), pages 18-44&lt;/ref&gt; The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali use the term ''Īśvara'' in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Patañjali defines ''Īśvara'' (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as "a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, ''puruṣa-viśeṣa'')",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K. S.|title=Pātañjalayogasūtrāṇi|date=1904|publisher=Ānandāśrama|location=Puṇe|page=25|url=https://archive.org/stream/patanjaliyoga/yoga_sutras_three_commentaries#page/n33/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sanskrit: {{IAST|क्लेश कर्म विपाकाशयैःपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेष '''ईश्वरः''' ॥२४॥}}&lt;br&gt;
– Yoga Sutras I.24&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sutra of Yoga philosophy adds the characteristics of ''Īśvara'' as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, ''aparamrsta'') by one's obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, ''klesha''), one's circumstances created by past or one's current actions (कर्म, ''karma''), one's life fruits (विपाक, ''vipâka''), and one's psychological dispositions/intentions (आशय, ashaya).&lt;ref name=se5&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=aparAmRSTa&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes aparAmRSTa], [http://spokensanskrit.de kleza, karma, vipaka and ashaya]; Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Īśvarapraṇidhāna is listed as the fifth [[niyama]] by Patañjali. In other forms of yoga, it is the tenth niyama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/776 The Practice of Surrender] Yoga Journal (August 28 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism, the [[Niyamas]] are the "do list" and the [[Yamas]] are the "don't do" list, both part of an ethical theory for life.

===Īśvara as a metaphysical concept===
Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is ''Īśvara''. These commentaries range from defining Īśhvara from a "personal god" to "special self" to "anything that has spiritual significance to the individual".&lt;ref name=lpfl&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Parabhaktisutra, Aporisms on Sublime Devotion, (Translator: A Chatterjee), in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 55-93; Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Eternally Liberated Isvara and Purusa Principle, in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Whicher explains that while Patañjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patañjali's concept of Īśvara in Yoga philosophy functions as a "transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; Desmarais states that Īśvara is a metaphysical concept in Yogasutras.&lt;ref name=mmd&gt;Michele Marie Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patañjali's Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120833364}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' is investing, occupying the mind with this metaphysical concept. Yogasutra does not mention deity anywhere, nor does it mention any devotional practices (''[[Bhakti]]''), nor does it give Īśvara characteristics typically associated with a deity. In yoga sutras it is a logical construct, states Desmarais.&lt;ref name=mmd/&gt; 

In verses I.27 and I.28, yogasutras associate Īśvara with the concept ''Pranava'' (प्रणव, ॐ) and recommends that it be repeated and contemplated in one of the limbs of eight step yoga.&lt;ref name=mmd132&gt;Michele Marie Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patañjali's Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120833364}}, page 132-136&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen as a means to begin the process of dissociating from external world, connecting with one's inner world, focusing and getting one-minded in [[Raja yoga|Yoga]].&lt;ref name=mmd132/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Yogasutra I.28 and I.29; {{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K. S.|title=Pātañjalayogasūtrāṇi|date=1904|publisher=Ānandāśrama|location=Puṇe|page=33|url=https://archive.org/stream/patanjaliyoga/yoga_sutras_three_commentaries#page/n41/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whicher states that Patañjali's concept of Īśvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism. Whicher also notes that some theistic sub-schools of Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, inspired by the Yoga school, prefer to explain the term ''Īśvara'' as the "Supreme Being that rules over the cosmos and the individuated beings".&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt; However, in the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali, and extensive literature of Yoga school of Hinduism, Īśvara is not a Supreme Ruler, Īśvara is not an [[ontology|ontological]] concept, rather it has been an abstract concept to meet the [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] needs for human beings accepting Yoga philosophy as a way of life.&lt;ref name=ianw&gt;Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pages 82-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Knut Jacobsen]] (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Īśvara as a deity===
''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' has been interpreted to mean the contemplation of a deity in some sub-schools of Hinduism. Zimmer in his 1951 Indian philosophies book noted that the Bhakti sub-schools, and its texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, refer to Isvara as a Divine Lord, or the deity of specific Bhakti sub-school.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer (1951), Philosophies of India, Reprinted by Routledge in 2008, {{ISBN|978-0415462327}}, pages 242-243, 309-311&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sectarian movements have emphasized Ishvara as Supreme Lord; for example, [[ISKCON|Hare Krishna]] movement considers Krishna as the Lord,&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1997), A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700710492}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Brahmoism]] movements – influenced by Christian and Islamic movements in India – conceptualize Ishvara as a monotheistic all powerful Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Rk Pruthi (2004), Arya Samaj and Indian Civilization, {{ISBN|978-8171417803}}, pages 5-6, 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional theistic sub-schools of Hinduism, such as the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] of Ramanuja and [[Dvaita|Dvaita Vedanta]] of Madhva, Ishvara is identified as Lord Vishnu/Narayana, that is distinct from the ''Prakriti'' (material world) and ''Purusa'' (soul, spirit). In all these sub-schools, ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' is the contemplation of the respective deity.

Radhakrishnan and Moore state that these variations in Īśvara concept is consistent with Hinduism's notion of "personal God" where the "ideals or manifestation of individual's highest Self values that are esteemed".&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan and Moore (1967, Reprinted 1989), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019581}}, pages 37-39, 401-403, 498-503&lt;/ref&gt; ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'', or contemplation of Īśvara as a deity is useful, suggests Zaehner, because it helps the individual become more like Īśhvara. Riepe, and others,&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73&gt;Mircea Eliade (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691142036}}, pages 73-76&lt;/ref&gt; state that the literature of Yoga school of Hinduism neither explicitly defines nor implicitly implies, any creator-god; rather, it leaves the individual with freedom and choice of conceptualizing Īśvara in any meaningful manner he or she wishes, either in the form of "deity of one's choice" or "formless [[Brahman]] (Absolute Reality, Universal Principle, true special Self)".&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1961, Reprinted 1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 177-184, 208-215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1975), Our savage god: The perverse use of eastern thought, {{ISBN|978-0836206111}}, pages 69-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1966), Hinduism, Oxford University Press, 1980 edition: pages 126-129, Reprinted in 1983 as {{ISBN|978-0198880127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need and purpose of Īśvara, whatever be the abstraction of it as "special kind of Self" or "personal deity", is not an end in itself, rather it is a means to "perfect the practice of concentration" in one's journey through the eight limbs of Yoga philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Woods (1914, Reprinted in 2003), [https://archive.org/stream/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft#page/48/mode/2up Yoga system of Patanjali], Harvard University Press, pages 48-59, 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73/&gt;

===Īśvara as pure consciousness===
Larson suggests Īśvara in ''Īśvarapraṇidhāna'' can be understood through its chronological roots. [[Raja yoga|Yoga]] school of Hinduism developed on the foundation of [[Samkhya]] school of Hinduism. In the non-theistic/atheistic Samkhya school, ''Purusa'' is a central metaphysical concept, and envisioned as "pure consciousness". Further, ''Purusa'' is described by Samkhya school to exist in a "plurality of pure consciousness" in its epistemological theory (rather than to meet the needs of its ontological theory).&lt;ref name=ianw80&gt;Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pages 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N Iyer (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; In the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali defines ''Īśhvara'' as a "special Purusa" in verse I.24, with certain characteristics. Īśhvara, then may be understood as one among the plurality of "pure consciousness", with characteristics as defined by Patanjali in verse I.24.&lt;ref name=ianw80/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 32-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Īśvara as spiritual but not religious===
Van Ness, and others,&lt;ref&gt;B Pradhan (2014), Yoga: Original Concepts and History. In Yoga and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, Springer Switzerland, {{ISBN|978-3-319-09104-4}}, pages 3-36&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the concepts of Īśvara, Īśvara-pranidhana and other limbs of Yoga may be pragmatically understood as "spiritual but not religious".&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Van Ness (1999), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27944075 Yoga as Spiritual but not Religious: A pragmatic perspective], American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy, Vol. 20, No. 1 (January 1999), pages 15-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff (2011), Yoga - Philosophy for Everyone: Bending Mind and Body, Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-0470658802}}, Foreword by John Friend and Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6279">'''Kneecapping''' is a form of malicious wounding, often as [[torture]], in which the victim is injured in the [[knee]]. The injury is typically inflicted by a low-velocity [[ballistic trauma|gunshot]] to the [[popliteal fossa|knee pit]] with a [[handgun]]. The term is considered a misnomer by medical professionals because only a very small minority of victims suffer damage to the [[patella|kneecap]]. A review of eighty kneecapping victims found that only two had a fractured kneecap. Some victims have their [[elbow]]s and [[ankle]]s shot as well.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|pp=740–741}}

== Treatment ==
The severity of the injury can vary from simple [[soft tissue]] damage to a knee joint fracture with [[neurovascular bundle|neurovascular]] damage. The latter requires several weeks in hospital and intensive [[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient]] [[physical therapy|physiotherapy]] for recovery.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|pp=740–741}} If the damage is too great, [[amputation]] might be necessary,{{sfn|Williams|1997|p=79}} but this rarely occurs. In Northern Ireland thirteen individuals had their legs amputated as a consequence of limb punishment shootings over the duration of [[the Troubles]].{{sfn|Graham|Parke|2004|p=229}} In the long term it is estimated that one out of five victims will walk with a [[limp]] for the rest of their lives.{{sfn|Conroy|1980}}

== History ==
During [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], paramilitaries considered themselves to be law enforcers in their own areas. They used limb punishment shootings to punish drug pushers and child molesters. If the crime was considered to be grave, the victim was also shot in the ankles and elbows, leaving them with six gunshot wounds (colloquially known as a six pack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Duncan|title=Northern Ireland kneecapping victim 'shot four times'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/10056251/northern-ireland-kneecapping-victim-shot-four-times|accessdate=29 October 2016|work=BBC Newbeat|date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2,500 people were victims of these punishment shootings through the duration of the conflict. Those who were attacked carried a [[social stigma]] with them.{{sfn|Williams|1997|pp=78–80}}

The [[Red Brigades]], an [[Italy|Italian]] militant organization, employed these punishment shootings to warn their opponents. They used the method to punish at least 75 people up to December 1978.{{sfn|Orsini|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8dx0xaO__78C&amp;pg=PT13 13], [https://books.google.com/books?id=8dx0xaO__78C&amp;pg=PT121 121]}} More recently this kind of punishment shooting has been employed by [[Hamas]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] to silence their political opponents.{{sfn|Amnesty International UK|2009}}{{sfn|Amnesty International Ireland|2009|p=3}}

The [[Bangladesh Police]] have started kneecapping in the country since 2009 to punish the opposition and preventing them from participating in protests against the government. [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) has published a report on kneecapping in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/29/bangladesh-stop-kneecapping-detainees|title=Bangladesh: Stop ‘Kneecapping’ Detainees|date=29 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In The [[United Kingdom]] although not too common apart from [[Northern Ireland]], when kneecappings have occurred elsewhere a sawn-off or double barrelled shotgun is more likely the choice of firearm due to its easy availability over other weapons among criminals.

==Use as metaphor==
As a [[metaphor]]  "kneecapping" suggests being limited by external imposition in a way that prevents full freedom of movement or utilization of resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''limit''' or a '''colimit''' of [[presheaf (category theory)|presheaves]] on a category ''C'' is a limit or colimit in the functor category &lt;math&gt;\widehat{C} = \mathbf{Fct}(C^{\text{op}}, \mathbf{Set})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;'''Notes on the foundation''': the notation '''Set''' implicitly assumes that there is the notion of a small set; i.e., one has made a choice of a [[Grothendieck universe]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The category &lt;math&gt;\widehat{C}&lt;/math&gt; admits small [[limit (category theory)|limit]]s and small [[colimit (category theory)|colimit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kashiwara–Schapira|loc=Corollary 2.4.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly, if &lt;math&gt;f: I \to \widehat{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a functor from a small category ''I'' and ''U'' is an object in ''C'', then &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim_{i \in I} f(i)&lt;/math&gt; is computed pointwise:

:&lt;math&gt;(\varinjlim f(i))(U) = \varinjlim f(i)(U).&lt;/math&gt;

The same is true for small limits. Concretely this means that, for example, a fiber product exists and is computed pointwise.

When ''C'' is small, by the Yoneda lemma, one can view ''C'' as the full subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{C}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\eta: C \to D&lt;/math&gt; is a functor, if &lt;math&gt;f: I \to C&lt;/math&gt; is a functor from a small category ''I'' and if the colimit &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\widehat{C}&lt;/math&gt; is representable; i.e., isomorphic to an object in ''C'', then,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kashiwara–Schapira|loc=Proposition 2.6.4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''D'',

: &lt;math&gt;\eta(\varinjlim f) \simeq \varinjlim \eta \circ f,&lt;/math&gt;

(in particular the colimit on the right exists in ''D''.)

The [[Density theorem (category theory)|density theorem]] states that every presheaf is a colimit of representable presheaves.

In [[philosophy]], '''moral responsibility''' is the status of [[morality|morally]] [[desert (philosophy)|deserving]] [[praise]], [[blame]], [[reward (psychology)|reward]], or [[punishment]] for an act or omission performed or neglected in accordance with one's [[moral obligation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Klein |first= Martha |authorlink= Martha Klein |editor-first= Ted |editor-last= Honderich |editor-link = Ted Honderich | encyclopedia = Oxford Companion to Philosophy | title = responsibility | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001/acref-9780199264797-e-2205 | year = 2005 | quote = The term 'moral responsibility' covers (i) the having of a moral obligation and (ii) the fulfilment of the criteria for deserving blame or praise (punishment or reward) for a morally significant act or omission.}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Deciding what (if anything) counts as "morally obligatory" is a principal concern of [[ethics]].

Philosophers refer to people who have moral responsibility for an action as [[moral agents]]. Agents have the capability to reflect upon their situation, to form [[intention]]s about how they will act, and then to carry out that action. The notion of [[free will]] has become an important issue in the debate on whether individuals are ever morally responsible for their actions and, if so, in what sense. [[Incompatibilist]]s regard determinism as at odds with free will, whereas [[compatibilist]]s think the two can coexist.
 
Moral responsibility does not necessarily equate to [[legal liability |legal responsibility]]. A person is legally responsible for an event when a legal system is liable to penalise that person for that event. Although it may often be the case that when a person is morally responsible for an act, they are also legally responsible for it, the two states do not always coincide.{{Citation needed|date= September 2011}}

==Philosophical stance==
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|220px|Various philosophical positions exist, disagreeing over [[determinism]] and free will]]
Depending on how a philosopher conceives of [[free will]], they will have different views on moral responsibility.&lt;ref name=Cave&gt;{{cite book |title=Responsibility in Law and Morality |author=Peter Cave |page =4 |quote=A common argument in the philosophical literature is that the essence of responsibility is to be found in what it means to be a human agent and to have free will...There is disagreement amongst philosophers about what freedom means, about whether human beings are free in the relevant sense, and about the relevance of freedom to responsibility... Nevertheless,...our responsibility practices have developed, and thrive, independently of ‘the truth’ about human freedom.|isbn=1841133213 |year=2002 |publisher=Hart Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incompatibilism===
{{main article|Incompatibilism}}

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{main article|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[Metaphysical libertarian]]s think actions are not always causally determined, allowing for the possibility of free will and thus moral responsibility. All libertarians are also incompatibilists; they think that if causal determinism were true of human action; people would not have free will. Accordingly, libertarians subscribe to the principle of alternate possibilities, which posits that moral responsibility requires that people could have acted differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woolfolk, Robert L.|first=Doris, John M., and Brianna, John M.|contribution=Identification, Situational Constraint, and Social Cognition: Studies in the Attribution of Moral Responsibility|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenomenological considerations are sometimes invoked by incompatibilists to defend a libertarian position. In daily life, we feel as though choosing otherwise is a viable option. Although this feeling doesn't firmly establish the existence of free will, some incompatibilists claim the phenomenological feeling of alternate possibilities is a prerequisite for free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nahmias, Eddy, |first=Morris, Stephen G., Nadelhoffer, Thomas N., and Turner, Jason|contribution=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] suggested that people sometimes avoid incrimination and responsibility by hiding behind determinism: "...we are always ready to take refuge in a belief in determinism if this freedom weighs upon us or if we need an excuse".&lt;ref name="Sartre2"&gt;Sartre, J.P. (1943)''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar view has it that individual moral culpability lies in individual character. That is, a person with the character of a murderer has no choice other than to murder, but can still be punished because it is right to punish those of bad character. How one's character was determined is irrelevant from this perspective. Robert Cummins, for example, argues that people should not be judged for their individual actions, but rather for how those actions "reflect on their character". If character (however defined) is the dominant causal factor in determining one's choices, and one's choices are morally wrong, then one should be held accountable for those choices, regardless of genes and other such factors.&lt;ref&gt;Vuoso, G. (1987) "Background Responsibility and Excuse," ''Yale Law Journal'', 96, pp. 1680–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, R. "Culpability" and Mental Disorder", p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, there is a known exception to the assumption that moral culpability lies in either individual character or freely willed acts. The [[insanity defense]]—or its corollary, [[diminished responsibility]] (a sort of appeal to the [[fallacy of the single cause]])—can be used to argue that the guilty deed was not the product of a guilty mind.&lt;ref name = "Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, A. M., Morse, S. J. &amp; Shapiro, D. L. 2003 "Evaluation of criminal responsibility". In ''Forensic psychology.'' vol. 11 (ed. A. M. Goldstein), pp. 381–406. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, the legal systems of most Western societies assume that the person is in some way not at fault, because his actions were a consequence of abnormal brain function (implying brain function is a deterministic causal agent of mind and motive).

=====The argument from luck=====

The argument from luck is a criticism against the libertarian conception of moral responsibility. It suggests that any given action, and even a person's character, is the result of various forces outside that person's control. It may not be reasonable, then, to hold that person solely morally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/|title=Moral Luck|date=January 26, 2004|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Nagel]] suggests that four different types of luck (including genetic influences and other external factors) end up influencing the way that a person's actions are evaluated morally. For instance, a person driving drunk may make it home without incident, and yet this action of ''drunk driving'' might seem more morally objectionable if someone happens to jaywalk along his path (getting hit by the car).&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. 1976, "Moral Luck", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary vol. 50: 137–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument can be traced back to [[David Hume]]. If physical indeterminism is true, then those events that are not determined are scientifically described as probabilistic or random. It is therefore argued that it is doubtful that one can praise or blame someone for performing an action generated randomly by his nervous system (without there being any non-physical agency responsible for the observed probabilistic outcome).&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main article|Hard determinism}}
[[Hard determinist]]s (not to be confused with [[Fatalist]]s) often use [[liberty]] in practical moral considerations, rather than a notion of a free will. Indeed, faced with the possibility that determinism requires a completely different moral system, some proponents say "So much the worse for free will!".&lt;ref name="Ben1"&gt;Benditt, Theodore (1998) ''Philosophy Then and Now'' with eds. Arnold and Graham. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55786-742-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarence Darrow]], the famous defense attorney, pleaded the innocence of his clients, [[Leopold and Loeb]], by invoking such a notion of hard determinism.&lt;ref name="Darrow"&gt;Darrow, Clarence, 1924, "The Plea of Clarence Darrow, in Defense of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, Jr., On Trial for Murder" page reference is to the reprint in Philosophical Explorations: Freedom, God, and Goodness, S. Cahn (ed.), New York: Prometheus Books, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; During his summation, he declared:

{{quote|What has this boy to do with it? He was not his own father; he was not his own mother; he was not his own grandparents. All of this was handed to him. He did not surround himself with governesses and wealth. He did not make himself. And yet he is to be compelled to pay.&lt;ref name="Darrow"/&gt;}}

[[Paul the Apostle]], in his [[Epistle to the Romans]] addresses the question of moral responsibility as follows: "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"&lt;ref&gt;St. Paul, "Epistle to the Romans", 9:21, ''King James Bible'' Tennessee:The Gideons International&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, individuals can still be dishonoured for their acts even though those acts were ultimately completely determined by God.

Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen, researchers in the emerging field of [[neuroethics]], argue, on the basis of such cases, that our current notion of moral responsibility is founded on libertarian (and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]]) intuitions.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, J. Cohen, J. (2004). "For the law, neuroscience changes nothing and everything". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B'', 359, 1775–1785.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research (e.g. [[neuroscience of free will]]) is undermining these intuitions by showing that the brain is responsible for our actions, not only in cases of florid [[psychosis]], but also in less obvious situations. For example, damage to the [[frontal lobe]] reduces the ability to weigh uncertain risks and make prudent decisions, and therefore leads to an increased likelihood that someone will commit a violent crime.&lt;ref name = "Brower"&gt;Brower M.C. and Price B.H. (2001). "Neuropsychiatry of frontal lobe dysfunction in violent and criminal behaviour: a critical review". ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry'', 71: 720–726.&lt;/ref&gt; This is true not only of patients with damage to the frontal lobe due to accident or stroke, but also of adolescents, who show reduced frontal lobe activity compared to adults,&lt;ref name = "SteinScott"&gt;Steinberg, L., Scott, E. S. (2003). "Less guilty by reason of adolescence: developmental immaturity, diminished responsibility, and the juvenile death penalty".''American Psychologist'' 58, 1009–1018.&lt;/ref&gt; and even of children who are chronically neglected or mistreated.&lt;ref name = "TAPANK"&gt;Teicher, M. H., Anderson, S. L., Polcari, A., Anderson, C. M., Navalta, C. P., and Kim, D. M. (2003). "The neurobiological consequences of early stress and childhood maltreatment". ''Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews'', 27: 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the guilty party can, they argue, be said to have less responsibility for his actions.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt; Greene and Cohen predict that, as such examples become more common and well known, jurors’ interpretations of free will and moral responsibility will move away from the intuitive libertarian notion that currently underpins them.

[[File:Prision del Condado de Mantras.JPG|thumb|right|180px|David Eagleman explains that nature and nurture cause all criminal behavior. He likewise believes that science demands that change and improvement, rather than guilt, must become the focus of the legal justice system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/05/david-eagleman-on-morality-and-the-brain.html David Eagleman, Philosophy Bites Podcast, "David Eagleman on Morality and the Brain"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Greene and Cohen also argue that the legal system does not require this libertarian interpretation. Rather, they suggest that only retributive notions of [[justice]], in which the goal of the legal system is to punish people for misdeeds, require the libertarian intuition. Many forms of [[Ethical realism|ethically realistic]] and [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] approaches to justice, which are aimed at promoting future welfare rather than retribution, can survive even a hard determinist interpretation of free will. Accordingly, the legal system and notions of justice can thus be maintained even in the face of emerging neuroscientific evidence undermining libertarian intuitions of free will.

Neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] maintains similar ideas. Eagleman says that the legal justice system ought to become more forward looking. He says it is wrong to ask questions of narrow culpability, rather than focusing on what is important: what needs to change in a criminal's behavior and brain. Eagleman is not saying that no one is responsible for their crimes, but rather that the "sentencing phase" should correspond with modern neuroscientific evidence. To Eagleman, it is damaging to entertain the illusion that a person can make a single decision that is somehow, suddenly, independent of their physiology and history. He describes what scientists have learned from brain damaged patients, and offers the case of a school teacher who exhibited escalating [[pedophile|pedophilic]] tendencies on two occasions—each time as results of growing tumors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2943-brain-tumour-causes-uncontrollable-paedophilia.htmlNewScientist.com, "Brain tumour causes uncontrollable paedophilia"]&lt;/ref&gt; Eagleman also warns that less attractive people and minorities tend to get longer sentencing—all of which he sees as symptoms that more science is needed in the legal system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman/&gt;

====Hard incompatibilism====
[[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] defends a skeptical position about free will he calls [[hard incompatibilism]]. In his view, we cannot have free will if our actions are causally determined by factors beyond our control, or if our actions are indeterministic events—if they happen by chance. Pereboom conceives of free will as the control in action required for moral responsibility in the sense involving deserved blame and praise, punishment and reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pereboom|first1=Derk|title=Living without Free Will|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he acknowledges that libertarian agent causation, the capacity of agents as substances to cause actions without being causally determined by factors beyond their control, is still a possibility, he regards it as unlikely against the backdrop of the most defensible physical theories. Without libertarian agent causation, Pereboom thinks the free will required for moral responsibility in the desert-involving sense is not in the offing.&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pereboom|first=Derk|title="Defending Hard Incompatibilism". In "Free Will and Moral Responsibility." |year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Inc.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=1-4051-3810-6|pages=228–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also contends that by contrast with the backward-looking, desert-involving sense of moral responsibility, forward-looking senses are compatible with causal determination. For instance, causally determined agents who act badly might justifiably be blamed with the aim of forming faulty character, reconciling impaired relationships, and protecting others from harm they are apt to cause.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2014), 'Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life', Oxford: Oxford University Press, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereboom proposes that a viable criminal jurisprudence is compatible with the denial of deserved blame and punishment. His view rules out retributivist justifications for punishment, but it allows for incapacitation of dangerous criminals on the analogy with quarantine of carriers of dangerous diseases. Isolation of carriers of the Ebola virus can be justified on the ground of the right to defend against threat, a justification that does not reference desert. Pereboom contends that the analogy holds for incapacitation of dangerous criminals. He also argues that the less serious the threat, the more moderate the justifiable method of incapacitation; for certain crimes only monitoring may be needed. In addition, just as we should do what we can, within reasonable bounds, to cure the carriers of the Ebola virus we quarantine, so we should aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate the criminals we incapacitate. Pereboom also proposes that given hard incompatibilism, punishment justified as general deterrence may be legitimate when the penalties don't involve undermining an agent's capacity to live a meaningful, flourishing life, since justifying such moderate penalties need not invoke desert.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2001), ''Living without Free Will'', Chapter 7; Pereboom, Derk (2014), ''Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{main article|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Handcuffs-20060604.jpg|thumb|right|Some forms of compatibilism suggest the term ''free will'' should only be used to mean something more like liberty.]]

Compatibilists contend that even if determinism were true, it would still be possible for us to have free will. The Hindu text ''[[Bhagavad Gita|The Bhagavad Gita]]'' offers one very early compatibilist account. Facing the prospect of going to battle against kinsmen to whom he has bonds, Arjuna despairs. Krishna attempts to assuage Arjuna's anxieties. He argues that forces of nature come together to produce actions, and it is only vanity that causes us to regard ourselves as the agent in charge of these actions. However, Krishna adds this caveat: "... [But] the Man who knows the relation between the forces of Nature and actions, witnesses how some forces of Nature work upon other forces of Nature, and becomes [not] their slave..." When we are ignorant of the relationship between forces of Nature, we become passive victims of nomological facts. Krishna's admonition is intended to get Arjuna to perform his duty (i.e., fight in the battle), but he is also claiming that being a successful moral agent requires being mindful of the wider circumstances in which one finds oneself.&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bhagavad Gita|year=1962|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda also said, "Freedom means the power to act by soul guidance, not by the compulsions of desires and habits. Obeying the ego leads to bondage; obeying the soul brings liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inspirational Thought for Each Day|year=1977|publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship|location=California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western tradition, Baruch Spinoza echoes the ''Bhagavad Gita{{'}}''s point about agents and natural forces, writing "men think themselves free because they are conscious of their volitions and their appetite, and do not think, even in their dreams, of the causes by which they are disposed to wanting and willing, because they are ignorant [of those causes]."&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"/&gt; Krishna is hostile to the influence of passions on our rational faculties, speaking up instead for the value of heeding the dictates of one's own nature: "Even a wise man acts under the impulse of his nature. Of what use is restraint?"&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"/&gt; Spinoza similarly identifies the taming of one's passions as a way to extricate oneself from merely being passive in the face of external forces and a way toward following our own natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baruch Spinoza|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
[[Daniel Dennett]] asks why anyone would care about whether someone had the property of responsibility and speculates that the idea of moral responsibility may be "a purely metaphysical hankering".&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;Dennett, D., (1984) ''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''. Bradford Books. {{ISBN|0-262-54042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental research==
Mauro suggests that a sense of personal responsibility does not operate or evolve universally among humankind. He argues that it was absent in the successful civilization of the [[Iroquois]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, research in [[experimental philosophy]] has explored whether people's untutored intuitions about determinism and moral responsibility are compatibilist or incompatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eddy |last=Nahmias|author2=Stephen Morris |author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer |author4=Jason Turner  |title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive? |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=28–52 |doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experimental work has included cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hagop Sarkissian, Amita Chatterjee, Felipe De Brigard, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Smita Sirker (forthcoming).[http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/hsarkissian/Is%20Belief%20in%20Free%20Will%20a%20Universal_final.pdf "Is belief in free will a cultural universal?"] Mind &amp; Language&lt;/ref&gt; However, the debate about whether people naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions has not come out overwhelmingly in favor of one view or the other, finding evidence for both views. For instance, when people are presented with abstract cases that ask if a person could be morally responsible for an immoral act when they could not have done otherwise, people tend to say no, or give ''incompatibilist'' answers. When presented with a specific immoral act that a specific person committed, people tend to say that that person is morally responsible for their actions, even if they were determined (that is, people also give ''compatibilist'' answers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Shaun|last=Nichols |authorlink=Shaun Nichols |author2=[[Joshua Knobe]]  |title=Moral Responsibility and Determinism: The Cognitive Science of Folk Intuitions |journal=[[Noûs]] |volume=41 |issue=4|pages=663–685 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00666.x |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neuroscience of free will investigates various experiments that might shed light on free will.

==Collective==
{{Main article|Collective responsibility}}
When people attribute moral responsibility, they usually attribute it to individual moral agents.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joel Feinberg, among others, has argued that corporations and other groups of people can have what is called ‘collective moral responsibility’ for a state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Risser, David T. 2006. 'Collective Moral Responsibility'. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/collecti.htm ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''] (Accessed 8 Sept 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when [[South Africa]] had an [[apartheid]] regime, the country's government might have been said to have had collective moral responsibility for the violation of the rights of non-European South Africans.

==Lack of sense of responsibility of psychopaths==
One of the attributes defined for [[psychopathy]] is "failure to accept responsibility for own actions".&lt;ref name=factorstructure&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harpur, T. J., Hare, R. D., &amp; Hakstian, A. R.|title=Two-factor conceptualization of psychopathy: Construct validity and assessment implications.|journal=Psychological Assessment|volume=1|issue=1|pages=6–17|year=1989|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.1.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artificial systems ==

The emergence of [[Outline of automation|automation, robotics and related technologies]] prompted the question, 'Can an artificial system be morally responsible?'&lt;ref name="Allen2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Varner|first2=Gary|last3=Zinser|first3=Jason|title=Prolegomena to any future artificial moral agent|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=2000|volume=12|issue=3|pages=251–261|doi=10.1080/09528130050111428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Smit|first2=Iva|last3=Wallach|first3=Wendell|title=Artificial Morality: Top-down, Bottom-up and Hybrid Approaches|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=September 2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1007/s10676-006-0004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparrow|first1=Robert|title=Killer Robots|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|date=2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=62–77|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2007.00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has a closely related variant, 'When (if ever) does moral responsibility transfer from its human creator(s) to the system?'.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grodzinsky|first1=Frances S.|last2=Miller|first2=Keith W.|last3=Wolf|first3=Marty J.|title=The ethics of designing artificial agents|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=21 Jun 2008|volume=10|issue=2-3|pages=115–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuflik|first1=Arthur|title=Computers in control: Rational transfer of authority or irresponsible abdication of autonomy?|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=173–184|doi=10.1023/A:1010087500508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions ''arguably'' adjoin with but are distinct from [[machine ethics]], which is concerned with the moral behavior of artificial systems.  Whether an artificial system's behavior qualifies it to be morally responsible has been a key focus of debate.

=== Arguments that artificial systems cannot be morally responsible ===

Batya Friedman and Peter Kahn Jr posited that [[intentionality]] is a necessary condition for moral responsibility, and that computer systems as conceivable in 1992 in material and structure could not have intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Batya|last2=Kahn, Jr.|first2=Peter H.|title=Human Agency and Responsible Computing: Implications for Computer System Design|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|date=January 1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(92)90075-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Kuflik asserted that humans must bear the ultimate moral responsibility for a computer's decisions, as it is humans who design the computers and write their programs. He further proposed that humans can never relinquish oversight of computers.&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999" /&gt;

Frances Grodzinsky et al. considered artificial systems that could be modelled as [[finite state machines]].  They posited that if the machine had a fixed state transition table, then it could not be morally responsible. If the machine could modify its table, then the machine's designer still retained some moral responsibility.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008" /&gt;

Patrick Hew argued that for an artificial system to be morally responsible, its rules for behaviour and the mechanisms for supplying those rules must not be supplied entirely by external humans.  He further argued that such systems are a substantial departure from technologies and theory as extant in 2014.  An artificial system based on those technologies will carry zero responsibility for its behaviour.  Moral responsibility is apportioned to the humans that created and programmed the system.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Artificial moral agents are infeasible with foreseeable technologies|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=13 May 2014|volume=16|issue=3|pages=197–206|doi=10.1007/s10676-014-9345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(A more extensive review of arguments may be found in.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"/&gt;)

=== Arguments that artificial systems can be morally responsible ===

Colin Allen et al. proposed that an artificial system may be morally responsible if its behaviours are functionally indistinguishable from a moral person, coining the idea of a 'Moral Turing Test'.&lt;ref name="Allen2000"/&gt; They subsequently disavowed the Moral Turing Test in recognition of controversies surrounding the [[Turing Test]].&lt;ref name="Allen2005" /&gt;

Andreas Matthias described a 'responsibility gap' where to hold humans responsible for a machine would be an injustice, but to hold the machine responsible would challenge 'traditional' ways of ascription.  He proposed three cases where the machine's behaviour ought to be attributed to the machine and not its designers or operators.  First, he argued that modern machines are inherently unpredictable (to some degree), but perform tasks that need to be performed yet cannot be handled by simpler means.  Second, that there are increasing 'layers of obscurity' between manufacturers and system, as hand coded programs are replaced with more sophisticated means.  Third, in systems that have rules of operation that can be changed during the operation of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthias|first1=Andreas|title=The responsibility gap: Ascribing responsibility for the actions of learning automata|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=175–183|doi=10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Adi Rosenblum and Markus Muntean met each other as students at the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna]], [[Austria]]. In 1992 they sublimated their subjective singularity into a double act, into a third person: Mutean/Rosenblum. In 1995 they founded Bricks &amp; Kicks (1995 to 1998), one of the first Artist-Run galleries in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/kunst/411264/Vierhaendig_Das-Kuenstlerduo-Muntean-und-Rosenblum|title=Vierhändig: Das Künstlerduo Muntean und Rosenblum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were professors for Contextual Painting at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from 1999 to 2005 and received the nationally prestigious City of Vienna Prize for Visual Arts in 2001.

The artist duo has shown work internationally; including solo exhibitions in renowned institutions such as [[De Appel|De Appel Centre for Contemporary Art]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] (2002); [[Tate Britain]], [[London]] (2004); the [[Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León]] (MUSAC), [[León, Spain]] (2006); Galerie für Zeitgenössische Kunst, Leipzig, Germany (2007); and Essl Museum – Contemporary Art, Klosterneuburg, Austria (2008). They participated in significant international group exhibitions such as “Fantasies and Curiosities” at the [[Miami Art Museum]] (2000); “Melodrama” at MARCO in Vigo (2003); “Rewind/Fast Forward,” Neue Galerie, Graz, Austria (2009); “The Triumph of Painting” and “New Blood,” both at [[Saatchi Gallery]], London (2006 and 2005), and the 26th [[São Paulo Biennial]] (2004). In Berlin they gained wider recognition through their installation “Where else,” shown at the 2nd [[Berlin Biennial]] (2001), followed by their solo exhibitions at [[Arndt &amp; Partner]] (2005 and 2008).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mariosequeira.com/mseq/sites/default/files/artists/cv/CV%20Muntean%20%26%20Rosenblum%20May%2016_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Work ==

In the compositions of their drawings, the artist couple Markus Muntean and Adi Rosenblum use methods of sampling and resampling of subjects from art history and present-day popular culture. The starting point is an intensive confrontation with the pathos formulas of art history and the questioning of how emotions that find expression as a result are articulated and interpreted in different eras. Motifs that we know from Passion cycles are applied to the psychological dispositions of contemporary existence, sometimes as the expression of an apathy that appeals to the empathy of the beholder. Historically overwhelming pictorial subjects are transferred into the present day, while at the same time triggering a discussion of the media conditions in which pictures are produced today. As a result of the use of language and lettering, a further plane penetrates into the drawings of Muntean/Rosenblum and gives insights into the complexity of the challenges which a subtle medium such as drawing has to face up to today. In the process. Muntean/Rosenblum also take an interest in the aspect of the nomadic narrative. The text collages form, in their relationship with the scenic compositions, aphorisms which pointedly contradict phrases of popular culture, and, through their paradoxical link with figural representations, awaken a dual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ursula Maria Probst|EditorSurname1= Klaus Albrecht Schröder, Elsy Lahner, Albertina Wien|Title=Drawing Now|Publisher=Hirmer Verlag|PublicationPlace=Wien/München|ISBN=978-3-7774-2408-8|Date=2015|language=German

The '''murder of Sylvia Likens''' took place in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], United States in October 1965. The 16-year-old was held captive, [[Child abuse|abused]] and [[Torture murder|tortured to death]] over a period of three months by Gertrude Baniszewski, Baniszewski's children, and other neighborhood children. Likens' parents, who were [[Traveling carnival|carnival]] workers, had initially left her and her sister Jenny in the care of the Baniszewski family, paying Gertrude $20 a week to care for the sisters.

Baniszewski, her daughter Paula, her son John, and two neighborhood youths, Coy Hubbard and Richard Hobbs, were tried and convicted of torturing and [[Child murder|murdering]] Likens. The case was described by the prosecutor in Baniszewski's trial as "the most terrible crime ever committed in the state of Indiana".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835635,00.html Avenging Sylvia]; ''Time Magazine'', 27 May 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backgrounds==

===Gertrude Baniszewski===
'''Gertrude Nadine Baniszewski''' ({{nee|'''Van Fossan'''}}; September 19, 1929 – June 16, 1990) was born in Indianapolis, Indiana to Mollie Myrtle (''née'' Oakley) and Hugh Marcus Van Fossan Sr., both of whom were originally from [[Illinois]] and were of [[Americans|American]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent. Baniszewski was the third of six children. On October 5, 1939, Baniszewski witnessed her 50-year-old father's death from a sudden heart attack. Six years later, she dropped out of school to marry 18-year-old John Stephan Baniszewski (1926–2007), who was originally from [[Youngsville, Pennsylvania]], with whom she had six children. Although John Baniszewski had a volatile temper, the two stayed together for ten more years before divorcing.

Baniszewski, then 34, moved in with 22-year-old Dennis Lee Wright, who abused her. She had one child with Dennis, Dennis Lee Wright Jr. (later given the name Denny Lee Wright by his adoptive mother), but after his birth, Wright abandoned Gertrude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/2.html|title=truTV - Funny Because it&amp;#039;s tru|website=truTV|access-date=2016-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016070750/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/2.html|archive-date=2013-10-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sylvia Likens===
'''Sylvia Marie Likens''' (January 3, 1949 – October 26, 1965) was the third child of [[Carny|carnival workers]] Lester Cecil Likens (1926–2013) and his wife Elizabeth Frances "Betty" (née Grimes, 1927–1998). She was born between two sets of fraternal [[twin]]s: Diana and Danny (two years older), and Jenny and Benny (one year younger, the former disabled by [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]).&lt;ref name="time2"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901828,00.html Addenda to De Sade]; ''Time Magazine'', 6 May 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Likens' parents' marriage was unstable. The family moved frequently, and the parents had financial difficulties. Likens and her sister Jenny were often boarded out or forced to live with relatives, such as their grandmother, so that their schoolwork would not suffer while their parents were on the road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/3.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: Foster Care] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825083251/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/3.html |date=2008-08-25 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; To earn money, Likens babysat and ironed, the same kind of work that was done by Gertrude Baniszewski. At the time of Likens' death, her favorite rock band was [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kLG4NQn0yfQC&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=Memorial+Baptist+Church+sylvia+likens&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b7s7j_Pkzw&amp;sig=2KWFo_DLm67dUl2gi640-scvsbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_x47YxJzWAhWFy7wKHaCNCDQQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Memorial%20Baptist%20Church%20sylvia%20likens&amp;f=false|title=House of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1965, Sylvia and Jenny Likens were living with their mother, Betty, in Indianapolis. During that time, Betty was arrested and jailed for [[shoplifting]]. Lester Likens, who had recently separated from his wife, arranged for his daughters to board with Gertrude Baniszewski, the mother of the girls' new friend Paula Baniszewski (aged 17) and Paula's six siblings, Stephanie (15), John (12), Marie (11), Shirley (10), James (8), and few-months-old Dennis Lee Wright Jr. During her early time with the Baniszewski family, she would sing with Baniszewski's daughter, Stephanie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/4.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: Foster Care] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601215939/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/4.html |date=2009-06-01 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Baniszewskis were poor, Lester "didn't pry" into the condition of the house (as he reported at the trial), and he encouraged Baniszewski to "straighten his daughters out."&lt;ref name=IndyStar&gt;[http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/history/likens_sylvia/sylvia.html The murder of Sylvia Likens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010807200635/http://www.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/history/likens_sylvia/sylvia.html |date=2001-08-07 }}; ''Indianapolis Star'', Library Factfiles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuse and death==
Lester Likens agreed to pay Baniszewski $20 a week in exchange for her care of the Likens girls. Baniszewski, described by ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' as a "haggard, underweight [[asthma]]tic",&lt;ref name=IndyStar/&gt; was suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and the stress of several failed marriages. When the weekly payment arrived late, Baniszewski beat the Likens girls on their bare buttocks with paddles.

Baniszewski soon focused her [[child abuse|abuse]] exclusively on Sylvia. She accused her of stealing candy that she had bought, and humiliated her when she admitted that she once had a boyfriend. Baniszewski's daughter, Paula, who was pregnant at the time, kicked Likens in the genitals and accused her of being pregnant. Later medical examination proved that Likens was not pregnant and could not have been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/5.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: A Dubious Start] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912111536/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/5.html |date=2008-09-12 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; Baniszewski began allowing her older children to beat Likens and repeatedly push her down stairs for entertainment. During a church function, Baniszewski [[Force-feeding|force-fed]] Likens a [[hot dog]] overloaded with condiments. Likens vomited afterwards, which she was later forced to consume. Baniszewski also accused Likens of [[prostitution]] and delivered [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] sermons about the filthiness of prostitutes and women in general.

Likens was later accused of spreading rumors within [[Arsenal Technical High School]] that Paula and Stephanie Baniszewski were prostitutes. This supposedly provoked Stephanie's boyfriend, Coy Hubbard, to physically attack Likens. Hubbard and his classmates soon made frequent visits to the Baniszewski residence to torment Likens, often collaborating with Bansizewski's own children and Baniszewski herself.

Paula Baniszewski once beat Likens in the face with such force that she broke her own wrist. She later had to wear a cast, which she used to further beat Likens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=177&amp;sid=0be6b27a888f78f72360647d85b4b093|title=Jenny Fay Likens - Sister of Deceased - Sylvia Likens|website=sylvialikens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=eONxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+beaten+with+cast&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7-werp-P_L&amp;sig=PMyFIdvOAIDl2BNcGJXM7j-bkc4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVtd-khprWAhXFwrwKHVZQCQMQ6AEIWDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20beaten%20with%20cast&amp;f=false|title=World Encyclopedia of 20th Century Murder|last=R.

Gertrude Baniszewski later forced Jenny to hit her sister, beating her if she did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/7.html "The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917053831/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/7.html |date=2008-09-17 }} Crime Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Raymond and Phyllis Vermillion, a middle-aged couple who moved next door, saw Gertrude to be an ideal caretaker for their two children. They visited the Baniszewski residence on two occasions, where they witnessed Paula, with Gertrude's approval, abusing Likens and boasting about it in front of them. The Vermillions refused to report the abuse to the authorities out of fear on both occasions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=173|title=Phyllis Vermillion - Next Door Neighbor|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baniszewski eventually forbade Likens from attending school after Likens confessed to having stolen a gym suit from the school when Baniszewski would not buy a gym suit for her. She brutally beat and whipped Sylvia and did the same for Jenny after remembering that she supposedly stole a tennis shoe. Baniszewski then switched the topic to the "evils" of premarital sex and brutally kicked Sylvia repeatedly in the genitals. She also burned all of her fingers with matches and further whipped her.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+gym+suit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmGVvnS7Um&amp;sig=WTIum4elXzljW-EsdKm3G49sWvc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPqKqsx7rYAhUKe7wKHRdDBq4Q6AEIZDAP#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20gym%20suit&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Likens eventually became [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]] due to the severity of the torture.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kLG4NQn0yfQC&amp;pg=PT64&amp;lpg=PT64&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+incontinent+house+of+evil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b7t7l5RjEw&amp;sig=0tzn0Z2Pfp3iwl56pA-2U5PUlpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS_MnXvsfYAhVMmJQKHefRBcYQ6AEIZDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20incontinent%20house%20of%20evil&amp;f=false|title=House of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was denied access to the bathroom and so was forced to wet herself. As punishment for her incontinence, Baniszewski threw her in the basement and locked her in. Throughout her captivity, Baniszewski frequently, with the assistance of her children and their friends, restrained Likens in a bathtub filled with scalding water and rubbed salt onto her burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=177|title=Jenny Fay Likens - Sister of Deceased|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was often kept naked and rarely fed. At times, Baniszewski and her twelve-year-old son John Jr. would make Likens eat her own feces, as well as urine and feces from the diaper of Gertrude Baniszewski's one-year-old son. She also made abusing Likens a pastime, charging the neighborhood children five cents to see the "display" of Likens' naked body and tie, beat, burn and mutilate her. Likens attempted to alert the neighbors for help by screaming and hitting the walls of the basement with a spade, ultimately to no avail.

The Likens sisters had no way to contact other family members to inform them of the abuse. Jenny, especially, struggled to do this since she was constantly threatened by Baniszewski that she would be abused and tortured next like her sister. She was also [[Bullying|bullied]] by the neighborhood girls and beaten whenever she alluded to Sylvia's situation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Nonetheless, they encountered Diana, their older and married sister, at the local park. Since Diana was forbidden by her parents to make contact with the sisters due to her estrangement, she initially assumed that the punishments Sylvia and Jenny were receiving were related to this. Neither party was aware that they lived less than a mile and a half apart. Diana eventually learned that Sylvia and Jenny were staying at a strangers' home and she attempted to visit them. Upon her visit, Bansizewski told Diana, unaware of who Baniszewski was, that the Likens sisters were not allowed to see her and ordered her off her property. At one point, Diana secretly gave a starving Sylvia a sandwich. Sylvia remained silent about the matter but after Marie Baniszewski revealed it, Paula and Gertrude choked and paddled Sylvia before subjecting her to another scalding bath.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, a neighbor made an anonymous report, which prompted an in-home visit by a public health nurse. The nurse entered the home and made inquiries, but had no choice but to leave without further investigation. She told Baniszewski the report was about Likens; Baniszewski replied she had kicked Likens out of her house, and that her whereabouts were unknown. The nurse had no way of knowing that the subject of her inquiry was right below her in the basement. 

Likens was often deprived of water. Jenny later speculated, during her court testimony, that Likens was unable to produce tears due to [[dehydration]].&lt;ref name="sylvialikens.com"/&gt;

On October 22, Likens was forced by John to eat a bowl of soup with her fingers. John quickly took away the bowl when Likens attempted to eat it. Baniszewski eventually allowed her to sleep upstairs, under the condition that she learned not to wet herself. That night, Likens whispered to Jenny to give her a glass of water before falling asleep. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;On October 23, Baniszewski discovered that Likens had urinated herself. As punishment, Likens was forced to masturbate with an empty glass Coca-Cola bottle in front of Baniszewski's children. After that, she stripped Likens naked and [[Human branding|carved]] the words "I'M A PROSTITUTE AND PROUD OF IT" onto Likens' abdomen with a heated needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19651028&amp;id=ZgYrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NZgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6404,6841839&amp;hl=en|title=Reading Eagle - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+whipping&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmGToqZfVh&amp;sig=drMzugkCi-YaYiR60-NR5kUjptI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY8sXyie3XAhWLp5QKHb8LC7gQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=october%2022&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Baniszewski was unable to finish the branding, she had Richard Hobbs finish. Hobbs continued to brand Likens as Baniszewski calmly took Jenny to the groceries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hobbs and 10-year-old Shirley Baniszewski then used an [[Fire iron|iron poker]] in an attempt to burn the letter "S" into Likens' chest; the burn scar ended up looking like the number "3."&lt;ref name="sylvialikens.com"&gt;[http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=177&amp;sid=2d539eaab9268eeaf90fd1f33a10776d] Jenny Fay Likens&lt;/ref&gt; Baniszewski later taunted Likens about how she would never be able to marry a man due to the words carved onto her stomach. Likens was taken back to the basement, where Coy Hubbard arrived to tie her up and slam her body against the walls six to seven times. That night, Likens confided to her sister, "I'm going to die. I can tell". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;The next day, Baniszewski woke Likens, then dictated a letter to her, intending to mislead her parents into believing that she had run away. The letter also tried to frame a group of anonymous boys for abusing and mutilating Likens after she supposedly agreed to have sexual relations with them. After Likens finished the letter, Baniszewski formulated a plan to have John Jr. and Jenny take Sylvia to a nearby forested area and leave her there to die.

On October 25, Likens tried to escape after overhearing Baniszewski's plan to blindfold her&lt;ref name="sylvialikens.com"/&gt; and dump her body in Jimmy's Forest, a wooded area nearby. Likens fled to the front door but due to her extensive injuries, Baniszewski caught her in time. Likens was provided with toast but was unable to eat it due to her severe dehydration. Baniszewski shoved the toast into her mouth and struck her face several times with a curtain rod. She violently threw Likens into the basement and with the assistance of Hubbard, she tied and bludgeoned her until she was unconscious. Likens managed to recover but was unable to speak intelligibly and move her limbs properly. Likens tried to exit the basement but collapsed before she could make it to the stairs. Baniszewski crushed her head with her feet and stood there for several moments. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 26, after multiple beatings, burnings, and scalding baths, Likens died of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=IndyStar/&gt; She was 16 years old.

When Stephanie Baniszewski and Richard Hobbs realized that Likens was not breathing, Stephanie tried to give her [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. Banzisewski, however, shouted at them that Likens was "faking it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=135|title=Richard Hobbs - Defendant|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Baniszewski finally realized that Likens was dead, she sent Hobbs to call the police from a nearby [[payphone]]. When police arrived, Gertrude Baniszewski handed them the letter she had forced Likens to write a few days previously. Before the police officers left the house, however, Jenny Likens approached them and said, "Get me out of here and I'll tell you everything."&lt;ref name="LETTER"&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/13.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: The Letter Before End] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824165415/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/13.html |date=2008-08-24 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; Her statement, combined with the discovery of Likens' body, prompted the officers to arrest Gertrude, Paula, Stephanie and John Baniszewski, Richard Hobbs, and Coy Hubbard for murder. Other neighborhood children present at the time—Mike Monroe, Randy Lepper, Darlene McGuire, Judy Duke, and Anna Siscoe—were arrested for "injury to person".

==Trial==
[[File:Jenny Fay Likens.jpg|thumb|Jenny Likens watching the proceedings of the Baniszewski trial. She instigated the investigation and the subsequent arrest of her sister's torturers and murderers.]]

Baniszewski, her children, Hobbs, and Hubbard were held without bail pending their trials.

An examination and autopsy of Likens' body revealed numerous burns, bruising, muscle and nerve damage. All of her fingernails were also broken backwards and most of the skin's outer layer peeled off. Her severely mutilated body led authorities to initially believe that it was the work of an "anonymous madman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+autopsy+madman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmFWmlW7Uh&amp;sig=6hLu6CWNFGw57Ko9l_aoXYzGUKA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZsMys-5nWAhXHzbwKHXp1DPIQ6AEIUjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20autopsy%20madman&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her death throes, Likens bit through her lips, partially severing each of them. Her vaginal cavity was nearly swollen shut, although an examination of the canal determined that her [[hymen]] was still intact, which meant it was possible she was still a virgin, discrediting Baniszewski's assertions that Likens was a prostitute and her insistence that she was pregnant. The official cause of death was brain swelling, internal hemorrhaging of the brain, and shock from severe and prolonged damage to her skin.

During the highly publicized trial, Gertrude Baniszewski denied being responsible for Likens' death. She pleaded [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. She claimed that she was too distracted by her ill health and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] to control her children.

Four minors who took part in the abuse of Likens were also put on trial. They were:

*Paula Baniszewski, aged 17
*John Baniszewski, aged 13
*Richard Hobbs, aged 15
*Coy Hubbard, aged 15

The attorneys for the minors claimed that they had been pressured by Baniszewski.

When Gertrude's 11-year-old daughter, Marie Baniszewski, was called to the stand as a witness for the defense, she broke down and admitted that she had been forced to heat the needle with which Hobbs had carved Likens' skin. She also testified that she had seen her mother beating Likens and forcing her into the basement.

In his closing statement, Baniszewski's lawyer said: "I condemn her for being a murderess ... but I say she's not responsible because she's not all here!" He tapped his head to make his point about her state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/16.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: Drama in the Court Room] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824121151/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/16.html |date=2008-08-24 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 1966, Gertrude Baniszewski was convicted of first-degree [[murder]]. She was spared the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

Paula Baniszewski, who had given birth to a daughter during the trial, was convicted of second-degree murder. She was also sentenced to life imprisonment.

Richard Hobbs, Coy Hubbard, and John Baniszewski Jr. were all convicted of [[manslaughter]] and given two 2-to-21-year prison sentences.

==Aftermath==
Hobbs, Hubbard, and John Baniszewski Jr. each served two years in a reformatory before being paroled in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed author: "150 Hear Likens Case Sentences," ''The Indianapolis News,'' May 25, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indystar"&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS06/80814026 ''Library Factfiles: The murder of Sylvia Likens.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65aUb7lAe?url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F99999999%2FNEWS06%2F80814026# |date=2012-02-20 }} The Indianapolis Star.

In 1971, Gertrude and Paula Baniszewski were granted another trial by the [[Supreme Court of Indiana|Indiana Supreme Court]], largely for reasons of a prejudicial atmosphere due to heavy news media publicity before and during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed author: "Court Orders New Trial in Likens Slaying", ''The Indianapolis Star'', September 2, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Baniszewski pleaded guilty to [[voluntary manslaughter]] and was released from prison one year later.&lt;ref name=IndyStar/&gt; Gertrude Baniszewski, however, was again convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed author: "Mrs. Baniszewski Meted Life in Likens Slaying", ''The Indianapolis Star'', August 20, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next 14 years, Baniszewski became a model prisoner at the [[Indiana Women's Prison]], working in the sewing shop and becoming a "den mother" to younger female inmates. By the time she came up for parole in 1985, she was known by the prison nickname "Mom".

The news of Baniszewski's parole hearing sent shockwaves through the Indiana community. Jenny Likens and her family appeared on television to speak out against Baniszewski; the members of two anti-crime groups, Protect the Innocent and Society's League Against Molestation, travelled to Indiana to oppose her parole and support the Likens family, beginning a sidewalk picket campaign. Over the course of two months, the groups collected over 40,000 signatures from the citizens of Indiana, including those who were too young to remember the case, demanding that Baniszewski be kept behind bars.&lt;ref&gt;Caleca, Linda Graham: "Baniszewski Ruling Won't Affect Past Parole Cases, Judge Says", ''The Indianapolis Star'', October 30, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mermel, Marcy: "Mrs. Baniszewski Portrayed as a New Woman", ''The Indianapolis News'', December 3, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the efforts, Baniszewski was granted parole. During the hearing, she stated: "I'm not sure what role I had in it ... because I was on drugs. I never really knew her ... I take full responsibility for whatever happened to Sylvia." The [[parole board]], taking her [[Good conduct time|good behavior]] in prison into account, voted in favor of granting Baniszewski's freedom 3–2, and she was released.

[[File:Gertrude-baniszewski002.jpg|thumb|Gertrude Baniszewski after leaving jail, aged 56.]]

Baniszewski was released from prison on December 4, 1985, and traveled to [[Iowa]], where she called herself Nadine Van Fossan, using her middle name and maiden name. She lived in obscurity until her death in [[Laurel, Iowa]], from [[lung cancer]], on June 16, 1990, aged 60.&lt;ref name="indystar"/&gt;

When Jenny Likens, who was then married and living in [[Beech Grove, Indiana]], saw Gertrude Baniszewski's obituary in a newspaper, she clipped it and mailed it to her mother with the note: "Some good news.

After the [[Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden|Westside Middle School massacre]], John Baniszewski Jr., by then calling himself John Blake, made a statement claiming that young criminals are not beyond help and describing how he had turned his life around.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: In Memoriam] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930100521/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html |date=2012-09-30 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] at General Hospital in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], on May 19, 2005, at the age of 52.

The injury-to-person charges against the younger juveniles, Anna Ruth Siscoe, Judy Darlene Duke, Michael John (Mike) Monroe, Darlene McGuire, and Randy Gordon Lepper, were dropped. Siscoe married and had children and grandchildren; she died on October 23, 1996 at the age of 44. Lepper died on November 14, 2010 in [[Indianapolis]] at the age of 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/indystar/obituary.aspx?n=randy-g-lepper&amp;pid=151636716#fbLoggedOut |title=THE INDIANAPOLIS STAR OBITUARIES: Complete listing of The Indianapolis Star Obituaries powered by Legacy.com |publisher=indystar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2015, Likens' sister Diana (who was using the name Dianna Bedwell) and her husband, Cecil Knutson, were reported missing by their son, Robert Acosta. Dianna and Cecil had been gambling at the [[San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians|Valley View Casino]] in [[Valley Center, California]]. Surveillance video recorded the couple leaving the casino at about 2 p.m. by car, but they did not show up at their son's house in [[La Quinta, California|La Quinta]]. Acosta contacted the police and appeared on television, asking the public's help in finding his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/05/13/sylvia-likens-older-sister-vanishes-california/27232635/|title=Archives: Sylvia Likens' older sister vanishes in California|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 2015, the couple was found in a mountainous area of an Indian reservation by members of a volunteer Jeep patrol. Cecil was dead and Dianna was severely dehydrated after surviving on just rainwater and some food. Dianna was airlifted to a hospital in serious condition. She told investigators they were looking for a shortcut when they got lost and became stuck on a rugged road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2015445/elderly-missing-couple-found-in-california-husband-dead/ |title=Elderly missing couple found in California, husband dead |publisher=globalnews.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house at 3850 East New York Street in which Likens was tortured and murdered stood vacant and rundown for many years after the murder. Although there was some discussion of purchasing it for renovation and using it as a [[women's shelter]], the necessary funds were never raised. The house was demolished on April 23, 2009. The property is now a church parking lot.

A {{convert|6|ft|m|-tall|adj=mid|spell=in}} block of granite was dedicated in June 2001 as a memorial to Likens in Willard Park, 1700 E. [[Washington Street (Indianapolis)|Washington Street]]. The dedication was attended by several hundred people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Will|title=Retro Indy: The Murder of Sylvia Likens, as told 50 years ago|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2015/10/23/indianapolis-most-sadistic-act-sylvia-likens-gertrude-baniszewski-torture-slaying-indianapolis-news-indianapolis-crime-crime-horror-torture/74209878/|accessdate=March 31, 2017|work=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikiquote}}
'''Naivety''' (or '''naïvety''' or '''naïveté''') is the state of being naïve, that is to say, having or showing a lack of [[experience]], [[understanding]] or sophistication, often in a context where one neglects [[pragmatism]] in favor of [[Deontological Ethics|moral idealism]]. One who is "naïve" may be called a ''naïf''.

== Etymology ==
In early use, the word ''naive'' meant "natural or innocent", and did not connote ineptitude. As a French [[adjective]], it is spelled ''naïve'' or ''naïf''. French adjectives have [[grammatical gender]]; ''naïf'' is used with masculine nouns and ''naïve'' with feminine nouns. The French noun is ''naïveté''.

The dots above the ''i'' are a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (see also [[Ï]]). As an unitalicized English word, "naive" is now the more usual spelling,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "naïve" and "naïf" and quotes.&lt;/ref&gt; although "naïve" is unidiomatic rather than incorrect; "naïf" often represents the French masculine, but has a secondary meaning as an artistic style. “Naive” is now normally pronounced as two syllables, with the stress on the second, in the French manner.

The noun form can be written as naivety, naïvety, naïveté, naïvete, or naiveté.

==Culture==
The naif appears as a cultural type in two main forms. On the one hand, there is 'the satirical naïf, such as [[Candide]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Perrino, ''The Poetics of Mockery'' (1995), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northrop Frye]] suggested we might call it "the ''ingénu'' form, after [[Voltaire]]'s dialogue of that name. "Here an outsider... grants none of the premises which make the absurdities of society look logical to those accustomed to them",&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973) p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; and serves essentially as a prism to carry the satirical message. [[Baudrillard]] indeed, drawing on his [[Situationist International|Situationist]] roots, sought to position himself as ingénu in everyday life: "I play the role of the Danube peasant: someone who knows nothing but suspects something is wrong... I like being in the position of the primitive... ''playing naïve''".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, ''The Conspiracy of Art'' (2005), p. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there is the artistic "naïf - all responsiveness and seeming availability".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Green, ''Children of the Sun'' (London 1977), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Here 'the naïf offers himself as being in process of formation, in search of values and models...always about to adopt some traditional "mature" temperament'&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; - in a perpetual adolescent [[James Marcia#Moratorium|moratorium]]. Such instances of "the naïf as a cultural image... offered themselves as essentially responsive to others and open to every invitation... established their identity in indeterminacy".&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, "the naifs turned toward mysticism and Eastern religions",&lt;ref&gt;Leora Lev, ''Enter at Your Own Risk'' (2006), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; feeding into the [[hippie]] movement. "Hippie culture, bastard of the beat generation out of pop, was much like a folk culture - oral, naive, communal, its aphorisms ("Make love, not war", "turn on, tune in, drop out") intuited, not rationalized".&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Willis, "Dylan" in Craig McGregor ed., ''Bob Dylan: A Retrospective'' (1975), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4960">:''For the character in Xenosaga, see [[Gaignun Kukai]]. Nigredo is also an album by [[Diary of Dreams]].

In [[alchemy]], '''nigredo''', or blackness, means [[putrefaction]] or [[decomposition]]. Many alchemists believed that as a first step in the pathway to the [[philosopher's stone]], all alchemical ingredients had to be cleansed and cooked extensively to a uniform black matter.&lt;ref&gt;''Chemical History Tour, Picturing Chemistry from Alchemy to Modern Molecular Science'' Adele Droblas Greenberg Wiley-Interscience 2000 {{ISBN|0-471-35408-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[analytical psychology]], the term became a metaphor 'for the [[dark night of the soul]], when an individual confronts the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] within'.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte H. Hopeke, ''A Guided Tour of the Collected Works of C. G. Jung'' (Boston 1989) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jung==

For [[Carl Jung]], 'the rediscovery of the principles of alchemy came to be an important part of my work as a pioneer of [[psychology]]'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; As a student of alchemy, he (and his followers) 'compared the "black work" of the alchemists (the nigredo) with the often highly critical involvement experienced by the ego, until it accepts the new equilibrium brought about by the creation of the self'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/shadow-analytical-psychology Hans Dieckmann, "Shadow (Analytical Psychology)"]&lt;/ref&gt; Jungians interpreted nigredo in two main psychological senses.

The first sense represented a subject's initial state of undifferentiated unawareness, 'the first nigredo, that of the ''unio naturalis'', is an objective state, visible from the outside only...an unconscious state of non-differentiation between self and object, consciousness and the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W Ashton, ''From the Brink'' 9London 2007) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Here the subject is unaware of the unconscious; i.e. the connection with the instincts'.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Adler, ''Studies in Analytical Psychology'' (London 1999) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense, 'the nigredo of the process of [[individuation]] on the other hand is a subjectively experienced process brought about by the subject's painful, growing awareness of his shadow aspects'.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, ''Brink'' p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; It could be described as a moment of maximum despair, that is a prerequisite to personal development.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. ''Psychology and Alchemy'' 2nd. ed. (Transl. by R. F. C. Hull&lt;/ref&gt; As individuation unfolds, so 'confrontation with the shadow produces at first a dead balance, a standstill that hampers moral decisions and makes convictions ineffective or even impossible...''nigredo'', ''tenebrositas'', chaos, melancholia'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Mysteruim Coniunctionis'' (London 1963) p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; Here is 'the darkest time, the time of despair, disillusionment, envious attacks; the time when [[Eros]] and [[Superego]] are at daggers drawn, and there seems no way forward...''nigredo'', the blackening'.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Perry, in P. Young-Eisendrath/T. Dawson eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1977) p. 152-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Only subsequently would come 'an [[enantiodromia]]; the ''nigredo'' gives way to the ''[[Albedo (alchemy)|albedo]]''...the ever deepening descent into the unconscious suddenly becomes illumination from above'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, "Psychology of the Transference", ''Collected Works Vol 16'' (London 19540 p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

Further steps of the [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|alchemical opus]] include such images as [[albedo (alchemy)|albedo]] (whiteness), [[citrinitas]] (yellowness), and [[rubedo]] (redness). Jung also found psychological equivalents for many other alchemical concepts, with 'the characterization of analytic work as an ''opus''; the reference to the analytic relationship as a ''vas'', vessel or container; the goal of the analytic process as the ''coniunctio'', or union of conflicting opposites'.&lt;ref&gt;Hopeke, ''A Guided Tour" p. 164-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoine pesne friedrich wil.jpg|thumb|300px|King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], the "Soldier-King", first named the Prussian virtues (which were supposedly present since the [[State of the Teutonic Order]]). Painting by [[Antoine Pesne]], about 1733.]]
'''Prussian virtues''' ({{lang-de| preußische Tugenden}}) refers to the [[virtue]]s associated with the historical [[Kingdom of Prussia]], especially its [[militarism]] and the [[Warrior ethos|ethical code]] of the [[Prussian army]], but also [[bourgeois]] values as influenced by  [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]]. It has also significantly influenced wider [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], such as the contemporary German stereotypes of efficiency, austerity and discipline.

==Development==
These virtues, while traced back to the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic knights]], were named by King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], the "soldier{{Ndash}}king" and frugal "bourgeois" reformer of Prussian administration, as well as from his son, [[Frederick the Great]]. The father had taken over an over-indebted public budget and saw himself as a moral role model, while the son saw himself as an exemplar of reason for the religiously, ethnically, and linguistically diverse Prussian state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Graf von Krockow|Christian Graf v. Krockow]]: "Die Pflicht und das Glück" (speech on 17 August 1991 in the [[Neues Palais]], [[Potsdam]]) in: [[Hans Bentzien]]: ''Die Heimkehr der Preußenkönige'', 1. edition, Berlin 1991. {{ISBN|3-353-00877-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extended Prussian territory was home to [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] subjects, of [[German people|Germans]], [[Polish people|Poles]], [[Sorbs]] and [[Kashubians]]. Frederick William I considered himself to be a role model, while his [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] son relied on reason and tolerance to rule his multifaceted state.

Prussia developed a highly-advanced administration and legal system, as well as a loyal officer corps and a kind of common-sense [[patriotism]] gathering the subjects behind the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] ruler. The Prussian "era of reform", from the military defeat by [[Napoleon I]] at the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|Battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], until the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, was also an important influence. These included reform of community boundaries, the army, schools, universities, and taxes, as well as the enfranchisement of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans-Joachim Schoeps]]: chapter "Preußische Tugenden" in ''Preußen&amp;nbsp;– Bilder und Zeugnisse'' (most recently posthumously in ''Preußen&amp;nbsp;– Geschichte eines Staates'', Frankfurt a. M./ Berlin 1995. {{ISBN|3-549-05496-3}}, pp. 442ff)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
The German author and soldier [[Walter Flex]] (1887–1917) wrote "Wer je auf Preußens Fahne schwört, hat nichts mehr, was ihm selbst gehört."  Translation: "He who swears on Prussia's flag has nothing left that belongs to himself."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Flex]]. "Preußischer Fahneneid" ("Prussian Military Oath" written in 1915) in ''Gesammelte Werke'' (Title Translation: ''Collected Works''), Vol. 1, pp. 73–74, quote in p. 74. This line was also served as his epitaph at his original burial site at the Dorffriedhof (Village Cemetery) of Peude (or Pöide), [[Saaremaa|Saaremaa island formerly Ösel Island]], Estonia. Lars Kich. ''Der Erste Weltkrieg als Medium der Gegenmoderne: Zu den Werken von Walter Flex und Ernst Jünger''. (Title Translation: "The First World War as a Means of Counter-Modernity: To the Works of Walter Flex and Ernst Jünger.")  Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2006, p. 117 and p. 117 n. 544.  {{ISBN|3826031687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian virtues may be summarized by the opening lines of the poem "{{Lang|de|Der alte Landmann an seinen Sohn}}" ("The Old Farmer to His Son") by [[Ludwig Christoph Heinrich Hölty]] (1748–1776). The text reads as follows: "{{Lang|de|Üb' immer Treu und Redlichkeit / Bis an dein kühles Grab; / Und weiche keinen Fingerbreit / Von Gottes Wegen ab.}}" Translation: "Practice always fidelity and honesty / Until your cool grave; / And stray not the width of one finger/ From the ways of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/H%F6lty,%20Ludwig%20Christoph%20Heinrich/Gedichte/S%E4mtliche%20Gedichte/Der%20alte%20Landmann%20an%20seinen%20Sohn "{{Lang|de|Der alte Landmann an seinen Sohn}}"], [[zeno.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The poem was set to music by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to a melody adapted from the aria "{{Lang|de|Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen}}" from his 1791 opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. It was played daily by the carillon of the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Potsdam Garrison Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/andruck/1271662/ "{{Lang|de|Moral ohne Anstand}}"] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Frederick the Great]] was initially buried.

==Post-WWII views==

Since the defeat in World War II and the [[denazification]] campaign, historical German militarism has become anathema in German culture, focused on [[collective responsibility]] and [[Vergangenheitsbewältigung|atonement]]. At the same time, the related non-military, bourgeois virtues of efficiency, discipline and work ethics remain in high standing. This has led to the concept of "Prussian virtues" being regarded with mixed feelings in modern-day Germany. 
Amongst the [[German student movement|German student protests of 1968]], militarist virtues were 
rejected as prerequisite for the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.
The term ''[[:wikt:Kadavergehorsam|Kadavergehorsam]]'' for "blind obedience", originally a slur directed against [[Jesuits]] during the 1870s ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', came to be used as a derogatory staple of "Prussian" military ethos. Similarly, the term ''[[Nibelungentreue]]'' ("Nibelung loyalty"), which in the German Empire had been used in a positive sense for the military virtue of absolute loyalty, came to be used derogatorily in reference to fanatical loyalty characteristic of [[fascism]].
In 1982, amid the controversy surrounding the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]], in response to [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Helmut Schmidt]]'s call for a return to such virtues, [[Saarbrücken]]'s SPD mayor [[Oskar Lafontaine]] commented that these were "perfectly suited to run a concentration camp". 
In 2006, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg [[Matthias Platzeck]] called for a return to Prussian virtues, citing "good basic virtues, such as honesty, reliability, and diligence".&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, R. (2004.) ''Die deutschen Mörder''. Translate from English by Jürgen Peter Krause. Bastei-Lübbe, Bergisch Gladbach, {{ISBN|340464218X}} pp. 151ff. quoted from: ''Himmler, Geheimreden 1933–1945'', ed.

A '''recursive transition network''' ("RTN") is a [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] [[schematic]] used to represent the rules of a [[context-free grammar]]. RTNs have application to [[programming language]]s, [[natural language]] and [[lexical analysis]]. Any [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] that is constructed according to the rules of an RTN&lt;ref&gt;A sentence is generated by a RTN by applying the generative rules specified in the RTN itself.

'''Reference''' is a relation between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first object in this relation is said to ''refer to'' the second object. It is called a ''[[name]]'' for the second object. The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the first object. A name is usually a [[phrase]] or expression, or some other [[Symbol|symbolic representation]]. Its referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept.

References can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is [[Hearing (sense)|audible]] ([[onomatopoeia]]), [[visual perception|visual]] (text), [[olfaction|olfactory]], or tactile, [[emotions|emotional state]], relationship with other,&lt;ref&gt;Treanor, Brian, ''Aspects of alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the contemporary debate'', Fordham University Press, 2006, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; [[spacetime]] coordinate, [[symbolic system|symbolic]] or [[alpha-numeric grid|alpha-numeric]], a physical object or an energy projection. In some cases, methods are used that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in [[cryptography]].

References feature in many spheres of human activity and knowledge, and the term adopts shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. Some of them are described in the sections below.

==Etymology and meanings==
The word ''reference'' is derived from [[Middle English]] ''referren'', from [[Middle French]] ''référer'', from [[Latin]] ''referre'', "to carry back", formed from the [[prefix]] ''re''- and ''ferre'', "to bear".&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the English language'', Vol II, Elsevier publishing company, Amsterdam, 1969, p.1317&lt;/ref&gt; A number of words derive from the same root, including ''refer'', ''[[referee]]'', ''referential'', ''[[referent]]'', ''[[referendum]]''.

The verb ''refer (to)'' and its derivatives may carry the sense of "link to" or "connect to", as in the meanings of ''reference'' described in this article. Another sense is "consult"; this is reflected in such expressions as [[reference work]], [[reference desk]], [[job reference]], etc.

== Semantics ==
{{further|Sense and reference|Theory of reference}}
[[File:Ogden semiotic triangle.png|thumb|right|220px|The [[triangle of reference]], from the influential book ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923) by [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]].]]
In [[semantics]], reference is generally construed as the relationships between [[noun]]s or [[pronoun]]s and objects that are named by them. Hence, the [[word]] "John" refers to the person John. The word "it" refers to some previously specified object. The object referred to is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Semantics|first = John | last = Saeed|page = 12|publisher = Blackwell |isbn = 0-631-22693-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the word-object relation is called "[[denotation]]"; the word denotes the object. The converse relation, the relation from object to word, is called "[[exemplification]]"; the object exemplifies what the word denotes. In syntactic analysis, if a word refers to a previous word, the previous word is called the "[[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]".

===Meaning===
[[Gottlob Frege]] argued that reference cannot be treated as identical with [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]: "[[Hesperus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the evening star) and "[[Phosphorus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the morning star) both refer to [[Venus]], but the astronomical fact that '"Hesperus" is "Phosphorus"' can still be informative, even if the "meanings" of "Hesperus" and "Phosphorus" are already known. This problem led Frege to distinguish between the [[sense and reference]] of a word. Some cases seem to be too complicated to be classified within this framework; the acceptance of the notion of [[secondary reference]] may be necessary to fill the gap. See also [[Opaque context]].

===Linguistic sign===
The very concept of the [[linguistic sign]] is the combination of content and expression, the former of which may refer entities in the world or refer more abstract concepts, e.g. thought.
Certain parts of speech exist only to express reference, namely [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] such as [[pronoun]]s. The subset of reflexives expresses co-reference of two participants in a sentence.  These could be the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] (actor) and patient (acted on), as in "The man washed himself", the theme and recipient, as in "I showed Mary to herself", or various other possible combinations.

==Computer science==
{{Main|Reference (computer science)}}
In [[computer science]], [[Reference (computer science)|reference]]s are [[data type]]s that refer to an object elsewhere in memory and are used to construct a wide variety of [[data structure]]s, such as [[linked list]]s. Generally, a reference is a value that enables a program to directly access the particular data item. Most [[programming language]]s support some form of reference. For the specific type of reference used in the [[C++]] language, see [[reference (C++)]].

The notion of reference is also important in relational [[database theory]]; see [[referential integrity]].

==Library and information sciences==
{{see also|Reference work|Reference desk}}

References to many types of printed matter may come in an electronic or machine-readable form. For books, there exists the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] and for journal articles, the [[Digital object identifier|Digital object identifier (DOI)]] is gaining relevance. Information on the [[Internet]] may be referred to by a [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]].

==Psychology==
In terms of mental processing, a [[self-reference]] is used in psychology to establish identification with a mental state during self-analysis. This seeks to allow the individual to develop own frames of reference in a greater state of immediate awareness. However, it can also lead to circular reasoning, preventing evolution of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Eric, ''Lex Naturalis, Ius Naturalis: Law as Positive Reasoning &amp; Natural Rationality'', The Rlias Clark Group, Melbourne, 2010, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a reference condition is the state toward which a control system's output tends to alter a controlled quantity. The main proposition is that "All behavior is oriented all of the time around the control of certain quantities with respect to specific reference conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Powers, William, ''Behavior: The Control of Perception'', 2nd ed., Benchmark Publications, New Canaan, Connecticut, 2005, pp.47 &amp; 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
In academics and scholarship, an author-title-date information in [[Bibliography|bibliographies]] and [[footnote]]s, specifying complete works of other people. Copying of material by another author without proper citation or without required permissions is [[plagiarism]].

Keeping a [[diary]] allows an individual to use references for personal organization, whether or not anyone else understands the systems of reference used. However, scholars have studied methods of reference because of their key role in communication and co-operation between ''different'' people, and also because of misunderstandings that can arise. Modern academic study of reference has been developing since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;
Reimer, Marga (2009). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference Reference]". ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarship, a reference may be a [[citation]] of a text that has been used in the creation of a piece of work such as an essay, report, or oration. Its primary purpose is to allow people who read such work to examine the author's sources, either for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] or to learn more about the subject. Such items are often listed at the end of an article or book in a section marked "[[Bibliography]]" or "References". A bibliographical section often contains works not cited by the author, but used as background reading or listed as potentially useful to the reader. A reference section contains only those works cited by the author(s) in the main text.

==Law==
In [[patent]] law, a reference is a document that can be used to show the state of knowledge at a given time and that therefore may make a [[claim (patent)|claim]]ed [[invention]] [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|obvious]] or [[Novelty (patent)#United States|anticipated]]. Examples of references are patents of any country, magazine articles, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] theses that are indexed and thus accessible to those interested in finding information about the subject matter, and to some extent Internet material that is similarly accessible.

==Arts==
In [[art]], a reference is an item from which a work is based. This may include:
* an existing artwork,
* a reproduction (i.e., photo),
* directly observed object (i.e., person), or
* the artist's memory.
Another example of reference is [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of various musical works being incorporated into a new one.

The '''Research Diagnostic Criteria''' (RDC) are a collection of influential [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria published in late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Spitzer"&gt;Spitzer RL, Robins E (1978). [http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/35/6/773 Research diagnostic criteria: rationale and reliability] Archives of General Psychiatry, vol. 35, no6, pp. 773-82 {{PMID|655775}}&lt;/ref&gt; As psychiatric diagnoses widely varied especially between the USA and Europe, the purpose of the criteria was to allow diagnoses to be consistent in psychiatric research. 

Some of the criteria were based on the earlier [[Feighner Criteria]], although many new disorders were included; "The historical record shows that the small group of individuals who created the Feighner criteria instigated a paradigm shift that has had profound effects on the course of American and, ultimately, world psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=102104 The Development of the Feighner Criteria: A Historical Perspective]  Kenneth S.

The RDC is important in the history of psychiatric diagnostic criteria as the [[DSM-III]] was based on many of the RDC descriptions.&lt;ref name="Garfield"&gt;Spitzer RL (1989).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19971">'''Risk perception''' is the [[subjectivity|subjective]] judgement that people make about the characteristics and severity of a [[risk]]. The phrase is most commonly used in reference to [[natural hazards]] and threats to [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]] or [[health]], such as [[nuclear power]]. Several theories have been proposed to explain why different people make different estimates of the dangerousness of risks.  Three major families of theory have been developed: psychology approaches (heuristics and cognitive), anthropology/sociology approaches (cultural theory) and interdisciplinary approaches (social amplification of risk framework).

==Early theories==
The study of risk perception arose out of the observation that experts and lay people often disagreed about how risky various technologies and natural hazards were.

The mid 1960s saw the rapid rise of nuclear technologies and the promise for clean and safe energy.  However, public perception shifted against this new technology.  Fears of both longitudinal dangers to the environment and immediate disasters creating radioactive wastelands turned the public against this new technology.  The scientific and governmental communities asked why public perception was against the use of nuclear energy when all the scientific experts were declaring how safe it really was.  The problem, from the perspectives of the experts, was a difference between scientific facts and an exaggerated public perception of the dangers.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Mary 1985"&gt;Douglas, Mary. Risk Acceptability According to the Social Sciences. Russell Sage Foundation, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key early paper was written in 1969 by [[Chauncey Starr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 1969 | title = Social Benefits versus Technological Risks | url = | journal = Science | volume = 165 | issue = 3899| pages = 1232–1238 | doi=10.1126/science.165.3899.1232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr used a [[revealed preference]] approach to find out what risks are considered acceptable by society. He assumed that society had reached equilibrium in its judgment of risks, so whatever risk levels actually existed in society were acceptable. His major finding was that people will accept risks 1,000 times greater if they are voluntary (e.g. driving a car) than if they are involuntary (e.g. a nuclear disaster).

This early approach assumed that individuals behave rationally by weighing information before making a decision, and that individuals have exaggerated fears due to inadequate or incorrect information. Implied in this assumption is that additional information can help people understand true risk and hence lessen their opinion of danger.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Mary 1985"/&gt; While researchers in the engineering school did pioneer research in risk perception, by adapting theories from economics, it has little use in a practical setting. Numerous studies have rejected the belief that additional information, alone, will shift perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freudenburg | first1 = William R. | year = 1993 | title = Risk and Recreancy: Weber, the Division of Labor, and the Rationality of Risk Perceptions | url = | journal = Social Forces | volume = 71 | issue = 4| pages = 909–932 | doi=10.1093/sf/71.4.909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological approach==

The psychological approach began with research in trying to understand how people process information.  These early works maintained that people use cognitive heuristics in sorting and simplifying information, leading to biases in comprehension.  Later work built on this foundation and became the ''psychometric paradigm''. This approach identifies numerous factors responsible for influencing individual perceptions of risk, including dread, novelty, stigma, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tversky | first1 = Amos | last2 = Kahneman | first2 = Daniel | year = 1974 | title = Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases | url = | journal = Science | volume = 185 | issue = 4157| pages = 1124–1131 | doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid=17835457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also shows that risk perceptions are influenced by the emotional state of the perceiver.&lt;ref&gt;Bodenhausen, G.V. (1993). Emotions, arousal, and stereotypic judgments: A heuristic model of affect and stereotyping. In D.M. Mackie &amp; D.L. Hamilton (Eds.), Affect, cognition, and stereotyping: Interactive processes in group perception (pp. 13-37). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The valence theory  of risk perception only differentiates between positive emotions, such as happiness and optimism, and negative ones, such as fear and anger.  According to valence theory, positive emotions lead to optimistic risk perceptions whereas negative emotions influence a more pessimistic view of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = JS | last2 = Keltner | first2 = D | year = 2000 | title = Beyond valence: Toward a model of emotion-specific influences on judgment and choice | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 473–493 | doi=10.1080/026999300402763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also has found that, whereas risk and benefit tend to be positively correlated across hazardous activities in the world, they are negatively correlated in people's minds and judgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slovic|first1=Paul|title=Risk Perception and Affect|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2006|volume=15|issue=6|pages=322–325|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/15/6/322.full|accessdate=Sep 14, 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00461.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heuristics and biases===
The earliest psychometric research was done by psychologists [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]], who performed a series of gambling experiments to see how people evaluated probabilities. Their major finding was that people use a number of [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]] to evaluate information. These heuristics are usually useful shortcuts for thinking, but they may lead to inaccurate judgments in some situations – in which case they become [[cognitive bias]]es.
*''[[Representativeness]]'': is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event belongs to a class / processes by its similarity:
** [[base rate neglect|insensitivity to prior probability]]
** [[insensitivity to sample size]]
** [[gambler's fallacy|misconception of chance]]
** [[insensitivity to predictability]]
** [[illusion of validity]]
** [[regression fallacy|misconception of regression]]
*''[[Availability heuristic]]:'' events that can be more easily brought to mind or imagined are judged to be more likely than events that could not easily be imagined:
** biases due to retrievability of instances
** biases due to the effectiveness of research set
** biases of imaginability
** [[illusory correlation]]
*''[[Anchoring and Adjustment]] heuristic'': people will often start with one piece of known information and then adjust it to create an estimate of an unknown risk – but the adjustment will usually not be big enough:
** insufficient adjustment
** biases in the evaluation of conjunctive and disjunctive event ([[conjunction fallacy]])
** anchoring in the assessment of subjective probability distributions
*Asymmetry between gains and losses: People are risk averse with respect to gains, preferring a sure thing over a gamble with a higher [[expected utility]] but which presents the possibility of getting nothing. On the other hand, people will be risk-seeking about losses, preferring to hope for the chance of losing nothing rather than taking a sure, but smaller, loss (e.g. [[insurance]]).
*Threshold effects: People prefer to move from uncertainty to certainty over making a similar gain in certainty that does not lead to full certainty. For example, most people would choose a vaccine that reduces the incidence of disease A from 10% to 0% over one that reduces the incidence of disease B from 20% to 10%.

Another key finding was that the experts are not necessarily any better at estimating probabilities than lay people. Experts were often overconfident in the exactness of their estimates, and put too much stock in small samples of data.&lt;ref name="Slovic, Paul 1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slovic | first1 = Paul | last2 = Fischhoff | first2 = Baruch | last3 = Lichtenstein | first3 = Sarah | year = 1982 | title = Why Study Risk Perception? | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 83–93 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1982.tb01369.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive Psychology===
The majority of people in the public express a greater concern for problems which appear to possess an immediate effect on everyday life such as hazardous waste or pesticide-use than for long-term problems that may affect future generations such as climate change or population growth.&lt;ref&gt;"Slimak &amp; Dietz, 2006Koger" cited in Susan M., and Deborah Du Nann. Winter. The Psychology of Environmental Problems: Psychology for Sustainability. 3rd ed. New York: Psychology, 2010. 216-217&lt;/ref&gt; People greatly rely on the scientific community to assess the threat of environmental problems because they usually do not directly experience the effects of phenomena such as climate change. The exposure most people have to climate change has been impersonal; most people only have virtual experience though documentaries and news media in what may seem like a “remote” area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Swim, Janet, Susan Clayton, Thomas Doherty, Robert Gifford, George Howard, Joseph Reser, Paul Stern, and Elke Weber. Psychology &amp; Global Climate Change. Publication. American Psychological Association, 2010. Web. 10 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://www.apa.org/science/about/publications/climate-change-booklet.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, coupled with the population’s wait-and-see attitude, people do not understand the importance of changing environmentally destructive behaviors even when experts provide detailed and clear risks caused by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;"Sterman, 2008" cited in Koger, Susan M., and Deborah Du Nann. Winter. The Psychology of Environmental Problems: Psychology for Sustainability. 3rd ed. New York: Psychology, 2010. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychometric paradigm===
Research within the psychometric paradigm turned to focus on the roles of affect, emotion, and stigma in influencing risk perception.  [[Melissa Finucane]] and [[Paul Slovic]] have been among the key researchers here.  These researchers first challenged Starr's article by examining expressed [[preference]] – how much risk people say they are willing to accept. They found that, contrary to Starr's basic assumption, people generally saw most risks in society as being unacceptably high. They also found that the gap between voluntary and involuntary risks was not nearly as great as Starr claimed.

Slovic and team found that perceived risk is quantifiable and predictable.  People tend to view current risk levels as unacceptably high for most activities.&lt;ref&gt;Slovic, Paul, ed. The Perception of Risk. Earthscan, Virginia. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  All things being equal, the greater people perceived a benefit, the greater the tolerance for a risk.&lt;ref name="Slovic, Paul 1982"/&gt;  If a person derived pleasure from using a product, people tended to judge its benefits as high and its risks as low.  If the activity was disliked, the judgments were opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = Robin | last2 = Mendelsohn | first2 = Robert | year = 1993 | title = Perceived Risk, Dread, and Benefits | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 259–264 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1993.tb01077.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research in psychometrics has proven that risk perception is highly dependent on intuition, experiential thinking, and emotions.

Psychometric research identified a broad domain of characteristics that may be condensed into three high order factors: 1) the degree to which a risk is understood, 2) the degree to which it evokes a feeling of dread, and 3) the number of people exposed to the risk. A dread risk elicits visceral feelings of terror, uncontrollable, catastrophe, inequality, and uncontrolled. An unknown risk is new and unknown to science.  The more a person dreads an activity, the higher its perceived risk and the more that person wants the risk reduced.&lt;ref name="Slovic, Paul 1982"/&gt;

==Anthropology/sociology approach==

The anthropology/sociology approach posits risk perceptions as produced by and supporting social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wildavsky | first1 = Aaron | last2 = Dake | first2 = Karl | year = 1990 | title = Theories of Risk Perception: Who Fears What and Why? | url = | journal = American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Daedalus) | volume = 119 | issue = 4| pages = 41–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this view, perceptions are socially constructed by institutions, cultural values, and ways of life.

===Cultural theory===

One line of the [[Cultural Theory of risk]] is based on the work of anthropologist [[Mary Douglas]] and political scientist [[Aaron Wildavsky]] first published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mary and Aaron Wildavsky. Risk and Culture. University of California Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In cultural theory, Douglas and Wildavsky outline four “ways of life” in a grid/group arrangement.  Each way of life corresponds to a specific social structure and a particular outlook on risk.  Grid categorizes the degree to which people are constrained and circumscribed in their social role.  The tighter binding of social constraints limits individual negotiation.  Group refers to the extent to which individuals are bounded by feelings of belonging or solidarity.  The greater the bonds, the less individual choice are subject to personal control.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Michael, Richard Ellis, Aaron Wildavsky.  Cultural theory. Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four ways of life include: Hierarchical, Individualist, Egalitarian, and Fatalist.

Risk perception researchers have not widely accepted this version of cultural theory.  Even Douglas says that the theory is controversial; it poses a danger of moving out of the favored paradigm of individual rational choice of which many researchers are comfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mary.  Risk and Blame: Essays in Cultural theory.  New York: Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, writers who drawn upon a broader cultural theory perspective have argued that risk-perception analysis helps understand the public response to terrorism in a way that goes far beyond 'rational choice'. As John Handmer and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] write:

{{cquote| In the area of embodied risk, people are not as fearful of themselves as perhaps they should be on the issues of illicit drug use, unsafe sex and so on. Yet with the compounding of both more abstract and more embodied risk this package appears to have met its goal to generate support for government policy. Fear of 'outsiders' and of a non-specific, invisible and uncontrollable threat was a powerful motivator in shaping perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2005 | author= John Handmer and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] | title= Trust Us, and Be Scared: The Changing Nature of Contemporary Risk  | url= https://www.academia.edu/3791859/Trust_Us_and_Be_Scared_The_Changing_Nature_of_Contemporary_Risk | journal= Global Society | volume= 21 | issue=  1 | pages=119–30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===National Culture and Risk Survey===
The First National Culture and Risk Survey of [[cultural cognition]] found that a person's worldview on the two social and cultural dimensions of "hierarchy-egalitarianism," and "individualism-solidarism" was predictive of their response to risk.&lt;ref name="First National"&gt;{{cite web|title=First National Risk &amp; Culture Study|url=http://www.culturalcognition.net/projects/first-national-risk-culture-study.html|publisher=The Cultural Cognition Project at Yale Law School|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary approach==

===Social amplification of risk framework===

The Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF), combines research in psychology, sociology, anthropology, and communications theory.  SARF outlines how communications of risk events pass from the sender through intermediate stations to a receiver and in the process serve to amplify or attenuate perceptions of risk.  All links in the communication chain, individuals, groups, media, etc., contain filters through which information is sorted and understood.

The framework attempts to explain the process by which risks are amplified, receiving public attention, or attenuated, receiving less public attention.  The framework may be used to compare responses from different groups in a single event, or analyze the same risk issue in multiple events.  In a single risk event, some groups may amplify their perception of risks while other groups may attenuate, or decrease, their perceptions of risk.

The main thesis of SARF states that risk events interact with individual psychological, social and other cultural factors in ways that either increase or decrease public perceptions of risk.  Behaviors of individuals and groups then generate secondary social or economic impacts while also increasing or decreasing the physical risk itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kasperson
|first= Roger E. |first2= Ortwin |last2=Renn |first3= Paul |last3= Slovic | first4= Halina |last4=Brown | first5=Jacque|last5= Emel |first6= Robert |last6=Goble |first7= Jeanne|last7= Kasperson |first8= Samuel |last8=Ratick | title= The Social Amplification of Risk: A Conceptual Framework |journal= Risk Analysis |volume= 8 | issue=2 |year=1988 | pages=177–187 | url=http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2010/5307/pdf/ren27.pdf | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01168.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These '''ripple effects''' caused by the amplification of risk include enduring mental perceptions, impacts on business sales, and change in residential property values, changes in training and education, or social disorder.  These secondary changes are perceived and reacted to by individuals and groups resulting in third-order impacts.  As each higher-order impacts are reacted to, they may ripple to other parties and locations.  Traditional risk analyses neglect these ripple effect impacts and thus greatly underestimate the adverse effects from certain risk events.  Public distortion of risk signals provides a corrective mechanism by which society assesses a fuller determination of the risk and its impacts to such things not traditionally factored into a risk analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kasperson, Jeanne X., Roger E.

A '''seed''' is a competitor or team in a sport or other tournament who is given a preliminary ranking for the purposes of the draw. Players/teams are "planted" into the [[bracket (tournament)|bracket]] in a manner that is typically intended so that the best do not meet until later in the competition.  The term was first used in [[tennis]],&lt;ref&gt;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (2002), Fifth Edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, Page 2737, {{ISBN|0-19-860457-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the idea of laying out a tournament ladder by arranging slips of paper with the names of players on them the way seeds or seedlings are arranged in a garden: smaller plants up front, larger ones behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beard|first=Robert|title=seed|url=http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/seed|work=AlphaDictionary.com|publisher=Lexiteria|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the remaining competitors in a [[single-elimination tournament]] will be "re-seeded" so that the highest surviving seed is made to play the lowest surviving seed in the next round, the second-highest plays the second-lowest, etc.  This may be done after each round, or only at selected intervals.{{Citation needed|reason=Would be great to cite sports or tournaments that use this practice|date=July 2018}}

==Tennis==

Professional tennis tournaments seed players based on their rankings. The number of seeds varies from tournament to tournament. Generally the bigger the event the more seeds there tend to be relative to lesser events. The 4 major (Grand Slam) tournaments progressively expanded from 8-seed format to 16-seed, then to the current 32-seed format, which was adopted in the middle of the 2001 season, after French Open champion [[Gustavo Kuerten]] had complained that clay-court specialists were at a disadvantage with just 16 seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tennis.life/2018/09/13/grand-slams-vote-to-keep-32-seeds/|title=Grand Slams vote to keep 32 seeds - Tennis.life|date=2018-09-13|work=Tennis.life|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a tennis event, one version of seeding is where brackets are set up so that the quarterfinal pairings (barring any [[Upset (competition)|upset]]s) would be the 1 seed vs. the 8 seed, 2 vs. 7, 3 vs. 6 and 4 vs. 5; however, this is not the procedure that is followed in most tennis tournaments, where the 1 and 2 seeds are placed in separate brackets, but then the 3 and 4 seeds are assigned to their brackets randomly, and so too are seeds 5 through 8, and so on. This may result in some brackets consisting of stronger players than other brackets, and since only the top 32 players are seeded in [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Tennis Grand Slam]] tournaments, it is conceivable that the 33rd best player in a 128-player field could end up playing the top seed in the first round. A good example of this occurring was when World No. 33 [[Florian Mayer]] was drawn against (and eventually defeated by) then-World No. 1 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the first round of the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships &amp;ndash; Men's Singles|2013 Wimbledon Championships]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://novakdjokovic.com/en/news/tennis/wimbledon-novak-vs-mayer-in-r1-andy-roger-and-rafa-all-in-bottom-half/ Wimbledon: Novak vs Mayer in R1; Andy, Roger, Rafa all in bottom half], ''[[Novak Djokovic]] official website'', 21 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in what was also a rematch of [[2012 Wimbledon Championships &amp;ndash; Gentlemen's Singles#Finals|a quarter-final from the previous year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/06/22/wimbledon-2013-possible-mens-matches-to-watch-out-for/ Wimbledon 2013: Men's matches to watch out for], ''The Roar'', 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Rankings of tennis players, based on a history of performance, tend to change positions gradually, and so a more "equitable" method of determining the pairings might result in many of the same head-to-head match-ups being repeated in successive tournaments. An example of a seeded 16-team bracket:
{{16TeamBracket
| RD2=Quarterfinals
| RD2-seed01=1
| RD2-seed02=8
| RD2-seed03=5
| RD2-seed04=4
| RD2-seed05=6
| RD2-seed06=3
| RD2-seed07=7
| RD2-seed08=2
| RD3-seed01=1
| RD3-seed02=4
| RD3-seed03=3
| RD3-seed04=2
| RD4-seed01=1
| RD4-seed02=2
}}

==Other sports==
In American team sports, [[Major League Soccer|MLS]], [[National Football League|NFL]] and [[WNBA]] employ re-seeding in [[MLS Cup Playoffs]], [[NFL playoffs]] &amp; [[WNBA Playoffs]], respectively, while the [[NBA playoffs]] and the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] do not; the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Stanley Cup Playoffs]] formerly used re-seeding between [[1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1994]] and [[2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2013]]. [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] does not have enough teams in its playoff tournament where re-seeding would make a difference in the matchups. (The MLS and NFL are at the minimum, which is 6 from each conference (or league in MLB) for a total of 12.) The NBA's format calls for the winner of the conference quarterfinal series between the first and eighth seeds (within each of the two conferences the league has) to face the winner of the other series between the fourth and fifth seeds in the next round, even if one or more of the top three seeds had been upset in their first-round series; critics have claimed that this gives a team fighting for the fifth and sixth seeding positions near the end of the regular season an incentive to [[match fixing|tank]] (deliberately lose) games, so as to finish sixth and thus avoid a possible matchup with the top seed until one round later. So will the winner of the second and seventh seeds to take on the winner of the third and sixth seeds.

In some situations, a seeding restriction will be implemented;  from 1975 until 1989 in the [[National Football League|NFL]] and from 1998 until 2011 in [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] there was a rule where at the conference or league semifinal, should the top seed and last seed (wild card) be from the same division, they may not play each other;  in that case, the top seed plays the worst division champion;  the second-best division champion plays the wild card team.

In international [[fencing]] competitions, it is common to have a [[group stage]]. Participants are divided in groups of 6–7 fencers who play a round-robin tournament, and a ranking is calculated from the consolidated group results. Single elimination is seeded from this ranking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5646">The '''social multiplier effect''' is a term used in [[economics]], [[economic geography]], [[sociology]], [[public health]] and other academic disciplines to describe certain social [[Externality|externalities]].  It is based on the principle that high levels of one attribute amongst one's peers can have [[spillover effect]]s on an individual.  "This social multiplier can also be thought of as a ratio ∆P/∆I where ∆I is the average response of an individual action to an [http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~delittle/Encyclopedia%20entries/exogenous%20variable.pdf exogenous parameter] (that affects only that person) and ∆P is the (per capita) response of the peer group to a change in the same parameter that affects the entire peer group."&lt;ref&gt;Sheinkman, José. ''Social Interactions.'' Princeton. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. https://www.princeton.edu/~joses/wp/socialinteractions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the ratio of an individual action to an exogenous parameter to the aggregate effect of the same parameter on the individual's peers.

For example, we know that health outcomes strongly correlate with education level.  Given the social multiplier effect, we know that in the aggregate, if a poorly educated individual moves into a highly educated area they will experience some of the positive health effects associated with being more educated.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Enrico. ''The New Geography of Jobs.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: 2012. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important however to distinguish between 1) a local-average model or [[Norm (social)|social norms]], whereby certain attributes are adopted based on them being the socially normal behavior, and 2) a local-aggregate model or social multiplier effect whereby "peer effects are captured by the sum of friends' efforts in some activity."&lt;ref&gt;Xiandong Liu et. al. "Social Multiplier versus Social Norms: What Matters Most for Outcomes?" Center For Economic Policy Research: 2013. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. http://www.voxeu.org/article/social-multiplier-versus-social-norms-what-matters-most-outcomes.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former an individual pays a price for deviating from a norm.  In the latter, as an individual gains more peers who have a certain attribute, they will experience greater utility for adopting this attribute as well.  The following are some examples of research on the social multiplier effect.

== Examples ==
Researchers Scott E. Carrell et. al. have shown that one's friends' fitness affects one's own fitness.  They find that "each out-of-shape individual creates two additional out-of-shape individuals through their social interactions."&lt;ref&gt;Scott E. Carrell et. al. "Is Poor Fitness Contagious?: Evidence From Randomly Assigned Friends." Penn State University: 2010. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.296.5005&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Another researcher Jeffery Fletcher has found that a 10 percent increase in the number of students who smoke at a high school increases the chances another student will smoke by about 3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19382102 | doi=10.1002/hec.1488 | volume=19 | issue=4 | title=Social interactions and smoking: evidence using multiple student cohorts, instrumental variables, and school fixed effects | year=2010 | journal=Health Econ | pages=466–84 | last1 = Fletcher | first1 = JM}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Xiaodong Liu et. al. have found that there is a multiplier effect for [[juvenile delinquency]] in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Xiandong Liu et. al. "Social Multiplier versus Social Norms: What Matters Most for Outcomes?" Center For Economic Policy Research: 2013. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. http://www.voxeu.org/article/social-multiplier-versus-social-norms-what-matters-most-outcomes.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in another article Carell et. al. find that peer cheating increases the likelihood that an individual will cheat.&lt;ref&gt;Scott E. Carrell et. al. "Peer Effects in Academic Cheating." Social Science Research Network: 2005. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=842224&lt;/ref&gt;

The social multiplier effect is of particular concern to researchers in economic geography. It is well documented that factors like income and education have strong positive correlations with many aspects of health. This is important because the geographic distribution of income and education is becoming increasingly stratified.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Enrico. ''The New Geography of Jobs.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: 2012. p. 101-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, since 1980, on average, cities that had high levels of college educated workers are becoming increasingly college educated whereas those who had low levels are becoming increasingly less educated. The same trend applies to income.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Enrico. ''The New Geography of Jobs.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: 2012. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, as the distribution of income and education level becomes more disparate, many low income regions lose out on the social multiplier benefits they once enjoyed.

'''Spatial visualization ability''' or '''visual-spatial ability''' is the ability to mentally manipulate [[Two dimensional|2-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|3-dimensional]] figures.  It is typically measured with simple [[cognitive test]]s and is predictive of user performance with some kinds of [[user interface]]s.

== Measurement ==
The cognitive tests used to measure spatial visualization ability including [[mental rotation]] tasks like the [[Mental Rotations Test]] or  mental cutting tasks like the [[Mental Cutting Test]]; and [[cognitive tests]] like the VZ-1 (Form Board), VZ-2 (Paper Folding), and VZ-3 (Surface Development) tests from the Kit of Factor-Reference cognitive tests produced by [[Educational Testing Service]].  Though the descriptions of spatial visualization and mental rotation sound similar, mental rotation is a particular task that can be accomplished using spatial visualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=J.|last2=Kent|first2=L.|year=2003|title=Apparency of contingencies in single panel and pull-down menus|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|volume=49|issue=1|pages=59–78|doi=10.1006/ijhc.1998.0200|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minnesota Paper Form Board Test|Form Board test]] involves giving participants a shape and a set of smaller shapes which they are then instructed to determine which combination of small shapes will fill the larger shape completely without overlapping. The Paper Folding test involves showing participants a sequence of folds in a piece of paper, through which a set of holes is then punched. The participants must choose which of a set of unfolded papers with holes corresponds to the one they have just seen.

The Surface Development test involves giving participants a flat shape with numbered sides and a three-dimensional shape with lettered sides and asking the participants to indicate which numbered side corresponds to which lettered side.

== Gender differences ==
{{See also|Sex differences in intelligence#Spatial ability}}
According to certain studies, men on average have one standard deviation higher spatial intelligence quotient than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Michèle|last2=Chevrier|first2=Eliane|date=October 2003|title=Does men's advantage in mental rotation persist when real three-dimensional objects are either felt or seen?|journal=[[Memory &amp; Cognition]]|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1136–1145|doi=10.3758/BF03196134|issn=0090-502X|pmid=14704028}}&lt;/ref&gt; This domain is one of the few where clear [[Sex and intelligence|sex differences in cognition]] appear. Researchers at the [[University of Toronto]] say that differences between men and women on some tasks that require spatial skills are largely eliminated after both groups play a video game for only a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Jing|last2=Spence|first2=Ian|last3=Pratt|first3=Jay|date=2016-05-06|title=Playing an Action Video Game Reduces Gender Differences in Spatial Cognition|journal=[[Psychological Science]]|language=en|volume=18|issue=10|pages=850–855|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01990.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.392.9474|pmid=17894600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Herman Witkin]] had claimed women are more "visually dependent" than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality through perception: An experimental and clinical study|last=Witkin|first=H.

B. |last6=Wapner|first6=S.|date=1954|publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper]]|location=New York|oclc=2660853|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has recently been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnett-Cowan|first=M.|last2=Dyde|first2=R.

Other studies suggest gender differences in spatial thinking may be explained by a [[stereotype threat]] effect. The fear of fulfilling stereotypes negatively affects the performance which results in a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGlone|first=Matthew S.|last2=Aronson|first2=Joshua|title=Stereotype threat, identity salience, and spatial reasoning|journal=[[Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology]]|volume=27|issue=5|pages=486–493|doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2006.06.003|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive significance, if any, of male superiority in spatial navigation has been questioned. A 2012 study suggests that male superiority in spatial navigation is more likely derived from hormonal differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clint|first=Edward K.|last2=Sober|first2=Elliott|last3=Garland|first3=Theodore|last4=Rhodes|first4=Justin S.|date=2013|title=Male Superiority in Spatial Navigation: Adaptation or Side Effect?|journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]|volume=87|issue=4|pages=289–313|doi=10.1086/668168|issn=0033-5770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age differences ==
Older adults tend to perform worse on measures of spatial visualization ability than younger adults, and this effect seems to occur even among people who use spatial visualization frequently on the job, such as [[architect]]s and [[Surveying|surveyors]] (though they still perform better on the measures than others of the same age). It is, however, possible that the types of spatial visualization used by architects are not measured accurately by the tests.{{Which|date=January 2015}}

== History ==
The construct of spatial visualization ability was first identified as separate from general intelligence in the 20th Century, and its implications for computer system design were identified in the 1980s.

In 1987, [[Kim Vicente]] and colleagues ran a battery of cognitive tests on a set of participants and then determined which cognitive abilities correlated with performance on a computerized information search task.  They found that the only significant predictors of performance were [[vocabulary]] and spatial visualization ability, and that those with high spatial visualization ability were twice as fast to perform the task as those with lower levels of spatial visualization ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vicente|first=K.

==Origins==
The theory of the great replacement can be traced back to the 1973 novel ''[[Le Camp des Saints]]'' by [[Jean Raspail]] which depicts the collapse of Western culture owing to an overwhelming "tidal wave" of Third World immigration. The novel, along with the theory of [[Eurabia]] developed by the Swiss-Israeli writer [[Bat Ye'or]] in 2005, set the ground then for [[Renaud Camus]] to develop and present his book entitled ''The Great Replacement'' in 2012.&lt;ref name="Abdeslam"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ait Abdeslam |first1=Abderrahim |title=The vilification of Muslim diaspora in French fictional novels: 'Soumission' (2015) and 'Petit Frère' (2008) as case studies |journal=Journal of Multicultural Discourses |volume=13 |issue=3 |date=28 August 2018 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1080/17447143.2018.1511717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credited as the "progenitor of the Great Replacement doctrine" by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/07/05/hate-europe-june-2018 |title=Hate in Europe: June 2018 |work=Hatewatch |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camus has stated that "the great replacement is very simple.

[[Image:Möbius strip.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Möbius strip]]s, which have only one surface and one edge, are a kind of object studied in topology.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''topology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] τόπος, ''place'', and λόγος, ''study'') is concerned with the properties of [[Space (mathematics)|space]] that are preserved under [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[Deformation theory|deformations]], such as [[stretching]], twisting, [[crumpling]] and bending, but not [[tearing]] or [[Quotient space (topology)|gluing]]. 

An [[Dimension|n-dimensional]] topological space is a space (not necessarily [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]) with certain properties of [[connectedness]] and [[compact (topology)|compactness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/topology|title=the definition of topology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The space may be [[Differentiable function|continuous]] (like all [[Point (geometry)|points]] on a rubber sheet), or [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] (like the set of [[integer]]s). It can be [[Open set|open]] (like the set of points inside a [[circle]]) or [[Closed set|closed]] (like the set of points inside a circle, together with the points on the circle).

Topology developed as a field of study out of [[geometry]] and [[set theory]], through analysis of concepts such as space, dimension, and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.wayne.edu/~rrb/topology.html |title= What is Topology? A short and idiosyncratic answer |first=Robert |last=Bruner |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas go back to [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who in the 17th century envisioned the ''geometria situs'' (Greek-Latin for "geometry of place") and ''analysis situs'' (Greek-Latin for "picking apart of place").  [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] Problem and [[Euler characteristic#Polyhedra|Polyhedron Formula]] are arguably the field's first theorems. The term ''topology'' was introduced by [[Johann Benedict Listing]] in the 19th century, although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed.  By the middle of the 20th century, topology had become a major branch of mathematics.

==History==
[[Image:Konigsberg bridges.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] was a problem solved by Euler.]]

Topology, as a well-defined mathematical discipline, originates in the early part of the twentieth century, but some isolated results can be traced back several centuries.&lt;ref name=Croom7&gt;{{harvnb|Croom|1989|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are certain questions in geometry investigated by Leonhard Euler. His 1736 paper on the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] is regarded as one of the first practical applications of topology.&lt;ref name=Croom7 /&gt; On 14 November 1750 Euler wrote to a friend that he had realised the importance of the ''edges'' of a [[polyhedron]]. This led to his [[Euler's polyhedron formula|polyhedron formula]], ''V'' − ''E'' + ''F'' = 2 (where ''V'', ''E'' and ''F'' respectively indicate the number of vertices, edges and faces of the polyhedron). Some authorities regard this analysis as the first theorem, signalling the birth of topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richeson|2008|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aleksandrov|1969|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further contributions were made by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Ludwig Schläfli]], [[Johann Benedict Listing]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Enrico Betti]].&lt;ref name="Richeson"&gt;Richeson (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Listing introduced the term "Topologie" in ''Vorstudien zur Topologie'', written in his native German, in 1847, having used the word for ten years in correspondence before its first appearance in print.&lt;ref&gt;Listing, Johann Benedict, "Vorstudien zur Topologie", Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, Göttingen, p.&amp;nbsp;67, 1848&lt;/ref&gt; The English form "topology" was used in 1883 in Listing's obituary in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] to distinguish "qualitative geometry from the ordinary geometry in which quantitative relations chiefly are treated".&lt;ref&gt;Tait, Peter Guthrie, "Johann Benedict Listing (obituary)", Nature '''27''', 1 February 1883, pp. 316–317&lt;/ref&gt; The term "topologist" in the sense of a specialist in topology was used in 1905 in the magazine ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Their work was corrected, consolidated and greatly extended by [[Henri Poincaré]]. In 1895 he published his ground-breaking paper on ''[[Analysis Situs (paper)|Analysis Situs]]'', which introduced the concepts now known as [[homotopy]] and [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]], which are now considered part of [[algebraic topology]].&lt;ref name="Richeson"/&gt;

Unifying the work on function spaces of [[Georg Cantor]], [[Vito Volterra]], [[Cesare Arzelà]], [[Jacques Hadamard]], [[Giulio Ascoli]] and others, [[Maurice Fréchet]] introduced the [[metric space]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fréchet |first=Maurice |title=Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel |work=PhD dissertation |year=1906 |oclc=8897542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A metric space is now considered a special case of a general topological space, with any given topological space potentially giving rise to many distinct metric spaces. In 1914, [[Felix Hausdorff]] coined the term "topological space" and gave the definition for what is now called a [[Hausdorff space]].&lt;ref&gt;Hausdorff, Felix, "Grundzüge der Mengenlehre", Leipzig: Veit. In (Hausdorff Werke, II (2002), 91–576)&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a topological space is a slight generalization of Hausdorff spaces, given in 1922 by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croom|1989|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern topology depends strongly on the ideas of set theory, developed by Georg Cantor in the later part of the 19th century. In addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory, Cantor considered point sets in [[Euclidean space]] as part of his study of [[Fourier series]]. For further developments, see [[point-set topology]] and algebraic topology.

==Introduction==
Topology can be formally defined as "the study of qualitative properties of certain objects (called [[topological space]]s) that are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under a certain kind of transformation (called a [[continuous map]]), especially those properties that are invariant under a certain kind of invertible transformation (called [[homeomorphism]]s)."

Topology is also used to refer to a structure imposed upon a set ''X'', a structure that essentially 'characterizes' the set ''X'' as a topological space by taking proper care of properties such as [[limit of a sequence|convergence]], connectedness and [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]], upon transformation.

Topological spaces show up naturally in almost every branch of mathematics. This has made topology one of the great unifying ideas of mathematics.

The motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved, but rather on the way they are put together. For example, the square and the circle have many properties in common: they are both one dimensional objects (from a topological point of view) and both separate the plane into two parts, the part inside and the part outside.

In one of the first papers in topology, Leonhard Euler demonstrated that it was impossible to find a route through the town of Königsberg (now [[Kaliningrad]]) that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once. This result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges, nor on their distance from one another, but only on connectivity properties: which bridges connect to which islands or riverbanks. This problem in introductory mathematics called ''[[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]'' led to the branch of mathematics known as [[graph theory]].

[[Image:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|240px|A continuous deformation (a type of homeomorphism) of a mug into a doughnut (torus) and back]]

Similarly, the [[hairy ball theorem]] of algebraic topology says that "one cannot comb the hair flat on a hairy ball without creating a [[cowlick]]." This fact is immediately convincing to most people, even though they might not recognize the more formal statement of the theorem, that there is no nonvanishing continuous [[vector field|tangent vector field]] on the sphere. As with the ''Bridges of Königsberg'', the result does not depend on the shape of the sphere; it applies to any kind of smooth blob, as long as it has no holes.

To deal with these problems that do not rely on the exact shape of the objects, one must be clear about just what properties these problems ''do'' rely on. From this need arises the notion of homeomorphism. The impossibility of crossing each bridge just once applies to any arrangement of bridges homeomorphic to those in Königsberg, and the hairy ball theorem applies to any space homeomorphic to a sphere.

Intuitively, two spaces are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. A traditional joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut, since a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHBj2oaSALoC&amp;pg=PA204|title=Differential Equations: A Dynamical Systems Approach. Part II: Higher-Dimensional Systems|last1=Hubbard|first1=John H.|last2=West|first2=Beverly H.|publisher=Springer|year=1995|isbn=978-0-387-94377-0|series=Texts in Applied Mathematics|volume=18|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeomorphism can be considered the most basic [[Homeomorphism|topological equivalence]]. Another is [[homotopy equivalence]]. This is harder to describe without getting technical, but the essential notion is that two objects are homotopy equivalent if they both result from "squishing" some larger object.

An introductory [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] is to classify the uppercase letters of the [[English alphabet]] according to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence. The result depends partially on the font used. The figures use the [[sans-serif]] [[Myriad (font)|Myriad]] [[font]]. Homotopy equivalence is a rougher relationship than homeomorphism; a homotopy equivalence class can contain several homeomorphism classes. The simple case of homotopy equivalence described above can be used here to show two letters are homotopy equivalent. For example, O fits inside P and the tail of the P can be squished to the "hole" part.

Homeomorphism classes are:
*no holes corresponding with C, G, I, J, L, M, N, S, U, V, W, and Z;
*no holes and three tails corresponding with E, F, T, and Y {{clarify|date=December 2017|reason=couldn't this be split into two classes: a bar with three tails and a point with three tails (or equivalently a line with two tails)?}};
*no holes and four tails corresponding with X;
*one hole and no tail corresponding with D and O;
*one hole and one tail corresponding with P and Q;
*one hole and two tails corresponding with A and R;
*two holes and no tail corresponding with B; and
*a bar with four tails corresponding with H and K; the "bar" on the ''K'' is almost too short to see.

Homotopy classes are larger, because the tails can be squished down to a point. They are:
*one hole,
*two holes, and
*no holes.

To classify the letters correctly, we must show that two letters in the same class are equivalent and two letters in different classes are not equivalent. In the case of homeomorphism, this can be done by selecting points and showing their removal disconnects the letters differently. For example, X and Y are not homeomorphic because removing the center point of the X leaves four pieces; whatever point in Y corresponds to this point, its removal can leave at most three pieces. The case of homotopy equivalence is harder and requires a more elaborate argument showing an algebraic invariant, such as the [[fundamental group]], is different on the supposedly differing classes.

Letter topology has practical relevance in [[stencil]] [[typography]]. For instance, [[Braggadocio (typeface)|Braggadocio]] font stencils are made of one connected piece of material.

==Concepts==

===Topologies on sets===
{{Main|Topological space}}

The term '''topology''' also refers to a specific mathematical idea central to the area of mathematics called topology. Informally, a topology tells how elements of a set relate spatially to each other. The same set can have different topologies. For instance, the [[real line]], the [[complex plane]] (which is a 1-dimensional complex vector space), and the [[Cantor set]] can be thought of as the same set with different topologies.

Formally, let ''X'' be a set and let ''τ'' be a [[family of sets|family]] of subsets of ''X''. Then ''τ'' is called a ''topology on X'' if:

# Both the empty set and ''X'' are elements of ''τ''.
# Any union of elements of ''τ'' is an element of ''τ''.
# Any intersection of finitely many elements of ''τ'' is an element of ''τ''.

If ''τ'' is a topology on ''X'', then the pair (''X'', ''τ'') is called a topological space. The notation ''X&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be used to denote a set ''X'' endowed with the particular topology ''τ''.

The members of ''τ'' are called ''open sets'' in ''X''. A subset of ''X'' is said to be closed if its complement is in ''τ'' (i.e., its complement is open). A subset of ''X'' may be open, closed, both ([[clopen set]]), or neither. The empty set and ''X'' itself are always both closed and open. A subset of ''X'' including an open set containing a point ''x'' is called a '[[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]]' of ''x''.

===Continuous functions and homeomorphisms===
{{Main|Continuous function|homeomorphism}}
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] or map from one topological space to another is called ''continuous'' if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the [[real number]]s to the real numbers (both spaces with the standard topology), then this definition of continuous is equivalent to the definition of continuous in [[calculus]]. If a continuous function is [[injective function|one-to-one]] and [[surjective function|onto]], and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. But the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.

===Manifolds===
{{Main|Manifold}}
While topological spaces can be extremely varied and exotic, many areas of topology focus on the more familiar class of spaces known as manifolds. A '''manifold''' is a topological space that resembles Euclidean space near each point.  More precisely, each point of an ''n''-dimensional manifold has a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] that is [[homeomorphic]] to the Euclidean space of dimension ''n''.  [[Line (geometry)|Lines]] and [[circle]]s, but not [[Lemniscate|figure eights]], are one-dimensional manifolds.  Two-dimensional manifolds are also called [[Surface (topology)|surfaces]].  Examples include the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], the sphere, and the torus, which can all be realized without self-intersection in three dimensions, but also the Klein bottle and [[real projective plane]], which cannot.

==Topics==

===General topology===
{{Main|General topology}}
'''General topology''' is the branch of topology dealing with the basic set-theoretic definitions and constructions used in topology.&lt;ref&gt;Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Colin Conrad, and Robert David Franzosa. Introduction to topology: pure and applied. Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the foundation of most other branches of topology, including differential topology, geometric topology, and algebraic topology. Another name for general topology is '''point-set topology'''.

The fundamental concepts in point-set topology are ''continuity'', ''compactness'', and ''connectedness''. Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points. Compact sets are those that can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size. Connected sets are sets that cannot be divided into two pieces that are far apart. The words ''nearby'', ''arbitrarily small'', and ''far apart'' can all be made precise by using open sets. If we change the definition of ''open set'', we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice of definition for ''open set'' is called a ''topology''. A set with a topology is called a ''topological space''.

''Metric spaces'' are an important class of topological spaces where distances can be assigned a number called a ''metric''. Having a metric simplifies many proofs, and many of the most common topological spaces are metric spaces.

===Algebraic topology===
{{Main|Algebraic topology}}
'''Algebraic topology''' is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from [[abstract algebra]] to study topological spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Hatcher, [http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html ''Algebraic topology.''] (2002) Cambridge University Press, xii+544 pp.&amp;nbsp;{{isbn|0-521-79160-X}} and {{isbn|0-521-79540-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that [[classification theorem|classify]] topological spaces [[up to]] homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.

The most important of these invariants are [[homotopy group]]s, homology, and [[cohomology]].

Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a [[free group]] is again a free group.

===Differential topology===
{{Main|Differential topology}}
'''Differential topology''' is the field dealing with [[differentiable function]]s on [[differentiable manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John M. | last = Lee | year = 2006 | title = Introduction to Smooth Manifolds | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn = 978-0-387-95448-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to [[differential geometry]] and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds.

More specifically, differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a [[smooth structure]] on a manifold to be defined.  Smooth manifolds are 'softer' than manifolds with extra geometric structures, which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and [[Deformation theory|deformations]] that exist in differential topology. For instance, volume and [[Riemannian curvature]] are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold—that is, one can smoothly "flatten out" certain manifolds, but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume.

===Geometric topology===
{{Main|Geometric topology}}

'''Geometric topology''' is a branch of topology that primarily focuses on low-dimensional [[Manifold|manifolds]] (i.e. spaces of dimensions 2,3 and 4) and their interaction with geometry, but it also includes some higher-dimensional topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/2840/what-is-geometric-topology

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Sher and R.J. Daverman (2002), ''Handbook of Geometric Topology'', North-Holland. {{isbn|0-444-82432-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of topics in geometric topology are [[Orientable manifold|orientability]], [[handle decomposition]]s, [[local flatness]], crumpling and the planar and higher-dimensional [[Jordan-Schönflies theorem|Schönflies theorem]].

In high-dimensional topology, [[characteristic classes]] are a basic invariant, and [[surgery theory]] is a key theory.

Low-dimensional topology is strongly geometric, as reflected in the [[uniformization theorem]] in 2 dimensions – every surface admits a constant curvature metric; geometrically, it has one of 3 possible geometries: positive [[curvature]]/spherical, zero curvature/flat, negative curvature/hyperbolic – and the [[geometrization conjecture]] (now theorem) in 3 dimensions – every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of eight possible geometries.

2-dimensional topology can be studied as [[complex geometry]] in one variable ([[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] surfaces are complex curves) – by the uniformization theorem every [[Conformal geometry|conformal class]] of [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] is equivalent to a unique complex one, and 4-dimensional topology can be studied from the point of view of complex geometry in two variables (complex surfaces), though not every 4-manifold admits a complex structure.

===Generalizations===
Occasionally, one needs to use the tools of topology but a "set of points" is not available. In [[pointless topology]] one considers instead the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of open sets as the basic notion of the theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnstone | first1 = Peter T. | authorlink = Peter Johnstone (mathematician) | year = 1983 | title = The point of pointless topology | url = http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183550014 | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 41–53 | doi = 10.1090/s0273-0979-1983-15080-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]] are structures defined on arbitrary [[category theory|categories]] that allow the definition of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] on those categories, and with that the definition of general cohomology theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Artin | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Artin | title=Grothendieck topologies | publisher=Harvard University, Dept. of Mathematics | year=1962 | zbl=0208.48701 | location=Cambridge, MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Biology===

[[Knot theory]], a branch of topology, is used in biology to study the effects of certain enzymes on DNA. These enzymes cut, twist, and reconnect the DNA, causing knotting with observable effects such as slower [[electrophoresis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Colin |last= Adams|author-link=Colin Adams (mathematician)|title=The Knot Book: An Elementary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots |publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8218-3678-1|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topology is also used in [[evolutionary biology]] to represent the relationship between [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]].&lt;ref name=bstadler2001&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2001.2423 |pmid=11894994 |title=The Topology of the Possible: Formal Spaces Underlying Patterns of Evolutionary Change |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=213 |issue=2 |pages=241–274 |year=2001 |last1=Stadler |first1=Bärbel M.R. |last2=Stadler |first2=Peter F. |last3=Wagner |first3=Günter P. |last4=Fontana |first4=Walter |citeseerx=10.1.1.63.7808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenotypic forms that appear quite different can be separated by only a few mutations depending on how genetic changes map to phenotypic changes during development. In neuroscience, topological quantities like the Euler characteristic and Betti number have been used to measure the complexity of patterns of activity in neural networks.

===Computer science===

[[Topological data analysis]] uses techniques from algebraic topology to determine the large scale structure of a set (for instance, determining if a cloud of points is spherical or [[torus|toroidal]]). The main method used by topological data analysis is:
# Replace a set of data points with a family of [[simplicial complex]]es, indexed by a proximity parameter.
# Analyse these topological complexes via algebraic topology – specifically, via the theory of [[persistent homology]].&lt;ref name=carlsson2009&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/S0273-0979-09-01249-X.pdf|title=Topology and data|author=Gunnar Carlsson|journal=Bulletin (New Series) of the American Mathematical Society|volume=46|issue=2|date=April 2009|pages=255–308|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-09-01249-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Encode the persistent homology of a data set in the form of a parameterized version of a [[Betti number]], which is called a '''barcode'''.&lt;ref name=carlsson2009/&gt;

=== Physics ===
Topology is relevant to physics in areas such as [[condensed matter physics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2016|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2016/press.html|publisher=Nobel Foundation|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quantum field theory]] and [[physical cosmology]].

The topological dependence of mechanical properties in solids is of interest in disciplines of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[materials science]]. Electrical and mechanical properties depend on the arrangement and network structures of [[molecules]] and elementary units in materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Topological properties of a self-assembled electrical network via ab initio calculation|journal=Sci. Rep.|volume=7|pages=41621|date=2017|doi=10.1038/srep41621|pmid=28155863|pmc=5290745|bibcode=2017NatSR...741621S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[compressive strength]] of [[Crumpling|crumpled]] topologies is studied in attempts to understand the high strength to weight of such structures that are mostly empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cambou| first1=Anne Dominique |last2=Narayanan | first2=Menon| title=Three-dimensional structure of a sheet crumpled into a ball.| journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2011 | volume=108 |issue=36 |pages=14741–14745 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1019192108| pmid=21873249 |arxiv=1203.5826|bibcode=2011PNAS..10814741C|pmc=3169141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topology is of further significance in [[Contact mechanics]] where the dependence of stiffness and friction on the [[Fractal dimension|dimensionality]] of surface structures is the subject of interest with applications in multi-body physics.

A '''[[topological quantum field theory]]''' (or '''topological field theory''' or '''TQFT''') is a quantum field theory that computes [[topological invariant]]s.

Although TQFTs were invented by physicists, they are also of mathematical interest, being related to, among other things, [[knot theory]], the theory of [[four-manifold]]s in algebraic topology, and to the theory of [[moduli spaces]] in algebraic geometry. [[Simon Donaldson|Donaldson]], [[Vaughan Jones|Jones]], [[Edward Witten|Witten]], and [[Maxim Kontsevich|Kontsevich]] have all won [[Fields Medal]]s for work related to topological field theory.

The topological classification of [[Calabi-Yau manifold]]s has important implications in [[string theory]], as different manifolds can sustain different kinds of strings.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, S. &amp; Nadis, S.; ''The Shape of Inner Space'', Basic Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, topology can be used to describe the overall shape of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shape of Space: How to Visualize Surfaces and Three-dimensional Manifolds'' 2nd ed (Marcel Dekker, 1985, {{isbn|0-8247-7437-X}})&lt;/ref&gt; This area of research is commonly known as [[spacetime topology]].

===Geography and Landscape Ecology===
Topological methods have been used to evaluate the complexity of geomorphological and ecological functions in a landscape and can be applied on geographic maps, or field observations (Papadimitriou, 2013), or even on models and programs representing such functions and their changes in time (Papadimitriou, 2012). 

===Robotics===
The possible positions of a [[robot]] can be described by a [[manifold]] called [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].&lt;ref&gt;John J. Craig, ''Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control'', 3rd Ed. Prentice-Hall, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of [[motion planning]], one finds paths between two points in configuration space. These paths represent a motion of the robot's [[Joint|joints]] and other parts into the desired pose.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Farber, ''Invitation to Topological Robotics'', European Mathematical Society, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games and puzzles===
[[Disentanglement puzzle|Tanglement puzzles]] are based on topological aspects of the puzzle's shapes and components.&lt;ref&gt;[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/644676/how-to-reason-about-disentanglement-tavern-puzzles https://math.stackexchange.com] How to reason about disentanglement puzzles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=27642974 |doi=10.2307/27642974 |title= Disentangling Topological Puzzles by Using Knot Theory |first=Mathew |last=Horak |journal=Mathematics Magazine |year=2006 |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=368–375}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sma.epfl.ch/~ojangure/Notes.pdf http://sma.epfl.ch/Notes.pdf] A Topological Puzzle, Inta Bertuccioni, December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.futilitycloset.com/2012/06/23/the-figure-8-puzzle/ https://www.futilitycloset.com/the-figure-8-puzzle] The Figure Eight Puzzle, Science and Math, June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiber Art===
In order to create a continuous join of pieces in a modular construction, it is necessary to create an unbroken path in an order which surrounds each piece and traverses each edge only once. This process is an application of the [[Eulerian path]].&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, Edie: ''Connect the shapes crochet motifs: creative techniques for joining motifs of all shapes.'' ©2012 Storey Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trager approach''' is a form of [[somatics|somatic education]]. Proponents claim the Trager approach helps release deep-seated physical and mental patterns and facilitates deep [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], increased physical mobility, and [[mental clarity]].&lt;ref&gt;Trivieri, Larry, and John W. Anderson. Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide. Berkeley, Calif: [[Celestial Arts]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Knaster"&gt;{{cite book |last= Knaster |first= Mirka |year= 1996 |title= Discovering the Body's Wisdom: A Comprehensive Guide to More Than Fifty Mind-Body Practices |publisher= [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] |pages= 178–81 |isbn= 9780307575500}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder, Milton Trager, called his work Psychophysical Integration. He was an athlete, dancer, and bodybuilder. He began doing bodywork with no training and later worked under a variety of practitioner licenses, including an MD earned in Mexico followed by 2 years residency in psychiatry.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; Trager wanted western medicine to accept his proposed mind-body connection in treating challenging conditions such as postpolio, Parkinson's, and other neuromuscular conditions. Doctors reportedly referred patients to him and were surprised by the results, but "none seemed to consider his drugless treatments as effective as surgery or medication" and the medical approach to these conditions did not fundamentally shift away from them as he had envisioned.&lt;ref name="Stillerman"/&gt; 
Late in life, at the [[Esalen Institute]], he was encouraged to begin teaching, which he did for the last 22 years of his life.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stillerman |first= Elaine |year= 2016 |edition= second |title= Modalities for Massage and Bodywork |publisher= [[Mosby (publisher)|Mosby]] |pages= 402–14 |isbn= 9780323239318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of a session, the practitioner enters into a state of [[meditation]] that Milton Trager originally termed "hook-up".&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; From this state of mind, the practitioner uses gentle [[touch]] and a combination of passive and active [[:wikt:movement|movement]] with the intent of teaching the recipient how to move with less effort.&lt;ref name= "Levine"&gt;{{cite book |last= Levine |first= Andrew |year= 1998 |title= The Bodywork and Massage Sourcebook |publisher= [[Lowell House]] |pages= 159–171 |isbn= 9780737300987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contact is gentle in a sense; it may be quite firm but is without strain or resistance.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; Regarding pain, Trager practitioners avoid causing pain, and attempt to contact the body in a way that allows the client to have decreased fear of pain and increased willingness to be present with the full range of sensations.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; Practitioners are taught to allow a tone of curiosity, playfulness, and effortlessness to guide their work.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; In addition to hands-on bodywork, clients are taught a series of movements called "Mentastics" to be performed with a certain mental attention. While doing these movements, the client is asked to explore how to move with the least tension and effort possible.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7159">The '''Underhanded C Contest''' is a [[Computer programming|programming]] contest to turn out code that is malicious, but passes a rigorous inspection, and looks like an honest mistake even if discovered. The contest rules define a task, and a malicious component. Entries must perform the task in a malicious manner as defined by the contest, and hide the malice. Contestants are allowed to use [[C (programming language)|C]]-like compiled languages to make their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.i-programmer.info/news/204/5727.html | title=Underhanded C Contest Revived | publisher=I Programmer | date=2013-04-06 | accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest was organized by Dr. Scott Craver&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.binghamton.edu/watson/programs/academic-departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/people/faculty-and-staff.html Faculty and Staff page of EE Dept. at Binghamton University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529234243/http://www2.binghamton.edu/watson/programs/academic-departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/people/faculty-and-staff.html |date=May 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Department of Electrical Engineering at [[Binghamton University]] ([[New York State]]). The contest was initially inspired by Daniel Horn’s Obfuscated V contest in the fall of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.underhanded-c.org/_page_id_7.html | title=Underhanded C Contest FAQ | publisher=Underhanded C contest | accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For the 2005 to 2008 contests, the prize was a $100 gift certificate to [[ThinkGeek]]. The 2009 contest had its prize increased to $200 due to the very late announcement of winners, and the prize for the 2013 contest is also a $200 gift certificate.

The domain for the website has expired as of 2018-10-17.

==2005 Contest==
The 2005 contest had the task of basic image processing, such as resampling or smoothing, but covertly inserting unique and useful "fingerprinting" data into the image. Winning entries from 2005 used uninitialized data structures, reuse of pointers, and an embedding of [[machine code]] in constants.

==2006 Contest==
The 2006 contest required entries to count word occurrences, but have vastly different runtimes on different platforms. To accomplish the task, entries used fork implementation errors, optimization problems, [[endianness|endian]] differences and various API implementation differences. The winner called strlen() in a loop, leading to quadratic complexity which was optimised out by a Linux compiler but not by Windows.

==2007 Contest==
The 2007 contest required entries to encrypt and decrypt files with a strong, readily available encryption algorithm such that a low percentage (1% - 0.01%) of the encrypted files may be cracked in a reasonably short time. The contest commenced on April 16 and ended on July 4.  Entries used misimplementations of RC4, misused API calls, and incorrect function prototypes.

==2008 Contest==
The 2008 contest required entries to redact a rectangular portion of a [[Netpbm format|PPM]] image in a way that the portion may be reconstructed. Any method of "blocking out" the rectangle was allowed, as long as the original pixels were removed, and the pixel reconstruction didn't have to be perfect&lt;ref&gt;[http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=8 2008 contest rules] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322223931/http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=8 |date=March 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the reconstruction's fidelity to the original file would be a factor in judging).  The contest began on June 12, and ended on September 30.  Entries tended to either xor the region with a retrievable pseudo-random mask or append the masked data to the end of the file format.  The two placing programs both used improperly defined macros while the winner, choosing to work with an uncommon text based format, zeroed out pixel values while keeping the number of digits intact.

==2009 Contest==
The 2009 contest required participants to write a program that sifts through routing directives but redirects a piece of luggage based on some innocuous-looking comment in the space-delimited input data file. The contest began December 29, 2009, and was due to end on March 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718125443/http://xcott.com/ The Underhanded C Contest »&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], [http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18 xcott.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085335/http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18 |date=October 6, 2014 }} (archived from [http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18 the original]  on 2011-07-18)&lt;/ref&gt; However, no activity occurred for three years. The winners were only announced on April 1, 2013, with one overall winner and six runners-up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100108082655/http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=19 The Underhanded C Contest » Also, we’re looking for good PhD students&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130409231352/http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~scraver/underhanded/ The Underhanded C Contest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 Contest==
The 2013 contest was announced on April 1, 2013, and was due July 4, 2013; results were announced on September 29, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underhanded-c.org/_p_23.html|title=2013 Winners|author=Scott Craver|date=2014-09-29|accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was about a fictional social website called "ObsessBook". The challenge was to write a function to compute the DERPCON (Degrees of Edge-Reachable Personal CONnection) between two users that "accidentally" computes a too low distance for a special user.

==2014 Contest==
The 2014 contest was announced on November 2, 2014, and was due January 1, 2015.  The results were announced on June 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underhanded-c.org/_p_26.html|title=The 7th Underhanded C Contest is now Open|author=Scott Craver|date=2014-11-02|accessdate=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object was to write surveillance code for a Twitter-like social networking service, to comply with a secret government surveillance request; but for non-obvious reasons, the code must subtly leak the act of surveillance to a user.

==2015 Contest==
The 2015 contest was announced on August 15, 2015, and was due November 15, 2015.  The results were announced on January 15, 2016. The scenario was a nuclear disarmament process between the Peoples Glorious Democratic Republic of Alice and the Glorious Democratic Peoples Republic of Bob, and the mission was to write a test function for comparing potentially fissile material against a reference sample, which under certain circumstances would label a warhead as containing fissile material when it doesn't.

==Utilization in engineering==
In [[engineering]] utilization or operational stage of a system or equipment [[System lifecycle|life-cycle]] is a period of time when their quality is realized in practical use to achieve intended objectives and supported by accomplishment of storage, [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance, repair]], etc. Subsequently, the term "utilization" may have two meaning depending on context: 1) a process of actual use of a system or equipment - in case of simple products and 2) a stage of a complex [[System lifecycle|product life-cycle]] - in case of use within the [[product life-cycle management]] processes. &lt;ref name="NATO_AAP48"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.fhi.nl/plot2012/archief/2010/images/aap-48e.pdf |title=NATO Standard AAP 48.

The action of making practical and effective use of something}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rental utilization==
In [[Rental management software|equipment and tool rental companies]], '''utilization''' is the primary method by which asset performance is measured and business success determined. In basic terms it is a measure of the actual revenue earned by assets against the potential revenue they could have earned.&lt;ref&gt;http://constructionequipmentdistribution.com/article-detail.cfm?id=10921486 Utilization is key to rental business&lt;/ref&gt; Rental utilization is divided into a number of different calculations, and not all companies work precisely the same way. In general terms however there are 2 key calculations: the '''physical utilization''' on the asset, which is measured based on the number of available days for rental against the number of days actually rented. (This may also be measured in hours for certain types of equipment), and the '''financial utilization''' on the asset (referred to in North America as $ Utilization) which is measured as the rental revenue achieved over a period of time against the potential revenue that could have been achieved based on a target or standard, non-discounted rate. Physical utilization is also sometimes referred to as '''spot utilization''', where a rental company looks at its current utilization of assets based on a single moment in time (e.g. now, 9 am today, etc.).

Utilization calculations may be varied based on many different factors. For example: 
* A company with equipment which requires [[Preventative Maintenance|preventative maintenance]] activities every 2 weeks, may decide that the number of available days in the month is decreased as it will unavailable due to maintenance for 2 days out of each month.
* Some rental businesses give "free days" on rental contract [[Invoicing|billing]] processes, for example on a national or public holiday, and therefore the equipment does not earn any money on those days, even though it is physically on rent.
* Some companies charge minimum rates, for example you may rent an excavator for 1 day, but be charged a three-day minimum. The Physical utilization will therefore be 100% on the day, but the financial utilization is actually 300% as you've earned 3 days revenue for 1 day's work.
* [[Rental management software|Rental Software]] is normally required to assist management teams in measuring and calculating utilization figures.
* [[Mobile asset management|Asset Tracking software]] may also be important in increasing or managing utilization figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Qualcomm|url=http://www.qualcomm.com/common/documents/white_papers/QUALCOMM-WP-EquipmentRental.pdf  |title= Using technology to improve utilization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilization in this context is heavily linked to [[Accounting|profitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cedmag.com/article-detail.cfm?id=10922778 |title= How to improve results|work=CED Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low physical utilization may be mitigated by keeping rental rates high, high physical utilization normally justifies keeping rental rates lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rentalmanagementmag.com/newsart.asp?ARTID=1509  |title=Close correlation between utilization and rental rates|work=Rental Management Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of equipment may also alter the relationship between rates and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=RentalPulse|url=http://www.rentalpulse.com/article.asp?ARTID=6519 |title=How utilization affects profitability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credit utilization==
Credit utilization is defined as the ratio of an entity's [[credit card]] and [[revolving loan]] balances to their [[credit limit]]s; in other words, it represents the amount of their credit limit that is being used. Credit utilization is one of several factors typically used by [[Credit score|credit scoring]] models because it is often correlated with [[Credit risk|lending risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=August 30, 2018|title=Understanding Credit Utilization: Credit Utilization and How It Affects Your Credit Score|url=https://www.thebalance.com/understanding-credit-utilization-960451|website=The Balance|date=July 10, 2018|author=Irby, LaToya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Credit Karma|url=https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/credit-card-utilization-and-your-credit-score/ |title=Credit card utilization and your credit scores|date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Win win}}
A '''win–win game''' is a [[game]] that, in game design or [[game theory]], is designed in a way that all participants can profit from it in one way or the other. In [[conflict resolution]], a '''win–win strategy''' is a collaborative strategy and conflict resolution process that aims to accommodate all participants.&lt;ref name=WWS-D-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=WWS-D-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=WWS-D-03/&gt; In [[economics]], it is a voluntary transaction where both parties gain wealth, as in [[the double thank-you of capitalism]].

==Types==
* In colloquial speech, a win–win situation often refers to a situation where one benefits, not necessarily through someone else's loss.
* In the context of [[group-dynamic game]]s, win–win games are also called "[[cooperative game]]s", "new games" or "games without losers".
* Mathematical [[game theory]] also refers to win–win games as [[non-zero-sum game]]s (although they may include situations where both players win or lose, as well).
* The TKI Thomas/Kilmann Conflict Profile provides a model that reveals preferences under stress and pressure. [[Collaboration]] style focuses on win–win outcomes.

===Group dynamics===
Group-dynamics win–win games have been increasingly popular since the end of the Vietnam war and have been successfully applied to all levels of society.

Group-dynamics win–win games emphasize the importance of cooperation, fun, sharing, caring and overall group success in contrast to domination, egoistic behavior and personal gain. All players are treated as equally important and valuable. Win–win games often also carry an ethical message of caring for the environment and a [[holistic]] approach to life and society. Win–win games are a powerful tool to give people [[self-confidence]] and a "we" experience, especially when they have suffered from emotional isolation.

An example would be a game where all players try to carry a huge "earth ball" (a ball several meters in diameter) over their heads while negotiating an obstacle course. This is a typical example of a win–win game for several reasons:
* There are no losers (everyone enjoys the accomplished task).
* All players are involved (no-one is left out or sits out).
* The game is psychologically working on many levels (communication, supporting each other, having fun in a group etc.)

There are also mathematical win–win games, the mathematical term being [[non-zero-sum games]]. Such games are often simply represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of payouts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2701">In [[Chinese philosophy]], '''xin''' can refer to one's "disposition" or "feelings" ({{zh|c=心 |p=xīn}}), or to one's confidence or trust in something or someone ({{zh|c=信 |p=xìn}}). Literally, ''xin'' (心) refers to the physical heart, though it is sometimes translated as "mind" as the ancient Chinese believed the heart was the center of human [[cognition]]. For this reason, it is also sometimes translated as "heart-mind". It has a connotation of intention, yet can be used to refer to long-term goals.&lt;ref&gt;Shun, Kwong Loi, "Mencius", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2010/entries/mencius/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], an important early [[Confucianism|Confucian]] thinker, considered ''xin'' (心) to be cultivated during one's life, in contrast to innate qualities of ''[[Nature (philosophy)#Eastern civilization and the philosophical question of nature|xing]]'' ({{zh|c=性 |p=xìng}}), or human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, Dan, "Xunzi", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/xunzi/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Daoism|Daoist]] view, specifically from the philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], understands ''xin'' (心) as being socialized, with environmental pressures influencing personal intentions, sometimes in such a way that can provoke disagreements and conflict. While a Confucian might take heart that ''xin'' (心) may be cultivated in order to develop ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'', or moral virtue, Zhuangzi considered this socialization as detrimental to one's personal nature, somewhat along the lines of the later French philosopher, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. However, unlike Rousseau, [[René Descartes]] and many other [[Age of enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era European philosophers following the classical example of [[Plato]], emotion and reason were not considered separate entities, but rather as coextensive; ''xin'' (心) itself is a concept that is as much cognitive as emotional.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad, "Taoism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/taoism/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivanhoe, P.J., &amp; Van Norden, B.W. (Eds.) (2001).

'''Yanantin''' is one of the best known and most defining characteristics of [[indigenous peoples in South America|indigenous South American]] [[Andean]] thought and exemplifies Andean adherence to a philosophical model based in what is often referred to as a "[[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of complementary terms"&lt;ref&gt;Ajaya, 1983, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; or, simply, a “complementary dualism".&lt;ref&gt;Barnard &amp; Spencer, 2002, p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; Much like in [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] [[Taoism]], Andean philosophy views the opposites of existence (such as male/female, dark/light, inner/outer) as interdependent and essential parts of a harmonious whole. Because existence itself is believed to be dependent upon the tension and balanced interchange between the polarities, there is a very definite ideological and practical commitment within indigenous Andean life to bringing the seemingly conflicting opposites into harmony with one another without destroying or altering either one. Among the indigenous people of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], the union of opposing yet interdependent energies is called ''yanantin'' or "complementary opposites."

== Etymology ==

In the [[Quechua languages|Quechua language]], the prefix ''yana-'' means ”help,” while its suffix ''-ntin'' means “inclusive in nature, with implications of totality, spatial inclusion of one thing in another, or identification of two elements as members of the same category".&lt;ref&gt;Platt, 1986, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Put together, ''yanantin'' has been translated as “the complement of difference.” However, according to some Andeans{{Who|date=March 2017}}:

:For us, ''yanantin'' doesn’t focus on the differences between two beings. That is what disconnects them. Instead, we focus on the qualities that brought them together. That is ''yanantin''. We don’t really see the differences. That’s why we see them as not necessarily opposed, but as complementary. One on its own can’t hold everything, can’t take care of everything. Not only are they great together, but they need to be together. There is no other way. When there is another, it represents extra strength for both.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 2012, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Urton, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; break down the word ''yanantin'' slightly differently, translating ''yana-'' as “black” in the sense of “dark” or “obscure,” and contrast it to “light” (rather than in the sense of “black” as opposed to “white”).

== Relevance to indigenous Andean life ==

Because the relationship of opposites as a harmonious partnership is considered the primary organizing principle of creation, ''yanantin'' infuses all aspects of social and spiritual life within the indigenous Andean worldview. Platt (1986) cited two examples of ''yanantin'' from his work with the Macha of Bolivia. When drinks are served, the Macha pour a few drops on the ground as an offering, while at the same time speaking the name of the receiving divinity. This is done twice. “This is explained as being ''yanantin'', for the conjugal pair”.&lt;ref name=p245&gt;Platt, 1986, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; When [[coca]] leaves (the most sacred plant of the Andes and an integral part of almost all indigenous ceremonies) are offered to a participant in a ritual, two handfuls are offered to each person, who receives them in two cupped hands. Platt (1986) wrote, “In all such cases, the pairing and the repetitions are explained as being ''yanantin''."&lt;ref name=p245/&gt; In ''Yanantin and Masinitin in the Andean World'', Hillary Webb notes that the relationship between entities or energies is the essential component within indigenous Andean worldview, involving, “the relationship, the alliance, the meeting, and the unity between two beings."&lt;ref&gt;Webb (2012), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yanantin'' contrasts with ''chhulla'', which refers to something that is unequal or odd—“one of things which should be twice."&lt;ref&gt;Platt, 1986, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vasquez (1998), the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] of [[Cajamarca]] say that something that is incomplete is referred to as ''chuya'' [alternate spelling], meaning “the one who is missing its other."&lt;ref&gt;Vasquez (1998), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Vasquez explained, ”In order to be whole, one has to pair up."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1989), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Whether something is paired or unpaired is an important distinction within the Andean cosmovision. Regina Harrison noted, “Quechua speakers persistently distinguish objects which are not well matched or ‘equal’.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1989), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; According to Platt, ''yanantin'' is the act of rendering equal two things that were once unequal—what he calls “the correction of inequalities."&lt;ref name=p251&gt;Platt (1986), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, some indigenous Andeans believe the following.

&lt;blockquote&gt;… [U]npartnered people are missing an important part of them. They say that when you don’t have a partner, you are only half of a being. Alone, you are precious, you are unique, but you are only part. You are not whole yet. This is because when you are by yourself, you are either accumulating so much that it is overwhelming or you are draining yourself so much that you become weak. Because of that, you will feel fear or confused or lost. … you may know yourself, but you can never see yourself. For that you need another person. You need other eyes, another perspective to see that. When you are a child, you have your parents, but when you become older you no longer have your parents to see you, to recognize you. As an adult, your ''yanantin'', your partner, is the person who is there to see what you don’t see in yourself, just as you are there to see in that person what he doesn’t see in himself. That is why it is easier to take care of another person than of yourself—because you are not supposed to take care of yourself! For that, there is the other person.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 2012, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

It has thus been implied that a perfect ''yanantin'' relationship is achieved when two energies are brought into harmony. Among the Macha, Platt explained, “The elements to be paired must first be ‘pared’ to achieve the ‘perfect fit.’ Here the crucial notion is that of the sharing of boundaries in order to create a harmonious co-existence."&lt;ref name=p251/&gt;

== Masintin ==
The Quechua word ''masintin'' is often used in tandem with ''yanantin'', as in ''yanantin-masintin''. This indicates the process by which the ''yanantin'' pair becomes “pared” in Platt’s terms, or harmonized to achieve a perfect fit. Webb’s research participants described ''masintin'' as, “the process, the experience of that ''yanantin'' relationship.”

:''Masintin'' is what is materialized. It is what is self realized, not what stays in theory. ''Masintin'' is to enter into the spirit and the essence of anything, of the thing. Of what has been materialized. Of what has been imagined. You must enter into the spirit of it. ''Masintin'' is to create, recreate, and procreate.&lt;ref&gt;Webb (2012), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
