'''''101 Reykjavík''''' ({{Audio|Is-101 reykjavík.oga|pronunciation}}) is 2000 film based on the 1996 novel by [[Hallgrímur Helgason]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallgrímur Helgason, ''101 Reykjavík'' (Reykjavík: Mál og menning, 1996).
{{ISBN|9979314761}}; 9979315768; 9789979314769&lt;/ref&gt; Both are set in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. The film was directed by Baltasar Kormákur and stars Victoria Abril and Hilmir Snær Guðnason. The title is taken from the [[Íslandspóstur]] [[List of postal codes in Iceland|postal code]] for the [[Miðborg]] district of central Reykjavík. The film won nine B-class film awards and received ten nominations most notably winning the Discovery Film Award at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].

==Plot==
Geek Hlynur is approaching 30 years old, still lives with his mother who is divorced from his alcoholic father, downloads porn and wanders around Reykjavík half-heartedly searching for a job while spending lots of time in Kaffibarinn, the central Reykjavík bar (the bar is owned in real life by writer/director Baltasar Kormákur and his soundtrack composer Damon Albarn, a long-standing Icelandophile). The cramped, dark and oddly furnished house in which Hlynur and his mother live features a bath which transfigures into a sofa as Hlynur steps naked out of it, in the middle of the lounge with his mother watching. 

Hlynur's isolated world — no small metaphor for his home country — is going along rather blissfully ignorant of the greater joys involved with engaging in life until his mother's friend Lola Milagros arrives to stay at the house for a while. Lola is a Spanish [[flamenco]] instructor with a seductive smile, a sultry voice and a ''[[carpe diem|carpe-diem]]'' attitude. Unknown to Hlynur, she is also [[bisexual]] and in a physical relationship with his mother, Berglind. An enigmatic character, Lola quickly becomes the center of the household dynamic when, after a night of heavy drinking while Berglind is away, she and Hlynur sleep together. The fling remains a secret between Hlynur and Lola. (Throughout the film, the song ''[[Lola (song)|Lola]]'' often plays as background music.) As Hlynur gradually learns of their [[lesbian]] relationship, he becomes jealous of it, realizing that he was simply a momentary fling for Lola, but he is also the dutiful son who wants to accept his mother's newfound lesbianism and be happy for her. He also has occasional seeming [[oedipal]] / [[incestuous]] dreams about his mother.

Lola wants Hlynur to get out of the house and find himself something to do because she recognizes from the start that that's what he needs most, but Hlynur prefers to pass the time in a true slacker fashion with plenty of excess and not an iota of effort. He sees no real future for himself, rather an entire life supported by the Icelandic welfare state. "It's a great system." he says. When asked what he does, Hlynur responds with, "Nothing." Pushed further with, "What kind of nothing?" he replies the only way he can: "A nothing kind of nothing." Not even death is a serious topic for Hlynur — intoxicating, out-all-night weekends inspire, "Each weekend I drop dead." He says this while lighting up a Lucky atop a snow-capped mountain, where he lies down as the snow gradually covers him up, but his plans are scuppered by rainfall melting his would-be tomb. His mixed up thoughts include musings about suicide: "The worst thing about AIDS as a method of suicide is that it takes so long to die from it."

On the other hand, Hlynur's fantasy life is alive with passion and glimpses of his subconscious show us a deeply conflicted sense of self. Flashbacks of an alcoholic father mix with sexual fantasies of the lovely Lola but quickly reveal that mom's in bed, too. During a quick trip to the suburbs for a dinner with extended family, Hlynur, so comically disturbed by the mundane family [[ritual]] (they actually gather to watch a video of last year's family dinner), imagines a [[bloodbath]] scene killing everyone at close range with a shotgun. When brought back to reality, Hlynur's blank slate and effortless personality come back into the fore: "I was thinking what a nice couch you have", he explains to the previously slaughtered family.

Hlynur's confusion over the whole situation is expressed in his rather profound and imaginative musings: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''There they are...my mother the lesbian, and my father the boozer. What am I then? The offspring of a lesbian and a boozer? It's like two birds of different species. The lesbian bird and the boozer bird. The boozer is a wetland bird. He's rather heavy...and needs a good run-up to get off the ground. He can fly for a long time and has good stamina. Several weeks may pass by before he gets back on the ground. In between he lies low and goes on the defensive. Especially for the first days after landing. The lesbian. Unlike the boozer...the lesbian is a relative newcomer to Icelandic nature. She is thought to have migrated from Denmark and Britain. Her only contact with the male bird is during conception. In recent years we have witnessed cases of male birds...who are unable to fly at all. The offspring of a boozer and a lesbian is the Hlynur...an unusually slow developer that can't fly... and remains with his mother for the first 30 years. The Hlynur is defensive by nature, but harmless.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film progresses as Hlynur comes to terms with his mother's love for Lola and his own feelings of inadequacy with her. The announcement that Lola is [[pregnant]] pushes him to the brink, making living under the same roof next to impossible for all three; but after a lot of acting out and flippant commentary, Hlynur begins to see life little differently. Hylnur also begins engaging in more activities outside his home and eventually finds himself a fitting job as well as the affections of a woman his age who has broken up with her unfaithful boyfriend. The infant's arrival also symbolically coincides neatly with Hlynur's homecoming to the world outside his bedroom and a newfound contentedness. The strong possibility that he is the father of Lola's child has been a secret between Lola and Hlynur, and this is more than hinted at in the closing scenes of the happy household composed of mother, son, Lola, and Lola's baby who calls him Papa.

'''''Alcibiades the Schoolboy''''' (''L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola''), an Italian [[dialogue]] published anonymously in 1652, is a defense of homosexual [[sodomy]] ([[anal sex]]) loosely styled after [[Plato]]nic [[dialogue]]. Set in ancient [[Athens]], the teacher is modelled on [[Socrates]], who so desperately wants to consummate the relationship he has with [[Alcibiades]], one of his students, that he uses all tactics of [[rhetoric]] and [[sophistry]] at his disposal. He argues that [[Nature]] gave us [[sexual organs]] for our own pleasure, and that it would insult her to use them otherwise, citing examples from [[Greek mythology]] and culture, as well as refuting counterarguments based on the [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] story. It is "a tour de force of pederastic fantasy and one of the frankest and most explicit texts on the subject to have been written before the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abebooks.com/Alcibiades-Schoolboy-ROOCO-Antonio-Entimos-Press/9994036425/bd&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called "the first homosexual novel".&lt;ref&gt;William A. Percy, "Alcibiades the Schoolboy. Afterword", http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Alcibiades_the_Schoolboy, retrieved 2014-09-02&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the identity of the author was a mystery. The work was first attributed to [[Pietro Aretino]], but an article in 1888 by Achille Neri identified the author as [[Antonio Rocco]], a [[libertine]] priest and philosopher and member of the [[Accademia degli Incogniti]] founded by [[Giovan Battista Loredan]].

The text is unashamedly explicit, and it has been argued that "it must be understood in the context of similar texts of the trend of [[libertinism]], using the term in its original sense of a sceptical philosophical tendency."

{{History of Greece}}
'''Archaic Greece''' was the period in [[History of Greece|Greek history]] lasting from the eighth century BC to the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|pp=1&amp;ndash;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[Greek Dark Ages]] and succeeded by the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]]. The period began with a massive increase in the Greek population&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1980|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of significant changes which rendered the Greek world at the end of the eighth century as entirely unrecognisable as compared to its beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Anthony Snodgrass, the Archaic period in ancient Greece was bounded by two revolutions in the Greek world.  It began with a "structural revolution" which "drew the political map of the Greek world" and established the ''[[Polis|poleis]]'', the distinctively Greek city-states, and ended with the intellectual revolution of the Classical period.&lt;ref name="Snodgrass 1980 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1980|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archaic period saw developments in Greek politics, economics, international relations, warfare, and culture.  It laid the groundwork for the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], both politically and culturally.  It was in the Archaic period that the [[Greek alphabet]] developed, that the earliest surviving Greek literature was composed, that monumental sculpture and red-figure pottery began in Greece, and that the [[hoplite]] became the core of Greek armies.  In [[Athens]], the earliest institutions of the democracy were implemented under [[Solon]], and the reforms of [[Cleisthenes]] at the end of the Archaic period brought in Athenian democracy as it was during the Classical period.  In [[Sparta]], many of the institutions credited to the reforms of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]] were introduced during the period, the region of [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenia]] was brought under Spartan control, [[helot]]age was introduced, and the [[Peloponnesian League]] was founded, making Sparta a dominant power in Greece.

==Historiography==
[[File:Gymnasion and Palaestra in Olympia 2010 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of ancient ruins.|The [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and [[palaestra]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the site of the ancient Olympic games.  The Archaic period conventionally dates from the first Olympiad.]]
The word "archaic" derives from the Greek word ''archaios'', which means "old". It refers to the period in ancient Greek history before the Classical. The period is generally considered to have lasted from the beginning of the eighth century BC until the beginning of the fifth century BC,&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the foundation of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in 776 BC and the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC forming notional start and end dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2009|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archaic period was long considered to have been less important and historically interesting than the Classical period, and was primarily studied as a precursor to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1980|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, Archaic Greece has come to be studied for its own achievements.&lt;ref name="Snodgrass 1980 13"/&gt; With this reassessment of the significance of the Archaic period, some scholars have objected to the term "archaic", due to its connotations in English of being primitive and outdated. No term which has been suggested to replace it has gained widespread currency, however, and the term is still in use.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 1"/&gt;

Much of our evidence about the Classical period of ancient Greece comes from written histories, such as Thucydides' [[History of the Peloponnesian War]].  By contrast, we have no such evidence from the Archaic period.  We have written accounts of life in the period in the form of poetry, and epigraphical evidence, including parts of law codes, inscriptions on votive offerings, and epigrams inscribed on tombs.  However, none of this evidence is in the quantity for which we have it in the Classical period.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What is lacking in written evidence, however, is made up for in the rich archaeological evidence from the Archaic Greek world.  Indeed, where much of our knowledge of Classical Greek art comes from later Roman copies, all of the surviving Archaic Greek art is original.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 6"&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources for the period are the traditions recorded by later Greek writers such as [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 5"/&gt;  However, these traditions are not part of any form of history as we would recognise it today; those transmitted by Herodotus he recorded whether or not he believed them to be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Herodotus does not even record any dates before 480 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political developments==

Politically, the Archaic period saw the development of the [[polis]] (or city-state) as the predominant unit of political organisation. Many cities throughout Greece came under the rule of autocratic leaders, called "tyrants". The period also saw the development of law and systems of communal decision-making, with the earliest evidence for law codes and constitutional structures dating to the period. By the end of the Archaic period, both the Athenian and Spartan constitutions seem to have developed into their classical forms.

The Archaic period saw significant urbanisation, and the development of the concept of the ''polis'' as it was used in Classical Greece.  By Solon's time, if not before, the word "polis" had acquired its classical meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2007|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the emergence of the polis as a political community was still in progress at this point,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2007|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; the polis as an urban centre was a product of the eighth century.&lt;ref name=Hall-43&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2007|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the polis did not become the dominant form of socio-political organisation throughout Greece in the Archaic period, and in the north and west of the country it did not become dominant until some way into the Classical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2007|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The urbanisation process in Archaic Greece known as "[[synoecism]]" &amp;ndash; the amalgamation of several small settlements into a single urban centre &amp;ndash; took place in much of Greece in the eighth century BC.  Both Athens and [[Argos]], for instance, began to coalesce into single settlements around the end of that century.&lt;ref name=Hall-43/&gt;  In some settlements, this physical unification was marked by the construction of defensive city walls, as was the case in [[Smyrna]] by the middle of the eighth century BC, and [[Corinth]] by the middle of the seventh century BC.&lt;ref name=Hall-43/&gt;

It seems that the evolution of the polis as a socio-political structure, rather than a simply geographical one, can be attributed to this urbanisation, as well as a significant population increase in the eighth century.  These two factors created a need for a new form of political organisation, as the political systems in place at the beginning of the Archaic period quickly became unworkable.&lt;ref name=Hall-43/&gt;

====Athens====
{{see also|History of Athens}}
Though in the early part of the Classical period [[Athens|the city of Athens]] was both culturally and politically dominant,&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 6"/&gt; it was not until the late sixth century BC that it became a leading power in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempted coup by [[Cylon of Athens]] may be the earliest event in Athenian history which is clearly attested by ancient sources, dating to around 636.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|pp=368&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, it seems that Athens' monarchy had already been ended and the [[eponymous archon|archonship]] had replaced it as the most important executive office in the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|pp=364&amp;ndash;5}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the archonship could only be held by members of the [[Eupatridae]], the families which made up Athens' aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest laws of Athens were established by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]], in 621/0;&lt;ref name="Cantarella 2005 239"&gt;{{harvnb|Cantarella|2005|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; his law on homicide was the only one to have survived to the Classical period.  Draco's law code aimed to replace private revenge as the first and only response of an individual to an offence committed against them.&lt;ref name="Cantarella 2005 239"/&gt;  The law code of Draco, however, failed to prevent the tensions between the rich and poor which were the impetus to Solon's reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 594/3 BC, [[Solon]] was appointed "[[archon]] and mediator".&lt;ref name=Andrewes-377&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exactly what his reforms consisted of is uncertain.  He claimed to have taken up the ''horoi'' to set the land free, but the exact meaning of ''horoi'' is unknown;&lt;ref name=Andrewes-377/&gt; their removal seems, however, to have been part of the problem of ''hektemoroi'' &amp;ndash; another word whose meaning is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Solon was also credited with abolishing slavery for debtors,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishing limits on who could be granted Athenian citizenship.&lt;ref name=Andrewes-384&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solon instituted radical constitutional reform, replacing noble birth as a qualification for office with income.&lt;ref name=Andrewes-384/&gt;  The poorest &amp;ndash; called [[thetes]] &amp;ndash; could hold no offices, although they could attend the Assembly and the law courts, while the richest class &amp;ndash; the [[pentacosiomedimni]] &amp;ndash; were the only people eligible to become treasurer, and possibly archon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He set up the Council of the Four Hundred,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for discussing motions which were to come before the [[ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, Solon substantially reduced the powers of the archon by giving citizens the right of appeal; their case was judged by the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|pp=388&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sparta====

{{see also|History of Sparta}}
Sparta's constitution took on the form it would have in the Classical period during the eighth century BC.&lt;ref name="Hammond 1982 329"&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1982|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thucydides]], the Spartan constitution was roughly four-hundred years old, which would place the semi-legendary lawgiver [[Lycurgus of Sparta]] as being active during the late 9th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, A. R. (1982). ''The Pelican History of Greece''. London: Penguin. pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Greece to the death of Alexander the Great|last=Bury|first=J.

===Colonization===

{{see also|Greek colonies}}
[[File:Agrigente 2008 IMG 1935.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the [[Temple of Heracles, Agrigento]], Sicily, within the [[Valle dei Templi]], built in the late 6th century BC during the late Archaic period]]

In the eighth and seventh centuries BC, Greeks began to spread across the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name=BoardmanHammond-xiii&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements.  These [[Greek colonies]] were not, as Roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right.&lt;ref name=BoardmanHammond-xiii/&gt;

Greeks settled outside of Greece in two distinct ways.  The first was in permanent settlements founded by Greeks, which formed as independent poleis.  The second form was in what historians refer to as ''emporia''; trading posts which were occupied by both Greeks and non-Greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods.  Examples of this latter type of settlement are found at [[Al Mina]] in the east and [[Pithekoussai]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Greek colonies were on [[Sicily]].  Many of these were founded by people from [[Chalcis]], but other Greek states, such as [[Corinth]] and [[Megara]] were also responsible for early colonies in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the eighth century BC, Greek settlements in southern Italy were also well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|pp=206&amp;ndash;207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventh century, Greek colonists expanded the areas that they settled.  In the west, colonies were founded as far afield as [[Marseille]]s. In the east, the north Aegean, the Sea of Marmara, and the Black Sea all saw colonies founded.&lt;ref name=Antonaccio-207&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant coloniser in these parts was [[Miletus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, early colonies such as Syracuse and Megara Hyblaia began to themselves establish colonies.&lt;ref name=Antonaccio-207/&gt;

In the west, Sicily and southern Italy were some of the largest recipients of Greek colonisers.  Indeed, so many Greek settlements were founded in southern Italy that it was known in antiquity as [[Magna Graecia]] &amp;ndash; "Great Greece".  It has been observed that in the last quarter of the eighth century, new Greek settlements were founded in Sicily and southern Italy at an average rate of one every other year, and Greek colonists continued to found cities in Italy until the mid-fifth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyranny===
{{main|Tyrant#Archaic_tyrants}}
[[File:Testa di uomo barbato da una statua funebre o votiva, da atene o egina, 530-540 ac ca.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Sabouroff head]], an important example of Late Archaic Greek marble sculpture, and a precussor of true [[portrait|portraiture]], ca. 550-525 BCE.&lt;ref name="TAM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=CAHN |first1=HERBERT A. |last2=GERIN |first2=DOMINIQUE |title=Themistocles at Magnesia |date=1988 |pages=20 &amp; Plate 3 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42668124}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Archaic Greece from the mid-seventh century BC has sometimes been called an "Age of Tyrants".  The word ''τύραννος'' (''tyrannos'', whence the English "tyrant") first appeared in Greek literature in a poem of [[Archilochus]], to describe the Lydian ruler [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1998|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest Greek tyrant was [[Cypselus]], who seized power in Corinthe in a coup in 655 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was followed by a series of others in the mid-seventh century BC, such as [[Orthagoras of Sicyon|Orthagoras]] in [[Sicyon]] and [[Theagenes of Megara|Theagenes]] in Megara.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various explanations have been provided for the rise of tyranny in the seventh century BC.  The most popular of these explanations dates back to [[Aristotle]], who argued that tyrants were set up by the people in response to the nobility becoming less tolerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As there is no evidence from the time that the nobility were becoming increasingly arrogant during the period, modern explanations of seventh century tyranny have tried to find other reasons for unrest among the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Against this position, Drews argues that tyrannies were set up by individuals who controlled private armies, and that early tyrants did not need the support of the people at all,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Hammond suggests that tyrannies were established as a consequence of in-fighting between rival oligarchs, rather than between the oligarchs and the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1982|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recently historians have begun to question the existence of a seventh century "age of tyrants".  In the Archaic period, the Greek word ''tyrannos'', according to Victor Parker, did not have the negative connotations it had gained by the time Aristotle wrote his ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]''.  When Archilochus used the word tyrant, it was synonymous with ''[[anax]]'' (an Archaic Greek word meaning "king").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1998|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker dates the first use of the word ''tyrannos'' in a negative context to the first half of the sixth century, at least fifty years after [[Cypselus]] took power in Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1998|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the time of [[Thucydides]] that ''tyrannos'' and ''basileus'' ("king") were consistently distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1998|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Greg Anderson has argued that Archaic Greek tyrants were not considered illegitimate rulers,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|pp=173&amp;ndash;174}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be distinguished from any other rulers of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
[[File:Olympia_-_Temple_of_Hera_3.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Hera, Olympia|Temple of Hera]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] was built in the Archaic period, circa  590 BC]]
Greek population doubled during the eighth century, resulting in more and larger settlements than previously. This was part of a wider phenomenon of population growth across the Mediterranean region at this time, which may have been caused by a climatic shift that took place between 850 and 750, which made the region cooler and wetter. This led to the expansion of population into uncultivated areas of Greece and was probably also a driver for colonisation abroad.&lt;ref name="Morris 2009 66–67"&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from human remains shows that average age at death increased over the Archaic period, but there is no clear trend for other measures of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of houses gives some evidence for prosperity within society; in the eighth and seventh centuries, the average house size remained constant around 45–50 m², but the number of very large and very small houses increased, indicating increasing economic inequality. From the end of the seventh century, this trend reversed, with houses clustering closely around a growing average.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all arable land in Greece was yet under cultivation in the Archaic period. Farms appear to have been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements. They were highly diversified, growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was not too much of a disaster. [[Crop rotation]] was practiced, alternating between [[legumes]] and [[cereals]] ([[barley]] and [[durum]]), and the land was left fallow every other year. Alongside these, farmers cultivated vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables as [[cash crop]]s for sale in local centres and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|pp=26–28}}; {{harvnb|van Wees|2009|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock were of secondary importance. Sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wees|2009|pp=450–451}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of oxen could increase agricultural output significantly, but were expensive to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses and large herds of cattle were the preserve of the mega-rich.

This pattern had probably developed before the beginning of the period and remained relatively consistent throughout it. The idea that it was preceded by a period of [[pastoralism]] and that agriculture only became dominant in the course of the Archaic period is not supported by the archaeological or literary evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=27}}; {{harvnb|van Wees|2009|pp=450–451}}&lt;/ref&gt; No technological innovations in agriculture appear to have occurred, except possibly the increased use of iron tools and more intensive use of [[manure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source for the practice of agriculture in the period is [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'', which gives the impression of very small subsistence holdings in which the owner performed most of the labour personally; close reading reveals that much of the produce is to be sold for profit, much of the work to be performed by slaves (''douloi'' or ''dmoes''), and much of the owner's time to be spent away from the farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wees|2009|pp=445–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves' labour was supplemented by labourers who worked for a wage, as [[sharecropping|sharecroppers]] (called ''[[hektemoroi]]'' at Athens), or to pay off debts; this practice seems to have increased in the eighth century as the growth of the population increased the number of workers available, and intensified in the seventh century with the development of legally enforced debts and the status of the labourers increasingly becoming a source of social strife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wees|2009|pp=451–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris 2009 66–67"/&gt;

===Trade===
By the late eighth century BC, the Archaic Greek world had become involved in an active trade network around the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was this trade network which was the source of the [[Orientalizing period|orientalizing influence on Greek art]] in the early part of the Archaic period.  Meanwhile, to the west, trade between Corinth and [[Magna Graecia]] in Southern Italy and Sicily was booming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern trade mainly involved the Greek islands, with [[Aegina]], for instance, acting as an intermediary between the east and the Greek mainland.&lt;ref name=Markoe-55&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  East Greek states would go on to become extremely prosperous through the sixth century due to the trade with Asia and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the mainland cities, those on the coast were the biggest recipients of trade from the east, especially Corinth.&lt;ref name=Markoe-55/&gt;

In the early part of the Archaic period, Athens does not seem to have been particularly actively involved in this eastern trade, and very few examples of eastern imports have been found in Athens from the eighth or early seventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|pp=55&amp;ndash;57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, nearby [[Euboea]] had trade-links with the east as early as the first half of the eighth century,&lt;ref name="Jeffery 1982 823"&gt;{{harvnb|Jeffery|1982|p=823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest pottery from the Greek islands found at [[Al Mina]] in modern Syria is from Euboea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jeffery|1982|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the sixth century, Greece was part of a trade network spanning the entire Mediterranean.  Sixth century Laconian pottery has been found as far afield as Marseilles and Carthage to the west, Crete to the south and Sardis to the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1979|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;Greece is too dry and warm for bread wheat, already in the Archaic period this was imported from the Black Sea. {{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=27}}; olive oil and wine particularly good trade&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Coinage===
{{main|Ancient Greek coinage#Archaic period}}
[[File:Aegina Stater achaic.jpg|thumb|left|Silver [[stater]] of [[Aegina]], 550–530 BC.]]
At the beginning of the Archaic period, coinage had not yet been invented. The Greeks measured the value of objects or fines using certain valuable objects, such as oxen, tripods, and metal spits, as [[unit of account|units of account]]. As in the Near East, precious metal [[bullion]] was used as a [[medium of exchange]], principally [[gold]] at first, but mainly [[silver]] by the beginning of the sixth century. The weight of this bullion (often known as [[hacksilber]]) was measured using standard units, named for their value in terms of metal spits (''obeloi'') and handfuls (''drachmai'') of metal spits; these terms would later be used as names for Greek coin denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kroll|2012|pp=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ATTICA, Athens. Circa 545-525-15 BC.jpg|thumb|The earliest coinage of [[Athens]], circa 545–525/15 BC]]
Coinage was invented in [[Lydia]] around 650 BC. It was quickly adopted by Greek communities in western Asia Minor, although the older system of bullion remained in use as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Konuk|2012|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island of [[Aegina]] began to issue its distinctive "turtle" coins before 550 BC, and from there coinage spread to Athens, Corinth and the [[Cycladic Islands]] in the 540s BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheedy|2012|pp=106, 110}}; {{harvnb|Van Alfen|2012|p=89}}; {{harvnb|Psoma|2012|p=166ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Italy and Sicily before 525 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutter|2012|p=128ff.}}; {{harvnb|Fischer-Bossert|2012|p=143ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thrace before 514 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Psoma|2012|p=157ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these coinages were very small and were mostly only used within the community that issued them, but the "turtles" of Aegina (from 530 or 520 BC) and the "owls" of Athens (from 515 BC) were issued in great quantity and exported throughout the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheedy|2012|p=107}}; {{harvnb|Van Alfen|2012|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The images on coins initially changed rapidly, but increasingly each community settled on a single image or set of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Konuk|2012|pp=43–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were the symbol or image of an important deity in the city or visual puns on the city's name,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the city of [[Phocaea]] issued coins depicting a seal (''phoke'', in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; but in many cases their meaning is obscure and may not have been chosen for any special reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spier|1990|pp=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Athens coin discovered in Pushkalavati.jpg|thumb|A late Achaic coin of [[Athens]] (circa 500/490–485 BC) discovered in [[Pushkalavati]] in [[Ancient India]]. This coin is the earliest known example of its type to be found so far east.&lt;ref name="CNG 199773"&gt;[https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=199773 "A Truly International Currency", Triton XV, Lot: 1163, ATTICA, Athens], CNG Coins&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The reasons for the rapid and widespread adoption of coinage by the Greeks are not entirely clear and several possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, have been suggested. One possibility is the increased ease of commerce which coinage allowed. Coins were of standardised weights, which meant that their value could be determined without weighing them. Furthermore, it was not necessary for users of coinage to spend time determining whether the silver was pure silver; the fact that the coin had been issued by the community was a promise that it was worth a set value.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kroll|2012|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that coinage was adopted specifically to enable communities to make payments to their citizens, mercenaries and artisans in a transparent, fair and efficient way. Similarly, when wealthy members of the community were required [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|to contribute wealth]] to the community for festivals and the equipment of navies, coinage made the process more efficient and transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1996|pp=267–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third possibility, that coinage was adopted as an expression of a community's independence and identity, seems to be anachronistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1996|p=261}}; in more detail: {{harvnb|Martin|1986|ch=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

In the visual arts, the Archaic period is characterised by a shift towards representational and naturalistic styles.  It was the period in which monumental sculpture was introduced to Greece, and in which [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Development of vase painting|Greek pottery styles went through great changes]], from the repeating patterns of the late [[Geometric art|geometric period]] to the earliest [[Red-figure pottery|red figure vases]].  The early part of the Archaic period saw [[Orientalizing period|distinctive orientalizing influences]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in pottery and in sculpture.  The period was also an innovative period in Greek literature, with the development of the Greek alphabet, and the composition of the earliest surviving Greek poetry.

Life-size human sculpture in hard stone began in Greece in the Archaic period.&lt;ref name=Boardman-450&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was inspired in part by ancient Egyptian stone sculpture:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; the proportions of the [[New York Kouros]] exactly correspond to Egyptian rules about the proportion of human figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Greece, these sculptures best survive as religious dedications and grave markers, but the same techniques would have also been used to make cult images.&lt;ref name=Boardman-450/&gt;

The best-known types of Archaic sculpture are the [[kouros]] and [[kore (sculpture)|kore]], near life-size frontal statues of a young man or woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|pp=269–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were developed around the middle of the seventh century BC in the [[Cyclades]].&lt;ref name=Hurwit-274&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Probably the earliest kore produced was the [[Dedication of Nikandre]], which was dedicated to [[Artemis]] at her temple on [[Delos]] between 660 and 650 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; while kouroi began to be created shortly after this.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|pp=271–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some kouroi, such as the [[Colossus of the Naxians]] from around 600 BC, are known to represent Apollo,&lt;ref name=Hurwit-274/&gt; while the [[Phrasikleia Kore]] was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the seventh century around 650 BC when kore are widely introduced, Daedalic style made an appearance in Greek sculpture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashmole|first=Bernard|date=December 1936|title=Review: Daedalic Art|url=https://www.jstor.org.proxy.wm.edu/stable/705500|journal=The Classical Review|volume=50|pages=|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00078057}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style consisted most noticeably of a geometric pattern of female subjects' hair framing their face. On male sculptures they were often posed with one foot in front, as if in motion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Over the course of the sixth century, kouroi from Attica become more lifelike and naturalistic.  However, this trend does not appear elsewhere in the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The genre began to become less common over the last part of the sixth century as the elites who commissioned kouroi declined in influence, and by around 480 kouroi were no longer made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The period saw a shift in the decoration of Greek pottery from abstract to figurative styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Greek Dark Ages]], following the fall of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]], Greek pottery decoration had been based around increasingly elaborate geometrical patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human figures first appeared on Greek pots in Crete in the early part of the ninth century BC, but did not become common on mainland Greek pottery until the middle of the eighth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eighth century saw the development of the [[Orientalizing Period|orientalizing style]], which signalled a shift away from the earlier [[geometric style]] and the accumulation of influences derived from [[Phoenicia]] and [[Syria]].  This orientalizing influence seems to have come from goods imported to Greece from the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the seventh century BC, vase painters in [[Corinth]] began to develop the [[black-figure pottery|black figure style]].  At the same time, potters began to use incisions in the clay of vases in order to draw outlines and interior detailing.&lt;ref name="Markoe-53"&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This adoption of incision, probably taken from eastern metalwork, allowed potters to show fine details of their decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Archaic period drew to a close, [[red-figure pottery]] was invented in Athens, with the first examples being produced about 525 BC, probably by the [[Andokides painter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|pp=278&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the red-figure technique in Athens came at around the same time as the development of other techniques such as the [[white ground technique]] and [[Six's technique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

{{main|Ancient Greek literature}}
The earliest extant Greek literature comes from the Archaic period.  Poetry was the predominant form of literature in the period.&lt;ref name=Power16-58&gt;{{harvnb|Power|2016|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside the dominant [[Greek lyric|lyric]] and [[epic poetry|epic]] traditions, [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]] began to develop in the archaic period, borrowing elements from the pre-existing genres of archaic Greek poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Power|2016|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the sixth century BC the first written prose in Greek literature appeared.&lt;ref name=Power16-58/&gt;

Though there would certainly have been a pre-existing literary tradition in Greece, the earliest surviving works are by [[Homer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Homer's poetry, though it dates to around the time that the Greeks developed writing, would have been composed orally – the earliest surviving poetry to have certainly been composed in writing is that of [[Archilochus]], from the mid-seventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast with the Classical period, in which the literary culture of Athens dominated the Greek world, Archaic poetic tradition was geographically spread out.  [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], for instance, were from Lesbos, while [[Pindar]] came from Thebes, and [[Alcman]] from Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kurke|2007|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
{{main|History of the Greek alphabet}}
After the end of the [[Mycenaean period]], the art of writing was lost in Greece: by the ninth century probably no Greeks understood the Bronze Age [[Linear B]] writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1980|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the ninth century BC, however, objects inscribed with [[Phoenicia]]n writing began to be brought into the Greek world, and it was from this [[Phoenician script]] that the [[Greek alphabet]] developed in the eighth century BC.  By the middle of the eighth century BC, pottery inscribed in Greek begins to occur in the archaeological record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known inscriptions in Greek tend to identify or explain the object on which they are inscribed.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 1982 831"&gt;{{harvnb|Jeffery|1982|p=831}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Possibly the earliest known Greek inscription is found on a jug from the first half of the eighth century BC, discovered in Osteria dell'Osa in Latium.&lt;ref name=Osborne09-104&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most early inscriptions were written in verse, though some from Ionia were in prose, influenced by the prose traditions of Ionia's eastern neighbours.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 1982 831"/&gt;  From the beginning of the seventh century, curses and dedications began to be inscribed on objects,&lt;ref name=Osborne09-104/&gt; and by the sixth century, surviving inscriptions include public records such as law codes, lists of officials, and records of treaties.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 1982 831"/&gt;

}}
In the Archaic period, the most significant military development was the adoption of [[hoplite]] warfare by the Greek states.  This occurred in the early part of the seventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2007|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[panoply]], or hoplite's armour, began to appear in the eighth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2007|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest known example comes from Argos in the late eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2007|loc=figure 5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the pieces which made up the panoply were all in use in Greece by the end of the eighth century, our first evidence for it being worn as a complete set of armour does not come until around 675 BC, where it is depicted on a Corinthian vase painting.&lt;ref name="Snodgrass 1965 110"&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1965|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adoption of the phalanx tactics which would be used by hoplites in the Classical period does not appear to have taken place until the mid-seventh century;&lt;ref name="Snodgrass 1965 110"/&gt; before this point, the older style of combat in which spears were thrown at the enemy before closing quarters was still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1965|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the naval sphere, the Archaic period saw the development of the [[trireme]] in Greece.  In the eighth century, Greek navies began to use ships with two banks of oars, and the three banked trireme seems to have become popular in the seventh century.&lt;ref name=Hunt-124&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2007|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corinth was probably the first place in the Greek world to adopt the trireme in the mid seventh century BC.&lt;ref name=Hunt-124/&gt;  It was not until the mid-sixth century, however, that the trireme became the most popular design for Greek battleships, due to its expense.&lt;ref name=Hunt-124/&gt;  According to Thucydides, the period saw the first Greek naval battles; he dates the first to around 664 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1965|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''AustLit: The Australian Literature Resource''''' is an internet-based collaboration between researchers and librarians from Australian universities designed to comprehensively record the history of Australian literary and story making cultures. ''AustLit'' is an encyclopaedia of Australian writers and writing.

== History ==
''AustLit'' was founded in 2000 as a resource and research infrastructure for literary studies. It has been funded by participating universities and the [[Australian Research Council]]. [[The University of Queensland]] leads the consortium. Partner universities include the [[University of New South Wales]], the [[University of Sydney]], [[Flinders University]], the [[University of Wollongong]], [[James Cook University]], and the [[University of Western Australia]]. Significant levels of research and teaching in the field are undertaken at all partner universities. 

== AustLit and research ==
''AustLit'' publishes biographical entries and brief essays on Australian writers, critics and storytellers, organisational histories relating to publishers, theatre companies and other arts organisations, and complete bibliographical histories of works of fiction and criticism. It also has an active digitisation program to generate full text versions of out-of-print literary works and critical articles about Australian literature. 

''AustLit Research Communities'' support detailed explorations of particular aspects of Australia's literary culture. Researchers can work within ''AustLit'' to create datasets around a specific field. These projects range across book, magazine and publishing histories, subject specific surveys of regionally based publishing and thematically based subsets. Research into the history of Australian popular and pulp fiction is supported alongside research into theatre history, drama and multicultural writers.&lt;ref&gt;Jacklin, Michael. "Multicultural Literature in Australian and the AustLit Database". ''InCite'' Vol. 30., No. 4., April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''BlackWords'' is a landmark ''AustLit'' research project that details the lives and work of [[Indigenous Australian literature|Indigenous Australian authors]], which includes [[Australian Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] writers and storytellers. 

''AustLit'' has become a key information resource for the study of Australian literature and related fields. Because of its status as the most comprehensive record of a nation's publishing history, ''AustLit'' has become an important source of data for analysing Australian literary history.&lt;ref&gt;Bode, Katherine.

'''Ciné-Asie Creatives''' was established in 2008 as a sister company of [[Ciné-Asie]]. The company is dedicated to sales and [[Film distributor|distribution]] of Asian films in Canada and Canadian films in Asia, as well as [[international co-production]] and [[location scouting]] in [[Quebec]], Canada.

The first feature film in distribution by Cine-Asie Creatives was the Korean blockbuster disaster film, [[Tidal Wave (2009 film)|Haeundae]]. Currently Ciné-Asie Creatives is in possession of the Canadian distribution rights to two Korean Films: [[My Dear Enemy]] (2008) by [[Lee Yoon-ki]] and [[Breathless (2009 film)|Breathless]] (2009) by [[Yang Ik-june]]. Ciné-Asie Creatives is also working on a feature film co-production project: Midnight to Four AM.  In addition, Ciné-Asie Creatives acts as a sales agent for three films by the Inuit-Canadian director [[Zacharias Kunuk]]. Ciné-Asie Creatives has also established a cooperation with [[Hancinema|HanCinema]], the largest and most comprehensive digital English database on the Korean TV and movie industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hancinema.net/cine-asie-creatives-acquires-award-winning-film-breathless--joins-forces-with-hancinema-20353.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sales and Distribution ==
In June 2009, Ciné-Asie Creatives acquired the Canadian distribution rights to [[My Dear Enemy]], a feature film from the Korean director [[Lee Yoon-ki]] ([[Love Talk]], [[This Charming Girl]]). Ciné-Asie Creatives has also acquired the Canadian rights to its second distribution title, [[Breathless (2009 film)|Breathless]], by first-time director [[Yang Ik-june]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/other-festivals/festival-news/breathless-continues-winning-streak-with-jury-prize-at-fantasia/5004183.article&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2009, Ciné-Asie Creatives is a representative of three films by the internationally acclaimed Inuit-Canadian director, Zacharias Kunuk, for distribution in Asian territories: ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]'', ''[[Before Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[The Journals of Knud Rasmussen]]''.

In October 2009, Ciné-Asie Creatives co-release Korean blockbuster [[Tidal Wave (2009 film)|Haeundae]] in cooperation with [[CJ Entertainment]] America in Canadian theatres in [[Montreal]] and [[Toronto]].

== Co-Production ==
Ciné-Asie Creatives's first co-production project is an omnibus feature film, composed of six short films each shot by six different directors from Asia or of Asian origin. Countries currently participating include Canada, Korea, and Japan. The omnibus project has also been selected for the Pusan Promotion Plan at the [[Pusan International Film Festival]] 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cinando.com/DefaultController.aspx?PageID=FicheFilm&amp;IdC=12416&amp;IdF=80272&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[visual arts]] a '''cityscape''' (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or [[urban area]]. It is the urban equivalent of a [[landscape]]. ''Townscape'' is roughly synonymous with ''cityscape,'' though it implies the same difference in urban size and density (and even modernity) implicit in the difference between the words ''city'' and ''town''.  In [[urban design]] the terms refer to the configuration of built forms and interstitial space.  

==History of cityscapes in art==
From the first century A.D. dates a [[fresco]] at the [[Baths of Trajan]] in [[Rome]] depicting a bird's eye view of an ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio la Rocca: "The Newly Discovered City Fresco from Trajan's Baths, Rome." ''Imago Mundi''  Vol. 53 (2001), pp. 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Middle Ages, cityscapes appeared as a background for [[portrait]]s and [[Bible|biblical]] themes. From the 16th up to the 18th century numerous [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] prints and [[etching]]s were made showing cities in [[aerial landscape art|bird's eye view]]. The function of these prints was to provide a map-like overview.

Halfway the 17th century the cityscape became an independent genre in the [[Netherlands]]. In his famous [[View of Delft (Vermeer)|'View of Delft']] in 1660-1661 [[Jan Vermeer]] painted a quite accurate portrait of the city [[Delft]]. Cities like [[Amsterdam]], [[Haarlem]] and [[The Hague]] also became popular subjects for paintings. Painters from other European countries (i.e. [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]]) followed the Dutch example. The 18th century was a flourishing period for cityscape painting in [[Venice]] ([[Canaletto]], [[Francesco Guardi|Guardi]]).

At the end of the 19th century the [[impressionists]] focused on the atmosphere and dynamics of [[everyday life]] in the city. Suburban and industrial areas, building sites and [[Rail yard|railway yards]] also became subjects for cityscapes. During the 20th century attention became focused on [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[conceptual art]], and thus the production of cityscapes declined. American painter [[Edward Hopper]], who stayed loyal to figurative painting, created intriguing images of the American scene. With a revival of figurative art at the end of the 20th century comes a revaluation of the cityscape. Well-known living cityscape painters are [[Rackstraw Downes]], [[Antonio López García]], and [[Richard Estes]]. American artist [[Yvonne Jacquette]] has made a specialty of [[aerial landscape art|aerial]] cityscapes. [[Stephen Wiltshire]], a London born artist with autism, is known for his [[panoramic]] cityscape renderings composed from memory, usually after taking a short overhead view of the city he is about to draw.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1223790/Autistic-artist-draws-18ft-picture-New-York-skyline-memory.html|title=Autistic artist Stephen Wiltshire draws spellbinding 18ft picture of New York from memory... after a 20-minute helicopter ride over city|publisher=Daily Mail Reporter

'''''Clinic Exclusive''''' (UK theatrical title: ''Clinic Xclusive''; [[working title]] ''With These Hands''; re-released as ''Sex Clinic'')&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt; is a 1971 British [[erotic film]] directed by [[Don Chaffey]] and starring Georgina Ward, Alexander Davion, [[Carmen Silvera]] and [[Windsor Davies]].

==Plot==
Julie Mason (Georgina Ward) abuses her position as the owner of a private health clinic by selling sexual favours to her male clients, whom she then blackmails for large amounts of money. At the same time, she resists the sexual advances of Elsa Farson ([[Carmen Silvera]]), a lonely, older woman.

When businessman Lee Maitland (Alexander Davion) engages her services, Julie, who wants to make a new life for herself, is taken by her new client and quickly becomes his fiancée. Meanwhile, barred from visiting Julie, Farson is driven to suicide.

Julie is drawn into Maitland's plan to make them both rich, unaware that he is actually Farson's son and intends to avenge his mother. The film ends with Maitland, having faked his death in a road accident that Julie helped to create, disappearing with tens of thousands of pounds that Julie had extracted from her clients. Julie is left to choose between admitting blackmail or remaining silent and being charged with Maitland's murder.

==Cast==
* Georgina Ward as Julie Mason
* Alexander Davion as Lee Maitland
* [[Polly Adams]] as Ann
* Mike Lewin as Roger Dawes 
* [[Carmen Silvera]] as Elsa Farson 
* [[Vincent Ball]] as Bernard Wilcox

* [[Tony Wright (actor)|Tony Wright]] as Police Inspector
* Geoffrey Morris as Sir Roderick Clyde
* Maria Coyne as Marilyn
* [[April Olrich]] as Paula
* [[Windsor Davies]] as Geoffrey Carter
* [[Peter Halliday]] as Mr Fawcett

==Production==
The film was written and produced by [[Hazel Adair]] and [[Kent Walton]] under the joint pseudonym "Elton Hawke". Many of the cast had appeared in either ''[[Crossroads (UK TV series)|Crossroads]]'' or ''[[Compact (TV series)|Compact]]'', soap operas co-created by Adair.&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt;

''Clinic Exclusive'' marks the film debut of [[Carmen Silvera]], later known for her role as [[Edith Artois]] in the BBC TV sitcom ''[[Allo! Allo!]]''.&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt;

==Release==
Originally titled ''Clinic Xclusive'', the film was re-released in May 1975 as ''Sex Clinic''.&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt;

==Critical response==
Writing for ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' in 1972, critic [[Nigel Andrews]] described the film as "quite a neat, unpredictable revenge thriller", praising its "glossily efficient" script and direction as well as the performance of Ward. He concluded that ''Clinic Exclusive'' is "altogether a surprisingly competent production, if only within the limits of its strictly [[Wikt:catchpenny|catchpenny]] genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |magazine=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |title=''Clinic Xclusive'' |date=August 1972 |last=Andrews |first=Nigel |authorlink=Nigel Andrews |editor1-last=Dawson |editor1-first=Jan |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |location=London, UK |page=157 |volume=39 |issue=463 |oclc=2594020 |issn=0027-0407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51987">[[File:Filterstef.JPG|thumb|[[wikt:Special:Search/colourless|Colorless]], [[green]], and [[red]] [[photographic filter]]s as imaged ("[[perception|perceived]]") by [[camera]]]]

'''Color vision''' is the ability of an organism or machine to distinguish objects based on the [[wavelength]]s (or [[frequency|frequencies]]) of the [[light]] they [[reflected light|reflect]], [[Light emission|emit]], or [[Transmittance|transmit]]. [[Color]]s can be measured and quantified in various ways; indeed, a person's perception of colors is a subjective process whereby the [[brain]] responds to the stimuli that are produced when incoming light reacts with the several types of [[cone cell]]s in the [[eye]]. In essence, different people see the same illuminated object or light source in different ways.

==Wavelength and hue detection==
[[Isaac Newton]] discovered that [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]], after being split into its component colours when passed through a [[dispersive prism]], could be recombined to make white light by passing them through a different prism. 

The characteristic colours are, from long to short wavelengths (and, correspondingly, from low to high frequency), red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Sufficient differences in wavelength cause a difference in the perceived [[hue]]; the [[just-noticeable difference]] in wavelength varies from about 1&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] in the [[blue-green]] and [[yellow]] wavelengths, to 10&amp;nbsp;nm and more in the longer red and shorter blue wavelengths. Although the human eye can distinguish up to a few hundred hues, when those pure [[spectral color]]s are mixed together or diluted with white light, the number of distinguishable [[chromaticity|chromaticities]] can be quite high.{{Ambiguous|date=October 2013}}

In very low light levels, vision is [[scotopic]]: light is detected by [[rod cell]]s of the [[retina]]. Rods are maximally sensitive to wavelengths near 500&amp;nbsp;nm, and play little, if any, role in colour vision. In brighter light, such as daylight, vision is [[photopic]]: light is detected by [[cone cell]]s which are responsible for colour vision. Cones are sensitive to a range of wavelengths, but are most sensitive to wavelengths near 555&amp;nbsp;nm. Between these regions, [[mesopic vision]] comes into play and both rods and cones provide signals to the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s. The shift in colour perception from dim light to daylight gives rise  to differences known as the [[Purkinje effect]]

The perception of "white" is formed by the entire spectrum of visible light, or by mixing colours of just a few wavelengths in animals with few types of colour receptors. In humans, white light can be perceived by combining wavelengths such as red, green, and blue, or just a pair of [[complementary colour]]s such as blue and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;"Eye, human." ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology of color perception==

[[File:Modern Color Vision Model.svg|thumb|The modern model of human color perception as it occurs in the retina, pertaining to both the [[trichromatic]] and [[opponent process]] theories introduced in the 19th century.]]

[[File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg|thumb|Normalized response spectra of human cones, to monochromatic spectral stimuli, with wavelength given in nanometers.]]

[[File:Spectrum locus 12.png|thumb|The same figures as above represented here as a single curve in three (normalized cone response) dimensions]]

[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|[[Photopic]] relative brightness sensitivity of the human visual system as a function of wavelength ([[luminosity function]])]]

Perception of color begins with specialized retinal cells containing pigments with different [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]], known as [[cone cell]]s. In humans, there are three types of cones sensitive to three different spectra, resulting in [[trichromatic color vision]].

Each individual cone contains pigments composed of [[opsin]] apoprotein, which is covalently linked to either 11-cis-hydroretinal or more rarely 11-cis-dehydroretinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Molecular Genetics of Human Color Vision: The Genes Encoding Blue, Green, and Red Pigments |first1=Jeremy |last1=Nathans |first2=Darcy |last2=Thomas |first3=David S. |last3=Hogness |journal=Science|date= April 11, 1986 |jstor=169687 |bibcode=1986Sci...232..193N |volume=232 |pages=193–202 |doi=10.1126/science.2937147 |pmid=2937147 |issue=4747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cones are conventionally labeled according to the ordering of the wavelengths of the peaks of their [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]]: short (S), medium (M), and long (L) cone types. These three types do not correspond well to particular colors as we know them. Rather, the perception of color is achieved by a complex process that starts with the differential output of these cells in the retina and it will be finalized in the [[visual cortex]] and associative areas of the brain.

For example, while the L cones have been referred to simply as [[red]] receptors, [[microspectrophotometry]] has shown that their peak sensitivity is in the greenish-yellow region of the spectrum. Similarly, the S- and M-cones do not directly correspond to [[blue]] and [[green]], although they are often described as such. The [[RGB color model]], therefore, is a convenient means for representing color, but is not directly based on the types of cones in the human eye.

The peak response of human cone cells varies, even among individuals with so-called normal color vision;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Neitz J, Jacobs GH |title=Polymorphism of the long-wavelength cone in normal human color vision |journal=Nature |volume=323 |issue=6089 |pages=623–5 |year=1986 |pmid=3773989 |doi=10.1038/323623a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6089/abs/323623a0.html |bibcode=1986Natur.323..623N |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305161805/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6089/abs/323623a0.html |archivedate=2007-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===
Two complementary theories of color vision are the [[trichromatic theory]] and the [[opponent process]] theory. The trichromatic theory, or [[Young–Helmholtz theory]], proposed in the 19th century by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], as mentioned above, states that the retina's three types of cones are preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. [[Ewald Hering]] proposed the opponent process theory in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Zur Lehre vom Lichtsinne |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Mathematisch–Naturwissenschaftliche Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften |issue=III Abtheilung |volume=LXVI.

In the same way that there cannot exist a "slightly negative" positive number, a single eye cannot perceive a bluish-yellow or a reddish-green.

A range of wavelengths of light stimulates each of these receptor types to varying degrees. Yellowish-green light, for example, stimulates both L and M cones equally strongly, but only stimulates S-cones weakly.  Red light, on the other hand, stimulates L cones much more than M cones, and S cones hardly at all; blue-green light stimulates M cones more than L cones, and S cones a bit more strongly, and is also the peak stimulant for rod cells; and [[blue]] light stimulates S cones more strongly than red or green light, but L and M cones more weakly. The brain combines the information from each type of receptor to give rise to different perceptions of different wavelengths of light.

The opsins (photopigments) present in the L and M cones are encoded on the X [[chromosome]]; defective encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of [[color blindness]]. The [[OPN1LW]] gene, which codes for the opsin present in the L cones, is highly [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] (a recent study by Verrelli and Tishkoff found 85 variants in a sample of 236 men).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Verrelli BC, Tishkoff SA |title=Signatures of Selection and Gene Conversion Associated with Human Color Vision Variation |journal=Am.

=== Color in the human brain ===
[[File:Ventral-dorsal streams.svg|thumb|left|Visual pathways in the human brain.  The [[ventral stream]] (purple) is important in color recognition.  The [[dorsal stream]] (green) is also shown.  They originate from a common source in the [[visual cortex]].]]

Color processing begins at a very early level in the visual system (even within the retina) through initial color opponent mechanisms. Both Helmholtz's trichromatic theory, and Hering's opponent process theory are therefore correct, but trichromacy arises at the level of the receptors, and opponent processes arise at the level of [[retinal ganglion cells]] and beyond.  In Hering's theory opponent mechanisms refer to the opposing color effect of red–green, blue–yellow, and light–dark. However, in the visual system, it is the activity of the different receptor types that are opposed. Some midget retinal ganglion cells oppose L and M cone activity, which corresponds loosely to red–green opponency, but actually runs along an axis from blue-green to magenta. Small bistratified retinal ganglion cells oppose input from the S cones to input from the L and M cones. This is often thought to correspond to blue–yellow opponency, but actually runs along a color axis from yellow-green to violet.

Visual information is then sent to the brain from retinal ganglion cells via the [[optic nerve]] to the [[optic chiasma]]: a point where the two optic nerves meet and information from the temporal (contralateral) visual field crosses to the other side of the brain. After the optic chiasma the visual tracts are referred to as the [[optic tract]]s, which enter the [[thalamus]] to synapse at the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (LGN).

The lateral geniculate nucleus is divided into laminae (zones), of which there are three types: the M-laminae, consisting primarily of M-cells, the P-laminae, consisting primarily of P-cells, and the koniocellular laminae.  M- and P-cells receive relatively balanced input from both L- and M-cones throughout most of the retina, although this seems to not be the case at the fovea, with midget cells synapsing in the P-laminae.  The koniocellular laminae receive axons from the small bistratified ganglion cells.&lt;ref name = "The First Steps in Seeing"&gt;R.W. Rodieck, "The First Steps in Seeing".

After [[Synapse|synapsing]] at the LGN, the visual tract continues on back to the primary [[visual cortex]] (V1) located at the back of the brain within the [[occipital lobe]]. Within V1 there is a distinct band (striation). This is also referred to as "striate cortex", with other cortical visual regions referred to collectively as "extrastriate cortex". It is at this stage that color processing becomes much more complicated.

In V1 the simple three-color segregation begins to break down. Many cells in V1 respond to some parts of the spectrum better than others, but this "color tuning" is often different depending on the adaptation state of the visual system. A given cell that might respond best to long wavelength light if the light is relatively bright might then become responsive to all wavelengths if the stimulus is relatively dim. Because the color tuning of these cells is not stable, some believe that a different, relatively small, population of neurons in V1 is responsible for color vision. These specialized "color cells" often have receptive fields that can compute local cone ratios. Such "double-opponent" cells were initially described in the goldfish retina by Nigel Daw;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.158.3803.942 | title = Goldfish Retina: Organization for Simultaneous Color Contrast | author = Nigel W.

From the V1 blobs, color information is sent to cells in the second visual area, V2. The cells in V2 that are most strongly color tuned are clustered in the "thin stripes" that, like the blobs in V1, stain for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (separating the thin stripes are interstripes and thick stripes, which seem to be concerned with other visual information like motion and high-resolution form).  Neurons in V2 then synapse onto cells in the extended V4.

Anatomical studies have shown that neurons in extended V4 provide input to the inferior [[temporal lobe]] . "IT" cortex is thought to integrate color information with shape and form, although it has been difficult to define the appropriate criteria for this claim. Despite this murkiness, it has been useful to characterize this pathway (V1 &gt; V2 &gt; V4 &gt; IT) as the [[ventral stream]] or the "what pathway", distinguished from the [[dorsal stream]] ("where pathway") that is thought to analyze motion, among many other features.

=== Subjectivity of color perception ===
{{see also|Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate}}
Nothing categorically distinguishes the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from invisible portions of the broader spectrum.  In this sense, color is not a property of electromagnetic radiation, but a feature of visual perception by an observer.  Furthermore, there is an arbitrary mapping between wavelengths of light in the visual spectrum and human experiences of color.  Although most people are assumed to have the same mapping, the philosopher [[John Locke]] recognized that alternatives are possible, and described one such hypothetical case with the "[[inverted spectrum]]" thought experiment.  For example, someone with an inverted spectrum might experience green while seeing 'red' (700&amp;nbsp;nm) light, and experience red while seeing 'green' (530&amp;nbsp;nm) light.  [[Synesthesia]] (or [[ideasthesia]]) provides some atypical but illuminating examples of subjective color experience triggered by input that is not even light, such as sounds or shapes.  The possibility of a clean dissociation between color experience from properties of the world reveals that color is a subjective psychological phenomenon.

The [[Himba people]] have been found to categorize colors differently from most Euro-Americans and are able to easily distinguish close shades of green, barely discernible for most people.&lt;ref&gt;Roberson, Davidoff, Davies &amp; Shapiro. referred by Debi Roberson, University of Essex 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Himba have created a very different color scheme which divides the spectrum to dark shades (''zuzu'' in Himba), very light (''vapa''),  vivid blue and green (''buru'') and dry colors as an adaptation to their specific way of life.

Perception of color depends heavily on the context in which the perceived object is presented. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple light will reflect mostly blue, pink, or purple light to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the color shift of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as [[color constancy]].

=== In other animal species ===

Many species can see light with frequencies outside the human "visible spectrum". [[Bee]]s and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them to find [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to ultraviolet "colors" and patterns rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400&amp;nbsp;nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuthill|first=Innes C |authorlink=Innes Cuthill |editor=Peter J.B.

The basis for this variation is the number of cone types that differ between species. Mammals in general have color vision of a limited type, and usually have [[red-green color blindness]], with only two types of cones. Humans, some primates, and some marsupials see an extended range of colors, but only by comparison with other mammals. Most non-mammalian vertebrate species distinguish different colors at least as well as humans, and many species of birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, and some invertebrates, have more than three cone types and probably superior color vision to humans.

In most [[Catarrhini]] (Old World monkeys and apes—primates closely related to humans) there are three types of [[color receptors]] (known as [[cone cell]]s), resulting in [[trichromatic color vision]]. These primates, like humans, are known as [[Trichromacy|trichromats]]. Many other primates (including New World monkeys) and other mammals are [[dichromat]]s, which is the general color vision state for mammals that are active during the day (i.e., felines, canines, ungulates). Nocturnal mammals may have little or no color vision. Trichromat non-primate mammals are rare.&lt;ref name=Ali&amp;Klyne1985&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ali|first=Mohamed Ather|last2=Klyne|first2=M.A.|title=Vision in Vertebrates|place=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1985|pages=174–175|isbn=0-306-42065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = G.

Many [[invertebrate]]s have color vision. [[Honeybee]]s and [[bumblebee]]s have trichromatic color vision which is insensitive to red but sensitive to ultraviolet.

Reptiles and amphibians also have four cone types (occasionally five), and probably see at least the same number of colors that humans do, or perhaps more. In addition, some nocturnal [[gecko]]s have the capability of seeing color in dim light.&lt;ref name="GeckoNocturnalVision"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Roth, Lina S.

In the evolution of mammals, segments of color vision were lost, then for a few species of primates, regained by [[gene duplication]]. [[Eutherian]] mammals other than primates (for example, dogs, mammalian farm animals) generally have less-effective two-receptor ([[dichromat]]ic) color perception systems, which distinguish blue, green, and yellow—but cannot distinguish oranges and reds. There is some evidence that a few mammals, such as cats, have redeveloped the ability to distinguish longer wavelength colors, in at least a limited way, via one-amino-acid mutations in opsin genes.&lt;ref&gt;Shozo Yokoyamaa and F. Bernhard Radlwimmera, "The Molecular Genetics of Red and Green Color Vision in Mammals", Genetics, Vol. 153, 919–932, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The adaptation to see reds is particularly important for primate mammals, since it leads to identification of fruits, and also newly sprouting reddish leaves, which are particularly nutritious.

However, even among primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, including monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. [[New World monkeys]] may or may not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the [[owl monkey]]s are cone [[monochromacy|monochromats]], and both sexes of [[howler monkey]]s are trichromats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobs G.

== Evolution ==
{{Main|Evolution of color vision}}
Color perception mechanisms are highly dependent on evolutionary factors, of which the most prominent is thought to be satisfactory recognition of food sources. In [[herbivorous]] primates, color perception is essential for finding proper (immature) leaves. In [[hummingbird]]s, particular flower types are often recognized by color as well. On the other hand, [[nocturnal]] mammals have less-developed color vision, since adequate light is needed for cones to function properly. There is evidence that [[ultraviolet]] light plays a part in color perception in many branches of the [[animal|animal kingdom]], especially [[insect]]s.  In general, the optical spectrum encompasses the most common [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transitions]] in matter and is therefore the most useful for collecting information about the environment.

The [[Evolution of color vision in primates|evolution of trichromatic color vision in primates]] occurred as the ancestors of modern monkeys, apes, and humans switched to [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] (daytime) activity and began consuming fruits and leaves from flowering plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]] |title=[[How the Mind Works]] |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |page=191 |isbn=0-393-04535-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color vision, with UV discrimination, is also present in a number of arthropods—the only terrestrial animals besides the vertebrates to possess this trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Koyanagi |first1=M. |last2=Nagata |first2=T. |last3=Katoh |first3=K. |last4=Yamashita |first4=S. |last5=Tokunaga |first5=F. |year=2008 |title=Molecular Evolution of Arthropod Color Vision Deduced from Multiple Opsin Genes of Jumping Spiders  |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=130–137 |doi=10.1007/s00239-008-9065-9 |pmid=18217181|bibcode=2008JMolE..66..130K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics of color perception ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016 }}
A "physical color" is a combination of pure [[spectral color]]s (in the visible range).  Since there are, in principle, infinitely many distinct spectral colors, the set of all physical colors may be thought of as an infinite-dimensional [[vector space]], in fact a [[Hilbert space]].  We call this space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;. More technically, the space of physical colors may be considered to be the (mathematical) [[cone (topology)|cone]] over the [[simplex]] whose vertices are the spectral colors, with white at the [[centroid]] of the simplex, black at the apex of the cone, and the monochromatic color associated with any given vertex somewhere along the line from that vertex to the apex depending on its brightness.

An element ''C'' of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; is a function from the range of visible wavelengths—considered as an interval of real numbers [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;]—to the real numbers, assigning to each wavelength ''w'' in [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;] its intensity ''C''(''w'').

A humanly perceived color may be modeled as three numbers: the extents to which each of the 3 types of cones is stimulated. Thus a humanly perceived color may be thought of as a point in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. We call this space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.

Since each wavelength ''w'' stimulates each of the 3 types of cone cells to a known extent, these extents may be represented by 3 functions ''s''(''w''), ''m''(''w''), ''l''(''w'') corresponding to the response of the ''S'', ''M'', and ''L'' cone cells, respectively.

Finally, since a beam of light can be composed of many different wavelengths, to determine the extent to which a physical color ''C'' in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; stimulates each cone cell, we must calculate the integral (with respect to ''w''), over the interval [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;], of ''C''(''w'')·''s''(''w''), of ''C''(''w'')·''m''(''w''), and of ''C''(''w'')·''l''(''w''). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color ''C'' (which is an element in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;) a particular perceived color (which is a single point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;). This association is easily seen to be linear. It may also easily be seen that many different elements in the "physical" space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; can all result in the same single perceived color in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;, so a perceived color is not unique to one physical color.

Thus human color perception is determined by a specific, non-unique linear mapping from the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; to the 3-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.

Technically, the image of the (mathematical) cone over the simplex whose vertices are the spectral colors, by this linear mapping, is also a (mathematical) cone in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.  Moving directly away from the vertex of this cone represents maintaining the same [[chromaticity]] while increasing its intensity. Taking a cross-section of this cone yields a 2D chromaticity space.  Both the 3D cone and its projection or cross-section are convex sets; that is, any mixture of spectral colors is also a color.

[[File:Cie Chart with sRGB gamut by spigget.png|thumb|The CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram with a triangle showing the [[gamut]] of the [[sRGB]] color space. The Planckian locus is shown with color temperatures labeled in [[kelvin]]s. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers (blue). Note that the colors in this file are being specified using '''sRGB'''. Areas outside the triangle cannot be accurately rendered because they are out of the gamut of sRGB, therefore they have been interpreted. Note that the colors depicted depend on the color space of the device you use to view the image (number of colors on your monitor, etc.), and may not be a strictly accurate representation of the color at a particular position.]]

In practice, it would be quite difficult to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them ''S'', ''M'', and ''L''. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) for the ''S'', ''M'', and ''L'' lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' would have to be added with some intensity to the ''physical test color'', and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.

By considering all the resulting combinations of intensities (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) as a subset of 3-space, a model for human perceptual color space is formed. (Note that when one of ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' had to be added to the test color, its intensity was counted as negative.) Again, this turns out to be a (mathematical) cone, not a quadric, but rather all rays through the origin in 3-space passing through a certain convex set. Again, this cone has the property that moving directly away from the origin corresponds to increasing the intensity of the ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' lights proportionately. Again, a cross-section of this cone is a planar shape that is (by definition) the space of "chromaticities" (informally: distinct colors); one particular such cross section, corresponding to constant ''X''+''Y''+''Z'' of the [[CIE 1931 color space]], gives the CIE chromaticity diagram.

This system implies that for any hue or non-spectral color not on the boundary of the chromaticity diagram, there are infinitely many distinct physical spectra that are all perceived as that hue or color. So, in general there is no such thing as ''the'' combination of spectral colors that we perceive as (say) a specific version of tan; instead there are infinitely many possibilities that produce that exact color. The boundary colors that are pure spectral colors can be perceived only in response to light that is purely at the associated wavelength, while the boundary colors on the "line of purples" can each only be generated by a specific ratio of the pure violet and the pure red at the ends of the visible spectral colors.

The CIE chromaticity diagram is horseshoe-shaped, with its curved edge corresponding to all spectral colors (the ''spectral [[locus (mathematics)|locus]]''), and the remaining straight edge corresponding to the most saturated [[purple]]s, mixtures of [[red]] and [[Violet (color)|violet]].

== Chromatic adaptation ==
{{Main|Chromatic adaptation}}

In color science, '''chromatic adaptation''' is the estimation of the representation of an object under a different light source from the one in which it was recorded. A common application is to find a ''chromatic adaptation transform'' (CAT) that will make the recording of a neutral object appear neutral ([[color balance]]), while keeping other colors also looking realistic.&lt;ref&gt;Süsstrunk, Sabine. [http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/research/past_topics/chromatic_adaptation.html Chromatic Adaptation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818184220/http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/research/past_topics/chromatic_adaptation.html |date=2011-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between [[ICC profile]]s with different [[white point]]s. [[Adobe Photoshop]], for example, uses the Bradford CAT.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbloom, Bruce. [http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html Chromatic Adaptation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926223613/http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html |date=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In color vision, chromatic adaptation refers to [[color constancy]]; the ability of the visual system to preserve the appearance of an object under a wide range of light sources.&lt;ref name=CAM&gt;{{cite book|title=Color Appearance Models|first=Mark D.|last=Fairchild|chapter=8.

'''ComicBase''' is a [[computer program]] for tracking [[comic book]] collections. It was created in 1992&lt;ref name="Company Information"&gt;[http://www.comicbase.com/mycb/company_information.aspx Company Information]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Peter Bickford]] as an [[Apple Macintosh]] program. A Windows version was introduced in 1996. As of February 2015, it is on its nineteenth version (dubbed ComicBase 2017) and is available for computers running [[Microsoft Windows]] Windows 7, and later. Its database includes pricing and notes on over 800,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbase.com/mycb/products/products.aspx ComicBase Product Features]&lt;/ref&gt; individual comic book issues, and allows users to sell their comics online at a website marketplace called Atomic Avenue.

ComicBase 2017 includes a "My Comics" web app which uses works in conjunction with the desktop software to allow users to view and update their collections on virtually any mobile device through the use of [[responsive design]] techniques, including Apple, Windows, and Android smartphones and tablets, as well as devices like the PSP and Kindle. This feature was introduced with ComicBase 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's New in ComicBase 2015|url=http://www.comicbase.com/mycb/Products/WhatsNew.aspx|website=www.comicbase.com|publisher=Human Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchases can be recorded in the mobile web app either by entering in the comics title and issue, or by taking a picture of the comic's barcode using a mobile device's camera.

ComicBase was the first software available on [[Blu-ray disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://uk.gizmodo.com/2006/07/12/comicbase_11_first_bluray_soft.html| title=Gizmodo UK : ComicBase 11: First Blu-ray Software| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708034457/http://uk.gizmodo.com/2006/07/12/comicbase_11_first_bluray_soft.html| archivedate=2007-07-08| deadurl=yes| accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Uncanny136.jpg|thumb|right|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #136 (August 1980, art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]), the penultimate issue of the "[[Dark Phoenix]]" saga.  [[Jean Grey]] would sacrifice herself in the following issue, but [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] later had the story [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to allow Jean to appear in the new ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' series.]]
In the [[comic book]] fan community, the apparent [[death]] and subsequent return of a long-running [[Character (arts)|character]] is often called a '''comic book death'''. A comic book death is generally not taken seriously by readers and is rarely permanent or meaningful other than for story or thematic purposes.

==Context==
Commenting on the impact and role of comic book character deaths, writer [[Geoff Johns]] said:&lt;ref&gt;IGN Geoff Johns: Inside Blackest Night&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Death in superhero comics is cyclical in its nature, and that's for a lot of reasons, whether they are story reasons, copyright reasons, or fan reasons.}}

The phenomenon of comic book death is particularly common for superhero characters. Writer [[Danny Fingeroth]] suggests that the nature of superheroes requires that they be both [[ageless]] and [[immortality|immortal]].&lt;ref&gt;James R. Fleming, [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v2_2/reviews/fleming.shtml Review of ''Superman on the Couch: What Superheroes Really Tell Us about Ourselves and Our Society''], ''ImageTexT: Interdisciplinary Comics Studies'', vol. 2, no. 2, Winter 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common expression regarding comic book death was once "The only people who stay dead in comics are [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], [[Jason Todd]], and [[Uncle Ben]],"&lt;ref name="opinionjournal2007"&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110009780 Captain America, RIP], para. 5, ''Wall Street Journal'', March 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the seminal importance of those characters' deaths to the title character:  [[Captain America]]'s [[sidekick]] (retconned dead in 1964), Batman's second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (dead in 1988), and [[Spider-Man]]'s uncle (dead since 1962), respectively. This long-held tenet was broken in 2005, when Jason Todd returned to life as the [[Red Hood (Jason Todd)|Red Hood]] and Bucky was reported to have survived the accident that seemingly killed him, brought back in 2005 as the [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]], remaining in the shadows for decades. Barnes apparently died again in 2011 after a short tenure as Captain America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Fraction, Matt]]|penciller=[[Immonen, Stuart]]|inker=von Grawbadger, Wade|story=Chapter 3: The Hammer That Fell On Yancy Street|title=Fear Itself|issue=3|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to be revived by [[Nick Fury]]'s Infinity Formula.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself'' #7.1 (2011), Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because death in comics is so often temporary, readers rarely take the death of a character seriously—when a character dies, the reader feels very little sense of loss, and simply left wondering how long it will be before they return to life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/comic-book-deaths/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/the-most-memorable-shocking-comic-book-deaths/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/logan-how-handled-death-comic-books-981835&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=raV6qalYZKwC&amp;pg=PA194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
Although several comic book deaths are well-known, two of the best-known are the 1980 "death" of [[Jean Grey]] in Marvel's "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix Saga]]" and that of [[Superman]] in [[DC Comics|DC]]'s highly publicized 1993 "[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]" storyline. There is one major distinction between the two, however—whereas it was never intended that Superman's death be permanent, but rather that he would return to life at the conclusion of the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-96/| title = Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed # 96| author = Brian Cronin| date = March 29, 2007| publisher = Comic Book Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean's passing was intended to be permanent, as the editor [[Jim Shooter]] felt that would be the only satisfactory outcome given that she had committed [[mass murder]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Dark Phoenix Tapes", ''Phoenix: The Untold Story'' #1 (April 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ginocchio|first=Mark|title=10 Amazing Storylines Derailed by Editorial Politics|url=http://whatculture.com/comics/10-amazing-comic-storylines-derailed-editorial-politics.php/8|work=What Culture|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the story was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] a few years later to facilitate Jean's return.

In 2007, the death of [[Captain America]] made real-world headlines&lt;ref name="opinionjournal2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/comics-captain-america-1941-2007-95787&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=2934283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/books/08capt.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/08/usa.arts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18520433&lt;/ref&gt; when he met his apparent end, but Steve Rogers returned in ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'' in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/06/15/captain.america/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/captain-america-steve-rogers-coming-back-life-years-marvel-comics-killed-article-1.376815&lt;/ref&gt;

==In universe acknowledgement==
Comic book characters themselves have made comments about the frequency of resurrections. [[Professor X]] has commented "in mutant heaven there are no pearly gates, but instead revolving doors."&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #70 page 17, panel 1&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Siryn]] was made aware of [[Banshee (comics)|her father]]'s death, she refused to [[Mourning|mourn]] him, giddily claiming that since her father has died as an [[X-Men|X-Man]], he was likely going to be soon resurrected, shocking her friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[David, Peter]] (w), [[Olivetti, Ariel]] (a). "Two Meetings, One In Person, One Not", ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (vol 3) #7 (July 2006). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father is later restored to life but is recruited by the [[Apocalypse Twins]] as part of their new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #9 (June 2013). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The obituary writer of the in-universe newspaper the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' once bemoaned to reporter [[Ben Urich]] about how many retractions he has had to write after each resurrection of a superhero or [[supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited'' vol.1 #18. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design International''' is an international architectural firm, which was founded in [[Toronto]] in 1965. The firm initially operated mainly in the North American market, but has since developed into a major international player{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and was one of the first architecture companies that truly worked on a global scale.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Today, the company's headquarters are in [[London]], with subsidiary offices in Milan, Shanghai, Jakarta and recently open in Dubai.

Design International works across 7 integrated divisions: Architecture, Masterplanning, Interior Design, Lighting Design, Landscape Design, Branding &amp; Signage, and Leasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Design International|url=http://www.designinternational.com/services}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is run by CEO [[Davide Padoa]].

The firm's portfolio includes a number of award-winning developments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAPIC Awards 2012|url=http://www.mapic.com/RM/RM_MIPIM_v2/documents/pdf/mapic/mapic2012-awards-winners.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global RLI Awards 2012|url=http://www.rli.uk.com/awards/2012/}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the retail and entertainment sector, such as [[CocoWalk]] (1990), an upscale [[lifestyle center]] in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, Florida; Odysseum (2009), a retail and entertainment complex in Montpellier, France; and the iconic [[Morocco Mall]] (2011), Africa's largest destination mall located on the [[Casablanca]] beach front promenade. The mall also includes one of only four [[Galeries Lafayette]] stores outside France.

More recently, in 2014, the firm completed Nave de Vero&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/cronaca/2014/25-marzo-2014/approda-marghera-nave-de-vero-centro-commerciale-ecocompatibile-2224265528789.shtml?refresh_ce-cp|title=A Marghera il centro commerciale ecocompatibile la|work=Corriere del Veneto|access-date=2018-02-12|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is located in Venice, Italy. The concept behind Nave de Vero is based on Venice’s merchant trading history. The project has won many awards, and in November 2014, was awarded a [[BREEAM]] rating of ‘Very Good’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.designinternational.com/nave-de-vero-becomes-first-commercial-retail-project-italy-obtain-breeam-certificate|title = Nave de Vero receives BREEAM rating of 'Very Good'|date = November 2014|accessdate = |website = Nave de Vero receives BREEAM rating of 'Very Good'|publisher = |last = Mifsud|first = Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt; This achievement makes the shopping centre the first commercial project in Italy to achieve this certification.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Design International is also responsible for the Cleopatra Mall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arch2o.com/cleopatra-mall-design-international/|title=Cleopatra Mall {{!}} Design International - Arch2O.com|date=2017-05-20|work=Arch2O.com|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is due to open in 2017, in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The shopping mall, which is currently under construction, is characterised by a gigantic canopy covering the central area of the scheme with a span of over 200 metres. The project includes over 300 shops and restaurants, and is set to include an outdoor musical fountain, gourmet markets and Egypt’s first dedicated luxury mall inside a shopping centre.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 2015, Design International announced their involvement in the [http://www.designinternational.com/design-international-create-destination-mall-part-king%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98royal-vision%E2%80%99-morocco-0 ‘Wessal Bouregreg]’ &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.designinternational.com/design-international-create-destination-mall-part-king%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98royal-vision%E2%80%99-morocco-0|title = Design International to create a destination mall as part of the King’s ‘Royal Vision’ for Morocco|last = Mifsud|first = Rebecca|date = March 2015|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; project in Rabat which is part of the King of Morocco's ‘Royal Vision’ for making Morocco an international destination.

The summer of 2015 also marked the moving of Design International’s London headquarters to a new location in Bermondsey.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">In [[archeology]], '''eastern ''sigillata'' A''' ('''ESA''') is a category of late Hellenistic and early Roman ''[[terra sigillata]]''. In 1957, [[Kathleen Kenyon]] introduced categories A, [[Eastern sigillata B|B]], [[Eastern sigillata C|C]], to classify eastern ''sigillata'' without determining the exact place of manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Doorselaer|first=André|title=Archaeological and historical aspects of West-European societies: album amicorum|year=1996|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=978-90-6186-722-7|pages=500–501|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2NAAS5jBI-IC&amp;lpg=PA500&amp;dq=Eastern%20sigillata&amp;pg=PA500#v=onepage&amp;q=Eastern%20sigillata&amp;f=false}} and Crowfoot, J.

London: Palestine Exploration Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; For ESA, still no production centers have been identified but distribution patterns suggest an origin in northern Syria.  ESA is distinguished by the fineness of its fabric, which stands out as very pale in comparison to the deep red-slip that usually covers all surfaces. When fully applied, the slip is of a consistent color and thickness across the vessel. There are many examples on which the thickness of the slip varies considerably or on which firing is inconsistent and very dark in patches. A full range of plates, bowls, cups and jugs was produced. Early forms develop in the context of an eastern Mediterranean [[Hellenistic Koine]], while later products are influenced by trends originating in Italian workshops. Many ESA forms are mold-made and exhibit distinct delineation between walls and floors as well as elegantly curved exterior and base profiles. A further technical feature is the frequent occurrence of a "double-dipping [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]]" that is the result of, first, one half of a vessel being dipped in dilute [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] and then the other half being similarly treated. The consequent overlap produced a line of thicker slip that became visibly darker during firing.

{{about|theatre electricians|construction electricians|electrician}}
In [[theatre]], an  '''electrician''' is a person who works with the various aspects of lighting. Some of the positions among electricians include the lighting supervisor, master electrician, deck electrician, light board operator, moving light programmer, [[Spotlight (theatre lighting)|followspot]] operator, as well as simply electricians. This group is generally known as the "Electrics" Department or LX Department.  

These people are responsible for receiving the [[light plot]] from the [[lighting designer]] and translating the design as it is on paper to the lighting that is seen by the audience in the final [[theatrical|production]]. In small theatres, many of these roles may be filled by a single person, while in a large production such as those on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] or a large tour, there may be several people filling some of the roles.

== Duties  ==
[[Image:Focusing stage lights.jpg|thumb|right|An electrician focuses a light]]
Theatre electricians are responsible for all non-design aspects of the lighting in a theatrical production. They may also be responsible for special effects (such as fog) and powering other electrical items (such as motors) used in the production.

Electricians install (hang), point and shape the beam (focus), and connect to power (circuit) [[lighting instrument]]s. Additionally they may add gel to color the light, patterns (or gobos) to create texture or shape a light into pictures, and accessories that give the designer the ability to change some aspect of the light, such as scrollers (color changers) or pattern effects (gobo rotators).

In the past (and even in some theatres today) the electrics department was in charge of all water and water effects used on or offstage (i.e. rain, waterfalls, pools, etc.).

==  Positions ==
=== Lighting supervisor ===
The '''lighting supervisor''' is responsible for acting as the go-between for the designers, and the theatre's electrics staff. In the cases of shows done in repertory, they may have to adapt the designs of several designers to work together given the limits of the [[Theatre|venue]] and the equipment, budget, and time available. In the case of a re-mount, they may adapt a design to newer equipment or a different venue than the design was originally created for. While Broadway and high end Off-Broadway productions have this position, the Master Electrician is often responsible for these duties in smaller productions.

=== Deck electrician ===
The '''deck electrician''', '''"stage electrician"''', '''"floor electrician"''', '''"floor LX"''', '''"deck elec"'''or just "'''stage LX'''"  is a member of the [[running crew]] for a production and is responsible for all aspects of running the lighting for the show that happen on or backstage. This can include such things as changing color, focusing and readjusting lights that were moved, connecting and disconnecting [[Stage lighting instrument|practical units]] or set pieces which are electrified, and in some venues, assisting with motor control or effects.  On touring or musical productions this individual is also referred to as the '''Dimmer Technician''', as their responsibilities include supervising and maintaining portable dimmer racks.

=== Load in electrician ===
The '''Load in electrician''' or "'''production electrician'''" in the UK, often referred to simply as an electrician, is a person usually hired on a per day or per project basis (freelance) to hang, circuit and focus the lights. Once the show goes into tech, the Load in Electrician will usually leave, although they may stay around to do "notes" with the lighting designer which may include adding or taking away lights, refocusing, or re-gelling lights. Even small productions usually have at least one or two Load in Electricians who are supervised by the Master Electrician.

=== Light board operator ===
{{main|Light board operator}}
The '''light board operator''', '''lighting operator''', '''noard op''' or just '''LX op''' is the person who executes [[cue (theatrical)|cues]] for a production. This can range from adjusting light levels of individual dimmers, such as on a two scene preset board, to simply pressing a "Go" button on a computer controlled console. They may need to be able to write cues for their lighting board, and to make adjustments quickly to account for equipment failure, or people being in the wrong location. For some live events, such as concerts, this person may also be creating cues and looks on the fly, and functioning both as an operator and a designer simultaneously.

=== Master electrician ===
{{main|Master electrician}}
The '''master electrician''', '''M.E.''' or '''"chief electrician"''' in the UK, supervises all other Electricians working on a production or show.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last = Parker | first = W. Oren | title = Scene Design and Stage Lighting | isbn = 0-03-028777-4 | publisher = [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc]] | date = 1990 | page = 263 }} &lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes referred to as the ''Head Electrician'' or in a touring house, the ''House Electrician''. Their other duties include:

*Planning and implementing of the cabling (circuiting) of lights and electric power distribution for any given show or production. 
*Inventory and repair and maintenance of all stage lighting fixtures, cables, effects, power distribution, dimmers, networking and lighting control consoles. 
*Organization and purchasing of all consumables including [[Color_gel|gels]], [[Gobo_(lighting)|gobos]], and [[gaffer tape|gaff tape]]. 
*Documenting and tracking of all scenery, circuiting, addressing, and system configuration in cooperation with the Lighting Designer. 
*If there are no light board ops, the Master Electrician may need to patch the board according to the L.D.'s designs.
*Solving any problems or issues with the electrical equipment that the Deck Electricians cannot resolve by themselves.
*Occupational safety and health of workers and operational decisions as the Head of the Electrics department.

=== Lighting programmer ===
The '''lighting programmer''', is a person familiar with the lighting board being used who sits next to or in communication with the lighting designer during "tech". He or she is responsible for programming in the lighting cues as dictated to him or her by the lighting designer. This saves the designer the time and attention of using the light board and allows him or her to concentrate on building the cues. Often, especially in smaller theatres, this person is the Light Board Operator for the show's run.

=== Moving light programmer ===
The '''moving light programmer''' is a person who specializes in the sometimes complex creation of cues for [[Intelligent lighting|moving lights]]. For large productions with several moving lights, there may even be a separate control system for the moving lights from that of the "conventional" lighting. Some of these lights, in addition to being able to change focus from one location to another, can include many other features such as color and patterns. The coordinating of these fixtures can be complex enough to require a dedicated person to program.

=== Followspot operator ===
{{main|Spotlight operator}}
The ''' followspot operator''' is the person who operates the [[Spotlight (theatre lighting)|followspot]], or spotlight on a production. This is a light which is physically moved by the operator during the production to follow a performer's movement around the stage. A follow spot may also have mechanisms to change color, as well as an iris to change the diameter of the projected circle of light. The followspot operator may have to change several aspects of the beam from their unit simultaneously. This position is more common in [[musical theatre]] and concerts than for drama.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5737">'''Empty books''' or '''blank books''' are [[Novelty item|novelty]] [[book]]s whose title indicates that they treat some serious subject, but whose pages have been [[Intentionally blank page|left intentionally blank]]. A number of such titles have been published as attempts at satire or polemic, to some commercial success. 

The joke is that "nothing" is the answer to whatever the title of the book asserts. In 2017, ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that the trend of publishing political empty books had led to "the noble art of political [[parody]] [descending] into a one-joke turn that avoids words".&lt;ref name="KeanSatire" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">'''Extra-illustration''' is the process whereby texts, normally in their published state, are customized by the incorporation of thematically linked prints, watercolors, and other visual materials.&lt;ref name=Ashmolean&gt;{{cite web|title=Extra-illustration (also known as ‘Grangerization’)|url=http://sutherland.ashmolean.museum/Grangerization.shtml|publisher=[[Ashmolean]]|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Extra-illustration was a vibrant and widespread fashion in Britain and America during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. While there was no set canon of titles chosen for extra-illustration, certain themes and subjects occur repeatedly. From the 1770s to the 1830s, most of the books selected were patriotic in tone and antiquarian or historical in subject. Titles ranged from biography, county histories, and topography to travel, natural history, and Shakespeare. As the pastime became more popular, the genre became more diverse but the scope remained the same: places and people, chronicles of contemporary life, the lives of artistic and theatrical celebrities, and a variety of then-modern writers, notably Byron and Dickens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Peltz]], ''Facing the Text: Extra-Illustration, Print Culture, and Society in Britain, 1769-1840''. San Marino, California: [[Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens]], 2017. Distributed in the UK by [[Manchester University Press]]. [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780873282611/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In Britain, extra-illustration is frequently called "Grangerising" or "Grangerisation," after [[James Granger]] whose seminal book ''Biographical History of England from Egbert the Great to the Revolution''—published in 1769 without illustrations—quickly prompted a fashion for portrait-print collecting and the incorporation prints and drawings into the printed text. However, the term "Grangerising" only came into use from the 1880s, more than a century after Granger's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Peltz]], ''Facing the Text: Extra-Illustration, Print Culture, and Society in Britain, 1769-1840''. San Marino, California: [[Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens]], 2017. Distributed in the UK by [[Manchester University Press]]. [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780873282611/]&lt;/ref&gt; And ironically for the process of book customization that carries his name, Granger never "grangerized" a book.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jackson, ''Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001): pp. 186-87.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Page from James Granger illustrated by A. M. Storer.jpg|thumb|Page from [[James Granger]]'s ''Biographical History'', extra-illustrated by [[Anthony Morris Storer]] with prints of Edward III dating to the 17th and 18th centuries. [[Eton College]] Library.]]

==Leading examples==
There are many examples of extra-illustration, especially Granger's ''Biographical History''.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the practice is given in [[Lucy Peltz]], ''Facing the Text: Extra-Illustration, Print Culture, and Society in Britain, 1769-1840''. San Marino, California: [[Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens]], 2017. Distributed in the UK by [[Manchester University Press]]. [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780873282611/]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and certainly the most influential example was made by [[Richard Bull (MP)]] who corresponded regularly with James Granger about his print collection and its organisation according to Granger's typologies.&lt;ref&gt;Their letters are preserved at Eton and published entire in [[Lucy Peltz]], "Engraved Portrait Heads and the Rise of Extra-illustration: The Eton Correspondence of the Revd James Granger and Richard Bull, 1769–1774," ''Walpole Society'' 66 (2004), pp. 1–161, see http://www.walpolesociety.org.uk/publications/publications.php retrieved 03 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bull-Granger, as Richard Bull's extra-illustrated copy is often called, is now in the collection of the [[Huntington Library]] in California. A large collection of extra-illustrated books was formed during the same period by [[Anthony Morris Storer]] who bequeathed them to [[Eton College]] in 1799. In the [[British Museum]], a particularly impressive and early example is the copy of ''Some Account of London'' by [[Thomas Pennant]], extra-illustrated by [[John Charles Crowle]]. Crowle filled fourteen folio volumes, bound in gold-tooled red leather, with a collection of over 3347 prints and drawings of London topography and of portrayals of historical events and people connected with the history of London. It was bequeathed to the British Museum in 1811 where it is registered under number G,1.1.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3316454&amp;partId=1&amp;images=true&amp;museumno=G,1.1&amp;page=1 Retrieved 03 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the largest project in the genre are the extra-illustrated books and related materials produced by Alexander Hendras Sutherland and his wife Charlotte, née Hussey, between c.1795 and 1839. The Sutherland collection is now shared between the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sutherland.ashmolean.museum/intro.shtml Retrieved 03 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Feet of Flames''''' is an [[Irish dance]] show directed by [[Michael Flatley]] and scored by [[Ronan Hardiman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1464172.stm BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Flatley was known for the shows ''[[Riverdance]]'' and ''[[Lord of the Dance (musical)|Lord of the Dance]]''.

==History==
===Hyde Park 1998===
The Hyde Park show was first created as a one-off performance of Flatley's previous show, "Lord of the Dance". It premiered on 25 July 1998, playing to approximately 25,000 people at the Route of Kings, an open-space arena-like spot in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Although closely resembling its predecessor, this show merged troupes, added new numbers, and featured a multi-level stage for the finale as well as a live band. Amongst the new numbers is Flatley's solo – "Feet of Flames", which the show is based around. The show introduced some of the key elements that are now featured when Flatley performs. His silver-heeled shoes made by [[Freed's of London]] were used for the first time in this show. TV screens on both sides of the stage were installed and are now used in all the shows that feature Flatley. Film of the Hyde Park show was later distributed on VHS and DVD.

===2000 World Tour===
On 21 September 1999 Michael Flatley announced a "Feet of Flames" world tour for 2000. This tour began on Wednesday, 1 March 2000, in Germany. The show differed significantly from the original 1998 version. The show had new numbers, new leads, a new story line and a "whole new outlook" in the words of Flatley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Both the original female leads [[Bernadette Flynn]] and [[Gillian Norris]] were replaced by Sarah Clark and [[Leigh Ann McKenna]]. [[Daire Nolan]] was replaced by [[Stephen Brunning]]. Both Daire Nolan and Gillian Norris went on to pursue their own careers after the 1998 show. Bernadette Flynn left to dance with Lord of the Dance troupe one until 2001. Some of the characters changed slightly in the show. Lord of the Dance became Firespirit, Saroise became The Swan and Morrighan the Temptress became Cleopatra. The Dark Lord was remained but there are sayings that they still used Don Dorcha as the name. Helen Egan's part as the little spirit became the Court Jester in the World Tour. The Highlight of the 2000 tour was Flatley and the Troupe performing in [[Budapest]] to over 100,000 people. The European part of the 2000 World Tour concluded on 29 July 2000 in [[Stormont Castle]], [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.

===2001 "Victory Tour"===

The 2001 tour, dubbed the "USA Victory Tour", had a preview show on 6 June 2001 in the [[Bi-Lo Center]], [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. The tour officially began on 8 June 2001 in the [[AmericanAirlines Arena]], [[Miami, Florida]]. The highlight of the tour was Michael Flatley performing for the first time in [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City on 29 June 2001. The tour ended on 29 July 2001 in [[Dallas, Texas]] in the [[American Airlines Center]], the second event to be held at the venue. The last time the show was performed was 29 July 2001. Michael Flatley was said to have retired that night{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but later in 2005 would come out with a new show, [[Celtic Tiger Live|Celtic Tiger]].

===2008 and 2009 Tour===
"Feet of Flames" returned to the world stage for a brief period with lead dancers Damien O' Kane and Bernadette Flynn taking the lead. This would mark the first time in the show's history that Michael Flatley would not be starring or dancing in it. This show featured dances/costumes from 1998 Hyde Park show. Later in 2009 Flatley returned in the lead role.

===2009===
In 2009, Michael Flatley reprised his role in the 2009 tour held in the [[Taipei Arena]] in [[Taipei]], Taiwan. It was filmed for DVD and later released as noted in his website. It was also released on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk by Playback HD in 2010. The 2009 return of Michael Flatley would later mark his return to his show, Lord of the Dance in 2010. 

==CD, VHS and DVD releases==
[[File:Flatley alone cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Flatley as Lord of the Dance during his return]]
The "Feet of Flames" show from Hyde Park in 1998 was released on VHS and DVD. A CD of the new music from the Hyde park show was released with the DVD. The Budapest show in 2000 was recorded for DVD release but this did not happen; however, clips of the show were put on Michael Flatley's autobiography/concert DVD ''[[Michael Flatley Gold]]''. Included on the DVD are the numbers:

*The Court of High Kings
*Firedance
*Cleopatra's Spell
*Thunder and Lightning

The [[Madison Square Garden]] show on 29 June 2001 in New York City and the American Airlines Center show on 29 July 2001 in [[Dallas]], Texas, were recorded. The American leg of the tour was filmed for an [[IMAX]] planned for release in 2002. In addition parts of the footage were going to be used in a film featuring Michael Flatley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The working title for the film was supposedly "Dream Dancer", a fictional love story.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Clips of the rehearsal process for the movie can be found on ''[[Michael Flatley Gold]]''. The film was, however, never completed. The original film from the shows in allegedly tied up in ownership dispute between the filming company and Michael Flatley's company [[Unicorn Entertainment]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The 2009 Taiwan tour was filmed for an actual DVD release and later released on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in 2010

The '''Hackney Flashers''' were a collective of broadly [[socialist]]-[[feminist]] [[women]] who produced notable [[agitprop]] [[exhibition]]s in the 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Perspectives on Photography'' (1979). Catalogue of Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition at the Hayward Gallery.&lt;/ref&gt; Working in the United Kingdom during [[second wave feminism]] (1960s–1980s), the Hackney Flashers are an example of collectives prevalent in the latter half of the 20th century that worked to raise consciousness of social or political issues relevant to the times. This group's original aim was to make visible the invisible and document women's work in the home and outside of it, helping to make the case for childcare and show the complex social and economic issues of women and childcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackney Flashers Collective|title=Who's Holding the Baby|journal=Heresies #9|date=1980|volume=3|issue=1|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
The group's origins go back to 1974 when photographers [[Jo Spence]] and Neil Martinson were searching for women photographers to produce an exhibition on Women and Work for Hackney Trades Council.&lt;ref&gt;''Putting Myself in the Picture'' (1986), Jo Spence, Camden Press; London, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; A woman designer and an illustrator, a writer and an editor also joined the group. Members were engaged in a variety of occupations at a professional level: university teaching, community photography, freelance photojournalism and publishing; some were active trade unionists. In 1975 the collective was consolidated when it adopted the name Hackney Flashers.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Left Shift: Radical Art in 1970s Britain'', Walker, John A. (London and New York: I .B. Tauris, 2002), p. 138, and "Who's Still Holding the Camera" Liz Heron in ''Putting Myself in the Picture'' (1986), Jo Spence, Camden Press; London, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
From the start the Flashers’ output was distributed as the work of a collective. It was a political decision that individual names were never listed, specific images or writing never credited. This may have led to later confusion about who was in the Hackney Flashers and who worked on the different projects.

Members were: An Dekker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ash|first1=Juliet|title=An Dekker Obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/an-dekker-obituary|website=the Guardian (UK)|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Greenhill, Gerda Jager, Liz Heron, Michael Ann Mullen, Maggie Murray, [[Christine Roche]], [[Jo Spence]] and Julia Vellacott. In her history of ''Women Photographers in Britain'' [[Val Williams]] recounts that "the group's nine women members began to study the use of photography within the capitalist system and to present alternatives. They played a decisive part in establishing a context within which women workers from different cultural fields could work together in pursuit of a collective political aim".&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Observers: Women Photographers in Britain 1900 to the present'', Williams, Val (London: Virago Press, 1986), pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others associated with the group were: Helen Grace, Maggie Millman, Jini Rawlings, Ruth Barrenbaum, Nanette Salomon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who's Holding the Baby?|journal=Heresies|date=1980|volume=4|issue=1|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlene Strasberg, Chris Treweek. Neil Martinson was a founding member of the group and was the main point of contact between the group and Hackney Trades Council. He left the group in November 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who's Holding the Baby?|journal=Heresies|date=1980|volume=4|issue=1|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Dennett did not join the group, but came to one or two meetings as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Spence, Oral History of British Photography, The British Library sound recordings archive, recording Recording date: 1991.03; 1991.04 Wembley, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and social purpose==
The group’s purpose and politics grew and developed over time – not without internal conflict and dissent. Members came from differing class backgrounds and political stances. Some were of the left, others emerging feminists. The group's feminist practice was reflected in their tactics of working as a small group outside of institutions like academia. They worked on bringing personal and domestic issues into the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;''Woman's Estate'', Juliet Mitchell, Penguin Books, 1971, p. 59. and ''Spare Rib'' (1972–93)&lt;/ref&gt; They would meet in each other's homes.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Spence, Oral History of British Photography, The British Library sound recordings archive, recording Recording date: 1991.03; 1991.04 Wembley, London&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamic of the group is documented in Liz Heron’s article, "Who’s still holding the camera?" in ''Photography Politics:One''.&lt;ref&gt;"Who’s still holding the camera?" (1979) Liz Heron. In ''Photography Politics: One''. Photography Workshop; London; republished as ‘Quién se ocupa de la cámara?’  in ''Fotografía y activismo'' (2006), ed. Jorge Luis Marzo, Editorial Gustavo Gili, Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aims of the group was to uncover what was hidden (hence ‘Flashers’). This was true of the many images of women at work (rarely recorded at the time) in the first exhibition and the complications of juggling childcare and work in the second. The works were conceived as campaigning and educational.

The second exhibition also engaged with issues of representation, of subverting imagery and the difficulty of visually showing a lack. Val Williams notes that "The eclectic use of graphics, of cartooning and of advertisements began a process which took photography out of its traditional limits and re-established it as a medium of cohesive political propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Observers: Women Photographers in Britain 1900 to the present'', Williams, Val, (London: Virago Press, 1986), p174.&lt;/ref&gt; Both exhibitions were intended for use in community centres, schools, trades union gatherings and every sort of alternative venue. The panels appeared in town halls, health centres, at conferences, in libraries &lt;ref&gt;''Transmitter Receiver: The Persistence of Collage'', An Arts Council Collection exhibition, Caroline Douglas and Jill Constantine, Hayward Publishing (London, 2011), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Hayward Gallery]] when it was selected by curator John Tagg to be included in the 'Three Perspectives of Photography' in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;''Left Shift: Radical Art in 1970s Britain'', Walker, John A. (London and New York: I .B. Tauris, 2002), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;
The collective also functioned as a co-operative, skill-sharing experience for women working in the media, who at that time had a very low profile and were often isolated.

==The work==
The Hackney Flashers Collective produced three main pieces of work, although there were other experimental pieces, including montages, which were made in the group’s occasional creative workshops

*''Women and Work'' (1975). This exhibit of B/W photographs and hand-written text acknowledged the hidden contribution women made to the economy and was a strong statement for equal pay. It was basic in concept and execution, but was well received and much used. It started its public life in Hackney Town Hall,&lt;ref&gt;''75 Years of Brotherhood: 1900–1975 Trades Union Exhibition'', Hackney Town Hall, 20 Sept-2 Oct
Pamphlet published by Hackney Trades Council (1975). Foreword by Terry McCarthy, Curator, National Museum of Labour History&lt;/ref&gt; appeared at a Socialist Feminist International Conference in Paris (1977) &lt;ref&gt;"Who’s still holding the camera?" (1979) Liz Heron. In Photography Politics: One Photography Workshop; London; republished as "Quién se ocupa de la cámara?" in Fotografía y activismo (2006), ed. Jorge Luis Marzo, Editorial Gustavo Gili, Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; and was hung in many venues in between.

[[File:Panel from 'Who'se Holding the Baby?' exhibition, 1978 by the Hackney Flashers Collective, showing the use of photomontage and graffiti by the group.jpg|thumb|right|Panel from ''Who’s Holding the Baby?'' exhibition by The Hackney Flashers Collective, 1978]]

* ''Who’s Holding the Baby'' (1978) The second exhibition was more sophisticated in its thinking and style. A designer and an illustrator had joined the group; the collective experimented at workshops and studied the work of [[John Heartfield]] when producing montages. These were used alongside a series of photographs documenting Market Nursery in Hackney. The lightweight, laminated panels were ideal for use in non-gallery settings and, as well as the photographs, included colour illustrations and montages. Its first showing was at Centreprise Community Centre in [[Kingsland Road]], Hackney.&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Observers: Women Photographers in Britain 1900 to the present'', Williams, Val (London: Virago Press, 1986), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; It toured to many parts of the country and was, controversially, included in, ‘Three Perspectives on Photography’, at the Hayward Gallery in 1979 &lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, "Three Perspectives on Photography" (1979). In ''Screen Education'' 1979:31, pp. 49–54.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Domestic Labour and Visual Representation'' (1980) An education pack (24 slides and a booklet) using the work of the Hackney Flashers; and intended to encourage student’s active, critical participation in the issues.&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition text of ''Who's Still Holding the Baby? Hackney Flashers 1978'' Exhibition at The Women's Art Library, Goldsmiths University of London, by Dr Hazel Frizell, p. 3, and ''Domestic Labour and Visual Representation'' pamphlet by Hackney Flashers, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afterlife and influence==
The collective split up in the early 80s citing political differences and the wish to work on other projects. Members of the Collective continued to develop their own careers or engage in new fields. Sally Greenhill worked as a photojournalist, Liz Heron worked as a journalist and literary translator and is the author of fiction and non-fiction books; Michael Ann Mullen became Photography Officer at the GLC and later lectured in history of photography at [[Middlesex University]]; Maggie Murray (with Val Wilmer) set up Format Photographers – a women's photo agency; Christine Roche continued as a cartoonist/illustrator and taught at the [[London College of Printing]]; Jo Spence produced books and exhibitions on health and representation. She died in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Jo (ed.), Spence, Jo, ''Cultural Sniping: The Art of Transgression'' (London and New York: Routledge, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Vellacott was an editor at [[Penguin Books]]. 
Informal contact and collaboration between many of the Flashers went on for many years and continues.

The work of the Hackney Flashers has been noted in histories of photography &lt;ref&gt;"Surveyors and Surveyed", Price, Derrick, in Wells, Liz (ed.), ''Photography: A Critical Introduction'' (London and New York: Routledge, 2004, Third Edition), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the art practices of collage and montage.&lt;ref&gt;''Transmitter Receiver: The Persistence of Collage'', Caroline Douglas and Jill Constantine (2011), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the initial showing of the work, the projects by the Hackney Flashers have been included in several major exhibitions in recent years. These have included but are not limited to:

'''2000:''' ''Protest and Survive'' at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]], curated by artists Matthew Higgs and Paul Noble &lt;ref&gt;''Protest and Survive'' exhibition catalogue, Matthew Higgs and Paul Noble (Whitechapel Art Gallery, 2000), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''herald''', or a '''herald of arms''', is an [[Officer of Arms|officer of arms]], ranking between [[pursuivant]] and [[King of Arms|king of arms]]. The title is commonly applied more broadly to all officers of arms.

Heralds were originally [[courier|messenger]]s sent by [[monarch]]s or [[nobleman|noblemen]] to convey messages or [[proclamation]]s—in this sense being the predecessors of modern [[diplomat]]s. In the [[Hundred Years' War]], French heralds challenged King Henry V to fight. During the [[Battle of Agincourt]], the English herald and the French herald, Montjoie, watched the battle together from a nearby hill; both agreed that the English were the victors, and Montjoie provided King Henry V, who thus earned the right to name the battle, with the name of the nearby castle.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Keegan|Keegan, John]]. ''[[The Face of Battle]]'', 1983, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|0-14-004897-9}}, pp 74, 77, 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other officers of arms, a herald would often wear a surcoat, called a [[tabard]], decorated with the coat of arms of his master. It was possibly due to their role in managing the [[tournament]]s of the [[Late Middle Ages]] that heralds came to be associated with the regulation of the knights' [[coat of arms|coats of arms]]. Heralds have been employed by kings and large landowners, principally as messengers and ambassadors. Heralds were required to organise, announce and referee the contestants at a tournament.&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.176&amp;177.&lt;/ref&gt; This science of [[heraldry]] became increasingly important and further regulated over the years, and in several countries around the world it is still overseen by heralds. In the United Kingdom heralds are still called upon at times to read proclamations publicly; for which they still wear tabards emblazoned with the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|royal coat of arms]]. 

There are active official heralds today in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, and the Republic of South Africa. In England and Scotland most heralds are full-time employees of the sovereign and are called "Heralds of Arms in Ordinary".  Temporary appointments can be made of "Heralds of Arms Extraordinary". These are often appointed for a specific major state occasions, such as a [[coronation]]. The [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] has created the position of "Herald of Arms Emeritus" with which to honor long-serving or distinguished heraldists.  In Scotland, some [[Scottish clan chief]]s, the heads of great [[nobility|noble]] houses, still appoint [[Private Officer of Arms|private officers of arms]] to handle cases of heraldic or genealogical importance of clan members, although these are usually pursuivants.

In addition, many [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]] have heralds attached to them. These heralds may have some heraldic duties but are more often merely ceremonial in nature. Heralds which were primarily ceremonial in nature, especially after the decline of chivalry, were also appointed in various nations for specific events such as a coronation as additions to the pageantry of these occasions. In the Netherlands, heralds are appointed for the [[Inauguration of the Dutch monarch|Dutch monarch's inauguration]] where they wore their tabards until 1948; these heralds proclaim the inauguration ceremony to have been completed to those inside and outside the Nieuwe Kerk.

'''Lisa Gerrard''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ə|ˈ|r|ɑːr|d}}; born 1961)&lt;ref name=:0&gt;[http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0409b.htm  Gerrard, Lisa (1961 – )] in ''The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia''&lt;/ref&gt; is an Australian musician, singer and composer who rose to prominence as part of the music group [[Dead Can Dance]] with music partner [[Brendan Perry]]. In addition to singing, she is an instrumentalist for much of her work, most prolifically using the ''[[yangqin]]'' (a Chinese [[hammered dulcimer]]).

Since her career began in 1981, Gerrard has been involved in a wide range of projects. She received a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the music score to the film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', on which she collaborated with [[Hans Zimmer]].

==Early life==
Lisa Gerrard was born in [[Melbourne]], and grew up in the suburb of [[Prahran]] with her Irish immigrant parents. She has said that she grew up with "[[Mediterranean]] music blaring out of the houses" and that this influenced her music, particularly on later Dead Can Dance albums and in her solo and collaborative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jane Cornwell |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/truly-madly-deeply-dippy-1597797.html |title=Truly, madly, deeply dippy – Arts and Entertainment |publisher=The Independent |date=25 August 1995 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerrard's first foray into forming bands and creative music-making was in Melbourne's [[little band scene]], an [[experimental music|experimental]] [[post-punk]] scene which flourished from 1978 until 1981. It was at one of these little band events that she first met Dead Can Dance co-founder [[Brendan Perry]]. Perry recalls, "It never occurred to me that we would one day collaborate musically together because at the time I thought her music was too [[Avant-garde|avant garde]]. I particularly remember one song that she sang about finding a man in the park and asking her mother if she could bring him home to keep in her wardrobe as she attacked this chinese dulcimer with two bamboo sticks".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ark.brendan-perry.com/biography.php]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107114101/http://ark.brendan-perry.com/biography.php |date=7 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Dead Can Dance===
{{main|Dead Can Dance}}
Dead Can Dance originally formed as a quartet in 1981 in [[Melbourne]], but in 1982 moved to London with members Gerrard, Brendan Perry and bass player [[Paul Erikson]]. Shortly after coming to England, Erikson flew back to Australia, leaving the band as a duo. Dead Can Dance recorded eight albums on the [[4AD Records]] recording label beginning with the self-titled ''[[Dead Can Dance (album)|Dead Can Dance]]'' [[Long play|LP]] in 1984. In 2005, the song "Nierika" became part of the opening titles for Mexican television station TV [[Azteca (TV network)|Azteca]]'s soap opera ''La Chacala''. The band split in 1998, but reunited in 2005 for a world tour. In 2012, the band announced a new world tour to coincide with the release of their new album, ''Anastasis''.

===Solo and collaborative career===
[[File:Lisa Gerrard1.jpg|thumb|upright|Lisa Gerrard at Beacon Theater, August 2012]]

In 1995, Gerrard recorded and released her first solo album, ''[[The Mirror Pool]]''. After the release of this album, she continued to work with Dead Can Dance, releasing the album, ''[[Spiritchaser]]'', in 1996. Following this, in 1998 she recorded ''[[Duality (Lisa Gerrard &amp; Pieter Bourke album)|Duality]]'' in collaboration with [[Pieter Bourke]]. This album would mark the beginning of an extensive collaboration for a number of film scores, including ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' and ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]''. Gerrard began a new collaboration with [[Patrick Cassidy (composer)|Patrick Cassidy]] in 2004 with the release of ''[[Immortal Memory (album)|Immortal Memory]]''. Again, this collaboration was furthered in film work, including ''[[Salem's Lot (2004 miniseries)|Salem's Lot]]''.

The following year in 2005, Gerrard contributed to the ''Ashes and Snow Soundtrack''. For the songs "Womb" and "Wisdom", she and Patrick Cassidy wrote and performed together. Her collaboration with Cassidy extended to include work with conductor Julie Rogers on the songs "Devota" and "Vespers".

In 2006, ''[[Sanctuary (documentary)|Sanctuary]]'', a documentary about the life and work of Gerrard, was recorded and released in September. It is the work of producer and director [[Clive Collier]] and features extensive interviews with Gerrard and various people who have collaborated with her in the past, including [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Niki Caro]]. The documentary was released on DVD by [[Milan Entertainment]] on 24 April 2007.

Also in 2006, Gerrard released her second solo album, ''[[The Silver Tree]]''. This album was markedly different from her previous work and was also her first album released outside 4AD Records. The album was first released on [[iTunes]], with a wider physical release planned at a future date. The album was nominated for the [[Australian Music Prize]] for 2006. In 2007 a retrospective album ''[[The Best of Lisa Gerrard]]'', a compilation of fifteen songs, was released covering her career in Dead Can Dance, solo work, and film work.

A world tour was undertaken in 2007 beginning in April in Melbourne, Australia. This tour marked the first time Lisa Gerrard had toured in Australia, with a performance in three cities. The tour was followed by performances in Europe and North America. More performances took place in Europe and Russia from 30 October to 22 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadcandancelibrary.com/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404110240/http://www.deadcandancelibrary.com/ |date=4 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, Gerrard collaborated with German electronic musician [[Klaus Schulze]] on the double-album ''[[Farscape (album)|Farscape]]''. The album was released 27 July 2008 and was followed by a European tour.

In 2009, Gerrard completed work on the documentary by Australian adventurer [[Tim Cope]] called ''On the Trail of Genghis Khan''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timcopejourneys.com/index.pl?page=1446/ |title=On the Trail of Genghis Khan |publisher=Timcopejourneys.com |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed her voice to the soundtrack, which began airing in 2010, of the Japanese [[NHK]] [[taiga drama]] ''[[Ryōmaden]]'', a story based on the life of [[Sakamoto Ryōma]]. Also in 2009, Gerrard created her own record label, Gerrard Records, which, aside from being a conduit for the release of Gerrard's future works, will also act to promote and support unrecognised artists of all genres. In September 2009, Gerrard and Klaus Schulze performed another tour in six European cities – [[Warsaw]], Berlin, [[Amsterdam]], [[Essen]], Paris, and [[Brussels]]. This tour coincided with the release of ''Come Quietly'', a joint project between Gerrard and Schulze that was released during the tour.

Gerrard released her third solo album, ''[[The Black Opal]]'', in October 2009. The album included collaboration with [[Michael Edwards (Australian composer)|Michael Edwards]], [[Patrick Cassidy (composer)|Patrick Cassidy]], [[Pieter Bourke]] and [[James Orr (musician)|James Orr]] and was the first release to come from Gerrard Records.

In 2010, Gerrard released a new album with fellow composer Marcello De Francisci titled ''Departum'' from Gerrard Records which was followed by the release of three new singles; "Coming Home" – as featured in ''[[Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole]]'', "Entry" and "Come This Way".

Gerrard also collaborated with Prash Mistry from "Engine Earz Experiment" on a track titled "Spirit Guide" which will appear on his upcoming album in 2011.

On 1 December 2010, Gerrard capped off a busy 2010 with the release of a new soundtrack album with [[Cye Wood]] titled ''The Trail of Genghis Khan'' which contains music from the Gerrard and Wood score to the documentary TV series by Australian adventurer [[Tim Cope]].

In July 2014, Gerrard released a new solo album entitled ''Twilight Kingdom'' through her own record label, Gerrard Records.

In 2014, Gerrard collaborated with British composer, songwriter and producer, [[Chicane (musician)|Chicane]].  Her vocals feature in the album ''[[The Sum of Its Parts]]'' featuring in songs "38 Weeks" and "Orleans".  The album was released in 25 January 2015 by [[Modena Records]].

Gerrard's vocals are heavily featured in the video game ''[[Armello]]'' launched on 1 September 2015, titled 'Wyld's Call', produced by [[Mick Allen (musician)|Michael Allen]].  Her vocals feature towards a Celtic theme of the soundtracks.

===Film career===
Gerrard's first experience in composing music for a film came with the 1989 Spanish film ''[[Moon Child (1989 film)|El Niño de la Luna]]'', directed by [[Agustí Villaronga]]. The film score was composed by Dead Can Dance and the film featured Lisa Gerrard in her first acting role. ''El Niño de la Luna'' describes the story of David, a young orphan with special powers, escaping an institution with the help of a fellow institute inmate, Georgina, played by Lisa Gerrard.

{{Listen| filename= Now We Are Free.ogg | title= "Now We Are Free" (2000) | description= 30-second extract from "Now We Are Free" by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. Theme from [[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]].| format= [[Ogg]]| pos = left}}

Gerrard participated in a number of musical scores but came to fame as a film composer after recording ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' in 1999, with [[Pieter Bourke]], and ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' in 2000, with [[Hans Zimmer]], which received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for best music score, although only Zimmer was nominated. It did, however, win a [[Golden Globe Award]] for both composers. Gerrard's score for the New Zealand independent film ''[[Whale Rider]]'' consisted entirely of solo material; a soundtrack album was released by 4AD.

In 2005 Gerrard collaborated with [[Ennio Morricone]] for ''[[Fateless (film)|Fateless]]'' followed by a collaboration with [[Jeff Rona]] on the score for the feature film "A Thousand Roads" and the song ''On an Ocean'' for the ''Henry Poole Is Here'' score. Gerrard along with Dead Can Dance also provided several contributions to the soundtrack of ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'', a visual journey showcasing mankind's impact on our planet. Gerrard was also invited by [[Denez Prigent]] to collaborate with him on his piece "Gortoz a ran – J'attends" (meaning "I await"), a piece that was later used in the soundtrack of [[Ridley Scott]]'s film ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]''.

In 2009 Gerrard wrote the score for ''[[Balibo (film)|Balibo]]'', for which she won a Best Feature Film Score award at the [[APRA Awards (Australia)|2009 APRA Screen Music Awards]] and an Aria Award for Best Original Soundtrack/Cast/Show Album at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2009|2009 Aria Awards]]. Gerrard finished 2009 by contributing her voice to the theme song for the Japanese [[NHK]] [[taiga drama]] ''[[Ryōmaden]]'', which began airing in 2010.

In 2010 Gerrard completed the score for ''[[Tears of Gaza]]'' with Marcello De Francisci which was well received despite its controversial theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=John |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943645?refcatid=31 |title=Variety Reviews – Tears of Gaza – Film Reviews – Toronto – Review by John Anderson |publisher=Variety.com |date=20 September 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerrard also scored the [[Jim Loach]]-directed ''[[Oranges and Sunshine]]'', starring [[Emily Watson]] and [[Hugo Weaving]], released in April 2011, which gained her another nomination at the 2011 IF Awards for Best Music Score.

In November 2010 Gerrard provided vocals and additional music for the post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller ''[[Priest (2011 film)|Priest]]'', scored by Christopher Young, which was released in 2011.

In November 2011 Gerrard completed the score for ''[[Burning Man (film)|Burning Man]]'', which won her Best Music Score at the 2011 Film Critics Circle of Australia awards, beating scores for ''Snowtown'', ''The Hunter'' and ''Red Dog''.

==Vocal ability==

[[File:Lisa Gerard 2012.jpg|thumb|left|DCD concert, 2012]]

Gerrard possesses the vocal range of a [[contralto]] but can also reach upward into the [[mezzo-soprano]] range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfolio.com/modernrock/lisagerrard.html |title=Lisa Gerrard: album reviews and ratings |publisher=Musicfolio.com |date=20 February 2007 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her voice has been described as rich, deep, dark, mournful and unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Original Soundtrack |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1NDOU50KT9KQW |title=A Customer's review of Gladiator: Music from the Motion Picture |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tower.com/mirror-pool-lisa-gerrard-cassette/wapi/106411002 |title=Music: The Mirror Pool (Cassette) by Lisa Gerrard (Artist) |publisher=Tower.com |date=22 August 1995 |accessdate=4 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628234609/http://www.tower.com/mirror-pool-lisa-gerrard-cassette/wapi/106411002 |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2007/05/19/lisa-gerrard-concert/ |title=Lisa Gerrard on Tour |publisher=Synthtopia |date=19 May 2007 |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Gerrard's mezzo-soprano range include the songs "The Host of Seraphim", "Elegy",  "Space Weaver", "Come This Way" and "One Perfect Sunrise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4PqWjug1Jg |title=Lisa Gerrard &amp; Patrick Cassidy 04 Elegy |publisher=YouTube |date=1 June 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV2dcF_BYvI |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerrard however performs more predominantly in the [[contralto|dramatic contralto]] range in her other songs, "[[Sanvean]]", "Sacrifice", "[[Ombra mai fu|Largo]]", "Lament" and [[Gladiator (soundtrack)#More Music from Gladiator|"Not Yet"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoXsxYf2UMA |title=Lisa Gerrard &amp; Pieter Bourke "Sacrifice" |publisher=YouTube |date=6 July 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xpkRj99FH0 |title=Sanvean (I am your shadow) – Lisa Gerrard |publisher=YouTube |date=5 April 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXc_YVn73PA |title=lisa gerrard – Largo |publisher=YouTube |date=7 February 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p7D5CGY4sg |title=Hans Zimmer &amp; Lisa Gerrard – Not Yet |publisher=YouTube |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerrard sings many of her songs, such as "Now We Are Free", "Come Tenderness", "Serenity", "The Valley of the Moon", "Tempest", "Pilgrimage of Lost Children", "Coming Home" and "[[Sanvean]]" in [[idioglossia]]. With respect to such work she has said, "I sing in the language of the Heart. It's an invented language that I've had for a very long time. I believe I started singing in it when I was about 12. Roughly that time. And I believed that I was speaking to God when I sang in that language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerrard|first1=Lisa|title=Quotation by Lisa Gerrard|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0314713/bio?|website=www.IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lubna Agha''' (May 2, 1949 - May 6, 2012) was an American artist. She was of Pakistani descent and lived in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamicartsmagazine.com/magazine/view/in_memoriam_lubna_agha_artist_in_white/|title=In Memoriam: Lubna Agha – Artist in white| publisher= islamicartsmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her art invokes a dialogue between the modern-abstract and traditional forms and practices of Islamic paintings. Her work taps on visual images once a part of daily life but now a part of history—from places as geographically disparate as [[South Asia]] and [[North Africa]]. She painted mainly on canvas and wood, applying an infinite number of painted pixels and organic shapes that evoke [[mosaic]] tiling, intricate carvings, and ornate metalwork.

Her work has been exhibited in art museums and galleries in [[Pakistan]] and the [[United States]], as well as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], and [[Switzerland]].

Her paintings are part of the permanent collections at the Asian Collection at Bradford Museum, UK, National Council of the Arts, Pakistan, and the Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts, Jordan.

The Karachi School of Arts dedicated an Art Gallery to her name. The Lubna Agha Art Gallery was inaugurated with a showing of her work and a memorial lecture in March, 2016. &lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/1061918/remembering-lost-gems-ksa-honours-lubna-agha-by-launching-gallery-in-her-name/ Remembering Lost Gems – KSA Honours Lubna Agha by launching gallery in her name]&lt;/ref&gt;

A book about the artist by [[Marcella Nessom Sirhandi]] entitled ''Lubna Agha: Points of Reference'' was published by The Foundation of Museum of Modern Art, Pakistan in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fomma.info/stories_cs.php?id=33&amp;r=1 Lubna Agha: Points of Reference, The Foundation of Museum of Modern Art, Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721202447/http://www.fomma.info/stories_cs.php?id=33&amp;r=1 |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agha died of complications from [[gallbladder cancer]] at her home in Brookline, MA on May 6, 2012.

Since 1850, when Madeiran natives were introduced to hand embroidery as a means of industry, the islands had been renowned for their needlework.&lt;ref name=sdabio/&gt; The Marghabs took advantage of this reputation, producing textiles that were skilfully hand-embroidered on the highest quality Irish linen and a form of [[organdy]] called Margandie,&lt;ref name=sdabio/&gt; made in Switzerland, and harder wearing than usual organdy.&lt;ref name=chic/&gt; The linens were designed by Vera, and hand-embroidered as a home industry by the women on Madeira, who Vera insisted received payment per stitch - which for a single [[place mat]] could amount to seventy thousand stitches.&lt;ref name=chic/&gt;

Marghab linens were retailed through leading American department stores such as [[Lord &amp; Taylor]], [[Marshall Field's]], and [[Neiman Marcus]].&lt;ref name=chic/&gt; In 1945 Vera Marghab was awarded the [[Neiman Marcus Fashion Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Staff writer|title=The Neiman's Seal of Approval.|date=25 October 2002 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-93918462.html|accessdate=2 March 2015 |work=Women's Wear Daily |publisher=via Highbeam {{subscription required}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emile died in 1947, and his wife took charge of the business until its dissestablishment in 1980.&lt;ref name=sdacol/&gt; She died in 1995.&lt;ref name=chic/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">'''Mono-ha''' (もの派) is the name given to a group of 20th-century Japanese artists. The Mono-ha artists explored the encounter between natural and industrial materials, such as stone, steel plates, glass, light bulbs, cotton, sponge, paper, wood, wire, rope, leather, oil, and water, arranging them in mostly unaltered, ephemeral states. The works focus as much on the interdependency of these various elements and the surrounding space as on the materials themselves.

==Origin of the Term “Mono-ha” and its Members==

“Mono-ha” is usually translated in a literal manner, as “School of Things.” The Mono-ha artists regularly assert that “Mono-ha” was a term disparagingly coined by critics (specifically Teruo Fujieda and Toshiaki Minemura  in ''Bijutsu Techo'' magazine in 1973) well after they had begun to exhibit their work, and they did not begin as an organized collective. Many of the Mono-ha artists were first exhibited at Tamura and Maki Galleries in Tokyo owned by Nobuo[[(Shinro) Yamagiishi]] who was also an art writer and whose archives are in the collection of [[The National Art Center Tokyo]].

Toshiaki Minemura explains in his 1986 essay “What Was Mono-ha?,” that in terms of their academic background and intellectual exchange, the Mono-ha artists are divided into three groups:&lt;ref&gt;Minemura, Toshiaki. [https://www.kamakura.gallery/mono-ha/minemura-en.html "What was MONO-HA?"], ''MONO-HA'', Kamakura Gallery, 1986, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''"The [[Lee Ufan|Lee]] + [[Tama Art University|Tamabi]] Connection.”''' This comprises [[Nobuo Sekine]], [[Kishio Suga]], Shingo Honda, Katsuhiko Narita and Katsurō Yoshida in the painting department, and  [[Susumu Koshimizu]] in the sculpture department at [[Tama Art University]] (aka Tamabi) as well as [[Jiro Takamatsu]] and [[Lee Ufan]], a Korean artist who is a close friend of Sekine. 
# '''“The [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Geidai Connection]],”''' a group of artists around [[Kōji Enokura]] and Noboru Takayama, who were both graduates of the [[Tokyo University of the Arts]] (aka Geidai), and Hiroshi Fujii and Makoto Habu, who were involved in Mono-ha later on. 
# '''“The [[Nihon University|Nichidai]] Connection,”''' students from the [[Nihon University]] (aka Nichidai) Fine Arts Department—whose central figure was Noriyuki Haraguchi—also known as the “Yokosuka Group,” due to Haraguchi’s upbringing in Yokosuka and his critique of the local US military presence through his work.&lt;ref&gt;''Kishio Suga''. Los Angeles: Blum &amp; Poe, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-Political Context==

Mono-ha emerged in response to a number of social, cultural and political precedents set in the 1960s. With the exception of Lee Ufan, who was a decade older, most of the Mono-ha artists were just beginning their careers when the violent student protests of 1968–69 occurred.

At the same time, there was much protest against the second extension of the US-Japan Security Treaty (known in abbreviated Japanese as ''[[Anpo]]'') in 1970, binding Japan into providing logistical support for the US war in Vietnam. Coupled with demands for the reversion of [[Okinawa]] by 1972 and the removal of nuclear weapons based there, the climate of protest during this period was symptomatic of a growing distrust of the United States’ intentions towards Asia and its dominant position in the bilateral relationship with Japan. The activism of the “''Anpo'' generation” gave rise to a highly intellectual counterculture that was both critical of US “[[imperialism]]” and acutely self-aware of its Japanese identity.&lt;ref&gt;Munroe, Alexandra. ''Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky''. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1994. p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mono-ha artists typically deny involvement with student activist movements at the time, though it is thought that the tense political climate influenced their work, allowing them to grapple with and make sense of their unease and disillusionment with postwar modernity in their different ways.

==Recent Attention in the United States==

In 2012, [[Blum &amp; Poe]] gallery introduced the Mono-ha art into the US with the survey exhibition “Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha,” curated by Mika Yoshitake. The gallery has also held solo exhibitions of [[Lee Ufan]], [[Kishio Suga]], [[Susumu Koshimizu]], [[Koji Enokura]], and [[Nobuo Sekine]].

'''MozartNu (1986–2008)''' is a contemporary dance performance conceived by the Spanish director, [[Iago Pericot]]. It is derived from Pericot's ''MozartNu'', which premiered in 1986. The original 1986 version of ''MozartNu'', inspired by the [[Coronation Mass (Mozart)|Coronation Mass]] of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], showed the beauty of human relationships through the naked bodies of two dancers.

In ''MozartNu (1986–2008)'', the original version is performed by one couple on one platform, while another couple dances simultaneously on a separate platform on the same stage. These parallel performances reflect the changes that have been the result of these human relationships over time.

The premiere production of ''MozartNu (1986–2008)'' was April 15–20, 2008 at ''El Mercat de les Flors'' in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name = "lugaresnaturistas.org"&gt;{{Cite web | title = MozartNu (1986-2008) - The human beauty and musical | publisher = lugaresnaturistas.org | url = http://www.lugaresnaturistas.org/mozartnu.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older dancers were the dancers who performed in the original ''MozartNu'' of 1986.

The '''Persio Flacco''' is an active opera and theater stage in [[Volterra]], Italy.

==History==
[[Volterra]] still lacked a proper indoor performance stage in the early nineteenth century. In 1816 a group of citizens, including cavaliere Bartolommeo Falchi, cavaliere Mario Maffei, Luigi Ducci, Francesco Cinci, and Luigi Campani, commissioned the architect [[Luigi Campani]] (an architect of the [[Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany]]). The theater was erected on the site of the palazzo belonging to Marchesi Incontri. Work began in 1816 and the theater was inaugurated in 1820.

===Description===
The main curtain (''sipario'') was painted by [[Nicola Contestabili]], who represented [[Aulus Persius Flaccus]], a Roman satirist and playwright born in Volerra, being led by the muses to the summit of [[Mount Parnassus|Parnassus]], ruled by Apollo. This gave the theater its final name. The ceiling over the seats was painted with ''Venus in a chariot drawn by swans'', and the parapets, with cupids, garlands and vignettes, harmonizing with the curtain. All these beautiful decorations were lost with subsequent restorations.

===Ongoing care===
In 1820, a group of 60 prominent citizens formed the ''Academy of the Riuniti'' (of the reunited), and purchased the entire theater, assigning to each member property of the individual boxes and seats, and this organization has continuously maintained that theatrical activity.

The theater was closed for physical repairs for 15 years, from 1984 to 1999, before the reopening,  members donated their ownerships of seats and boxes to the Academy. This availed them of funds to pursue reconstruction.

The '''''Portrait of Juan de Pareja''''' is a painting by Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] of his assistant [[Juan de Pareja]], a notable painter in his own right, who was [[Slavery in Spain|enslaved]] and owned by Velázquez at the time the painting was completed. Velázquez painted the portrait in [[Rome]], while traveling in [[Italy]], in 1650.  It is the earliest known [[Portrait painting#Baroque and Rococo|portrait]] of a Spanish man of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=The Image of the Black in Western Art, Volume III|last=Stoichita|first=Victor|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=|year=2010|isbn=9780674052611|editor-last=Bindman|editor-first=David|edition=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=226|chapter=The Image of the Black in Spanish Art: Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries|oclc=555658364|editor-last2=Gates, Jr|editor-first2=Henry Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first painting to sell for more than £1,000,000. At the time of the painting's purchase by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1970 they considered it "among the most important acquisitions in the Museum's history".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 1971|title=Juan de Pareja by Diego Velázquez|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/juan_de_pareja_by_diego_velazquez_the_metropolitan_museum_of_art_bulletin_v_29_no_10_part_ii_june_1971|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in [[New York City]].

==History==
In 1649, as court painter to [[Philip IV of Spain]], Diego Velázquez was sent to Rome to purchase works of art for the [[Alcázar]] in Madrid. Velázquez brought with him Juan de Pareja, a  [[Slavery in Spain|enslaved man]], who served as an assistant in the artist's workshop.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art website"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/437869 Metropolitan Museum of Art website]&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Rome, Velázquez executed an oil painting of Juan de Pareja, which was displayed as part of a larger exhibition of paintings at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] on 19 March 1650. According to Antonio Palomino's biography of Velázquez, the painting "was generally applauded by all the painters from different countries, who said that the other pictures in the show were art but this one alone was 'truth'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Palomino, Antonio | title= El Museo pictórico y escala óptica | year=1724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Velázquez painted the portrait of [[Juan de Pareja]], who was of Moorish descent,&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art website"/&gt; in his workshop, as an exercise in preparation for his official [[portrait of Pope Innocent X]]. The Pope, a ruddy-faced man who would be depicted in the bright pink and crimson robes of his office, presented a tricky study in both color and composition. Additionally, since he would be executing a portrait from life, Velázquez would be forced to work quickly while still capturing the essence of Innocent X's character. The ''Portrait of Juan de Pareja'' reflects Velázquez's exploration of the difficulties he would encounter in the Pope's portrait. To compensate for a restricted palette of colors, Velázquez adopted a loose, almost impressionistic style of brushwork to bring an intense vitality to his subject.

Juan de Pareja (circa 1610 – 1670) became an artist in his own right, and in 1654 he was freed by Velázquez.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art website"/&gt;

The [[Provenance|painting's ownership]] between its first exhibition at the Pantheon in Rome in 1650 and the end of the eighteenth century is unknown. There is no record of the painting in Spain. The earliest record of the ownership of the painting was in essay written in 1765 by [[Francisco Preciado]], Director of the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]] in Rome. He stated that the painting owned by Cardinal Trajano D'Acquaviva (1694-1747) who lived in Rome.

The painting then reappears in the record as part of the dukes of Baranello's collection in [[Naples]] sometime in the 1700s. It was recorded as part of the collection of [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]], the [[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to the Two Sicilies#Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Naples and.2For the Kingdom of Sicily|British Ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples]] from 1764 to 1798. The inventory of his residence in Naples, Palazzo Sessa, lists  "a portrait of a Moresco slave by Velazquez." Hamilton sent the portrait and his other works of art to London for safekeeping, on board the ship [[HMS Foudroyant (1798)|HMS Fondroyant]] the [[flagship]] of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], when he left Naples. Hamilton returned to England heavily in debt and the portrait was auctioned at [[Christie's]] in 1801. The auction catalogue listed the painting as Velazquez's "Portrait of a Moorish Slave, that was in his service, and became a great Painter". It sold for 39 guineas and disappeared from the record again.

It later surfaces in the collection of [[Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, 2nd Earl of Radnor|Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie]], 2nd [[Earl of Radnor]] at [[Longford Castle]], [[Salisbury]]. In a catalogue of the Radnor family's collection, published in 1909, stated that the portrait was part of the collection by 1814 and may have been acquired in 1811. It remained in the ownership of the Radnor family for over 150 years until it was sold at Christie's in London for the record sum of £2,310,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/dec/01/archive-velazquez-scarred-price-tag|title=From the Observer archive: 29 November 1970: A Velázquez now forever scarred by its £2m price-tag|last=Gosling|first=Nigel|date=2013-12-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 2,200,000 guineas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.countrylife.co.uk/luxury/art-and-antiques/5-sales-made-christies-no-5-first-million-pound-picture-144183|title=The 5 sales which made Christie’s - No.5: The first million-pound picture - Country Life|date=2016-12-30|work=Country Life|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or $5,544,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 5, 1971|title=Comment|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1971/06/05/comment-5350|journal=The New Yorker|volume=|pages=31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on 27 November 1970.

'''''Searchlight on Harbor Entrance, Santiago de Cuba''''' is an early 20th century painting by American artist [[Winslow Homer]]. It is currently (2018) in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11136 |title=Winslow Homer &amp;#124; Searchlight on Harbor Entrance, Santiago de Cuba |website=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executed in oil on canvas from sketches made by Homer in 1895, the painting depicts two cannon atop [[Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca]], also known as Morro castle, a Spanish built fortress on the island of Cuba. The fort played a role in the decisive [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] in 1898, in which the United States Navy destroyed a Spanish fleet sheltering there. The image was painted after the event received much publicity in 1901 as a court of enquiry strove to apportion credit to the American commanders involved.

The work is on view at the Metropolitan in Gallery 767.

'''''Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors''''' ({{lang-uk|Тіні забутих предків}}, ''Tini zabutykh predkiv''), also called ''Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors'', ''Shadows of Our Ancestors'', or ''Wild Horses of Fire'' &amp;ndash; is a 1965&lt;ref name="SteffenXVI"&gt;{{cite book |last= Steffen |first=James |date=2013 |title= The Cinema of Sergei Parajanov |url= https://books.google.com/?id=RbDxAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shadows+parajanov+september+1964#v=snippet&amp;q=1964%20september&amp;f=false |location=Madison |publisher= University of Wisconsin Press |isbn= 978-0-299-29653-7 |page="xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; film by the Soviet filmmaker [[Sergei Parajanov]] based on the classic book by Ukrainian writer [[Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky]]. The film was Parajanov's first major work and earned him international acclaim for its rich use of costume and color. The film also features a detailed portrayal of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Hutsul]] culture, showing not only the harsh [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] environment and brutal family rivalries, but also the various aspects of Hutsul traditions, music, costumes, and dialect.

==Plot==
In a small [[Hutsul]] village in the [[Carpathian mountains]] of [[Ukraine]], a young man, Ivan, falls in love with the daughter of the man who killed his father. Though their families share a bitter enmity, Ivan and Marichka have known each other since childhood. In preparation for their marriage, Ivan leaves the village to work and earn money for a household. While he is gone, Marichka accidentally slips into a river and drowns while trying to rescue a lost lamb.

Ivan returns and falls into despair after seeing Marichka's body. He continues to work, enduring a period of joyless toil, until he meets another woman, Palahna, while shoeing a horse. Ivan and Palahna get married in a traditional [[Hutsul]] wedding in which they are blindfolded and yoked together. The marriage quickly turns sour, however, as Ivan remains obsessed with the memory of Marichka. Estranged from her emotionally distant husband, Palahna becomes involved with a local sorcerer, while Ivan begins to experience hallucinations.

At a tavern, Ivan witnesses the sorcerer embrace Palahna and strike one of his friends. Roused into an uncharacteristic fury, Ivan snatches up his axe, only to be struck down by the sorcerer. Ivan stumbles into the nearby woods and perceives Marichka's spirit to be with him, reflected in the water and gliding amongst the trees. As reality merges into dream, the colorless shade of Marichka reaches out across a great space and touches Ivan's outstretched hand. Ivan screams and dies. The community gives him a traditional Hutsul burial while children watch through cross braced windows.

==Themes==
The film is highly symbolic, making frequent use of religious and folkloric images that include crosses, lambs, graves, and spirits. The film also uses color to represent mood. During Ivan's period of mourning, black and white film stock is used. In other scenes, colors are often muted, but provide a contrast to vivid use of red and yellow. On its release, the film's presentation contrasted with the common [[socialist realism]] style that had government approval. After refusing to change the film, Parajanov was soon blacklisted from Soviet cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/maestro.html Sergei Paradzhanov&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simpich Character Dolls, Ltd.''' was a [[doll]]maker and [[Putting-Out system#Cottage industry|home-workshop employer]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. In production since 1952, the founders, Bob and Jan Simpich, announced their retirement for February 2007, and the closing of their studio in the [[Old Colorado City|Old Colorado City Historic Commercial District]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collectorsweekly.com/dolls/simpich&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.westsidepioneer.com/Articles/122106/Simpich.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The dolls themselves range from [[History of the United States|historical figures]] to [[mythology|mythological]] ones, and the most consistently popular are the [[Christmas]]-themed dolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpich  |first= Bob &amp; Jan |date=January 1, 1982 |title=Simpich Character Dolls |url= |location= |publisher= |asin= B007RHTK28 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dolls have spawned other concepts since their creation, notably the [[marionette]] [[theater]] of their son, [[puppeteer]] David Simpich.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x35zarc&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susan Stamberg''' (born September 7, 1938) is an [[United States|American]] radio journalist who is a Special Correspondent for [[National Public Radio]] and guest host of ''[[Weekend Edition|Weekend Edition Saturday]]''.

==Early life==
Susan Stamberg was born '''Susan Levitt''' in [[Newark, New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} She graduated from [[Barnard College]] in 1959.

==Career==
For 14 years beginning in 1972 Stamberg served as co-host of ''[[All Things Considered]]'', the evening news magazine.   She was the first woman to hold a full-time position as [[News presenter|anchor]] of a national nightly news broadcast in the [[United States]].  She was awarded the [[Edward R. Murrow Award (CPB)]]. She was the host of Weekend Edition Sunday from 1987 to 1989.  In 1994, Stamberg was inducted into the [[Broadcasting Hall of Fame]].  In 1996 she was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405090225/http://www.journalism.wisc.edu/alumni/wj/sum02/wj_sum02.pdf "Stamberg urges hard news after 9/11"]. ''The Wisconsin Journalist''. School of Journalism and Mass Communication, [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Retrieved March 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Thanksgiving since 1971, Stamberg provides NPR listeners with her mother-in-law's recipe for a [[cranberry]] relish sauce that is unusual in having [[horseradish]] as one of its principal ingredients. The recipe is known as ''Mama Stamberg's Cranberry Relish Recipe'', although it was originally published in 1959 by Craig Claiborne in his food column.&lt;ref&gt;Stamberg, Susan (November 23, 2006). [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4176014 "Mama Stamberg's Cranberry Relish Recipe"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122105402/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4176014 |date=November 22, 2014 }}. [[National Public Radio]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of her most memorable interviews was with [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]–winning economist [[Milton Friedman]]. Stamberg argued with Friedman over the merits of the [[free market]], claiming her conversations with "Russian cabbies" on the streets of New York had showed that the expatriates preferred life in the former [[Communism|Communist]] country to "how dreadfully tough their lives are here (the United States)."  Friedman dismissed Stamberg's observation, contending, "I'm saying if you really want to know what they really believe about the relative merits of the two systems, see what they do, not what they say. And what they do is to stay here. They don't go back."&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, Alex; Scott, Amy. (November 16, 2006). [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6497584 "Nobel-Winning Economist Milton Friedman Dies"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235039/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6497584 |date=March 3, 2016 }}. National Public Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stamberg was also the first host of the long-running [[PBS]] arts series, ''[[Alive from Off Center]]'', hosting from 1985 to 1986.

==Personal life==
The mother of actor [[Josh Stamberg]], Stamberg was married to Louis C. Stamberg, who died on October 9, 2007. During a career with the [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] Louis Stamberg worked as a program officer and spent more than two years at the USAID mission in New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Patricia (October 10, 2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20121103094704/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/09/AR2007100902166.html "Obituaries"].

'''Terry Louise Fisher''' (born February 21, 1946) is an [[Americans|American]] former TV screenwriter and producer. During her career, she won three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s from seven nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.emmys.com/bios/terry-louise-fisher|title=Terry Louise Fisher|website=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences|Television Academy]]|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Fisher was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and attended [[UCLA School of Law]] in 1968. She later worked for the Los Angeles District Attorney's office and moved from that into Entertainment Law.  While a [[Los Angeles]] lawyer, Fisher wrote two novels, both published by the [[Warner Publishing Company]]. The first, entitled ''A Class Act'', was published in 1976. The second, entitled ''Good Behavior'', was published in 1979. Both are no longer in print. After ten years in the law field, Fisher decided to pursue her true passion of writing full-time and quit practicing law.

==Television career==

===Early years===
She began her television career as a writer and producer for the [[CBS]] police procedural ''[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]'' in 1982. Between 1983 and 1987, she wrote for other series and [[television films]]. In 1985, she left ''Cagney &amp; Lacey'', but returned many years later for the series' reunion films ''Cagney and Lacey: The Return'' (1994) and ''Cagney and Lacey: Together Again'' (1995), both of which she co-wrote.

===''L.A. Law''===
Fisher's most notable series was ''[[L.A. Law]]'', which she co-created with producer [[Steven Bochco]]. She served as a supervising producer and writer for many of the series early episodes. Her writing for the series won her a shared Primetime Emmy Award in 1987, and two additional shared nominations in 1988.

In 1988, a legal battle with Steven Bochco led to her departure from the series, when a negotiation for her to take over Bochco's role as the series' executive producer failed, and she was banned from the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/terry-louise-fisher|title=Articles about Terry Louise Fisher|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, she had also co-created the comedy-drama series ''[[Hooperman]]'' with Bochco in 1987. The series starred [[John Ritter]] and ran for two seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

===Post-''L.A. Law''===
Fisher wrote the 1992 short-lived summer series ''[[2000 Malibu Road]]'', which was produced by [[Aaron Spelling]] and directed by [[Joel Schumacher]]. She later took part in the production of a highly anticipated primetime soap opera pilot, entitled ''Daughters of Eve'', which was to star [[Sophia Loren]] and premiere during the [[1995-96 United States network television schedule|1995-1996 television season]]. However, the series was not picked up.

'''''The Burial of the Sardine''''' (Spanish: ''El entierro de la sardina'') is an oil-on-panel painting by [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Francisco Goya]], usually dated to the 1810s. The title is posthumous, referring to the [[Burial of the Sardine|culminating event]] of a three-day [[carnival]] in Madrid ending on [[Ash Wednesday]].  Masked and disguised revellers are seen dancing their way to the banks of the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]], where a ceremonial sardine will be buried. Goya does not illustrate the fish in the painting, nor the large doll made of straw, called a ''pelele'', from which it hung;&lt;!-- are you sure that the pelele isn't the fish? Nowadays it is a figure of a fish rather than an actual sardine//er, yup!--&gt; the centrepiece is the darkly grinning "King of the Carnival".

The painting has been dated between 1793 and 1819, but most accounts place it toward the end of this range on account of the painting's style and its place within the shifting themes of Goya's art as he aged. ''The Burial'' appears to fit within a progression beginning with the artist's bright, youthful works—in which he painted commissions of popular entertainments and colourful [[List of Francisco Goya's tapestry cartoons|cartoon tapestries]]—and his much later, psychologically darker [[Black Paintings]].  The  painting is certainly a tribute to the common people, depicting an exuberant crowd carousing on the first day of [[Lent]] while other [[History of Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spanish Catholics]] worship at church. Yet the celebration takes on a sinister aspect due to the many masked and blank faces (see the detail in "Gallery") surrounding the gaily dancing women in white; the grey, distorted trees and encroaching dark colours; and the eye-catching black banner that parades an unsettling mascot. Such festivals as the "Burial of the Sardine" originated with themes of mortality: masks were worn to ward off the spirits of criminals and those who had died violently. The word "mortus" ("death") is barely visible on the banner though in a preparatory ink sketch by Goya (in the gallery below) it features prominently over an indistinct shape which may be a representation of the sardine itself. The painting forms a loose thematic set with other paintings of religious ceremony that Goya produced around the same time, among which are ''[[A Procession of Flagellants]]'' (''Procesión de disciplinantes'') and ''[[The Inquisition Tribunal|Inquisition Scene]]'' (''Auto de fe de la Inquisición'').

Goya scholar Fred Licht writes:

:[''The Burial of the Sardine''] is also one of the most astonishing virtuoso performances to come down to us from Goya's brush. Rarely did Goya again reach such decisiveness of touch. Every brushstroke is a calligraphic marvel at the same time that it describes with consummate precision the expression of faces and the emotional charge of each stance or gesture. We have arrived here at the perfect balancing point between the early tapestry cartoons and the later Black Paintings. All the riotous gaiety of the former appeals to the eye from the surface of the painting. But in the darkening of the colors, in the masklike ambiguity of the faces... and especially in the overwrought gestures and expressions, one begins to feel the obscurely disturbing undertones of mass hysteria underlying the fiesta.&lt;ref&gt;Licht, Fred. ''Goya: The Origin of the Modern Temper in Art'', Abbeville Press; p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Distrest Poet''''' is an [[oil painting]] produced sometime around 1736 by the British artist [[William Hogarth]]. Reproduced as an [[etching]] and [[engraving]], it was published in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs p.78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulson (Vol. 2) p.165&lt;/ref&gt; The scene was probably inspired by [[Alexander Pope]]'s [[satire|satirical]] poem ''[[The Dunciad]]''.  It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet sits at his desk in the dormer and, scratching his head, stares at the papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing.  Near him sits his wife darning clothes, surprised by the entrance of a milkmaid, who impatiently demands payment of debts.

== Background ==
[[Image:Enraged musician.jpg|right|thumb|''The Enraged Musician''.]]
The engraving of ''The Distrest Poet'' in its third state was issued on 15 December 1741 as a companion piece to ''[[The Enraged Musician]]'', a comic scene of a violinist driven to distraction by the noise from the street outside his practice room. The initial plate for ''The Distrest Poet'' was produced soon after Hogarth had completed the oil painting, but the third state plate was not completed until late in 1740 at which time Hogarth advertised his intention to issue a three-image set: ''The Provok'd Musician'', ''The Distrest Poet'', and a third image on the subject of "Painting". ''The Provok'd Musician'' (renamed ''The Enraged Musician'') was produced in 1741 but the third image was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Picture ==
[[Image:The distrest poet.jpg|right|thumb|The third state print, completed in 1740 and issued in 1741, featured a different bill above the poet's head.]]
The scene is set in a small and messy [[garret]], sparsely furnished by a few pieces of crude furniture.  The room is poorly kept, with cracking plaster, a broken window and uneven floor, and a bare cupboard. In this way, Hogarth underlines the desperate circumstances of the occupants and the poverty of the family.

Starved of inspiration and suffering [[writer's block]], the poet sits on the end of his bed in his night gown, quill in hand, scratching his head.  A copy of [[Edward Bysshe (writer)|Edward Bysshe]]'s ''The Art of English Poetry'', a guide to composition published in 1702, lies open on the table. A copy of Popes's satirical ''[[Grub Street Journal]]'' lies on the floor near his feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.ci.uc.pt/pessoal/mportela/arslonga/MPENSAIOS/a_portrait_of_the_author.htm|title=A Portrait of the Author as an Author|author=Manuel Portela|accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few feet to his right sits his wife, darning the clothes on her lap and those sprawled on the floor, where a cat sits, while a crying infant, who is upset and hungry, goes unattended in the only bed. Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals the last of the family's food from a plate.

Other, less obvious, elements of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled "Upon Riches", which suggests that the poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry.&lt;ref&gt;Postmus p.256&lt;/ref&gt; Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was ''The Poet's Ramble After Riches'', which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture.&lt;ref name="Hallett"/&gt; Earlier impressions showed the poem as "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting on the chair in the back of the room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/hogarth_william_thedistrestpoet.htm |title=William Hogarth – The Distrest Poet|accessdate=8 January 2007|publisher=ArtOfThePrint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.&lt;ref name="Hallett" /&gt;

=== Alexander Pope ===
[[Image:Pope-Alexander.png|thumb|right|upright|Hogarth reproduced this image of "Pope Alexander" in the painting, but whether his intention was to mock Pope or Pope's opponents is unclear. By the time the print was issued, the image of Pope had been removed.]]
The scene shown in ''The Distrest Poet'' was probably inspired by [[Alexander Pope]]'s satirical poem ''[[The Dunciad]]'', most likely by the prefatory matter of the second version, the ''Dunciad Variorum'' which had been published in 1735, and in which Pope confirmed his authorship of the original. The painting and early states of the print included a quotation from Pope's work:
{{quote|
Studious he sate, with all his books around,&lt;br/&gt;
Sinking from thought to thought, a vast profound:&lt;br/&gt;
Plunged for his sense, but found no bottom there;&lt;br/&gt;
Then wrote and flounder'd on, in mere despair.}}
The bill stuck to the wall above the poet's head originally featured a reference to Pope in which he was punningly mocked as "His Holiness Pope Alexander", depicted as an ape wearing a [[papal tiara]] with an ass as his Prime Minister. The initial states of the print kept the quotation but replaced the genuine bill with a representation (which appears to have been entirely invented by Hogarth rather than copied from a real bill) of Pope clashing with [[Edmund Curll]] over the unauthorised publication of the poet's correspondence. Although Hogarth and Pope had never met, this literary inspiration led to speculation as to the identity of Hogarth's poet as one of the targets of Pope's satire. [[Ned Ward]], the author of ''[[The London Spy]]'' was a strong contender,&lt;ref name="Hallett"&gt;Hallett p.137&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Lewis Theobald]], to whom the lines quoted from Pope in Hogarth's original print referred.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson (Vol. 2) pp.119–20&lt;/ref&gt; 

How far Hogarth sympathised with Pope is questionable. The original bill mocked him, but it featured in an image that, at the least, poked fun at the poor poet who was the subject. Hogarth may have been suggesting either that poet was showing contempt for Pope or that he placed Pope's image above his head as a model to which to aspire. In the second image, which shows Pope and Curll locked in battle, it is not clear who has the upper hand, and by the time the print was issued the direct reference to Pope had been removed completely. [[Ronald Paulson]], the preeminent modern authority on Hogarth, suggests that Hogarth would have viewed Pope, through his Roman Catholicism, as having been implicitly tied to the continental influences that Hogarth despised, and would have seen Pope's refusal to accept the patronage of the great men of the time, while still cultivating them as friends and still reaping the rewards they had to offer, as hypocritical. Pope was part of the circle that included [[William Kent]] and [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]] who had displaced Hogarth's father-in-law [[James Thornhill]] from commissions, and Hogarth also had ties to Lewis Theobald, a possible target of the satire, through illustrations he had produced for Theobald's ''Perseus and Andromeda'', and through his subscription to Theobald's edition of the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Paulson suggests that the real "villain" of ''The Distrest Poet'' may be Pope, unseen but representing the successful "Great Poet" whom the deluded aspiring artist hopes to emulate, rather than the distressed poet himself.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson (Vol. 2) pp.120–22&lt;/ref&gt;  Hogarth had featured Pope picking [[John Gay]]'s pocket in the foreground of ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'', an early print he had produced on the theme of the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] (both Pope and Gay had invested money in the scheme).&lt;ref&gt;Wharton p.191&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, within the satire of the painting, the poet who is distressed is going to be one of Pope's [[dunce]]s.  

The lines by Pope, though referring to Theobald, the hero of ''The Dunciad'', are a characterisation of a [[Grub Street]] hack, a stereotype popular in the 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/hogarth/rooms/room5.shtm|title=Hogarth – Room 5|publisher=Tate Online|accessdate=8 January 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209045218/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/hogarth/rooms/room5.shtm|archivedate=9 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the particular scribbler depicted in the painting would be one of this fraternity of "witlings" who banded together to protest Pope's poem. In this context it would make sense, therefore, for the ''poet'' to have the scabrous anti-Pope print, or an emblem of Pope's fight with the hack writers' patron, above him. Just as Moll Hackabout has a picture of  [[Macheath]] on her wall in ''[[A Harlot's Progress]],'' this aspiring and witless poet would have a picture of his hero, Edmund Curll, and an anti-Pope print. The emblem, in other words, identifies the poet's "side" in the battle between dunces and men of wit.

Hogarth was well acquainted with the struggles of the Grub Street hack though, through the travails of his own father, Richard, who had been unable to make a living as writer and had eventually ended up at the [[Fleet Prison]] as a bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson (Vol. 1) p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to the dunce struggling with his rhymes. Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, posits that the gradual alteration of the prints above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.&lt;ref&gt;Uglow pp.29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Geographer''''' is a painting created by Dutch artist [[Johannes Vermeer]] in 1668–1669, and is now in the collection of the [[Städelsches Kunstinstitut]] museum in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. It is closely related to Vermeer's ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'', for instance using the same model in the same dress, and has sometimes been considered a [[pendant painting]] to it. A 2017 study indicated that the canvas for the two works came from the same bolt of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johnson, C.

==Description==
[[File:JohannesVermeer-TheAstronomer(1668).jpg|thumb|left|150px|''The Astronomer'' has been considered a pendant to ''The Geographer'']]

This is one of only three paintings Vermeer signed and dated (the other two are ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' and ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'').

The geographer, dressed in a Japanese-style robe then popular among scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Wheelock (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; is shown to be "someone excited by intellectual inquiry", with his active stance, the presence of maps, charts, a globe and books, as well as the dividers he holds in his right hand, according to Arthur Wheelock Jr. "The energy in this painting [...] is conveyed most notably through the figure's pose, the massing of objects on the left side of the composition, and the sequence of diagonal shadows on the wall to the right."&lt;ref name=awjvtcw&gt;Wheelock (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vermeer made several changes in the painting that enhance the feeling of energy in the picture: the man's head was originally in a different position to the left of where the viewer now sees it, indicating the man perhaps was looking down, rather than peering out the window; the dividers he holds in his hand were originally vertical, not horizontal; a sheet of paper was originally on the small stool at the lower right, and removing it probably made that area darker.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

Details of the man's face are slightly blurred, suggesting movement (also a feature of Vermeer's ''[[Mistress and Maid]]''), according to Serena Carr. His eyes are narrowed, perhaps squinting in the sunlight or an indication of intense thinking. Carr asserts that the painting depicts a "flash of inspiration" or even "revelation". The drawn curtain on the left and the position of the oriental carpet on the table&amp;mdash;pushed back&amp;mdash;are both symbols of revelation. "He grips a book as if he's about to snatch it up to corroborate his ideas."&lt;ref name=scvahw&gt;Cant (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt, Faust.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Faust depicted in an etching by [[Rembrandt]] (c. 1650). Faust, also a scholar, is depicted in the same pose as ''The Geographer'', although facing in roughly the opposite direction.]]

The globe was published in Amsterdam in 1618 by [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt; Terrestrial and celestial globes were commonly sold together, and the celestial globe in ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' "was also a Hondius (Hendrick rather than Judocus)", another indication that the two paintings were created as pendant pieces, according to Cant. The globe is turned toward the Indian Ocean, where the [[Dutch East India Company]] was then active. Vermeer used an impasto technique to apply [[pointillé]] dots, not to indicate light reflected more strongly on certain points but to emphasize the dull ochre cartouche "frame" printed on the globe. Since the globe can be identified, we know the decorative cartouche includes a plea for information for future editions&amp;mdash;reflecting the theme of revelation in the painting.&lt;ref name=scvahw/&gt;

[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|150px|thumb|left|Vermeer's possible model, [[Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek]], painted two decades later by [[Jan Verkolje]]]]

The cartographic objects surrounding the man are some of the actual items a geographer would have: the globe, the dividers the man holds, a cross-staff (hung on the center post of the window), used to measure the angle of celestial objects like the sun or stars, and the chart the man is using, which (according to one scholar, James A. Welu) appears to be a nautical chart on vellum. The sea chart on the wall of "all the Sea coasts of Europe" has been identified as one published by [[Willem Jansz Blaeu]]. This accuracy indicates Vermeer had a source familiar with the profession. ''The Astronomer'', which seems to form a pendant with this painting, shows a similar, sophisticated knowledge of cartographic instruments and books, and the same young man modeled for both. That man himself may have been the source of Vermeer's correct display of surveying and geographical instruments, and possibly of his knowledge of perspective.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt; 

Wheelock and others assert the model/source was probably [[Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632-1723), a contemporary of Vermeer who was also born in Delft. The families of both men were in the textile business, and both families had a strong interest in science and optics. A "microscopist", van Leeuwenhoek was described after his death as being so skilled in "navigation, astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, and natural science ... that one can certainly place him with the most distinguished masteres of the art." Another image of van Leeuwenhoek (by the Delft artist [[Jan Verkolje]]) about 20 years later shows a broad face and straight nose, similar to Vermeer's model. At the time Vermeer painted the two works, the scientist would have been about 36 years old. He would have been actively studying for his examination for surveyor, which he passed on February 4, 1669. There is no documentary evidence for any kind of relationship between the two men during Vermeer's lifetime, although in 1676, van Leeuwenhoek was appointed a trustee for Vermeer's estate.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

The pose of the figure in Vermeer's painting "takes up precisely the position of [[Faust]] in [[Rembrandt]]'s famous etching" (although facing the opposite direction), according to [[Lawrence Gowing]]. Similar arrangements can be found in drawings by [[Nicolaes Maes]].&lt;ref&gt;Gowing (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance and exhibitions==
[[File:The Geographer.jpg|thumb|150px|A less-detailed image of the painting, with more accurate coloring]]
[[File:Catalogus of naamlyst van schilderyen, met derzelven pryzen p 242.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1720 catalog listing the work.]]
For much of the painting's early history (until 1797), it was owned together with ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'', which it strongly resembles, and the two have long been considered pendants, although their measurements are not identical. The paintings were not among the works in the Dissius sale of 1696, a collection apparently originally owned by the artist's supposed patron, [[Pieter van Ruijven]], and the earliest record of the painting is from 1713. Up until the late 18th century, they were referred to as "Astrologers". The pair were sold by an anonymous owner together in Rotterdam on April 27, 1713 (No. 10 or 11), for 300 florins (a "considerable sum", according to Wheelock). [[Hendrik Sorgh]], an art broker, may have bought the paintings at that point. They were among his effects when he died in 1720, and both were sold on March 28 of that year in Amsterdam (No. 3 or 4 in the sale; for 160 florins; described as "An Astrologer" and "a repeat"). Govert Looten, a neighbor of Sorgh at the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam bought the paintings, which were sold from his estate on March 31, 1729 (this painting was No. 6 and went for 104 florins, both were described in the catalog as "sublimely and artfully painted"). Jacob Crammer Simmonsz of Amsterdam (1725-1778) owned the pair before 1778, hanging them in his home on the Prinsengracht (Simonsz also owned ''[[The Lacemaker (Vermeer)|The Lacemaker]]'' and another Vermeer, now unknown, depicting a lady pouring wine). He sold ''The Astronomer'' and ''The Geographer'' together on November 25 of that year to a Huguenot banker, Jean Etiènne Fizeaux of Amsterdam, who owned ''The Geographer'' until his death in 1780. His widow owned the work until perhaps 1785. As of 1794 it was owned by Jan Danser Nijman of Amsterdam, who sold it on August 16, 1797 to Christiaan Josi, a publisher of prints, for 133 guilders. It later was bought by Arnoud de Lange of Amsterdam. This transaction separated the two paintings. De Lange sold it on December 12, 1803 for 360 florins.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt; 

Sometime before 1821, the painting was owned by Johann Goll van Franckenstein Jr. of Velzen and Amsterdam. Pieter Hendrick Goll van Franckenstein of Amsterdam owned it before 1832, and he sold it on July 1, 1833 for 195 florins to a Nieuwenhuys. It was owned by Alexandre Dumont of Cambrai before 1860, who sold it through Thoré-Bũrger to Isaac Pereire of Paris, who owned it by 1866. It was sold on March 6, 1872. Max Kann of Paris owned the painting, perhaps that year, and it passed into the hands of Prince Demidoff of [[Demidov Collection|San Donato]], near Florence, sometime before 1877, and stayed in his hands until he sold it on March 15, 1880. A.J. Bosch sold the painting in Vienna on April 28, 1885 (for Õs 8,000) to a Kohlbacher, who sold it to the Stãdelsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

The work was exhibited in the ''Exposition rétrospective, Tableaux anciens empruntés aux galeries particulières'' held at the Palais des Champs-Elysées, Paris, 1866 ; at the exhibition of ''Ouvrages de peinture exposés au profit de la colonisation de l'Algérie par les Alsaciens-Lorrains'', Palais de la Présidence du Corps législatif, Paris, 1874 ; and in the ''Vermeer, oorsprong en involved. Fabritius, de Hooch, de Witte'' exhibition at the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam, 1935.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

It is [[Aarne–Thompson]] type 1362.&lt;ref name="ashliman"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
A merchant returns home after an absence of two years to find his wife with a newborn son. She explains one snowy day she swallowed a snowflake while thinking about her husband which caused her to conceive. Pretending to believe, he raises the boy with her until he takes the boy on a trip and sells him into [[slavery]].

'''Urbane Künste Ruhr''' (Urban Arts Ruhr) is a cultural institution established in the aftermath of [[Ruhr.2010]], the [[European Capital of Culture]]. It realizes artistic productions in urban spaces of the [[Ruhr]]. Led by architect and curator [[Katja Aßmann]], Urbane Künste Ruhr will initiate and implement projects in urban spaces, temporary architectural structures, urban interventions, and artistic research projects in the period from 2012 to 2014. The mandate of Urbane Künste Ruhr is to develop cooperations with artists and scholars from various disciplines in order to create new cultural, political, and social strategies for metropolitan areas.

== Projects ==
Urbane Künste Ruhr contributes periodically to the international music and arts festival [[Ruhrtriennale]].&lt;ref&gt;In 2012 this contribution was conceived by the Canadian-Mexican artist [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]], the light installation Pulse Park, located in former industrial area.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside these projects, Urbane Künste Ruhr generates programs within the three overall categories "Mobile Laboratories", "Regional Interventions", and "Strategies for the Region". The labs are considered to be a “research department” of the Ruhr metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;See website [http://www.urbanekuensteruhr.de Urban Arts Ruhr]&lt;/ref&gt; Curated by Urbane Künste Ruhr, the labs research the urban space of the Ruhr with artistic means on an equal footing with scientific means.

Other projects connected with the second and third programmatic field aim at recent infrastructural ventures of the region, such as the renaturation project for the river [[Emscher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.emscherkunst.de/news/news.html?L=1 |title=Website EMSCHERKUNST |access-date=2012-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203122736/http://www.emscherkunst.de/news/news.html?L=1 |archive-date=2012-02-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highway [[Ruhrschnellweg]]. The latter was already the scene for artistic productions and interventions during Ruhr.2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.b1a40.de/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Network Approach ==
Beyond programmatic and curatorial activities Urbane Künste Ruhr is assigned to administer the existing cultural networks in the metropolitan area. The vast creative potentials of the artists working in the region as well as the multitude of significant modern art museums (e.g. [[Museum Folkwang]], [[Museum Küppersmühle]], [[Lehmbruck Museum]] etc.) joined forces in different networks (e.g. RuhrKunstMuseen, KunstVereineRuhr, "Starke Orte"). Urbane Künste Ruhr promotes these agglomerations by supporting them with infrastructure, marketing, and PR. The institution also encourages the development of new affiliations in the cultural sector.

== Partner Institutions ==
A lot of the projects of Urbane Künste Ruhr are co-productions with partner institutions, such as Regionalverband Ruhr, Emschergenossenschaft, [[Schauspielhaus Bochum]], [[ETH Zurich]],  PACT Zollverein, [[Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts]], Ringlokschuppen Mülheim, and many more.

== Artists ==
Urbane Künste Ruhr works together with artists like [[Daniel Buren]], [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]], [[rAndom International]], [[Haubitz + Zoche]], and many other.

[[File:Vasateatern 2009a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vasateatern]]
'''Vasateatern''' or ''"Vasan"'' (in [[English language|English]]: ''The Vasa Theatre'') is a private [[theatre]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. It is located at [[Vasagatan, Stockholm|Vasagatan]] 19–21 in central Stockholm.

It was built in 1886 and has for many years been [[Stockholm]]'s (and [[Sweden]]'s) main private theatre for [[comedy|comedies]] and [[farce]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In this genre it has a proud history: it was for many years (1895–1928) run by the legendary Swedish theatre manager [[Albert Ranft]] who in the early 20th century staged a large number of [[France|French]] and [[UK|British]] comedy plays. He had personal contact with many of the most popular European comedy playwrights at the time, including [[George Bernard Shaw]], and successfully had a great number of contemporary comedy plays translated and staged in Sweden at "Vasan". Plays such as [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]] (Mr Ernst)'', Shaw's ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]] (Man kan aldrig veta)'' and ''[[Major Barbara (play)|Major Barbara]]'', and ''[[Jack Straw (play)|Jack Straw]]'' by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. Popular [[France|French]] playwrights at the theatre included [[Georges Feydeau]], [[Georges Berr]] and [[Nancy Rieux|Nancy]] &amp; [[Jean Rieux]]. Strindberg was also produced at the Vasateatern.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Michael. Editor. ''An International Annotated Bibliography of Strindberg Studies 1870–2005: The plays''.

Over the years it has produced most of the classic farces and comedies. Historic long-runners from the 1950s to the 1980s include ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'', the stage version of ''[[Cactus Flower (play)|Cactus Flower]]'' and ''[[The Spanish Fly (play)|The Spanish Fly]] (Die spanische Fliege)'', the popular 1914 German farce by [[Franz Arnold]] and [[Ernst Bach]].

Legendary [[Sweden|Swedish]] thespian [[Gösta Ekman (senior)]] is said to haunt the theatre at nights.&lt;ref&gt;http://shelf3d.com/i/G%C3%B6sta%20Ekman%20(senior)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre closed in 2009 in connection with an extensive renovation in the neighbourhood that was transformed into Scandic Grand Central Hotel. Large parts of the interior of the theatre was taken down while the auditorium was used as a dump during the construction. Parts of the theatre's former premises have been occupied by the hotel business. For example, the theatre cafe integrated with the hotel and converted into the bistro. After the property is sold by the developer Diligentia to Norwegian KLP Eiendom the plans for the theatre are unclear and the theatre operations remained dormant. Because of monument protection the location must be preserved. The beautiful auditorium is preserved, but as of 2012 there were no theatre shows in production.

The '''VroniPlag Wiki''' is a [[wiki]] started 28 March 2011 at [[Wikia]] that examines and documents the extent of [[plagiarism]] in German doctoral [[theses]].

== History ==
Following the [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg#Doctorate plagiarism|revocation of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg's doctoral degree]], the VroniPlag Wiki adopted the idea of the [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg#Effect of Guttenplag|GuttenPlag Wiki]]. VroniPlag is named after the first thesis documented in it, the thesis submitted by Veronica Saß, daughter of German politician [[Edmund Stoiber]]. "Vroni" is a nickname in German for "Veronica".

== Modus operandi ==
Publication of a thesis consists of an overview that contains a "bar code" visualizing the amount of plagiarism, the exact bibliographic information of the theses (and if online, a link) and then a page overview that links to the fragments of plagiarism found on the page. Each fragment is classified as to the kind of plagiarism and must be verified by a second person before it is acceptable. Interesting parts are linked to separately and there is a final report published when the group feels the work is done.

[[File:Mm plag graphic.png|thumb|Visualization of the findings proved to be a key factor for the reception &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimme-institut.de/html/index.php?id=1122#c8529|title=GuttenPlag Wiki Grimme Online Award 2011|work=jury statement (in German)|accessdate=2012-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625105629/http://www.grimme-institut.de/html/index.php?id=1122#c8529|archive-date=2011-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

VroniPlag Wiki only publishes text parallel documentation openly with names of the authors on theses that have been found to contain serious plagiarism. Before publication, the office of academic integrity at the university in question is formally notified, as any revocation of title must be done by the university.

In addition to looking at dissertations, the text parallels in one habilitation and one book how to write scientifically.

== Current cases ==
As of February 2016, 152 dissertations, 8 habilitations, 1 master's thesis, and 1 book on scientific writing have been examined in detail on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VroniPlag overview|url=http://de.vroniplag.wikia.com/wiki/%C3%9Cbersicht|accessdate=2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first seven were:

Most of the plagiarism allegations made by VroniPlag led to investigations by the responsible universities, and some have resulted in the revocation of the [[Academic degree|degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VroniPlag Wiki – Overview of degree revocations|url=http://de.vroniplag.wikia.com/wiki/%C3%9Cbersicht|accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these revocations have held up in court. However, some universities disagreed with VroniPlag finding, even in cases of blatant plagiarism (between 40 and 70% of pages affected with plagiarism). The correct methods for dealing with plagiarism—and its prevention—remains an ongoing discussion in Germany.
[[File:Zedler-Preis 2012-4718.jpg|thumb|Awarding of the "Zedler-Preis für freies Wissen 2012" by [[Wikimedia Germany]] on July 1, 2012]]

Prominent cases of plagiarism continue to surface in Germany. At the University of Münster, a text book on scientific writing for lawyers was found to contain massive plagiarism. Ironically, even the chapter on plagiarism was plagiarized. While the book told students not to use Wikipedia, the book itself contained 18 text fragments from the German Wikipedia. The dissertations of two of the book's authors, who received their doctorates at Münster University, were found to show extreme text parallels.

VroniPlag was the first [[Crowdsourcing|crowd sourcing]] phenomenon of its kind in Germany that has been referred to as an authoritative source in all major media channels in Germany. The plagiarism investigation project has triggered an extensive nationwide discussion about plagiarism and what represents appropriate consequences for plagiarists and universities. The project was awarded the Zedler Prize for Free Knowledge in the category External Knowledge Project of the year 2011 by the German Wikimedia on July 1, 2012.

Since September 2015, Minister of Defence [[Ursula von der Leyen]]'s thesis is under formal investigation by her university after the wiki alleged plagiarism on more than 40% of its pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ursula von der Leyen als Exempel?|url=http://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/ursula-von-der-leyen-als-exempel-1.18625015|website=NZZ|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">The '''World Architecture Survey''' was conducted in 2010 by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', to determine the most important works of [[contemporary architecture]]. 52 leading architects, teachers, and critics, including several [[Pritzker Prize]] winners and deans of major architecture schools were asked for their opinion.

The survey asked two questions:&lt;ref name="VF Results"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanity Fair’s World Architecture Survey: the Complete Results |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-list-201008 |accessdate=22 July 2010 |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=30 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108161337/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-list-201008 |archivedate=November 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#What are the five most important buildings, bridges, or monuments constructed since 1980?
#What is the greatest work of architecture thus far in the 21st century?

While the range of responses was very broad, more than half of the experts surveyed named the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] by [[Frank Gehry]] as one of the most important works since 1980.  The [[Beijing National Stadium]] (Bird’s Nest stadium) in [[Beijing]] by [[Herzog and de Meuron]] was the building most often cited, by seven respondents, as the most significant structure of the 21st century so far.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-slideshow-201008?currentPage=13 Architecture’s Modern Marvels]&lt;/ref&gt; Counted by architect, works by Frank Gehry received the most votes, followed by those of [[Rem Koolhaas]]. The result of the survey led ''Vanity Fair'' to label Gehry as "the most important architect of our age".&lt;ref name="VF Tyrnauer 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyrnauer|first=Matt|title=Architecture in the Age of Gehry|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-201008?currentPage=all|accessdate=22 July 2010|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

===Most important works since 1980===
The respondents named a total of 132 different structures when asked to indicate the five most important buildings, monuments, and bridges completed since 1980.

==Criticism==
Writing for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Blair Kamin criticized the "self-aggrandizing" survey for not including any [[green buildings]].&lt;ref name="Kamin 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kamin|first=Blair|title=The blind spot in Vanity Fair's world architecture survey: green design |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/theskyline/2010/07/the-blind-spot-in-vanity-fairs-world-architecture-survey.html|accessdate=22 July 2010|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Lance Hosey]] of ''Architect'' magazine conducted an alternate survey of leading green building experts and found that no buildings appeared on both lists, suggesting that standards of "good design" and "green design" are misaligned.&lt;ref name="Hosey 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hosey|first=Lance|title=The G List |url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/the-g-list_o|accessdate=28 July 2010|magazine=Architect|date=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators also noted that several of the architects surveyed (but not Gehry)&lt;ref name="Culture Monster"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ng|first=David|title=Frank Gehry's Bilbao museum tops Vanity Fair architecture list|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/06/frank-gehrys-bilbao-museum-tops-vanity-fair-architecture-list.html|work=[[Culture Monster]]|publisher=[[LA Times]]|accessdate=22 July 2010|date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "perhaps took the magazine’s title a little too seriously" and voted for their own buildings.&lt;ref name="Winston 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Winston|first=Anna|title=Vanity Fair reveals vanity voting behind list of best modern buildings|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/vanity-fair-reveals-vanity-voting-behind-list-of-best-modern-buildings/5002211.blog|accessdate=22 July 2010|newspaper=[[Building Design (newspaper)|Building Design]]|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glick Kudler  2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glick Kudler |first=Adrian|title=Bilbao Wins, But Which Architects Nominated Themselves to Vanity Fair List?|url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2010/06/bilbao_wins_but_which_architects_nominated_themselves_to_vanity_fair_list.php|accessdate=22 July 2010|newspaper=[[Curbed (blog)|Curbed]]|date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4974">'''You can click, but you can't hide''' is a propaganda campaign run jointly by several international associations, most notably the [[Motion Picture Association|MPA]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], and the [[Gesellschaft zur Verfolgung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen e.V.|GVU]], as part of the larger ''"Respect Copyrights"'' campaign against [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] of [[motion pictures]]. The associations have long alleged that Internet file sharing, or maintaining a file sharing tracker, network or [[search engine]], constitutes [[copyright infringement]] because the practice hurts their profits.

The phrase is an adaptation of the phrase "You can run but you can't hide," a statement attributed to American boxer [[Joe Louis]]. The "Illegal Downloading: Inappropriate for all ages" campaign logo is based on the [[MPAA]] Rating System logos.

In addition to a print and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] campaign, [[BitTorrent tracker]] websites closed between October 2004 and May 2005 due to legal action by the associations have replaced their front page with the campaign's logo and an accompanying message:

''There are websites that provide legal downloads. This is not one of them. This website has been permanently shut down by court order because it facilitates the illegal downloading of copyrighted motion pictures. The illegal downloading of motion pictures robs thousands of honest, hard-working people of their livelihood, and stifles creativity. Illegally downloading movies from sites such as these without proper authorization violates the law, is theft, and is not anonymous. Stealing movies leaves a trail. The only way not to get caught is to stop.''

==LokiTorrent controversy==
The associations have also obtained records from some closed tracker sites, which could be used to trace individual users. The administrator of one such site, [[LokiTorrent]], closed the site and turned over its logs, amidst controversy, as part of a settlement ending a 2005 copyright infringement lawsuit filed by MPAA studios against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4256449.stm |title=Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-[[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] campaign's signature replaced the content of the website upon its shutting down.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lokitorrent.com/ |title=MPAA notice on LokiTorrent website |accessdate=February 10, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210215106/http://www.lokitorrent.com/ |archivedate=February 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other campaigns==
The arresting nature of the graphics, and the use of scare tactics in this campaign is a marked difference from previous large-scale copyright-promotion campaigns such as [[Home Taping is Killing Music]] and [[Who Makes Movies?]], which appealed to the consumer's interest in the art form and the consumer's compassion for movie industry workers. John G. Malcolm, former Senior Vice President and Director of Worldwide Anti-Piracy for the MPAA, has been quoted saying that the goal of the campaign is to "make an example of" internet movie thieves and other pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading_room/room/view_article.asp?name=../articles/MPAA%20you%20can%20click%20but%20you%20cant%20hide.htm|title=Motion Picture Association of America enforces its message 'you can click but you can't hide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former MPAA chief Dan Glickman insisted in a statement to film [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] traders that the MPAA "will find you, and you will be held responsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/68741|title=MPAA Sues Three|date=21 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Update on campaign==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
In 2010 they conducted survey and found out as the years progressed more and more people continued to find more ways and websites to download illegal music. Troels Møller from pro-[[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] group [[:da:Piratgruppen|Piratgruppen]] stated, "The advertising campaigns used to prevent illegal downloads have been a waste of money and have in general been a cop-out from the record industry". He believes that these campaigns are useless and have no real major effect on the daily consumer of music. This scare tactic is not a significant factor and has little to no success for music listeners.
