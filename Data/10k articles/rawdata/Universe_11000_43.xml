The '''1884 Howard, South Dakota tornado''' was a large [[tornado]] that occurred on August 28, 1884, near [[Howard, South Dakota]], which was then part of the [[Dakota Territory]]. 

==Event==
It demolished one farm, located south of [[Bridgewater, South Dakota]]. Four people were killed there and two injured. It was one of an outbreak of four very strong tornadoes in the area that day. Contemporary records and survivors' recollections indicate that the storms were F3 or F4 on the [[Fujita scale]],&lt;ref name=Snow1984/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grazulis |first=Thomas P. |authorlink=Thomas P.

The '''Great Daylight Fireball''' (or '''US19720810''') was an [[Earth-grazing fireball]] that passed within {{convert|57|km|mi ft}} of Earth's surface at 20:29 [[UTC]] on August 10, 1972. It entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of {{convert|15|km/s|mi/s}}&lt;ref name="gsna" /&gt; in daylight over [[Utah]], United States (14:30 local time) and passed northwards leaving the atmosphere over [[Alberta]], Canada. It was seen by many people and recorded on film and by space-borne sensors.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/9806/impact.html Observation of Meteoroid Impacts by Space-Based Sensors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020025037/http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/9806/impact.html |date=2007-10-20 }} [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]], Edward Tagliaferri, 2003, 'It was first detected by satellite at an altitude of about 73 km, tracked as it descended to about 53 km, and then tracked as it climbed back out of the atmosphere', 'object is still in an Earth-crossing orbit around the Sun and passed close to the Earth again in August 1997'&lt;/ref&gt; An eyewitness to the event, located in [[Missoula, Montana]], saw the object pass directly overhead and heard a double sonic boom. The smoke trail lingered in the atmosphere for several minutes.

The atmospheric pass modified the object's mass and orbit around the Sun, but it is probably still in an [[Earth-crosser asteroid|Earth-crossing]] orbit and passed close to Earth again in August 1997.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; 

&lt;!-- what suggestion?: [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s website states that these "suggestions have not been substantiated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public/themes/neo/nea/ |title=Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) |work=IAU–International Astronomical Union |quote=Great Daylight 1972 Fireball (US19720810), Earth-grazing asteroid. Suggestions that this object is still in an Earth crossing orbit around the Sun and passed close to the Earth again in August 1997 have not been substantiated (Spahr, 2010, private communication). |accessdate= 23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Description==
Analysis of its appearance and trajectory showed the object was about 3–14&amp;nbsp;m (10–45&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter, depending on whether it was a [[comet]] made of ices, or a [[carbonaceous chondrite|stony]] and therefore denser [[asteroid]].&lt;ref name="gsna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maa"/&gt; Other sources identified it as an [[Apollo asteroid]] in an [[Earth-crosser asteroid|Earth-crossing orbit]] that would make a subsequent close approach to Earth in August 1997.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; In 1994, Czech astronomer Zdeněk Ceplecha reanalysed the data and suggested the passage would have reduced the asteroid's mass to about a third or half of its original mass (reducing its diameter to {{convert|2|–|10|m|ft}}.)&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050120051405/http://www.maa.agleia.de/Comet/Other/1972.html Daylight Fireball of August 10, 1972] C. Kronberg, Munich Astro Archive, archived summary by Gary W. Kronk of early analysis and of Zdeněk Ceplecha's paper for Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1994, '3 meters, if a carbonaceous chondrite, or as large as 14 meters, if composed of cometary materials', 'post-encounter ... 2 or 10 meters'&lt;/ref&gt;

The object was tracked by military surveillance systems and sufficient data obtained to determine its orbit both before and after its 100-second passage through [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Its velocity was reduced by about {{convert|800|m/s}} and the encounter significantly changed its [[Inclination#Orbits|orbital inclination]] from 15 degrees to 7 degrees.&lt;ref name="gsna"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040307122520/http://www.fis.unipr.it/~albino/ITASN/GSNA/US19720810/US19720810.html US19720810 (Daylight Earth grazer)] Global Superbolic Network Archive, 2000, 'Size: 5 to 10 m'&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The US19720810 meteoroid is described in the preface of the first chapter of [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[The Hammer of God (Clarke novel)|The Hammer of God]]''.

The clip featuring the fireball is shown in the 1994 made-for-TV film ''[[Without Warning (1994 film)|Without Warning]]'', in which it is described as a 500-metre asteroid narrowly missing the Earth by just thousands of feet.

'''Abnormal''' or '''discontinuous grain growth''', also referred to as '''exaggerated''' or '''secondary recrystallisation grain growth''', is a [[grain growth]] phenomenon through which certain energetically favorable grains ([[crystallite]]s) grow rapidly in a [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]] of finer grains resulting in a [[bimodal distribution|bimodal]] grain size distribution.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Kang| first1=S.-J. L. | title= Sintering: Densification, Grain Growth, and Microstructure| publisher= [[Butterworth-Heinemann|Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann]]| year= 2005|isbn = 9780080493077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ceramic materials]] this phenomenon can result in the formation of elongated prismatic, acicular (needle-like) grains in a densified matrix with implications for improved fracture toughness through the impedance of crack propagation.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Padture| first1=N. P.|last2=Lawn|first2=B. R.| title= Toughness properties of a silicon carbide with an in situ induced heterogeneous grain structure | journal= [[J. Am. Ceram. Soc.]]| year=1994| volume=77| pages=2518–2522| doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1994.tb04637.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

Abnormal grain growth (AGG) is encountered in metallic or ceramic systems exhibiting one or more of several characteristics.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hillert| first=M.| title= On the theory of normal and abnormal grain growth| journal= [[Acta Metallurgica]]| year=1965| volume=13| issue=3| pages= 227–238| doi=10.1016/0001-6160(65)90200-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;
# Secondary phase inclusions, precipitates or impurities above a certain threshold concentration.
# High anisotropy in solid/liquid interfacial energy or grain boundary energy (solid/solid) in bulk materials.
# Highly anisotropic surface energy in thin film materials.
# High chemical inequilibrium.

Although many gaps remain in our fundamental understanding of AGG phenomena, in all cases abnormal grain growth occurs as a result of very high local rates of interface migration and is enhanced by the localised formation of liquid at grain boundaries.

== Significance ==

Abnormal grain growth is often recorded as an undesirable phenomenon occurring during the [[sintering]] of ceramic materials as rapidly growing grains may lower the hardness of the bulk material through [[Grain boundary strengthening|Hall Petch type effects]]. However, the controlled introduction of [[dopant]]s to bring about controlled AGG may be used to impart fibre-toughening in ceramic materials. In [[piezoelectric ceramics]] the occurrence of AGG may bring about the degradation of [[Poling (piezoelectricity)|piezoelectric effect]] and thus in these systems AGG is avoided.

== Example systems ==

A ''half-neutralization'' occurs due to the remaining of replaceable [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s from the partial dissociation of weak acids that have not been reacted with [[hydroxide ion]]s (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to create water molecules. Acid salt is an [[ionic compound]] consisted of an anion, contributed from a [[weak acid|weak parent acid]], and a cation, contributed from a [[Strong base|strong parent base]].

==Acidic solution and examples of acid salts==

[[Acid-base]] property of the resulting solution from a neutralization reaction depends on the remaining salt products. A salt containing reactive cations undergo [[hydrolysis]] by which they react with water molecules, causing [[deprotonation]] of the conjugate acids.

==Use in food==
{{main|Baking powder}}
Some acid salts such as sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are used in baking. They are found in baking soda, bread soda or cooking soda and are typically divided into low-temperature (or single-acting) and high-temperature (or double-acting) acid salts.  Common low-temperature acid salts react at room temperature to produce a leavening effect.  They include [[cream of tartar]], [[calcium phosphate]], and [[citrate]]s. High-temperature acid salts produce a leavening effect during baking and are usually [[aluminium]] salts such as [[calcium]] [[aluminium phosphate]].  Some acid salts may also be found in [[non-dairy creamer|non-dairy coffee creamers]]. And also disodium phosphate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is used in foods and monosodium phosphate, NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is used in animal feed, toothpaste and evaporated milk.

==Intensity of acid==
An acid with higher [[Acid dissociation constant|''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'']] value dominates the chemical reaction. It serves as a better contributor of [[proton]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). A comparison between the ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[Base dissociation constant|''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'']] indicates the acid-base property of the resulting solution by which:
:# The solution is acidic if ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''. It contains a greater concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions than concentration of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions due  more extensive of cation hydrolysis compared to that of anion hydrolysis.
:# The solution is alkali if ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''. Anions hydrolyze more than cations, causing an exceeding concentration of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions.
:# The solution is expected to be neutral only if ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymond|first1=Chang|title=Chemistry|date=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Americas, New York|isbn=0077274318|pages=725–727|edition=tenth|url=https://archive.org/details/Chemistry_10th_Edition_Raymond_Chang|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other possible factors that could vary [[pH level]] of a solution are the relevant [[equilibrium constants]] and the additional amounts of any base or acid.
:For example, in [[ammonium chloride]] solution, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the main influence for acidic solution. It has greater ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' value compared to that of water molecules; ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is 5.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; and ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is 1.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt;. This ensures its deprotonation when reacting with water, and is responsible for the ph below 7 at room temperature. Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; will have no [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nor tendency to hydrolyze, as its ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' value is very low (''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' of Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is 7.7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Lower, S.K., (1999).

{{Refimprove|date=October 2013}}

'''Air bearings''' (also known as '''aerostatic''' or '''aerodynamic bearings''') are [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] that use a thin film of pressurized gas to provide a low friction load-bearing interface between surfaces. The two surfaces do not touch, thus avoiding the traditional bearing-related problems of friction, wear, particulates, and [[lubricant]] handling, and offer distinct advantages in precision positioning, such as lacking backlash and static friction, as well as in high-speed applications.{{sfn|Schulz|1999|pp=6}}

A differentiation is made between aerodynamic bearings, which establish the air cushion through the relative motion between static and moving parts, and aerostatic bearings, in which the pressure is being externally inserted.

Gas bearings are being mainly used in precision machinery tools (measuring and processing machines) and high-speed machines (spindle, small-scale turbomachinery, precision gyroscopes).
[[File:Luftgelagerte Hochfrequenz-Bohrspindel mit integriertem Vorschub (mehrfach patentiert).gif|290px|right|Air borne high frequency spindle with integrated feeding]]
[[File:Luftlagerung einer Hochfrequenz-Spindel für das Leiterplattenbohren.jpg|thumb|Air borne high frequency spindle]]

== Gas bearing types ==
Gas-lubricated bearings are classified in two groups, depending on the source of pressurization of the gas film providing the load-carrying capacity:
* '''Aerostatic bearings''': the gas is externally-pressurized (using a compressor or a pressure tank) and injected in the clearance of the bearing. Consequently, aerostatics bearings can sustain a load even in absence of relative motion but require an external gas compression system, which induces costs in terms of complexity and energy.
* '''Aerodynamic bearings''': the gas is pressurized by the relative velocity between the static and moving surfaces in the bearing. Such bearings are self-acting and do not require an external input of compressed gas. However, mechanical contact occurs at zero speed, requiring a particular tribological consideration to avoid premature wear.

Hybrid bearings combining the two families also exist. In such cases, a bearing is typically fed with externally-compressed gas at low speed and then relies partially or entirely on the self-pressurizing effect at higher speeds.

Among these two technological categories, gas bearings are classified depending on the kind of linkage they realize:
* Linear-motion bearings: Support a translation along 1 or 2 directions between two planes
* Journal bearings: Support a rotation between two parts
* Thrust bearings: Block the axial displacement of a rotating part, usually used in combination with journal bearings

The main air bearing types fall under the following categories:
{| class="wikitable"

|}

=== Aerostatic bearings ===

Pressurized gas acts as a lubricant in the gap between bearing moving parts. The gas cushion carries the load without any contact between the moving parts. Normally, the compressed gas is supplied by a compressor. A key goal of supplying the gas pressure in the gap is that the [[stiffness]] and [[damping]] of the gas cushion reaches the highest possible level. In addition, gas consumption and uniformity of gas supply into the gap are crucial for the behaviors of aerostatic bearings.

==== Delivery of gas to the gap ====

Supplying gas to the interface between moving elements of an aerostatic bearing can be achieved in a few different methods:&lt;ref name="Air Bearing Fundamentals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialtycomponents.com/Resources/Technical-Articles/Air-Bearing-Fundamentals/|title=Air Bearing Fundamentals|work=specialtycomponents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Porous Surface
* Partial porous surface
* Discrete orifice feeding
* Slot feeding
* Groove feeding

There is no single best approach to feeding the film.  All methods have their advantages and disadvantages specific to each application.&lt;ref name="Orifice versus Porous Surface Comparison"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialtycomponents.com/Resources/Technical-Articles/Orifice-vs-Porous-Surface-Inlet-Air-Bearings-/|title=Orifice vs. Porous Surface Inlet Air Bearings|work=specialtycomponents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dead volume ====

Dead volumes refer in particular to chambers and canals existing in conventional aerostatic bearings in order to distribute the gas and increase the compressed pressure within the gap. The [[Cavitation|cavity]] inside porous (sintered) gas bearings are also attributed to dead volume.{{sfn|Schulz|1999|pp=14}}

==== Conventional aerostatic bearings ====

[[File:Nozzle-air bearing with chambers and channels.jpg|thumb|Nozzle-air bearing with chambers and channels]]

With conventional single nozzle aerostatic bearings, the compressed air flows through a few relatively large nozzles (diameter 0.1 – 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm) into the bearing gap. The gas consumption thus allows only some flexibility such that the bearing’s features (force, moments, bearing surface, bearing gap height, damping) can be adjusted only insufficiently. However, in order to allow a uniform gas pressure even with only some nozzles, aerostatic bearing manufacturers take constructive techniques. In doing so, these bearings cause dead volumes (non-compressible and thus weak air volume). In effect, this dead volume is very harmful for the gas bearing’s dynamic and causes self-excited vibrations.{{sfn|Schulz|1999|pp=7-8}}

==== Single-nozzle aerostatic bearings ====

The pre-pressured chamber consists of a chamber around the centralized nozzle. Usually, this chamber’s ratio is between 3% and 20% of the bearing’s surface. Even with a chamber depth of 1/100&amp;nbsp;mm, the dead volume is very high. In the worst cases, these air bearings consist of a [[wikt:Special:Search/concave|concave]] bearing surface instead of a chamber. Disadvantages of these air bearings include a very poor tilt stiffness.{{sfn|Schulz|1999|pp=9}}

==== Gas bearings with channels and chambers ====

Typically, conventional aerostatic bearings are implemented with chambers and canals. This design assumes that with a limited amount of nozzles, the dead volume should decrease while distributing the gas within the gap uniformly. Most constructive ideas refer to special canal structures. Since the late 1980s, aerostatic bearings with micro canal structures without chambers are manufactured. However, this technique also has to manage problems with dead volume. With an increasing gap height, the micro canal’s load and stiffness decreases. As in the case of high-speed linear drives or high-frequency spindles, this may cause serious disadvantages.{{sfn|Schulz|1999|pp=11}}

==== Laser drilled Micro-nozzle aerostatic bearings ====

[[File:Cut thru a cylindrical element.jpg|thumb|Cut through a cylindrical element]]
[[File:Laserbearbeitung (Schnitt durch ebenes Lagerelement).jpg|thumb|Laserprocessing (cut through a bearing element)]]
Laser-drilled micro nozzle aerostatic bearings make use of computerized manufacturing and design techniques to optimize performance and efficiency. This technology allows manufacturers more flexibility in manufacturing. In turn this allows a larger design envelope in which to optimize their designs for a given application. In many cases engineers can create air bearings that approach the theoretical limit of performance.
Rather than a few large nozzles, aerostatic bearings with lots of micro nozzles avoid dynamically disadvantageous dead volumes. Dead volumes refer to all cavities in which gas cannot be compressed during decrease of the gap. These appear as weak gas pressure stimulates vibration. Examples of the benefits are: linear drives with accelerations of more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;m/s² (100&amp;nbsp;g), or impact drives with even more than 100,000&amp;nbsp;m/s² (10,000&amp;nbsp;g) due to high damping in combination with dynamic stiffness; sub-nanometer movements due to lowest noise-induced errors; and seal-free transmission of gas or vacuum for rotary and linear drives via the gap due to guided air supply.

Micro-nozzle aerostatic bearings achieve an effective, nearly perfect pressure distribution within the gap with a large number of micro nozzles. Their typical diameter is between 0.02&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.06&amp;nbsp;mm. The narrowest cross-section of these nozzles lies exactly at the bearing’s surface. Thereby the technology avoids a dead volume on the supporting air bearing’s surface and within the area of the air supplying nozzles.

The micro nozzles are automatically drilled with a laser beam that provides top-quality and repeatability. The physical behaviors of the air bearings prove to have a low variation for large as well as for small production volumes. In contrast to conventional bearings, with this technique the air bearings require no manual or costly manufacturing.

The advantages of the micro-nozzle air bearing technology include:
* efficient use of the air cushion (close to the physical limit) through a uniform pressure within the whole gap;
* perfect combination of static and dynamic properties;
* highest-possible flexibility of the air bearing properties: with a particular gap height, it is possible to optimize the air bearing such that it has, for example, a maximum load, stiffness, tilt stiffness, damping, or a minimum air consumption (respectively also in combination with others);
* multi-approved highest precision of all air bearings, e.g. in the measurement technology due to slightest movements (&lt;&lt; 2 nanometer) through physical, lowest-possible self-excited vibrations;
* considerably higher tilt stiffness than conventional air bearings such that the air within the gap flows through canals from the loaded to the unloaded areas away;
* vibration-free within the entire operating range even with high air pressure supply (actually even much more than 10 bar are possible);
* highest reliability due to the large number of nozzles: clogging of nozzles by particles is out of question (no failure in operation) because their diameters are much higher than the gap height;
* possibility to adjust bearing properties for deformation and tolerances of the bearing and opposite surface;
* proven usability for many bearing materials and coatings.

Some of these advantages, such as the high flexibility, the excellent static and dynamic properties in combination, and a low noise excitation, prove to be unique among all other aerostatic bearings.{{sfn|Schulz|Muth|1997|pp=1-9}}{{sfn|Schulz|1999|pp=21-79}}

==== Various designs ====

[[File:Standardlager rund.jpg|thumb|Standard bearing round]]
Standard air bearings are offered with various mountings to link them in a system:
* Bearings for flexible connection with ball-pins. This design for standard air bearings is usually supplied on the market.
* Bearings with a high-stiff joint instead of a conventional ball-pin. Using this version the stiffness of the complete system is significantly higher.
* Bearings with integrated piston for preload of statically determined guidances.
* In addition, there are also rectangular bearings with a fixed mounting (joint-less) for guidances with highest stiffness for highest accuracy or highest dynamic.
* Furthermore, there are also air bearings with integrated [[vacuum]] or magnetic preloads, air bearings for high temperatures with more than 400&amp;nbsp;°C, as well as ones manufactured with alternative materials.{{sfn|Schulz|1999|pp=59-62}} {{sfn|Schulz|Muth|1997|pp=1-9}}

== Advantages and disadvantages of gas-lubricated bearings ==

=== Advantages ===

[[File:Air bearing comparison.png|thumb|Comparison of bearings]]
* Wearless operation, durability. Air bearings operate contact-free and so without [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]]. The only friction results from airflow air in the gap. Thus, the durability of air bearings is unlimited if they are designed and calculated correctly. Especially roller and friction bearings face a high friction when applied at high speed or acceleration or small strokes, causing high abrasion such that the precision decreases which in turn causes a breakdown.
* Guiding, repeatability, and position accuracy. In the chip production and when positioning at the back-end, repeatability accuracy of 1-2&amp;nbsp;µm must be reached with the wire bonder. At the die bonder, even 5&amp;nbsp;µm must be achieved. With such a precision, roller bearings reach their physical limit without a lower acceleration. At the front end (lithography), air bearings are already established.
* Cost advantage and repeatability. When applied in series, gas bearings can have a cost advantage over roller bearings: the production of a roller-guided high-frequency spindle is – according to a manufacturer – about 20% more expensive than air-guided spindles.
* Environmental purity. Because they do not require the use of oil for their lubrication and are frictionless, gas bearings are suited for applications requiring a low contamination of the working fluid. This is a critical aspect to the pharmaceutical industry, nuclear fuel processing, semi-conductor manufacturing and energy conversion cycles.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Self-excited vibration. In journal bearings, self-excited vibration can appear past a given speed threshold, because of the cross-coupled stiffness and low damping of gas lubrication. This vibration can lead to an instability and threaten the gas bearing operation. Precise dynamic computations are required to ensure a safe operation within the desired speed range. This kind of instability is known as "half-speed whirl" and affects particularly the aerodynamic bearings.
* Tight manufacturing tolerances. To ensure a satisfying load-carrying capacity and postpone the appearance of the instability mentioned above, tight tolerances are required in the clearance. Typical clearances ranging from 5&amp;nbsp;µm to 50&amp;nbsp;µm are required for both aerodynamic and aerostatic bearings. Consequently, the manufacturing cost is negatively affected.
* Clean environment. Because of their small clearance, gas-lubricated bearings are sensitive to the presence of particulates and dust in the environment (in the case of aerodynamic bearings) and externally-pressurized gas (aerostatic bearings).

{{sfn|Schulz|1999|pp=63-72}}{{sfn|Bartz|1993|pp=1-26}}

== Theoretical modeling ==

Gas-lubricated bearings are usually modeled using the [[Reynolds equation]] to describe the evolution of pressure in the thin film domain. Unlike liquid-lubricated bearings, the gas lubricant has to be considered as compressible, leading to a non-linear differential equation to be solved.
Numerical methods such as [[Finite difference method]] or [[Finite element method]] are common for the discretization and the resolution of the equation, accounting for the boundary conditions associated to each bearing geometry (linear-motion, journal and thrust bearings). In most cases, the gas film can be considered as isothermal and respecting the ideal gas law, leading to a simplification of the Reynolds equation.

== Examples ==

=== Automotive technology ===

[[File:Luftgelagertes Entfaltsystem für Satelliten Solar Arrays.gif|thumb|Air bearing satellite system for Solar Arrays]]
* Air-guided high-frequency knife drive
Even for movements which cause damage due to disruptive wear with roller bearings, lifetimes of the drive systems are unlimited.
* Air-guided turbo charger
In order to provide confidence and for the first investigations, an initial conversion from a conventional oil-guided turbo charger into air-guided was done. For a real future version, the use of results obtained from high-temperature solutions, mass products (proved production costs) and high-frequency spindles (know-how of dynamic background) will be very helpful.

=== Semiconductor technology ===
* Air bearing for inspection device
In terms of the measurement of wafers and flat panels, it is very important to place the sensor chip precisely and without any contact along the surface. Therefore, the chip is integrated directly into the bearing’s surface. The maximum distance tolerance to the surface which refers to the gap variation of the air bearing, is smaller than 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm. When placing the air bearing with the sensor chip, they must not touch the wafer surface being measured. As for the up-and-down movement, a pneumatic piston is used which is, for repeatability reasons, also air-guided. The preload of the air bearing and thus the gap height are also adjusted with this piston.
* Chuck with integrated lift drive
For the electrical testing of wafers the chuck can be lifted stick-slip-free up to 3&amp;nbsp;mm. The needed contact force for the probe is adjustable and independent from stroke. The lift drive is based on a voice coil motor; the guidance is air-guided. An air-guided pneumatic piston between the chuck and the drive limits the contact force.

=== Linear drives ===
* Precision measurement stage
The filigree structure enables through light measurements for the 300&amp;nbsp;nm chip production with the utmost precision of less than 1&amp;nbsp;nm. In particular, the air bearings are designed for lowest air consumption with the highest stiffness.
* High-accelerated Doppler drive
The High-accelerated Doppler drive supports and guides a carbon fiber mirror (surface 500&amp;nbsp;mm x 250&amp;nbsp;mm) with an acceleration of up to 300&amp;nbsp;m/s² and a flexible movement profile with high precision. The solution consists of an air-guided drive: The beam (length 900&amp;nbsp;mm), which is fixed at the mirror, is manufactured of carbon fibre and carries the magnets of the linear motors. Cables/tubes (motor, air bearing, measurement system) do not move in order to avoid breakages due to high load cycles. The air-bearings are absolutely insensitive against geometric fluctuation as a result of a temperature change.{{sfn|Klement|2009|pp=56-60}}
* Drive for production machine
Beside the performance, the reliability is extremely important for a production machine. The air-guided solution is designed to be statically determined. The iron-core linear motor and piston bearings achieve the preload for the air bearings. Thereby, the drive is easy to assemble and insensitive against geometric variations, for instance through temperature influences or the disposition of the machines.{{sfn|Schulz|1999|pp=76}}

=== Medical technology ===

Fat- and oil-free drives for respirators, stick-slip-free movements of scanners or a high rotary speed of large rotors have all been achieved with air bearings.
* Air-guided computed tomography
High rotary speed (&gt; 5.5&amp;nbsp;Hz / 330 rpm), low operation costs, no noise, large inner rotor diameter (&gt; 1&amp;nbsp;m), small weight of rotor and frame, tilt possibility of the rotor as well as a high reliability. Besides a direct drive, a belt drive is also possible.

=== Production technology ===

Primarily, stick-slip-free movements and/or smallest forces are required. The air bearing technology is predestinated for fat/oil-free high-dynamic movements with short strokes.
* Air bearing for the adjustment of components
With air-guided units, optical components can be arranged to have the same diameter on a rotary table. The air bearing with vacuum preload and a constant bearing gap height floats contact-less on top of the rotary table.
* Adjustment slider for optics production
The linear slider, which is air-guided and statically determined, guarantees a high-precision positioning of the optical component before grinding. The self-aligning process is done without friction or force. When clamped the component retains its position for further manufacturing in the sub-micrometer-range.

=== Space technology ===
* Air-magnetic slip system
When transporting solar panels for satellites in a launching rocket, these must be folded. After reaching orbit, they unfold via a spring mechanism, weightlessly and without friction. This process requires prior testing on Earth due to reliability reasons. During the testing design, the solar panels are hung on magnetic preloaded air-bearings that compensate for gravity. In doing so, the unfolding movement process is carried out with a minimum friction impact which means that the solar panels are tested at close to reality. Moreover, the design offers absolutely maintenance-free handling with equal sequential movements.

The air-bearing components (diameter 34&amp;nbsp;mm) with integrated magnets are so small such that they are able to glide contact-free along conventional rolled sheet plates smoothly and with a bearing gap height of about 25&amp;nbsp;µm. The holding force of an air bearing for one solar panel averages 600 N. This force is achieved by an equal distribution of the load on 16 single air bearing elements. The unfolding process of the solar panels has been developed for an area of 21&amp;nbsp;m x 2.5 m.

The permanent magnetic preloaded air-bearing guidance system may be used for many types of hanging transportation movements as well as for many other applications, such as for instance for the stick-slip-free positioning of components during assembly.

The '''Australian Renewable Energy Agency''' ('''ARENA''') is an independent agency of the [[Australian federal government]], established in 2012 to manage Australia's [[renewable energy]] programs, with the objective of increasing supply and competitiveness of Australian renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

== Background ==
ARENA was established in 2012 as an independent [[statutory authority]] to manage the government's renewable energy programs.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; Legal establishment came with the passing of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011 (ARENA Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00629 |title=Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011, Act No. 151 of 2011 as amended. |year=2012 |website= ComLaw|publisher= Australian Government |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation passed parliament in November 2011 with the support of the [[Australian Greens]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|National]] coalition opposition as well as the governing [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. ARENA commenced operations on 1 July 2012. The agency resulted from negotiations within the Australian parliament under the [[Gillard Government]], with the intention of providing more secure funding for renewable energy programs in the context of political changes.&lt;ref name="Plan" &gt;{{cite news |author=Jeremy Thompson |title= Greens hail win on renewables agency |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-08/greens-hail-win-on-renewables-agency/2787118  | publisher= ABC Online|location= Australia|date= 8 July 2011 |accessdate=24 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ARENA was created as part of the Clean Energy Future package together with the [[Clean Energy Finance Corporation]], these are separate institutions. ARENA has consolidated various earlier renewable programs and research and development projects from the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, the Australian Solar Institute and the former [[Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism]].&lt;ref name="Plan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arena.gov.au/about-arena/history/ |title=History |date= |website=arena.gov.au |publisher=Australian Renewable Energy Agency |accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH announcement" &gt;{{cite news |title=Agency to achieve renewable energy target |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/energy-smart/agency-to-achieve-renewable-energy-target-20111012-1lkiy.html  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 12 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
[[File:CETO-unit.jpg|thumb|Carnegie Wave Energy's wave energy unit as it will appear in the Perth Wave Energy Project (supported by ARENA) off [[Garden Island (Western Australia)|Garden Island]], Western Australia]]
The agency's responsibilities cover funding of renewable energy research and development, demonstration and commercialisation, including large scale deployment, as well as the sharing of knowledge and information about these technologies.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Homepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arena.gov.au/ |title= ARENA (homepage) |date= |website=Australian Renewable Energy Agency |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARENA was established with a total funding allocation of $3.2 billion out to 2020. In the [[2013 Australian federal budget|2013 budget]] the Labor government deferred $370 million of the agency's funding, extending the timeline to 2022. The subsequent [[Abbott Government]] proposed to cut $435 million from ARENA's budget, followed by an additional $40 million, but has affirmed its support for the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tom Arup |title=Abbott government to cut $435m from renewable energy agency|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/abbott-government-to-cut-435m-from-renewable-energy-agency-20131113-2xg1g.html  |newspaper= Sydney Morning Herald |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dugald Murray |title=Waging war on the environment does not add up |url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/waging-war-on-the-environment-does-not-add-up-20131219-2znxt.html |newspaper= Sydney Morning Herald |date=20 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automatic quartz''' is a collective term describing [[watch]] [[Movement (clockwork)|movements]] that combine a self-winding rotor mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.brinkersjewelers.com/mechanical-automatic-quartz-understanding-type-watch-movement
|title=Mechanical, Automatic, or Quartz: Understanding Each Type of Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as used in [[Automatic watch|automatic mechanical watches]]) to generate electricity with a [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[Crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]] as its timing element. Such movements aim to provide the advantages of quartz without the inconvenience and environmental impact of batteries. Several manufacturers employ this technique.

==Mode of operation==
A rotating [[pendulum]] inside the case is attached to a relatively large gear which meshes with a very small [[pinion]].  As the wearer moves, the pendulum turns and spins the pinion at a very high speed - up to 100,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]].  This is coupled to a miniature [[electrical generator]] which charges a storage device which is a [[capacitor]](s) or a rechargeable [[Button cell|battery]].  A typical full charge will last between two weeks and six months.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Applications==
===Seiko===
Japanese company [[Seiko]] pioneered the technique which it unveiled at the [[BaselWorld|Baselworld]] 1986 trade show under the trial name AGM.&lt;ref name="seikooverview"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.seikowatches.com/world/technology/kinetic/ | title=SEIKO Kinetic. 20 years of success | publisher=[[Seiko]] | date=2007-04-12 | accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first such watch was released in Germany in January 1988 and April of the same year in Japan (under the name '''Auto-Quartz''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bestmilitarywatch.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/19_ags.pdf | title=Seiko AGS Quartz Watch: The world's first automatic power generating quartz watch | work=[[Seiko Epson|Seiko Epson Corp]] | accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watches had an average monthly rate of ±15 sec and provided 75 hours of continuous operation when fully powered. Early ''automatic quartz'' movements were called '''AGS''' (Automatic Generating System).

In 1991 the company introduced the '''Kinetic''' brand name. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://schwaebischer-whisky.de/typo3/files/why-acquire-swiss-replicas-watches-10091.html
|title=Copy Swiss Replica Watches}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adv. {{cite magazine
|magazine=Newsweek |page=15 |date=December 18, 1995
|title=How could we fit 50 patents inside? We took out the battery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Seiko offers a wide range of watches with various Kinetic movements. The top of the line is the caliber 9T82, included in Sportura (international brand) and PROSPEX (only marketed in Japan) Collection. It is sold in limited volume at a price range of about [[United States dollar|US$]]3000 which makes it one of the most expensive automatic quartz watches. 
Kinetic technology has also been used in some of Seiko's Pulsar and Lorus watches. As of 2007, Seiko has sold more than eight million automatic quartz watches.&lt;ref name="seikooverview"/&gt;

The different calibres of Kinetic watches currently are relatively large and heavy, weighing in at 1/3 of a pound (150&amp;nbsp;grams) or more on many models. Therefore, most Seiko Kinetic watches are only available in a men's size.

===ETA===
[[Image:Omega seamaster omegamatic black.JPG|thumb|right|[[Omega Seamaster Omegamatic|Omega Seamaster 200 Omegamatic]]. This watch uses Omega caliber 1400 (ETA 205.111 Rhodium plated).]]
[[Image:Swatch Swiss Autoquarz, 1998.jpg|thumb|[[Swatch]] Swiss Autoquarz, 1998]]

Swiss company [[ETA SA]], part of the [[Swatch]] group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |date=April 2006
|url=https://www.europastar.com/news/1002343810-eta-sa-advanced-training-in-latest-watch.html
|title=ETA SA: Advanced Training in Latest Watch Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; made seven different automatic quartz movements, calling them '''Autoquartz'''. They were part of the premium Flatline series of movements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Flatline
|url=https://www.eta.ch/en/our-products/quartz-movements/flatline}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were sold to a variety of watch vendors, primarily European and American.  High grade movements designed to last as long as their premium mechanical movements, they had between 15 and 53 jewels.  Unlike most quartz watches, Autoquartz could be calibrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Mens Citizen Watches
|url=http://watches2all.blogspot.com/2011/06/history-of-mens-citizen-watches.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase their accuracy.  Several vendors had their Autoquartz watches [[COSC]] certified. In 2006 to increase production of its highly demanded mechanical movements, Swatch discontinued supplying the Autoquartz line to customers (service and parts are still available). Then in 2009, possibly due to available production capacity or stocked parts, [[Tissot]] reintroduced the Autoquartz in its PRC200 dive watch.  The Autoquartz movement used by Tissot is gold plated and carries the designation ETA 205.914.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Movement calibers:{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* '''204.901''' (small 8.75 lignes used primarily in women's watches)
* '''204.911''' (replacement for the 204.901 upgrading from a capacitor to a rechargeable battery)
* '''[[205.111]]''' (discontinued and replaced by the [[Omega Seamaster Omegamatic#Omegamatic caliber|205.911]] which upgraded from a capacitor to a rechargeable battery)
* '''205.711''' (15 jeweled movement used only by Swatch Watch for a variety of its fashion watches)
* '''205.911''' (the most commonly available movement having 17 jewels and often ordered in gold plating)
* '''205.914''' (no information available from ETA)
* '''205.961''' (a 205.911 with the addition of a GMT hand)
* '''206.211''' (a 205.911 fitted with a Dubois Depraz 2021 to make a chronograph. With 53 jewels the most jeweled quartz movement ever made)

Manufacturers who employ or employed ETA movements: [[Tissot]], [[Rado (watch)|Rado]] in their Accustar line of watches, [[Longines]], [[Swatch]], [[Omega SA|Omega]] ([[Omega Seamaster Omega-matic]]), Dugena (K-Tech), [[Wenger]] (GST Field Terragraph Autoquartz), [[Hermès]] (Nomade), Roberge (Altaïr), [[Mido (watch)|Mido]] (Multifort), [[Bovet]] (Autoquartz calibre 11BQ01), [[Fortis Uhren AG|Fortis]] (Spacematic Eco), Belair (Autoquartz), [[Franck Muller]] (Transamerica), HTO (Grand Voyager) and [[Cyma Watches|Cyma]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Citizen===
[[Citizen Watch Co.|Citizen]], one of the world's largest watch manufacturers, also built an autoquartz-powered watch: the Eco-Drive Duo (released in December 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citizen.com.hk/en/about-us/brand-history | title=Brand History | work=[[Citizen Watch Co.]] | accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novel to this watch was the use of both mechanical power as well as a solar cell. This model was an attempt to enter higher-priced markets (at a cost of around $1000 USD), but the technology failed to attract consumer interest and Citizen has since stopped making use of the unique movement. No other autoquartz powered watch from Citizen is known; all other [[Eco-Drive]] models only use solar power or thermal power.

===Ventura===
Ventura is a small Swiss watch manufacturer claiming to be "the World's only manufacturer of automatic digital watches".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Their '''VEN_99''' movement was the only watch to ever combine autoquartz and digital readout of time (LCD) in one package. Offered were three models: the Sparc rx, fx and px. In late 2006, the company started selling their movement with an incorporated alarm, another exclusive feature. All hardware is proprietary to Ventura.

In 2007 the company went into bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chuckmaddoxwatch.blogspot.com/2008/02/sad-news-to-report-loss-of-innovator.html Chuck Maddox’s Watch Blog: Sad news to report, the loss of an innovator...]&lt;/ref&gt; Support was available from an independent entity. In 2011 the company re-emerged from bankruptcy and continued to sell its models, introducing the "2nd gen Micro-Generating-System" and marketing the watch (Sparc MGS) integrating it as the world's first and only digital-readout multi-function automatic quartz module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Krupp | first=Alexander | title=Ventura: Rückkehr einer Uhrenmarke | publisher=Watchtime.net | date=22 May 2011 | url=http://www.watchtime.net/nachrichten/ventura-ruckkehr-einer-uhrenmarke/ | accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with other manufacturers the watch movement ('''VEN_10''') and power source ('''MGS''') are separate units, only linked by a single wire.

==Pricing==
In spite of the relatively complex mechanical parts used, Seiko has positioned their kinetic watches to be medium-priced.&lt;ref&gt;"We have strengthened the Seiko collection in the medium price range"
{{cite magazine |magazine=The Jeweller Magazine 
|title=Zest Europe
|date=February 2010 |url=https://issuu.com/jeweller/docs/feb2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are kinetic with other complications such as [[chronograph]] movement 9T82, 7L22 and direct drive movements. [[ETA SA|ETA]] sold Autoquartz to a variety of [[Swiss Made|Swiss]] manufacturers with pricing below $100 ([[Swatch]]) to multiple thousands (Omega, Baume et Mercier, et al.).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Ventura prices its automatic quartz watches at around 2000-4000 Euro.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:Betafite.jpg|thumb|'''Betafite''', [[Gunnison, Colorado]]]]

'''Betafite''' is a mineral group in the [[pyrochlore]] supergroup, with the chemical formula (Ca,U)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Ti,Nb,Ta)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH). Betafite typically occurs as a primary mineral in [[granite]] [[pegmatites]], rarely in [[carbonatite]]s. Defined by the B-site atom Ti, Atencio et al.(2010) combined and considered the ideas portrayed in (Hatert and Burke)(2008) and a modernization of (Hogarth)(1977) system for nomenclature of pyrochlore and betafite in order to further rationalize the naming process of this grouping of minerals. Therefore, Atencio et al. (2010), states that only two of the mineral species that were formerly recognized under the previous nomenclature system of betafite in Hogarth (1977) are now recognized. They are ''oxyuranobetafite'' and ''oxycalciobetafite''. Now the term betafite is a synonym or varietal group name under the pyrochlore super group (Christy and Atencio 2013).  
[[Image:Betafite bionerd.jpg|thumb|Betafite from [[Madagascar]]]]

==Structure==
The pyrochlore supergroup minerals conform to the general formula, A&lt;sub&gt;2−''m''&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;6−''w''&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;1−''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where the ''m'', ''w'', and ''n'' variables represent the parameters that indicate incomplete occupancy of the A, Y, and X sites (Atencio et al. 2010). They crystallize isometric system with a space group of Fd{{overline|3}}m or its subgroups where Betafite has a hexoctahedral class (Hogarth 1977). Site A is generally an 8-coordinated cation with a ~1.0&amp;nbsp;Å radius, B site is generally a 6-coordinated cation, which contains the elements Ti, Nb, and Ta usually for betafite, (Atencio et al. 2010, site X is generally O but can subjugate to OH and F, and site Y is typically an anion but can also be a vacancy, H2O, or a very large monovalent cation, like Cs, K, and Rb.

==Origin and uses==
The oxycalciobetafite in Camara et al. (2004) occurs in the [[pyroclastic]] formation belonging to the main effusive stage of the Vico activity where it is contained within foid-bearing [[syenite]], which also holds optical observances of K-feldspar, and minor [[amphibole]], [[plagioclase]], [[magnetite]], [[sodalite]]  and  rare  [[biotite]]. While with SEM-EDS, [[titanite]], [[apatite]], and [[baddeleyite]] were also observed.  While the geologic occurrence of oxycalciobetafite located on the moon has been rather difficult to ascertain.  Oxyuranobetafite is also located on the moon and is described in Mokhov et al. (2008).

Betafite is an important ore of thorium, uranium, and niobium. Though, there is no real applicable use as of yet for the accepted betafite species, the pyrochlore super-group that contains the former betafites of Hogarth (1977) are mentioned in Lumpkin and Ewing (1996), Turner (1928) and many others, all with the recurring theme of either extracting uranium, thorium, and niobium from the pyrochlore super-group ores. The depletion of urananite rich ore bodies has led to the search and mild application of refractory uranium minerals as a source of [[uranium]] to keep up with the increasing demands.&lt;ref name=Harlow/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16284">'''Central processing unit power dissipation''' or '''CPU power dissipation''' is the process in which [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) consume [[electrical energy]], and dissipate this energy in the form of [[heat]] due to the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] in the [[electronic circuit]]s.

== Power management ==
{{See also|Variable TDP}}

Designing CPUs that perform tasks [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiently]] without [[thermal shock|overheating]] is a major consideration of nearly all CPU manufacturers to date. Some CPU implementations use very little power; for example, the CPUs in [[mobile phone]]s often use just a few [[watt]]s of electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/accurate-cpu-power-modeling-for-multicore-smartphones/ |title=Accurate CPU Power Modeling for Multicore Smartphones |first1=Yifan |last1=Zhang |first2=Yunxin |last2=Liu |first3=Li |last3=Zhuang |first4=Xuanzhe |last4=Liu |first5=Feng |last5=Zhao |first6=Qun |last6=Li |publisher=Microsoft Research |id=MSR-TR-2015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some [[microcontroller]]s used in [[embedded system]]s may consume only a few milliwatts or even as little as a few microwatts. In comparison, CPUs in general-purpose [[personal computer]]s, such as [[desktop computer|desktop]]s and [[laptop]]s, dissipate significantly more power because of their higher complexity and speed. These microelectronic CPUs may consume power in the order of a few watts to hundreds of watts. Historically, early CPUs implemented with [[vacuum tube]]s consumed power on the order of many [[kilowatt]]s.

CPUs for desktop computers typically use a significant portion of the power consumed by the [[computer]].  Other major uses include fast [[video card]]s, which contain [[graphics processing unit]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sparsh |last1=Mittal |first2=Jeffrey S. |last2=Vetter |url=https://www.academia.edu/6644474/A_Survey_of_Methods_For_Analyzing_and_Improving_GPU_Energy_Efficiency |title=A Survey of Methods for Analyzing and Improving GPU Energy Efficiency |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |date=2014 |volume=47 |issue=2 |doi=10.1145/2636342 |pages=1–23|arxiv=1404.4629 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]]. In laptops, the [[LCD]]'s backlight also uses a significant portion of overall power. While [[power management|energy-saving feature]]s have been instituted in personal computers for when they are idle, the overall consumption of today's high-performance CPUs is considerable. This is in strong contrast with the much lower energy consumption of CPUs designed for low-power devices. One such CPU, the [[Intel XScale]], can run at 600&amp;nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]] consuming under 1&amp;nbsp;W of power, whereas Intel [[x86]] PC processors in the same performance bracket consume a few times more energy.

There are some engineering reasons for this pattern. 
* For a given device, operating at a higher [[clock rate]] may require more power. Reducing the clock rate or [[undervolting]] usually reduces energy consumption; it is also possible to undervolt the microprocessor while keeping the clock rate the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/5763/undervolting-and-overclocking-on-ivy-bridge |title=Undervolting and Overclocking on Ivy Bridge |first=Ian |last=Cutress |website=anandtech.com |date=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New features generally require more [[transistor]]s, each of which uses power. Turning unused areas off saves energy, such as through [[clock gating]].
* As a processor model's design matures, smaller transistors, lower-voltage structures, and design experience may reduce energy consumption.

Processor manufacturers usually release two power consumption numbers for a CPU:
* ''typical thermal power'', which is measured under normal load. (for instance, AMD's [[Average CPU power]])
* ''maximum thermal power'', which is measured under a worst-case load

For example, the Pentium 4 2.8&amp;nbsp;GHz has 68.4&amp;nbsp;W typical thermal power and 85&amp;nbsp;W maximum thermal power. When the CPU is idle, it will draw far less than the typical thermal power. [[Datasheet]]s normally contain the [[thermal design power]] (TDP), which is the maximum amount of [[heat]] generated by the CPU, which the [[computer cooling|cooling system]] in a computer is required to [[dissipation|dissipate]].  Both Intel and [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD) have defined TDP as the maximum heat generation for thermally significant periods, while running worst-case non-synthetic workloads; thus, TDP is not reflecting the actual maximum power of the processor.  This ensures the computer will be able to handle essentially all applications without exceeding its thermal envelope, or requiring a cooling system for the maximum theoretical power (which would cost more but in favor of extra headroom for processing power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentpcreview.com/article169-page3.html |title=Athlon 64 for Quiet Power |page=3 |date=2004-06-15 |access-date=2013-12-21 |first=Mike |last=Chin |website=silentpcreview.com |quote=Thermal Design Power (TDP) should be used for processor thermal solution design targets. The TDP is not the maximum power that the processor can dissipate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/the-technical-details-behind-intels-7-watt-ivy-bridge-cpus/ |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=The technical details behind Intel's 7 Watt Ivy Bridge CPUs |date=2013-01-14 |access-date=2013-01-14 |work=Ars Technica
 | quote = In Intel's case, a specified chip's TDP has less to do with the amount of power a chip needs to use (or can use) and more to do with the amount of power the computer's fan and heatsink need to be able to dissipate while the chip is under sustained load. Actual power usage can be higher or (much) lower than TDP, but the figure is intended to give guidance to engineers designing cooling solutions for their products.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many applications, the CPU and other components are idle much of the time, so idle power contributes significantly to overall system power usage.  When the CPU uses power management features to reduce energy use, other components, such as the motherboard and chipset, take up a larger proportion of the computer's energy.  In applications where the computer is often heavily loaded, such as scientific computing, [[performance per watt]] (how much computing the CPU does per unit of energy) becomes more significant.

== Sources ==
There are several factors contributing to the CPU power consumption; they include dynamic power consumption, short-circuit power consumption, and power loss due to [[transistor leakage current]]s:

&lt;math&gt;P_{cpu} = P_{dyn} + P_{sc} + P_{leak}&lt;/math&gt;

The dynamic power consumption originates from the activity of logic gates inside a CPU. When the logic gates toggle, energy is flowing as the capacitors inside them are charged and discharged. The dynamic power consumed by a CPU is approximately proportional to the CPU frequency, and to the square of the CPU voltage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://download.intel.com/design/network/papers/30117401.pdf |title=Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology for the Intel Pentium M Processor (White Paper) |date=March 2004 |access-date =2013-12-21 |publisher=[[Intel Corporation]] |format=PDF |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812030010/http://download.intel.com/design/network/papers/30117401.pdf |archive-date=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{dyn} = C V^2 f&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|C}} is capacitance, {{mvar|f}} is frequency, and {{mvar|V}} is voltage.

When logic gates toggle, some transistors inside may change states. As this takes a finite amount of time, it may happen that for a very brief amount of time some transistors are conducting simultaneously. A direct path between the source and ground then results in some short-circuit power loss. The magnitude of this power is dependent on the logic gate, and is rather complex to model on a macro level.

Power consumption due to leakage power emanates at a micro-level in transistors. Small amounts of currents are always flowing between the differently doped parts of the transistor. The magnitude of these currents depend on the state of the transistor, its dimensions, physical properties and sometimes temperature. The total amount of leakage currents tends to inflate for increasing temperature and decreasing transistor sizes.

Both dynamic and short-circuit power consumption are dependent on the clock frequency, while the leakage current is dependent on the CPU supply voltage.  It has been shown that the energy consumption of a program shows convex energy behavior, meaning that there exists an optimal CPU frequency at which energy consumption is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |first1=Karel |last1=De Vogeleer |first2=Gerard |last2=Memmi |first3=Pierre |last3=Jouvelot |first4=Fabien |last4=Coelho |title=The Energy/Frequency Convexity Rule: Modeling and Experimental Validation on Mobile Devices |date=2013-09-09 |eprint=1401.4655 |class=cs.OH }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduction ===
Power consumption can be reduced in several ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sparsh |last=Mittal |url=https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems |title=A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems |journal=IJCAET |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=440–459 |date=2014 |doi=10.1504/ijcaet.2014.065419|arxiv=1401.0765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the following:
* Voltage reduction{{snd}} [[dual-voltage CPU]]s, [[dynamic voltage scaling]], [[undervolting]], etc.
* Frequency reduction{{snd}} [[underclocking]], [[dynamic frequency scaling]], etc.
* Capacitance reduction{{snd}} increasingly [[integrated circuit]]s that replace PCB traces between two chips with relatively lower-capacitance on-chip metal interconnect between two sections of a single integrated chip; [[low-k dielectric]], etc.
* Techniques such as [[clock gating]] and [[globally asynchronous locally synchronous]], which can be thought of as reducing the capacitance switched on each clock tick, or can be thought of as locally reducing the clock frequency in some sections of the chip
* Various techniques to reduce the switching activity{{snd}} number of transitions the CPU drives into off-chip data buses, such as non-multiplexed [[address bus]], [[bus encoding]] such as [[Gray code addressing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Ching-Long |last1=Su |first2=Chi-Ying |last2=Tsui |first3=Alvin M. |last3=Despain |url=http://www.scarpaz.com/2100-papers/Power%20Estimation/su94-low%20power%20architecture%20and%20compilation.pdf |title=Low Power Architecture Design and Compilation Techniques for High-Performance Processors |date=1994 |publisher=Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory |id=ACAL-TR-94-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or power protocol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K. |last1=Basu |first2=A. |last2=Choudhary |first3=J. |last3=Pisharath |first4=M. |last4=Kandemir |url=http://cucis.eecs.northwestern.edu/publications/pdf/BasCho02A.pdf |title=Power Protocol: Reducing Power Dissipation on Off-Chip Data Buses |journal=Proceedings of the 35th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO) |pages=345–355 |date=2002 |doi=10.1109/MICRO.2002.1176262 |isbn=0-7695-1859-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sacrificing transitor density for higher frequencies.
* Layering heat-conduction zones within the CPU framework ("Christmassing the Gate").
* Recycling at least some of that energy stored in the capacitors (rather than dissipating it as heat in transistors){{snd}} [[adiabatic circuit]], energy recovery logic, etc.
* Optimizing machine code - by implementing compiler optimizations that schedules clusters of instructions using common components, the CPU power used to run an application can be significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Al-Khatib |first1=Zaid |last2=Abdi |first2=Samar |date=2015-04-13 |title=Operand-Value-Based Modeling of Dynamic Energy Consumption of Soft Processors in FPGA |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-16214-0_6 |journal=Applied Reconfigurable Computing |volume=9040 |publisher=Springer, Cham |pages=65–76 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-16214-0_6|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn=978-3-319-16213-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clock frequencies ==
Historically, processor manufacturers consistently delivered increases in [[clock rate]]s and [[instruction-level parallelism]], so that single-threaded code executed faster on newer processors with no modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Herb |last=Sutter |url=http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm |title=The Free Lunch Is Over: A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software |journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]] |volume=30 |issue=3 |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, in order to manage CPU power dissipation, processor makers favor [[multi-core]] chip designs, thus software needs to be written in a [[multi-threaded]] or multi-process manner to take full advantage of such hardware.  Many multi-threaded development paradigms introduce overhead, and will not see a linear increase in speed when compared to the number of processors.  This is particularly true while accessing shared or dependent resources, due to [[Lock (computer science)|lock]] contention.  This effect becomes more noticeable as the number of processors increases.

Recently, IBM has been exploring ways to distribute computing power more efficiently by mimicking the distributional properties of the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=R. Colin |url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218883/IBM-demos-cognitive-computer-chips |title=IBM demos cognitive computer chips |work=[[EE Times]] |date=2011-08-18 |access-date=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Blue Stones of Dailly - geograph.org.uk - 1500376.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Old Dailly]] Charter Stone is the larger of the two.]]
'''Charter Stones''' date back to ancient times when such stones were granted to individuals or communities in lieu of written charters to signify the granting of land by the crown, feudal overlords or other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dailly Parish Community Website|url=https://www.daillyparish.co.uk/the-blue-stones-of-old-dailly|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used to record ownership of land before written documents came into general use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Sir Walter|year=1826|title=Poetical Works|publisher=|isbn=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of Charter Stones==
The stones were sometimes engraved or were instead distinctive in terms of colour, composition or shape. The use of these stones may relate to the common practice of using [[Boundary marker|boundary stones]] to establish precise limits to areas of land ownership&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pryce|first=Huw|year=1998|title=Literacy in Medieval Celtic Societies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57039-5|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but differ in that the proof of the land ownership was invested in them. Being stone they had a permanence that gave them an advantage over charters written on [[Vellum|vellum]], etc. An essential element was that the stone in question had once belonged to the donor and was next held by the grantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Train|first=Joseph|year=1845|title=An Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man: From the ..., Volume 1|publisher=Mary A Quiggin|isbn=|page=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size, weight and individuality of charter stones helped to ensure that they were not easily stolen or moved any significant distance.

==Surviving examples==

In [[Old Dailly]] a tradition has it that when worship was discontinued at the old kirk in 1695 the people of [[Dailly]] insisted that the 'Blue stone' or charter stone should be removed from the old kirk to the new parish church. The people of [[Old Dailly]] refused to part with their ancient stone and in his historical notes located in [[Sir Walter Scott]]’s “Lord of The Isles”, he records this conflict in Dailly parish and notes that it was settled ‘when man, woman and child form both communities marched out and by one desperate engagement put an end to the conflict’. The inhabitants of Old Dailly triumphed and the  'Blue Stone' still resides in the old churchyard. Old Dailly is sometimes recorded as the 'Blue Stone Burgh'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dailly Parish Community Website|url=https://www.daillyparish.co.uk/the-blue-stones-of-old-dailly|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith in 1895 mentions charter stones plural and suggests that the tradition of trials of strength, in common with the 'Leper's Charter Stone' at [[Prestwick]], was linked with proof that the person granted the land involved was mature enough to hold it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=John|year=1895|title=Prehistoric Man In Ayrshire|publisher=Elliot Stock|isbn=|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Bruce's Well, Kingcase in [[Prestwick]], records describe the ''Lepers' Charter Stone'' as being the shape of a sheep's kidney, formed of basalt, blue in colour and as smooth as glass. It weighed around 15 stones or 95 Kilograms and its weight was such that it could only be lifted with arms extended and cupped in a cavity in the stone. Lifting it was considered proof of the passage to manhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Sir Walter|year=1826|title=Poetical Works|publisher=|isbn=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources state that some English [[Dragoons|dragoons]] encamped one night at Bruce's Well where the charter stone was kept and somehow managed to break it. The pieces were collected and carefully kept by the freemen of [[Prestwick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Sir Walter|year=1826|title=Poetical Works|publisher=|isbn=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later incorporated into the consolidated walls of the old St Ninian's Chapel (see video). Another source states that "''... a low character of the name of Allison, who rented a salt-pan in the neighbourhood, about the year 1800 bribed a drunk man, who broke the stone in pieces.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow Broadside Ballads|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/0t4/~dumfries/files/layer2/glasgow_broadside_ballads/chapter_10.htm|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LondonStone.jpg|thumb|250px|The London Stone]]
The ''Clach na Cudainn'' (Gaelic for 'stone of the tub') or ''Charter Stone of [[Inverness]]'' was kept in the market place, set in a frame and bound with iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Sir Walter|year=1826|title=Poetical Works|publisher=|isbn=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the Clachnacuddin Stone it is said that as long as the stone is preserved then Inverness will flourish. The upper surface was supposedly worn flat by the action of women resting their tubs or pails on it whilst they rested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merkat Cross and Clachnacuddin Stone outside Town House of Inverness, Scotland|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/conner395/12260261775|publisher=Flikr|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Near [[Blair Atholl]] at Pitagowan in Perthshire the ''Clach na h-Iobairt'' (the stone of offering) or 'Bridge of Tilt' standing stone is said to be a charter stone that records a land grant, possibly to the Church of Kilmaveonaig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pryce|first=Huw|year=1998|title=Literacy in Medieval Celtic Societies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57039-5|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCAHMS Canmore - Clach Na H' Iobairt|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/25801/clach-na-h-iobairt|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The [[Stone of Scone]] was regarded as being the charter stone of the Kingdom of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Sir Walter|year=1826|title=Poetical Works|publisher=|isbn=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Wales charter stones are recorded from Llanllyr in [[Merioneth]] (circa 8th century) and [[Merthyr Mawr]] (11th century) and [[Ogmore-by-Sea|Ogmore]] (11th century) in [[Glamorgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=Howard|year=2003|title=Archaeologies of Remembrance: Death and Memory in Past Societies|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media New York|isbn=978-1-4613-4845-0|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The example at [[Merthyr Mawr]] carries the inscription "''in grefium in propium''" which translates literally as "''ownership was registered''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pryce|first=Huw|year=1998|title=Literacy in Medieval Celtic Societies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57039-5|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commemorates St Glywys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies|first=John Reuben|year=2003|title=The Book of Llandaf and the Norman Church in Wales|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=1-84383-024-8|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ogmore-by-Sea|Ogmore]] charter stone also honours St Glywys and records a Bishop Fili who was the grantee of an ''ager'', a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies|first=John Reuben|year=2003|title=The Book of Llandaf and the Norman Church in Wales|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=1-84383-024-8|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In England the ancient [[London Stone]] has been put forward as a charter stone due to its proximity to lands once held by [[Canterbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|year=1815|title=The Literary Panorama and National Register, Volume 2||publisher=|isbn=|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Kirkby Stephen]] charter stone in [[Cumbria]] is till used on St Luke’s Fair day in October for the reading of the market's charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Short History of Kirkby Stephen|url=http://www.kirkby-stephen.com/index.php/local-history/a-short-history-of-kirkby-stephen|publisher=Kirkby Stephen Community Council|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Cumbria is the ''Ca'an Stone'' in the main street of [[Kendal]], once part of the market cross, but possibly older and once used as a place where proclamations were read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Holloway|first=Norman|year=2013|title=Kendal Through Time||publisher=Amberley Books|isbn=978-1-4456-2901-8|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible example has been recorded at Stoke near [[Hartland, Devon|Hartland]] in [[North Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=Howard|year=2003|title=Archaeologies of Remembrance: Death and Memory in Past Societies|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media New York|isbn=978-1-4613-4845-0|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Ireland's [[County Armagh]] an eighth century example of a charter stone is recorded at [[Kilnasaggart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=Howard|year=2003|title=Archaeologies of Remembrance: Death and Memory in Past Societies|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media New York|isbn=978-1-4613-4845-0|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Isle of Man]] it is recorded that it was common for charter stones to be given as a sign of transfer of ownership, the stone itself once having been the property of the donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Train|first=Joseph|year=1845|title=An Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man: From the ..., Volume 1|publisher=Mary A Quiggin|isbn=|page=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Micro-history==
[[File:The Ca' Steean or Stone, Kendal, Cumbria.jpg|thumb|250px|The Kendal Ca' Stone]]
Records show that before the Norman conquest other items that once belonged to the donor of property were given in lieu of a written charter, such as swords, helmets and especially horns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Train|first=Joseph|year=1845|title=An Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man: From the ..., Volume 1|publisher=Mary A Quiggin|isbn=|page=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tradition has it that charter stones are sometimes possessed with special powers such as bringing good luck to those who touch them and in some cases they can supposedly cure certain illness, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dailly Parish Community Website|url=https://www.daillyparish.co.uk/the-blue-stones-of-old-dailly|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Dailly stone is said to have held the right of being a [[Sanctuary|sanctuary]] stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Dailly|url=http://www.ayrshirepaths.org.uk/daillyhistory.htm|publisher=Wiki|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The larger of the two [[Old Dailly]] charter stones weighs between {{convert|20|and|23|st|kg}} and the smaller between {{convert|18.5|and|20|st|kg}} and like the old Lepers' charter stone at Prestwick is smooth and their shape make them difficult to grip them easily and over the years they became a weight lifting challenge. In international stone lifting circles the name ''The Big Blue'' was the name given to the largest Old Dailly stone as a ‘lifting’ or ‘testing’ stone however the local council have bound both with metal hoops and they cannot at present be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dailly Parish Community Website|url=https://www.daillyparish.co.uk/the-blue-stones-of-old-dailly|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chashma Nuclear Power Plant''' ('''CHASNUPP''') or '''Chashma Nuclear Power Complex''', near [[Chashma (Pakistan)|Chashma Colony]] and [[Kundian]] town, [[Mianwali District]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]], is a commercial nuclear power plant consisting of four operating units (CHASHNUPP-I, CHASHNUPP-II, CHASHNUPP-III and CHASHNUPP-IV) and one planned unit (CHASHNUPP-V). Chashma Nuclear Power Plant reactors and other facilities are being built and operated by the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC) with Chinese support under the approval and guidelines of International Atomic Energy Agency.

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] as well as the [[United States Department of Energy]] recognised the urgency of Pakistan's energy needs, which is expected to grow seven to eight times by 2030.

In November 2006, The [[IAEA|International Atomic Energy Agency]] approved an agreement with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission for new nuclear power plants to be built in the country with Chinese assistance. The 35-member Board of Governors of the IAEA unanimously approved the safeguards agreement for any future Nuclear Power Plants that Pakistan will be constructing.&lt;ref&gt;http://payvand.com/news/06/nov/1318.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_pakistan-gets-approval-for-nuke-plant_1066118&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unit 1 ==

The 325 MW unit 1 (CHASNUPP-I) is a pressurised water reactor that began commercial operation in May 2000.&lt;ref name=TheNews/&gt; It is an [[CNP-300]] nuclear reactor design like the other 3 units in the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant, and the first Chinese export of a nuclear power plant.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.uxc.com/smr/uxc_SMRDetail.aspx?key=CNP-300 Info on CNP-300 at Ux Consulting&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unit 2 ==
The 325 MW unit 2, (CHASNUPP-II) is like CHASNUPP-I. Unit 2 was officially inaugurated on 10 May 2011 by former Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]].&lt;ref name=TheNews&gt;{{cite news|title=PM inaugurates 330MW Chashma-2 N-power plant|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-5952-PM-inaugurates-330MW-Chashma-2-N-power-plant|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=[[The News International]]|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PakObserver&gt;{{cite news |date=27 July 2013  |title=China to build 2,200 MW N-power facility for Pakistan  |url=http://www3.pakobserver.net/201307/27/detailnews.asp?id=213862  |newspaper=[[Pakistan Observer]]  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615184414/http://pakobserver.net/201307/27/detailnews.asp?id=213862  |archive-date=15 June 2015  |dead-url=no  |accessdate=15 October 2016  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unit 3 ==
On 28 April 2009 a general engineering and design contract for CHASNUPP-3 and CHASNUPP-4 was signed with ''Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute'' (SNERDI). The units will both have generation capacity of 340 MW and a design life of 40 years.On 6 March 2013 the dome of the third reactor was lifted into place.

The 340 MW Unit 3 (CHASNUPP-3) was officially inaugurated on 28 December 2016 by  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

The reactor type is [[CNP-300]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Unit 4 ==
CHASHNUPP-4 has been connected to national grid on 29 June, 2017 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Pakistans-Chashma-4-connected-to-grid-0307174.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Formal inauguration is to be held on 08 September, 2017 by Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.

The reactor type is also [[CNP-300]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://archive.is/20160907130951/http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/pakistan.aspx Nuclear Power in Pakistan, World Nuclear Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unit 5 ==
On March 2013, [[Pakistan]] and China agreed to build a fifth unit (CHASNUPP-5). It will be an ACP-1000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/03/21/china-pakistan-reach-controversial-deal-on-nuclear-power-plant-sources-say/ China, Pakistan reach controversial deal on nuclear power plant]&lt;/ref&gt; [[China National Nuclear Corporation]] and the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] had signed a cooperation agreement for the construction of a 1,100 MW [[ACP1000]] ([[Hualong One]]) nuclear reactor at the Chashma nuclear power plant in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2121532/china-build-third-hualong-one-nuclear-reactor-pakistan China ‘to build third Hualong One nuclear reactor’ in Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear Engineering Training centre==
The complex has its own training establishment, known as CHASCENT (CHASNUPP Center of Nuclear Training). CHASCENT houses a Full Scope Training Simulator (FSTS) for CHASNUPP-1 and a similar facility for CHASNUPP-2 is under construction. The simulator is used for providing training to the nuclear power plant operators. Apart from training nuclear plant operators the centre offers various engineering programs at diploma and degree levels. The centre is currently in a phase of expansion to cater to an ever-increasing demand for quality technicians and engineers within PAEC.It is largest Nuclear hub of Pakistan.

{{refimprove|date=December 2015}} 

'''Chemical energy''' is the potential of a [[chemical substance]] to undergo a [[Chemical transformation|transformation]] through a [[chemical reaction]] to transform other chemical substances. Examples include batteries, food, gasoline, and etc.. Breaking or making of [[chemical bond]]s involves [[energy]], which may be either absorbed or evolved from a chemical system.

Energy that can be released (or absorbed) because of a reaction between a set of chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants, if the initial and final temperatures are the same. This change in energy can be estimated from the [[bond energy|bond energies]] of the various chemical bonds in the [[reactants]] and products. It can also be calculated from &lt;math&gt;\Delta {U_f^\circ}_{\mathrm {reactants}}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[internal energy]] of formation of the reactant [[molecules]], and &lt;math&gt;\Delta {U_f^\circ}_{\mathrm {products}}&lt;/math&gt; the internal energy of formation of the product molecules. The internal energy change of a chemical process is equal to the heat exchanged if it is measured under conditions of constant volume and equal initial and final temperature, as in a closed container such as a [[Calorimeter|bomb calorimeter]]. However, under conditions of constant pressure, as in reactions in vessels open to the atmosphere, the measured heat change is not always equal to the internal energy change, because pressure-volume work also releases or absorbs energy. (The heat change at constant pressure is called the [[enthalpy]] change; in this case the [[enthalpy of reaction]], if initial and final temperatures are equal).

Another useful term is the [[heat of combustion]], which is the energy mostly of the weak double bonds of molecular oxygen&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 2094–2099 | bibcode = 2015JChEd..92.2094S }}&lt;/ref&gt; released due to a [[combustion]] reaction and often applied in the study of [[fuel]]s. Food is similar to hydrocarbon and carbohydrate fuels, and when it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, the energy released is analogous to the heat of combustion (though not assessed in the same way as a hydrocarbon fuel — see [[food energy]]).

Chemical potential energy is a form of potential energy related to the structural arrangement of atoms or molecules.  This arrangement may be the result of [[chemical bond]]s within a molecule or otherwise.  Chemical energy of a chemical substance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a [[chemical reaction]].  As an example, when a fuel is burned the chemical energy of molecular oxygen is converted to heat,&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15" /&gt; and the same is the case with digestion of food metabolized in a biological organism.  Green plants transform [[solar energy]] to chemical energy (mostly of oxygen) through the process known as [[photosynthesis]], and electrical energy can be converted to chemical energy and vice versa through [[electrochemical]] reactions.

The similar term [[chemical potential]] is used to indicate the potential of a substance to undergo a change of configuration, be it in the form of a chemical reaction, spatial transport, particle exchange with a reservoir, etc.  It is ''not'' a form of [[potential energy]] itself, but is more closely related to [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].  The confusion in terminology arises from the fact that in other areas of physics not dominated by entropy, all potential energy is available to do useful work and drives the system to spontaneously undergo changes of configuration, and thus there is no distinction between "free" and "non-free" potential energy (hence the one word "potential").  However, in systems of large entropy such as [[Chemical system|chemical systems]], the total amount of energy present (and conserved by the [[first law of thermodynamics]]) of which this Chemical Potential Energy is a part, is separated from the amount of that energy—[[Thermodynamic free energy|Thermodynamic Free Energy]] (which [[Chemical potential]] is derived from)—which (appears to) drive the system forward spontaneously as its entropy increases (in accordance with the [[Second law of thermodynamics|''second'' law]]).

The '''Corn Belt derecho''' was a [[Derecho#Classification and criteria|progressive derecho]] which affected a large area of the central [[United States]] on June 29, 1998. In the morning, [[thunderstorm]]s, including a [[supercell]], developed over [[South Dakota]] and tracked into central [[Iowa]].  As the thunderstorms reached central Iowa, a strong [[rear-inflow jet]] developed which caused the thunderstorm to take on a different characteristic, becoming a derecho. It traveled more than 600 miles in about ten hours, causing more than $125 million worth of widespread damage destruction, especially to crops, and was responsible for power outages to nearly a half a million people.&lt;ref name=Corfidi&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Radar Loop of the Corn Belt Derecho over Central Illinois.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] loop of the thunderstorm line crossing Illinois.]]
At 1200 UTC (7:00 am. CDT), a stationnary front extended from South Dakota to Southern Michigan, bringing warm and humid to its South. Temperature was around {{convert|25|C|F}} at this early hour and the dew point was at {{convert|23|C|F}}. At 850 mb, the southwesterly flow was maintaining this situation while at higher levels the flow was turnig to the northwest, bringing drier and colder air. Daytime heating would increase the instability of the airmass and the [[Convective available potential energy|CAPE]] was expected to reach a strong 3689 J/kg.&lt;ref name=Arnott&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Arnott|first1=Justin M.|first2=N.

Along the front in South Dakota, an unorganized area of thunderstorms formed by 9:00 a.m. CDT. They rapidly organized and spread along the front, moving east-southeast into northeast [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=Arnott2/&gt; By midday, the storms reached northwestern and north central [[Iowa]], [[supercell]]s among them, while forming an west-east band and assuming a [[bow echo]] shape.&lt;ref name=Corfidi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnott2/&gt;

In the early afternoon, a second area of thunderstorms formed west of [[Des Moines]] and merged with the original bow echo line which accelerating east-southeast into Illinois by 4:00 p.m. The line evolved into a classic large scale bow echo, showing a "book end vortex" on its northern end,&lt;ref name=Corfidi/&gt; becoming a [[Derecho#Classification and criteria|progressive derecho]].&lt;ref name=Arnott/&gt; Damage, especially to crops and trees, became continuous from the Iowa border into Indiana as most of the damage was produced by strong straight-line winds on the leading edge of the [[Outflow boundary|gust front]]. Some embedded supercells, showing smaller-scale vortices on radars, produced narrower corridors of more intense damage, with measured wind gusts up to at least {{convert|110|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=Corfidi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnott/&gt;

The derecho crossed central and southern Indiana during the early to mid evening while its highest wind gusts decreased somewhat compared with those observed earlier in the day. The system became a roughly west-east arc and turned more southward as it moved into [[Kentucky]] by late evening, dissipating gradually&lt;ref name=Corfidi/&gt;

==Impact==
[[File:Velocity data for June 29, 98jun Corn Belt Derecho over Central Illinois.gif|thumb|Radar velocity display across southeastern Iowa into far western Illinois at 3:51 p.m. CDT, June 29, 1998.]]
By the end of the morning, the thunderstorms produced hail up to the size of hen's eggs and locally damaging wind in Nebraska. By mid-day, supercells along the [[bow echo]] in Iowa began to produce very strong winds, up to tennis ball-sized hail, and several mostly short-lived tornadoes.&lt;ref name=Corfidi/&gt; On [[Weather radar#Velocity|Doppler weather radar]], a large fast-moving [[mesocyclone]] associated of the track of a [[supercell]] was nearly in contact with the ground as it moved from southwest [[Boone County, Iowa|Boone County]] east-southeast across the northern and eastern parts of the [[Des Moines metropolitan area|Des Moines metro area]].&lt;ref name=Corfidi/&gt;

Over the [[Davenport, Iowa]] [[List of National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices|NWS Weather Office]] area of responsibility, numerous reports of [[wind gust]]s ranging from 80 to 100&amp;nbsp;mph were received.  The highest measured wind gust of {{convert|123|mph|km/h|0}} mph was reported in [[Washington, Iowa]] near coordinates {{coord|41.3|-91.7|region:US-IA|display=inline}}. This is the highest unofficial recorded wind gust in the history of the state of Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/dvn/ev19980629svr |title=June 29, 1998 Derecho|author= NWS Quad Cities IA/IL Weather Forecast Office|publisher=US [[National Weather Service]]|date=|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same moment, the area of green in the radar display to the right shows the velocities toward the weather radar. The lighter shade, beneath the orange arrow, represented Doppler-estimated mean wind speeds in excess of {{convert|64|knot|km/h}} all along the gust front, and the yellow circle are [[Convective storm detection#Radar|mesocyclone detections]].

In Illinois, railroad cars where topples, steel power transmission towers were bent, and many buildings were seriously damages during the afternoon.&lt;ref name=Corfidi/&gt; By the evening into Indiana, hundreds of trees were uprooted in the [[Bedford, Indiana|Bedford]] and [[Indianapolis metropolitan area|Indianapolis]] areas, two semi-trailer trucks were blown off [[Interstate 65]] near [[Columbus, Indiana|Columbus]].&lt;ref name=Corfidi/&gt;. By late evening, damage into Kentucky was minimal, mostly limited to toppled trees and several blown off roofs.&lt;ref name=Corfidi/&gt;

Along with the long-lived derecho, 28 [[tornadoes]] were reported, one an '''[[Fujita scale|F2]]''' which injured 85&amp;nbsp;people in central [[Iowa]].  Over eight states, the derecho and associated tornadoes killed one person and injured 174.&lt;ref name="severe plot"&gt;Data from the [[Storm Prediction Center]] archives, which are accessible through [http://www.spc.noaa.gov/software/svrplot2/ SeverePlot], free software created and maintained by John Hart, lead forecaster for the SPC.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21208">The '''D'Arcy Concession''' was a [[petroleum]] oil [[Concession (contract)|concession]] that was signed in 1901 between [[William Knox D'Arcy]] and  [[Mozzafar al-Din]], [[Shah]] of [[Persia]].  The oil concession gave D'Arcy the exclusive rights to [[Hydrocarbon exploration|prospect]] for oil in Persia (now [[Iran]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paine, Schoenberger, “Iranian Nationalism and the Great Powers: 1872–1954.” MERIP Reports, 37, (1975), pp.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this exploration for oil, D'Arcy and his team encountered financial troubles and struggled to find sellable amounts of oil.  They were about to give up but eventually struck large commercial quantities of oil in 1908.  After these large commercial quantities of oil were found, the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] took over the concession in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, “The Anglo-Persian Oil Dispute 1932-33.”  Journal of Contemporary History, 9, 4 (1974): p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Knox D'Arcy==
{{main|William Knox D'Arcy}}
William Knox D'Arcy was born in [[Devon]], [[England]] in 1849. When he emigrated to [[Australia]], he took a chance by organizing a [[syndicate]] to reopen and get an Australian [[gold mine]] back into operation.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money &amp; Power. Free Press, 2008, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;   It turned out that this gold mine still had a lot of [[gold]] yet to be found.  From this, D'Arcy became a very wealthy man and he returned to England looking for a new investment and to take another chance.  This investment and chance would eventually be to prospect for oil in Persia and the venture later became known as the D'Arcy Concession.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.119"&gt;Yergin (2008), p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil potential in Persia==
During the 1890s, research and reports were being published that Persia had great oil potential.  Some of D'Arcy's advisers made D'Arcy aware of these reports and promised him wealth if he invested in this venture.  D'Arcy agreed and sent out representatives to [[Tehran]] to win a concession that would give him the exclusive rights to prospect for oil in Persia.  On April 16, 1901, negotiations commenced between D'Arcy's representatives and Shah Mozzafar al-Din over the potential oil concession.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.119"/&gt;

==The rivalry of Britain and Russia over influence in Persia==
During this time period [[Great Britain]] and [[Russia]] had a great rivalry over the influence each wanted inside Persia. Both imperial powers believed that Persia and the [[Middle East]] were important to their imperial economic and military interests. Russia wanted to expand its influence into Persia and Britain believed that this would be a direct threat towards its precious [[India]]n possessions.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.120"&gt;Yergin (2008), p.120.&lt;/ref&gt; These two countries fought for influence in Persia through numerous concessions and loans throughout the 19th century. Many British government officials believed that this was where the D'Arcy concession could help. A British oil concession would help tip the balance of power in Persia in Britain's favour.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.120"/&gt; As a result, the British government and its officials in Persia gave full political support to D'Arcy and his potential oil concession. Once the Russians found out about the negotiations between D'Arcy and the Shah, the Russian prime minister tried to block the impending negotiations.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.121"&gt;Yergin (2008), p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian prime minister was able to slow the pace of the agreement until D'Arcy's representative in Tehran offered the Shah an extra £5,000 to close the agreement.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.121"/&gt;

==The oil concession==
The extra £5,000 worked and influenced the Shah to sign the concession.  At Tehran's Sahebqaraniyyeh Palace on May 28, 1901, Shah Mozzafar al-Din signed the 18 point concession.  This 18 point concession would give D'Arcy the exclusive rights to prospect, explore, exploit, transport and sell [[natural gas]], [[petroleum]], [[asphalt]] and [[mineral wax]]es in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtiari, “D'Arcy Concession Centennial and OPEC Today: An Historical Perspective.”  The Oil and Gas Journal, 99, 28 (2001), p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This concession also granted D'Arcy these rights for a 60-year period and it covered an area of 1,242,000 square kilometers.&lt;ref name="Bakhtiari 2001, p.22"&gt;Bakhtiari (2001), p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This covered three quarters of the country and D'Arcy purposely excluded the five most northerly provinces from the concession because of their proximity to Russia.  In return, the Shah received £20,000 cash, another £20,000 worth of shares, and 16 percent of annual net profits, from the operating companies of the concession.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.121"/&gt;

=== The 18 Articles ===
Between the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, of the one part, and William Knox D'Arcy, of independent means, residing in London at No. 42, Grosvenor Square (hereinafter called "the Concessionaire") of the other part;

The following has by these presents been agreed on and arranged:

'''Article 1.''' The Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah grants to the concessionnaire by these presents a special and exclusive privelege to search for, obtain, exploit, develop, render suitable for trade, carry away and sell natural gas petroleum, asphalt and ozokerite throughout the whole extent of the Persian Empire for a term of sixty years as from the date of these presents.

'''Article 2.''' This privelege shall comprise the exclusive right of laying the pipelines necessary from the deposits where there may be found one or several of the said products up to the Persian Gulf, as also the necessary distributing branches. It shall also comprise the right of constructing and maintaining all and any wells, reservoirs, stations, pump services, accumulation services and distribution services, factories and other works and arrangements that may be deemed necessary.

'''Article 3.''' The Imperial Persian Government grants gratuitously to the concessionnaire all uncultivated lands belonging to the State which the concessionnaire's engineers may deem necessary for the construction of the whole or any part of the above-mentioned works. As for cultivated lands belonging to the State, the concessionnaire must purchase them at the fair and current price of the province.

The Government also grants to the concessionnaire the right of acquiring all and any other lands or buildings necessary for the said purpose, with the consent of the proprietors, on such conditions as may be arranged between him and them without their being allowed to make demands of a nature to surcharge the prices ordinarily current for lands situate in their respective localities.

Holy places with all their dependencies within a radius of 200 Persian archines are formally excluded.

'''Article 4.''' As three petroleum mines situate at Schouster, Kassre-Chirine, in the Province of Kermanschah, and Daleki, near Bouchir, are at present let to private persons and produce an annual revenue of two thousand tomans for the benefit of the Government, it has been agreed that the three aforesaid mines shall be comprised in the Deed of Concession in conformity with Article 1, on condition that, over and above the 16 per cent mentioned in Article 10, the concessionnaire shall pay every year the fixed sum of 2,000 (two thousand) tomans to the Imperial Government.

'''Article 5.''' The course of the pipe-lines shall be fixed by the concessionnaire and his engineers.

'''Article 6.''' Notwithstanding what is above set forth, the privelege granted by these presents shall not extend to the provinces of Azerbadjan, Ghilan, Mazendaran, Asdrabad, and Khorassan, but on the express condition that the Persian Imperial Government shall not grant to any other person the right of constructing a pipe-line to the southern rivers or to the South coast of Persia.

'''Article 7.''' All lands granted by these presents to the concessionnaire or that may be acquired by him in the manner provided for in Articles 3 and 4 of these presents, as also all products exported, shall be free of all imposts and taxes during the term of the present concession. All material and apparatuses necessary for the exploration, working and development of the deposits, and for the construction and development of the pipe- lines, shall enter Persia free of all taxes and Custom-House duties.

'''Article 8.''' The concessionnaire shall immediately send out to Persia and at his own cost one or several experts with a view to their exploring the region in which there exist, as he believes, the said products, and in the event of the report of the expert being in the opinion of the concessionnaire of a satisfactory nature, the latter shall immediately send to Persia and at his own cost all the technical staff necessary, with the working plant and machinery required for boring and sinking wells and ascertaining the value of the property.

'''Article 9.''' The Imperial Persian Government authorises the concessionnaire to found one or several companies for the working of the concession.

The names, "statutes" and capital of the said companies shall be fixed by the concessionnaire, and the directors shall be chosen by him on the express condition that, on the formation of each company, the concessionnaire shall give official notice of such information to the Imperial Government, through the medium of the Imperial Commissioner, and shall forward the "statutes", with information as to the places at which such company is to operate. Such company or companies shall enjoy all the rights and priveleges granted to the concessionnaire, but they must assume all his engagements and responsibilities.

'''Article 10.''' It shall be stipulated in the contract between the concessionnaire, of the one part, and the company, of the other part, that the latte is, within the term of one month as from the date of the formation of the first exploitation company, to pay the Imperial Persian Government the sum of 20,000 sterling in cash, and an additional sum of 20,000 sterling in paid-up shares of the first company founded by virtue of the foregoing article. It shall also pay the said Government annually a sum equal to 16 per cent of the annual net profits of any company or companies that may be formed in accordance with the said article.

'''Article 11.''' The said Government shall be free to appoint an Imperial Commissioner, who shall be consulted by the concessionnaire and the directors of the companies to be formed. He shall supply all and any useful information at his disposal, and he shall inform them of the best course to be adopted in the interest of the undertaking. He shall establish, by agreement with the concessionnaire, such supervision as he may deem expedient to safeguard the interests of the Imperial Government.

The aforesaid powers of the Imperial Commissioner shall be set forth in the "statutes" of the companies created.

The concessionnaire shall pay the Commissioner thus appointed an annual sum of 1,000 sterling for his services as from the date of the formation of the first company.

'''Article 12.''' The workmen employed in the service of the company shall be subject to His Imperial Majesty the Shah, except the technical staff, such as the managers, engineers, borers and foremen.

'''Article 13.''' At any place in which it may be proved that the inhabitants of the country now obtain petroleum for their own use, the company must supply them gratuitously with the quantity of petroleum that they themselves got previously. Such quantity shall be fixed according to their own declarations, subject to the supervision of the local authority.

'''Article 14.''' The Imperial Government binds itself to take all and any necessary measures to secure the safety and the carrying out of the object of this concession of the plant and of the apparatuses, of which mention is made, for the purposes of the undertaking of the company, and to protect the representatives, agents and servents of the company. The Imperial Government having thus fulfilled its engagements, the concessionnaire and the companies created by him shall not have power, under any pretext whatever, to claim damages from the Persian Government.

'''Article 15.''' On the expiration of the term of the present concession, all materials, buildings and apparatuses then used by the company for the exploitation of its industry shall become the property of the said Government, and the company shall have no right to any indemnity in this connection.

'''Article 16.''' If within the term of two years as from the present date the concessionnaire shall not have established the first said companies authorised by Article 9 of the present agreement, the present concession shall become null and void.

'''Article 17.''' In the event of there arising between the parties to the present concession any dispute of difference in respect of its interpretation or the rights or responsibilities of one or the other of the parties therefrom resulting, such dispute or difference shall be submitted to two arbitrators at Tehran, one of whom shall be named by each of the parties, and to an umpire who shall be appointed by the arbitrators before the proceed to arbitrate. The decision of the arbitrators or, in the event of the latter disagreeing, that of the umpire shall be final.

'''Article 18.''' This Act of Concession, made in duplicate, is written in the French language and translated into Persian with the same meaning.

But, in the event of there being any dispute in relation to such meaning, the French text shall alone prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Modern Middle East|last=James|first=Gelvin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=154–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early business==
Once D'Arcy was granted the oil concession, his first order of business was to assemble a team to carry out the exploration for oil.  The assembled team would carry out the daily operations in Persia for D'Arcy, as he would never set foot on Persian soil.&lt;ref name="Bakhtiari 2001, p.22"/&gt;  D'Arcy hired Alfred T. Marriot to secure the concession and Dr. M. Y. Young to be the company's medical officer in Persia.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.121"/&gt;  George Reynolds was hired for the exploration because of his previous drilling experience.  The first area chosen to explore for oil was Chiah Surkh, which is located near what is today's Iran-[[Iraq]] border.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.122"&gt;Yergin (2008), p.122.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The task for D'Arcy and his team would prove to be very difficult.  This first site at Chiah Surkh had hostile terrain, warring tribes that often refused to recognize the Shah's authority and any concessions he granted, very few roads for transportation, and was nearly three hundred miles away from the [[Persian Gulf]].  The local population near the site also had a hostile culture towards Western ideas, technology and presence.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.122"/&gt;  Local religion also played a factor as the dominating [[Shia]] sect in this region also resisted political authority and had a hostile attitude towards the outside world, including [[Christian]]s and [[Sunni]] [[Moslem]]s.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.122"/&gt;  Not only was the region and terrain hostile, but shipping each piece of equipment to the drilling sites was also extremely difficult.  The equipment often had to be carried by man and [[mule]] through mountainous terrain.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.122"/&gt;

==Drilling for oil==
The actual drilling did not begin until the end of 1902.  The working conditions were rough, as temperatures reached as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit, equipment often broke down, there were shortages of food and water, and there was an abundance of [[insect]]s that often bothered the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (2008), pp.122-123.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1903 D'Arcy began to worry as very little oil had been found and he began to run out of money.  Expenses continued to mount as he already spent £160,000 and needed at least another £120,000.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (2008) pp.123-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  It became evident that D'Arcy would either need more funding through loans or he would need to be bought out.

===Search for funding===
After being advised by Thomas Boverton Redwood, who was very knowledgeable on international oil developments, D'Arcy tried applying for a loan from the [[British Admiralty]].  At this time, before oil was considered a critical resource, the loan was ultimately denied.  Shortly after D'Arcy's loan was denied, one of the wells at Chiah Surkh, in early 1904, became a producer.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.124"&gt;Yergin (2008), p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;  The output of oil was small, as the well only produced about 200 gallons per day.&lt;ref name="Paine 1975, p.6"&gt;Paine (1975), p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  With or without this well being turned into a producer, D'Arcy still needed money to continue his venture.  D'Arcy became busy looking around for investors and he even began to search in [[France]] for foreign investors, without much success.  To make matters worse, shortly after they struck oil, the well at Chiah Surkh began to run out and turn into a trickle.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.124"/&gt;

===The British Admiralty intervenes===
Back in [[London]], the British Admiralty began to reconsider and feared that if they did not intervene, then D'Arcy would sell out his concession to other foreign investors or lose the concession altogether.  They feared that the French or the Russians would take over the concession and then have a major influence in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (2008), pp.124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Admiralty decided to intervene and try to play matchmaker and find an investor to help out D'Arcy and keep the concession under British control. One way they did this was using a British spy named Sidney Reilly, who allegedly disguised himself as a priest, and convinced D'Arcy to sell the majority of his concession to a "good 'Christian' enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The D'Arcy Concession|last=Michael|first=Zadell|publisher=Calliope|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were successful and with the help of Redwood they were able to strike a deal with the firm called [[Burmah Oil]].  D'Arcy and Burmah Oil made the deal in London in 1905 that made an agreement establishing the Concession Syndicate, renamed as the Anglo Persian Oil Co.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (2008), pp.125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New drilling site===
With new capital being provided by the agreement with Burmah Oil, the exploration was able to continue.  The focus for drilling now shifted towards southwestern Persia.  The drilling site was closed at Chiah Surkh and the equipment was shipped to the southwest of Persia.  The new drilling site was established at [[Masjid-i-Suleiman]].&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (2008), p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again Reynolds encountered problems in this region with hostile tribes and the local population.  Reynolds often had to pay them a high fee and guarantee them a share of profits in order to protect the concession.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (2008), p.129.&lt;/ref&gt;  Disease also slowed down production and even Reynolds became very ill from contaminated [[drinking water]].
	
In 1907, without any major findings of oil, D'Arcy once again became anxious.  He decided to sell off the majority of his shares to Burmah Oil for £203,067 cash and £900,000 in shares.  This meant Burmah acquired the majority of D'Arcy's interests in the exploitation company.&lt;ref name="Paine 1975, p.6"/&gt;

===Major discovery===
After mounting expenditure, continuous funding from Burmah Oil and very few results, Burmah also began to grow impatient.  It was now 1908 and no commercial quantities of oil had been found and it began to seem as if the beginning of the end was near.  Burmah Oil sent a letter to Reynolds telling him to slow down production and pack up the equipment because the project was nearly over.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (2008), p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as the letter was making its way to Reynolds, at 4:00 am on May 26, 1908, people at the site woke up to shouting, as a fifty-foot gusher of petroleum shot up the [[drilling rig]].&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (2008), pp.130-131.&lt;/ref&gt;  At last, commercial quantities of oil had been struck at the Masjid-i-Suleiman site.

==Creation of Anglo-Persian==
In 1909, shortly after the commercial quantities of oil were found, Burmah Oil thought that a new corporate structure needed to be created in order to work the concession.&lt;ref name="Yergin 2008, p.132"&gt;Yergin (2008), p.132.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the creation of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] and Burmah Oil made it a publicly traded company, by selling shares off to the public in 1909.   At this time Burmah Oil maintained control and the majority of the [[ordinary shares]].  William Knox D'Arcy was compensated for his exploration costs and became a director of the new company.

[[File:Ohm's Law with Voltage source TeX.svg|right|thumb|A simple electric circuit made up of a voltage source and a resistor. Here, &lt;math&gt;V=iR&lt;/math&gt;, according to [[Ohm's Law]].]]

In the theory of [[electrical network]]s, a '''dependent source'''  is a [[voltage source]] or a [[current source]] whose value depends on a voltage or current elsewhere in the network.&lt;ref name=ML96&gt;I. D. Mayergoyz, Wes Lawson ''Basic electric circuit theory: a one-semester text'' Gulf Professional Publishing, 1996 
{{ISBN|0-12-480865-4}}, Chapter 8 "Dependent sources and operational amplifiers"&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependent sources are useful, for example, in modelling the behavior of amplifiers. A [[bipolar junction transistor]] can be modelled as a dependent current source whose magnitude depends on the magnitude of the current fed into its controlling base terminal. An [[operational amplifier]] can be described as a voltage source dependent on the differential input voltage between its input terminals.&lt;ref name=ML96/&gt; Practical circuit elements have properties such as finite power capacity, voltage, current, or frequency limits that mean an ideal source is only an approximate model. Accurate modelling of practical devices requires using several idealized elements in combination.

Dependent sources can be classified as follows:

* Voltage-controlled voltage source: The source delivers the [[voltage]] as per the voltage of the dependent element. &lt;math&gt;V={f_a}({v_x})&lt;/math&gt;
* Voltage-controlled current source: The source delivers the [[Electric current|current]] as per the voltage of the dependent element. &lt;math&gt;I={f_b}({v_x})&lt;/math&gt;
* Current-controlled current source: The source delivers the current as per the current of the dependent element. &lt;math&gt;I={f_c}({i_x})&lt;/math&gt;
* Current-controlled voltage source: The source delivers the voltage as per the current of the dependent element. &lt;math&gt;V={f_d}({i_x})&lt;/math&gt;

Dependent sources are not necessarily linear. For example, [[MOSFET]] switches can be modeled as a voltage-controlled current source when 
&lt;math&gt;V_{\rm DS}&gt;V_{\rm GS}-V_T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm GS}&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt;.

However, the relationship between the current flowing through it and &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm DS}&lt;/math&gt; is approximately:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\rm D} = \frac{\mu_n C_{\rm ox}}{2}\frac{W}{L}(V_{\rm GS}-V_{\rm th})^2 \left(1+\lambda (V_{\rm DS}-V_{\rm DSsat})\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Gray-Meyer2&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the current is not linear to &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm DS}&lt;/math&gt;, but rather approximately proportional to the square of &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm DS}-V_T&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- dummy edit; can be deleted. --&gt;

As for the case of linear dependent sources, the proportionality constant between dependent and independent variables is dimensionless if they are both currents (or both voltages).  A voltage controlled by a current has a proportionality factor expressed in units of resistance ([[ohm]]s), and this constant is sometimes called "transresistance".  A current controlled by a voltage has the units of conductance ([[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]), and is called "transconductance".  Transconductance is a commonly used specification for measuring the performance of [[field effect transistor]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s.&lt;ref name=ML96/&gt;

'''Disulfur monoxide''' or '''sulfur suboxide''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with formula S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  It is one of the [[lower sulfur oxides]]. It is a colourless gas and condenses to give a pale coloured solid that is unstable at room temperature.&lt;ref name=Steudel&gt;R.

Disulfur monoxide was discovered by Peter W. Schenk in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schenk|first1=Peter W.|title=über das Schwefelmonoxyd|journal=Zeitschrift für Anorganische und Allgemeine Chemie|date=18 March 1933|volume=211|issue=1–2|pages=150–160|doi=10.1002/zaac.19332110117|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hall77/&gt; However, only when Myers and Meschi studied it, did the actual composition and shape of the molecule become known.&lt;ref name=Hall77/&gt;

==Preparation==
It can be formed by many methods, including combustion of sulfur vapour in a deficiency of oxygen. It arises by oxidizing [[sulfur]] with [[copper oxide]]:&lt;ref name="Satyanarayana64"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Satyanarayana|first=S. R.|author2=A. R. Vasudeva Murthy|year=1964|title=Reactions with Disulphur monoxide Solutions Obtained by the Reduction of Cupric Oxide by Elemental Sulphur|journal=Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Section A|volume=59|issue=4|url=http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/28079/1/32.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:3 S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 CuO   →   12 CuS  +  4 S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  4 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Other routes include the reaction of thionyl chloride with silver sulfide:
:SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S   →   2 AgCl  +  S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

It also arises via thermal decomposition of [[sulfur dioxide]] in a [[glow discharge]].&lt;ref name=candw/&gt;

Disulfur monoxide forms a yellow solution in carbon tetrachloride.&lt;ref name="Satyanarayana64"/&gt;  The solid can be obtained at liquid nitrogen temperatures, often appearing dark colored owing to impurities. On decomposition at room temperature it forms SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via the formation of polysulfur oxides.&lt;ref name=candw&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Inorganic Chemistry: A Comprehensive Treatise|author=Cotton and Wilkinson|year=1966|page=540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
Disulfur monoxide was first produced by P. W. Schenk in 1933&lt;ref name=Steudel/&gt; with a glow discharge though sulfur vapour and sulfur dioxide. He discovered that the gas could survive for hours at single digit pressures of mercury in clean glass, but decomposed near 30mm Hg  Schenk assigned the formula as SO and called it [[sulfur monoxide]].  In 1940 K Kondrat'eva and V Kondrat'ev proposed the formula as S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[disulfur dioxide]].  In 1956, D. J. Meschi and R.  J. Myers established the formula as S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|title=Disulfur Monoxide. I.

S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O can be found coming from volcanoes on [[Io (moon)|Io]].  It can form from 1 to 6% when hot 100 bar S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas erupts from volcanoes.

Disulfur monoxide is a [[ligand]] bound to [[transition metal]]s. These are formed by oxidation peroxide oxidation of a disulfur ligands. Excessive oxygen can yield a dioxygendisulfur ligand, which can be reduced in turn with [[triphenylphosphine]].

'''Heinrich Friedrich Emil Lenz''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɛ|n|t|s}}; {{IPA-de|lɛnts|lang}}; also '''Emil Khristianovich Lenz''', {{lang-ru|Эмилий Христианович Ленц}}; 12 February 1804 – 10 February 1865),  usually cited as '''Emil Lenz''',&lt;ref&gt;[[I. Grattan-Guinness]] (ed.), ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences, Volume 2'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003, p. 1213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lezhneva/&gt; was a Russian [[physicist]] of [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German ethnicity]]. He is most noted for formulating [[Lenz's law]] in electrodynamics in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Lenz, E. (1834), "[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k151161/f499.image.r=lenz.langEN Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; die Bestimmung der Richtung der durch elektodynamische Vertheilung erregten galvanischen Ströme]", ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', '''107''' (31), pp. 483–494. A partial translation of the paper is available in  Magie, W. M. (1963), ''A Source Book in Physics'', Harvard: Cambridge MA, pp. 511–513.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lenz was born in [[Tartu|Dorpat]] (nowadays Tartu, [[Estonia]]), at that time in the [[Governorate of Livonia]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. After completing his secondary education in 1820, Lenz studied chemistry and physics at the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]].&lt;ref name=Lezhneva&gt;{{DSB |first=Olga | last=Lezhneva | title=Lenz, Emil Khristianovich (Heinrich Fridrich Emil)  | volume=8 | pages=187-189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled with the navigator [[Otto von Kotzebue]] on his third expedition around the world from 1823 to 1826. On the voyage Lenz studied climatic conditions and the physical properties of [[seawater]]. The results have been published in "Memoirs of the [[St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences]]" (1831). 

After the voyage, Lenz began working at the [[University of St. Petersburg, Russia]], where he later served as the Dean of Mathematics and Physics from 1840 to 1863 and was [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] from 1863 until his death in 1865. Lenz also taught at the [[Petrischule]] in 1830 and 1831, and at the [[Mikhailovskaya Artillery Academy]].

Lenz had begun studying [[electromagnetism]] in 1831. Besides the law named in his honor, Lenz also independently discovered [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]] in 1842; to honor his efforts on the problem, it is also given the name the "Joule–Lenz law," named also for [[James Prescott Joule]].

Lenz eagerly participated in development of the [[electroplating]] technology, invented by his friend and colleague [[Moritz von Jacobi]]. In 1839, Lenz produced several [[medallion]]s using [[electrotyping]]. Along with the electrotyped relief produced by Jacobi the same year, these were the first instances of [[Galvanoplastic|galvanoplastic sculpture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galteh.ru/article_galvanotehnika.html History of electroplating in the 19th century Russia]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305183445/http://www.galteh.ru/article_galvanotehnika.html |date=2012-03-05 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lenz died in [[Rome]], after suffering from a stroke.

A small lunar [[Lents (crater)|crater]] on the far side of the [[moon]] is named after him.

==Appearance==
Engkanto have many similarities to humans in that they age, appear to have male and female sexes, can suffer from illness and indeed even die. They are an object of mythology for many Filipinos. Often told by adults as stories and shown on media. They have different appearances. Some appear to be beautiful having blue eyes, fair complexion and golden hair.&lt;ref name=Demetrio /&gt;  They may however have unusual features such as high-bridged noses, fair skin, blond hair and lack of [[philtrum]]. They have a wide range of appearances but one common fact of a different feeling or vibe than humans.&lt;ref name="ramos"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramos |first=Maximo D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |pages=55–56 |title=Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology |year=1971 |publisher=University of the Philippines Press |location=Philippines |oclc=804797}} {{ISBN|971-06-0691-3}} (Quezon City Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Other variants exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]] such as [[Bagobo]] spirits which are separated into the female ''tahamaling'' and the male ''mahomanay''. The female spirit is alleged to have red complexion while the male have a fair complexion.&lt;ref name="ramos" /&gt; Their dwellings will normally appear as natural features, for example large rocks or trees, or shadows in human form; although to humans they have befriended they can appear as magnificent palaces.&lt;ref name=Demetrio /&gt; These creatures prefer large trees and nature such as the ''[[Banyan|balete]]'' in which they also place their belongings.&lt;ref name="ramos"/&gt; An engkanto may choose to stay by a human's side as told by stories where characters are usually in either a sense of trance or a deep loss of energy. Engkanto may be good or bad.

==Capabilities==

Engkanto are most commonly known for either extreme malignant effects, or an overwhelming influence of luck. Those the Engkanto do not favor had become depressed, suffered from madness, or even disappeared for days or months, possibly as a result of the human possession.&lt;ref name=Demetrio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tremlett |first=Paul-François |title=The Ethics of Suspicion in the Study of Religions |year=2007 |journal=DISKUS |volume=8 |url=http://www.basr.ac.uk/diskus/diskus8/Tremlett.htm |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416193040/http://www.basr.ac.uk/diskus/diskus8/Tremlett.htm |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also said to be capable of causing [[fever]]s and skin diseases such as [[boil]]s. These spirits also sometimes lead travelers astray in the forest, even kidnap them. This, however, is said to be avoidable by bringing an "''[[Anting-anting]]''" or "''[[Agimat]]''" a piece of magical [[Amulet|charm]] or [[amulet]] that wards away evil spirits and prevents them from harming the wielder.&lt;ref name=VanRheenan /&gt; However, if they do favor someone they are generous and capable of bringing power and riches to that person.  [[Shamanism|Shaman]] often try to commune with Engkanto on holy days to obtain better healing powers from them, as well as learning how to better deal with evil spirits.&lt;ref name=Demetrio /&gt;

==Study==
Francisco Demetrio made a study of 87 folk stories from [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]] relating to Engkanto. He contended the Engkanto were based on early European [[friars]].&lt;ref name=Aguilar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Demetrio/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26927">[[File:Kalolis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Industrial Filter press]]
An '''industrial filter press''' is a tool used in [[separation process]]es, specifically to separate solids and liquids. The process uses the principle of pressure drive,{{huh|date=July 2017}} as provided by a [[slurry pump]]. Among other uses, filter presses are utilized in marble factories in order to separate water from mud in order to reuse the water during the marble cutting process.

==Concept behind filter press technology==
Generally, the slurry that will be separated is injected into the center of the press and each chamber of the press is filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIEMENS. 2011. What is a Filter Press? |url=http://www.micronicsinc.com/technical-data/faq/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal filling time will ensure the last chamber of the press is loaded before the mud in the first chamber begins to cake. As the chambers fill, pressure inside the system will increase due to the formation of thick sludge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Filter Presses|url=http://www.micronicsinc.com/products/filter-presses/special-filter-presses/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the liquid is strained through filter cloths by force using pressurized air, but the use of water could be more cost-efficient in certain cases, such as if water was re-used from a previous process.

==History==
The first form of filter press was invented in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1853, used in obtaining [[seed oil]] through the use of pressure cells. However, there were many disadvantages associated with them, such as high labour requirement and discontinuous process. Major developments in filter press technology started in the middle of 20th century. In Japan in 1958, [[Kenichiro Kurita]] and [[Seiichi Suwa]] succeeded in developing the world's first automatic horizontal-type filter press to improve the cake removal efficiency and moisture absorption. Nine years later, [[Kurita Company]] began developing flexible [[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragms]] to decrease moisture in filter cakes. The device enables optimisation of the automatic filtration cycle, cake compression, cake discharge and filter-cloth washing leading to the increment in opportunities for various industrial applications.&lt;ref name="Shirato"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micronicsinc.com/products/filter-presses/mining-presses/|title=LASTA MC Mineral Concentrate Mining Presses and Dewatering Presses|work=micronicsinc.com|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A detailed historical review, dating back to when the Shang Dynasty used presses to extract [[tea]] from [[camellia]] the leaves and oil from the hips in 1600 BC, was compiled by K. McGrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGrew|first1=Kent|title=Historical Development of the Automated Filter Press|url=http://tonsperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/Historical-AFP-Development.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of filter presses==
There are three main basic types of filter presses: plate and frame filter presses, recessed plate and frame filter presses and automatic filter presses.

===Plate and frame filter press===
A plate and frame filter press is the most fundamental design, and many now refer it as a "membrane filter plate". This type of filter press consists of many plates and frames assembled alternately with the supports of a pair of rails. The presence of a centrifuge pump ensures the remaining [[suspended solids]] do not settle in the system, and its main function is to deliver the suspension into each of the separating chambers in the plate and frame filter. For each of the individual separating chambers, there is one hollow filter frame separated from two filter plates by filter cloths. The introduced [[slurry]] flows through a port in each individual frame, and the filter cakes are accumulated in each hollow frame. As the filter cake becomes thicker, the filter resistance increases as well. So when the separating chamber is full, the filtration process is stopped as the optimum pressure difference is reached. The [[filtrate]] that passes through filter cloth is collected through collection pipes and stored in the filter tank. Filter cake (suspended solid) accumulation occurs at the hollow plate frame, then being separated at the filter plates by pulling the plate and frame filter press apart. The cakes then fall off from those plates and are discharged to the final collection point.&lt;ref name="IWA PUBLISHING"&gt;{{cite book|last=Von Sperling|first=M|title=Biological Wastewater Treatment: Wastewater Characteristics Treatment and Disposal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHSKO7Gz7ykC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=post+treatment+for+filter+press#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|publisher=IWA PUBLISHING|accessdate=06/10/13|isbn=9781843391616|date=2007-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cake discharge can be done in many ways. For example: Shaking the plates while they are being opened or shaking the cloths. A scraper can also be used, by moving from one chamber to another and scraping the cake off the cloth. At the end of each run, the cloths are cleaned using wash liquid and are ready to start the next cycle.&lt;ref name="SUTHERLAND 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=SUTHERLAND|first=K|title=Filters and Filtration Handbook (5th edition)|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automatic filter press===
An automatic filter press has the same concept as the manual filter and frame filter, except that the whole process is fully [[Automation|automated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tons Per Hour Product Guide|url=http://tonsperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/TPH_PG_2016_Eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of larger plate and frame filter presses with mechanical "plate shifters".&lt;ref name="Shirato"/&gt; The function of the plate shifter is to move the plates and allow rapid discharge of the filter cakes accumulated in between the plates. It also contains a diaphragm compressor in the filter plates which aids in optimizing the operating condition by further drying the filter cakes.&lt;ref name="Shirato"/&gt;

===Recessed plate filter press===
A recessed plate filter press is made up of polypropylene squares at about 2 to 4 feet across with a concave depression and a hole in the center of each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Biosolids technology fact sheet : Recessed-plate filter press, washington, D.C.|url=http://www.micronicsinc.com/products/filter-plates/recessed-filter-plates/|accessdate=05/10/13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two plates join together to form a chamber to pressurize the slurry and squeeze the filtrate out through the filter cloth lining in the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Biosolids technology fact sheet : Recessed-plate filter press, washington, D.C.|url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/water/biosolids/pdf/BiosolidsTechSheetPlatePress.pdf|accessdate=05/10/13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is capable of holding 12 to 80 plates adjacent to each other, depending on the required capacity. When the filter press is closed, a series of chambers is formed. The differences with the plate and frame filter are that the plates are joined together in such a way that the cake forms in the recess on each plate, meaning that the cake thickness is restricted to 32mm unless extra frames are used as spacers.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarleton|first=E. S. W., R. J|title=Solid/liquid separation - equipment selection and process design,|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-080-46717-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are disadvantages to this method, such as longer cloth changing time, inability to accommodate filter papers, and the possibility of forming uneven cake.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt;

==Applications==
Filter presses are used in a huge variety of different applications, from [[dewatering]] of mineral [[mining]] slurries to [[blood plasma]] purification.&lt;ref name="SUTHERLAND 2008"/&gt; At the same time, filter press technology is widely established for ultrafine [[coal]] dewatering as well as filtrate recovery in coal preparation plants. According to G.Prat, the "filter press is proven to be the most effective and reliable technique to meet today's requirement".&lt;ref name="SME2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kilma|first1=M. S.|last2=Arnold|first2=Barbara J.|last3=Bethell|first3=Peter J.|title=Challenges in Fine Coal Processing, Dewatering, and Disposal (Chapter 10)|date=2012|publisher=Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (SME)|isbn=978-0-87335-363-2|url=http://app.knovel.com/web/toc.v/cid:kpCFCPDD08/viewerType:toc/root_slug:challenges-in-fine-coal/url_slug:challenges-in-fine-coal/?kpromoter=legacy|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the examples is Pilot scale plate filter press, which is specialized in dewatering coal slurries. In 2013 the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration published an article highlighting this specific application.&lt;ref name="SME"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kilma|first1=M. S.|last2=Arnold|first2=Barbara J.|last3=Munjack|first3=J.|last4=Barry|first4=B.|title=Application of a Pilot-Scale Plate Filter Press in Dewatering Coal Slurries.|year=2013|publisher=Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration (SME)|isbn=978-1-62198-038-4|pages=42–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was mentioned that the use of the filter press is very beneficial to plant operations, since it offers dewatering ultraclean coal as product, as well as improving quality of water removed to be available for equipment cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lessard|first1=Paul|title=Filter Press Doubles Coal Production|url=http://tonsperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/AnthraciteCoal_CS_Eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other industrial uses for automatic membrane filter presses include municipal waste sludge dewatering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Waste Dewatering with a Filter Press|url=http://tonsperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/TPH_Municipal_Waste_Treatment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ready mix concrete water recovery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lessard|first1=Paul|title=Concrete Ready Mix Wash-Out Water|url=http://tonsperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/Argo_CS_Eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; metal concentrate recovery, and large-scale fly ash pond dewatering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lessard|first1=Paul|title=Large-Scale Fly Ash Pond Dewatering|url=http://tonsperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/White-Paper-on-Fly-Ash-Dewatering-with-a-TPH-Filter-Press.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many specialized applications are associated with different types of filter press that are currently used in various industries. Plate filter press is extensively used in [[sugaring]] operations such as the production of [[maple syrup]] in [[Canada]], since it offers very high efficiency and reliability. According to M.Isselhardt, "appearance can affect the value of maple syrup and customer's perception of quality".&lt;ref name="Proctor Maple Research Center"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isselhardt|first1=M.|last2=Williams|first2=S.|last3=Stowe|first3=B.|last4=Perkins|first4=T.|title=Recommendations for Proper Plate Filter Press Operation|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pmrc/filter_press_brochure.pdf|website=Proctor Maple Research Center|publisher=University of Vermont Extension|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the raw syrup filtration process extremely crucial in achieving desired product with high quality and appealing form, which again suggested how highly appreciated filter press methods are in industry.

===Feed===
Typical range of particle size and feed concentration are 1-100 μm and 1-30% by weight.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt; The slurry feed concentration generally has large amount of [[ultrafine particle]]s. The percentage of solids concentration in the slurry feed is normally more than 10% by weight.&lt;ref name="SME"/&gt;

===Operation===
Limitation in pressure resistance of the filter cake is up to a maximum of 800 kPa.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt; Flow rate of filtrate is controlled by feed pump. In filter press methodology, positive pressure filtration is used instead of vacuum filtration with high-energy consumption.&lt;ref name="IWA PUBLISHING"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHEREMISINOFF, N. P. 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=CHEREMISINOFF, N. P.|title=Liquid Filtration (2nd Edition)|year=1998|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-0805-1036-1|url=http://app.knovel.com/web/toc.v/cid:kpLFE00001/viewerType:toc/root_slug:liquid-filtration-2nd/url_slug:liquid-filtration-2nd/?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficiency===
Plate and frame filter press produce up to 99% of solids recovery, and the moisture left in the cake commonly ranges from 15% to 20%.&lt;ref name="SME"/&gt; During cake washing, 90% of the filtrate can be removed by the wash liquid.&lt;ref name="Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J H HARKER |author2=J. R. B. |author3=J.F. RICHARDSON |title=Coulson &amp; Richardson Chemical Engineering Particle Technology &amp; Separation Processes|publisher=Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=0750644451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment of important characteristics==
Here are some typical filter press calculation used for handling operation applied in waste water treatment:

===Solids loading rate===
S={{frac|(B x 8.34 lb/gal x s)|A}}&lt;br /&gt;
Where,&lt;br /&gt;
 S is the solid loadings rate in {{frac|lb|h|ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;r /&gt;
 B is biosolids in {{frac|gal|h}}&lt;br /&gt;
 s is the % solids/ 100.&lt;br /&gt;
 A is the plate area in ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Net filter yield===
&lt;math&gt;NFY=\frac{S\times P}{TCT}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*NFY  is the net filter yield in kg/h/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. 
*S    is the solids loadings rate in kg/h/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. 
*P    is the period in h. 
*TCT  is the total cycle time in h.
(S × P) gives the filter run time.&lt;ref name="F.R. Spellman"&gt;{{cite book|last=F.R. Spellman|title=Handbook of water and waste water treatment plant operations, (second edition)|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow rate of filtrate===
&lt;math&gt;u=\frac{1}{A}\frac{dV}{dt}=\frac{\Delta P}{\mu\times(R_c+R_f)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*u is flow rate of filtrate through cloth and cake (m/s), 
*dV/dt is volumetric filtration rate (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s), 
*R&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the resistance of the filter cake (m-1), 
*R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial resistance of the filter (resistance of an initial layer of cake, filter cloths, plate and channel)  (m-1),  
*&amp;mu; is the [[viscosity]] of the filtrate (N·s/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),  
*&amp;Delta;P is the applied pressure difference (N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) one side to another side of the filter medium, 
*A is the filtration area (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Those are the most important factors that affect the rate of filtration. When filtrate pass through the filter plate, deposition of solids are formed and increases the cake thickness, which also increase Rc while Rf is assumed to be constant.&lt;ref name="CHEREMISINOFF, N. P 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=CHEREMISINOFF, N. P|title=Liquid Filtration (2nd Edition)|year=1998|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-0805-1036-1|url=http://app.knovel.com/web/toc.v/cid:kpLFE00001/viewerType:toc/root_slug:liquid-filtration-2nd/url_slug:liquid-filtration-2nd/?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flow resistance from cake and filter medium can be studied by calculating the flow rate of filtration through them.

If the flow rate is constant, the relationship between pressure and time can be obtained. The filtration must be operated by increasing pressure difference to cope with the increase in flow resistance resulting from pore clogging.&lt;ref name="CHEREMISINOFF, N. P 1998"/&gt; The filtration rate is mainly affected by viscosity of the filtrate as well as resistance of the filter plate and cake.

==Optimum time cycle==
High filtration rate can be obtained from producing thin cake. However, a conventional filter press is a batch system and the process must be stopped to discharge the filter cake and reassemble the press, which is time consuming. Practically, maximum filtration rate is obtained when the filtration time is greater than the time taken to discharge the cake and reassemble the press to allow for cloth's resistance.&lt;ref name="CHEREMISINOFF, N. P 1998"/&gt;
Properties of the filter cake affect the filtration rate, and it is desirable for the particle's size to be as large as possible to prevent pore blockage by using a [[Flocculation|coagulant]]. From experimental work, flow rate of liquid through the filter medium is proportional to the pressure difference.&lt;ref name="Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann"/&gt; As the cake layer forms, pressure applies to the system increases and the flow rate of filtrate decreases.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt; If the solid is desired, the purity of the solid can be increased by cake washing and air drying.&lt;ref name="D.W Green, R 2022"/&gt;
Sample of filter cake can be taken from different locations and weighed to determine the moisture content by using overall material balance.&lt;ref name="SME"/&gt;

==Possible heuristics to be used during design of the process==
The selecting of filter press type depends on the value of liquid phase or the solid phase. If extracting liquid phase is desired, then filter press is among the most appropriate methods to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ALEJANDRO ANAYA DURAND; JOSSELINE ALARID MIGUEL; GABRIEL GALLEGOS DIEZ BARROSO; LEON GARCIA, M. A. J. P. S. A.|title=Heuristics Rules for Process Equipment. Chemical Engineering|year=2006|pages=113, 44–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Nowadays, filter plates are made from [[polymers]] or steel coated with polymer. They give good drainage surface for filter cloths. The plate sizes are ranged from 10 by 10&amp;nbsp;cm to 2.4 by 2.4 m and 0.3 to 20&amp;nbsp;cm for the frame thickness.&lt;ref name="D.W Green, R 2022"/&gt;

==Filter medium==
Typical cloth areas can range from  1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or less on laboratory scale to 1000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a production environment, even though plates can provide filter areas up to 2000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Normally, plate and frame filter press can form up to 50&amp;nbsp;mm of cake thickness, however, it can be push up to 200&amp;nbsp;mm for extreme cases. Recessed plate press can form up to 32&amp;nbsp;mm of cake thickness.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt;

In the early days of press use in the municipal waste [[biosolids]] treatment industry, issues with cake sticking to the cloth was problematic and many treatment plants adopted less effective [[centrifuge]] or [[belt filter]] press technologies.  Since then, there have been great enhancements in fabric quality and manufacturing technology that have made this issue obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jingjin Filter Cloth Manufacture and Quality Control|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/cpyskxuxmubmqm6/Jingjin%20Filter%20Cloth%20Manufacture%20and%20Quality%20Control.mov?dl=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the USA, automatic membrane filter technology is the most common method to dewater municipal waste biosolids in Asia. Moisture is typically 10-15% lower and less polymer is required—which saves on trucking and overall disposal cost.

==Operating condition==
The operating pressure is commonly up to 7 bars for metal.&lt;ref name="D.W Green, R 2022"/&gt; The improvement of the technology makes it possible to remove large amount of moisture at 16 bar of pressure and operate at 30 bars.&lt;ref name="SUTHERLAND 2008"/&gt; However, the pressure is 4-5 bars for wood or plastic frames.&lt;ref name="D.W Green, R 2022"/&gt;  If the concentration of solids in the feed tank increase until the solid particles are attached to each other. It is possible to install moving blades in the filter press to reduce resistance to flow of liquid through the slurry.&lt;ref name="CHEREMISINOFF, N. P. 1998"/&gt;
For the process prior to cake discharge, air blowing is used for cakes that have permeability of 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="SME"/&gt;

==Pre-treatment==
Pre-treatment of the slurries before filtration is required if the solid suspension has settled down.  Coagulation as pre-treatment can improve the performance of filter press because it increases the porosity of the filter cake leading to faster filtration. Varying the temperature, concentration and [[pH]] can control the size of the flocs. Moreover, if the filter cake is impermeable and difficult for the flow of filtrate, filter aid chemical can be added to the pre-treatment process to increase the porosity of the cake, reduce the cake resistance and obtain thicker cake. However, filter aids need to be able to remove from the filter cake either by physical or chemical treatment. A common filter aid is Kieselguhr, which give 0.85 voidage.&lt;ref name="CHEREMISINOFF, N. P. 1998"/&gt;

In terms of cake handling, batch filter press requires large discharge tray size in order to contain large amount of cake and the system is more expensive compared to continuous filter press with the same output.&lt;ref name="SUTHERLAND 2008"/&gt;

==Washing==
There are two possible methods of washing that are being employed, the "simple washing" and the "thorough washing". For simple washing, the wash liquor flows through the same channel as the slurry with high velocity, causing erosion of the cakes near the point of entry. Thus the channels formed are constantly enlarged and therefore uneven cleaning is normally obtained. A better technique is by thorough washing in which the wash liquor is introduced through a different channel behind the filter cloth called washing plates. It flows through the whole thickness of the cakes in opposite direction first and then with the same direction as the filtrate. The wash liquor is normally discharged through the same channel as the filtrate. After washing, the cakes can be easily removed by supplying compressed air to remove the excess liquid.&lt;ref name="D.W Green, R 2022"/&gt;

==Waste==
Nowadays filter presses are widely used in many industries, they would also produce different types of wastes. Harmful wastes such as toxic chemical from dye industries, as well as pathogen from waste stream might accumulate in the waste cakes; hence the requirement for treating those wastes would be different. Therefore, before discharge waste stream into the environment, application of post-treatment would be an important disinfection stage. It is to prevent health risks to the local population and the workers that are dealing with the waste (filter cakes) as well as preventing negative impacts to our ecosystem. Since filter press would produce large amount of waste, if it was to be disposed by land reclamation, it is recommended to dispose to the areas that are drastically altered like mining areas where development and fixation of vegetation are not possible. Another method is by incineration, which would destroy the organic pollutants and decrease the mass of the waste. It is usually done in a closed device by using a controlled flame.&lt;ref name="IWA PUBLISHING"/&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages compared to other competitive methods==
Many debates have been discussed about whether or not filter presses are sufficient to compete with modern equipment currently as well as in the future, since filter presses were among one of the oldest machine-driven dewatering devices. Efficiency improvements are possible in many applications where modern filter presses have the best characteristics for the job, however, despite the fact that many mechanical improvements have been made, filter presses still remain to operate on the same concept as when first invented. A lack of progress in efficiency improvement as well as a lack of research on conquering associated issues surrounding filter presses have suggested a possibility of performance inadequacy. At the same time, many other types of filter could do the same or better job as press filters. In certain cases, it is crucial to compare characteristics and performances.&lt;ref name="PERLMUTTER, B"&gt;{{cite web|last=PERLMUTTER, B|title=A REVIEW OF FILTER PRESS BASICS AND ISSUES VERSUS ALTERNATIVE BATCH OR CONTINUOUS REPLACEMENT TECHNOLOGIES|url=http://www.globalspec.com/FeaturedProducts/Detail/BHSFiltration/Filter_Press_Basics_PROs_CONs_Alternatives/76520/1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Batch filter press versus a continuous vacuum belt filter==
Filter presses offer a wide range of application, one of its main propositions is the ability to provide a large filter area in a relatively small footmark. Surface area available is one of the most important dimensions in any filtering process, since it maximises filter flow rate and capacity.  A standard size filter press offers a filter area of 216&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas a standard belt filter only offers approximately 15&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="PERLMUTTER, B"/&gt;

==High-solids slurries: continuous pressure operation==
Filter presses are commonly used to dewater high-solids slurries in metal processing plants, one of the press filter technology that could deliver the job is the Rotary Pressure Filter method, which provides continuous production in a single unit, where filtration is directed via pressure. However, in cases where solids concentration in high-solids slurries is too high (50%+), it is better to handle these slurries using vacuum filtration, such as a continuous Indexing Vacuum Belt Filter, since high concentration of solids in slurries will increase pressure and if pressure is too high, the equipment might be damaged and/or less efficient operation.&lt;ref name="PERLMUTTER, B"/&gt;

==Current development==
In the future, market demands for modern filtration industry are going to become finer and higher degree in separation, and particularly on the purpose of material recycling, energy saving, and green technology.  In order to meet increasing demands for higher degree of dewatering from difficult-to-filter material, super-high pressure filters are required. Therefore, the trend in increasing the pressure for the automatic filter press will keep on developing in the future.

The conventional filter press mechanisms usually use mechanical compression and air to 
de-liquoring; however, the efficiency of producing low-moisture cake is limited. An alternative method has been introduced by using steam instead of air for cake dewatering. Steam dewatering technique can be a competitive method since it offers product of low-moisture cake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teemu Kinnarinen|author2=Antti Häkkinen &amp; Bjarne Ekberg|journal=Steam Dewatering of Filter Cakes in a Vertical Filter Press, Drying Technology|year=2013|pages=31:10, 1160–1169|doi=10.1080/07373937.2013.780246|title=Steam Dewatering of Filter Cakes in a Vertical Filter Press|volume=31|issue=10|first=Teemu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Framework Convention on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Carpathians''' ''(Carpathian Convention)'' is a framework type convention pursuing a comprehensive policy and cooperating in the protection and [[sustainable]] development of the Carpathians. Designed to be an innovative instrument to ensure protection and foster sustainable development of this outstanding region and living environment, the Convention is willing to improve the quality of life, to strengthen local economies and communities. 

It aims as well at providing conservation and restoration of unique, rare and typical natural complexes and objects of recreational and other importance situated in the heart of [[Europe]], preventing them from negative [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influences through the promotion of joint policies for sustainable development among the seven countries of the region ([[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Ukraine]]).

In 2001, [[United Nations]] Environment Programme / Regional Office for Europe UNEP/ROE was requested by the Government of Ukraine to service a regional cooperation process aiming at the protection and sustainable development of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], a major transboundary mountain range shared by the seven countries. In response to this request, UNEP/ROE promoted an Alpine-Carpathian Partnership. 

In 2002, during the UN International Year of the Mountains, the Alpine-Carpathian partnership has been initiated and launched by the Ministry of the Environment and Territory of [[Italy]], at the time President of the Alpine Convention. Since then, UNEP/ROE serviced five negotiation meetings of the Carpathian countries. 

At the Fifth Ministerial Conference "Environment for Europe" (Kiev, May 2003), the Carpathian countries adopted the Framework Convention on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Carpathians consequently signed by all seven countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carpathianconvention.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In combustion physics, '''fuel mass fraction''' is the ratio of [[fuel]] [[mass flow]] to the total mass flow of a fuel mixture. If an air flow is fuel free, the fuel mass fraction is zero; in pure fuel without trapped gases, the ratio is unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kanury | first = a. | title = Introduction to Combustion Phenomena | publisher = Gordon and Breach | location = New York | year = 1975 | pages = 150 | isbn = 0-677-02690-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As fuel is burned in a [[combustion]] process, the fuel mass fraction is reduced. The definition reads as

:&lt;math&gt;Y_F = \frac{m_F}{m_{\rm{tot}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*&lt;math&gt;m_F&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the fuel in the mixture
*&lt;math&gt;m_{\rm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total mass of the mixture

{{More citations needed|date=October 2012}}
Because of [[Archimedes' principle]], a '''lifting gas''' is required for [[aerostats]] to create [[buoyancy]]. Its [[density]] is lower than [[density of air|that of air]] (about 1.29&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.29 g/L). Only certain [[lighter than air]] gases are suitable as lifting gases.

== Gases theoretically suitable for lifting ==

=== Hot air ===
Heated atmospheric air is frequently used in [[Hot air balloon|recreational ballooning]]. According to the [[Ideal gas law]], an amount of gas (and also a mixture of gases such as air) expands as it is heated. As a result, a certain volume of gas has a lower weight as the temperature is higher. The average temperature of air in a hot air balloon is about {{convert|212|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Hydrogen ===
[[Hydrogen]], being the lightest existing gas (7% the density of air), seems to be the most appropriate gas for lifting. But hydrogen has several disadvantages:
* Hydrogen is extremely flammable. Some countries have banned the use of hydrogen as a lift gas for commercial vehicles but it is allowed for recreational free ballooning in the US, UK and Germany. The [[Hindenburg disaster]] is frequently cited as an example of the [[hydrogen safety]] risks posed by hydrogen. The high cost of helium (compared to hydrogen) has led researchers to re-investigate the safety issues of using hydrogen as a lift gas: with good engineering and good handling practices, the risks can be significantly reduced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* Because the hydrogen molecule is very small, it can easily [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] through many materials such as latex, so that the balloon will deflate quickly. This is one reason that many hydrogen or helium filled balloons are constructed out of [[BoPET|Mylar/BoPET]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

=== Helium ===
[[Helium]] is the second lightest gas. For that reason, it is an attractive gas for lifting as well. Small size of helium molecules increases its lifting value.

A major advantage is that this gas is noncombustible. But the use of helium has some disadvantages, too:
* The same diffusion problem as above described with hydrogen;
* Helium is expensive.
* Although abundant in the universe, helium is very scarce on Earth. The only commercially viable reserves are a few natural gas wells, mostly in the US, that trapped it from the slow [[alpha decay]] of radioactive materials within Earth. By human standards helium is a [[non-renewable resource]] that cannot be practically manufactured from other materials. When released into the atmosphere, e.g., when a helium-filled balloon leaks or bursts, helium eventually escapes into space and is lost.

=== Steam / water vapor ===
The [[Steam|gaseous state of water]] is lighter than air, incombustible and much cheaper than helium. The concept of using steam for lifting is therefore already 200 years old. The biggest challenge has always been to make a material that can resist it. In 2003, a university team in Berlin, Germany, has successfully made a 150&amp;nbsp;°C steam lifted balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroix.de/fileadmin/user_upload/aeroix/redakteure/Dokumente_HeiDAS/HeiDAS_DGLRKongress2005.pdf|title=HeiDAS UH – Ein Heissdampfaerostat mit ultra-heiss-performance|publisher=Aeroix.de|accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a design is generally impractical due to high boiling point and condensation.

=== Ammonia ===
[[Ammonia]] is sometimes used to fill [[weather balloon]]s. Due to its high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast). Ammonia gas is relatively heavy, poisonous, and an irritant.

=== Methane ===
[[Methane]], the main component of [[natural gas]], is sometimes used as a lift gas when hydrogen and helium are not available. It has the advantage of not leaking through balloon walls as rapidly as the smaller molecules of hydrogen and helium. However, methane is highly flammable and like hydrogen is not appropriate for use in passenger-carrying airships. It is also relatively dense and a potent [[greenhouse gas]].

=== Hydrogen fluoride ===
[[Hydrogen fluoride]] is lighter than air and could theoretically be used as a lifting gas. However, it is extremely corrosive, highly toxic, expensive, is heavier than other lifting gases, and has a high boiling point of 19.5 &amp;deg;C. Its use would therefore be impractical. 

=== Coal gas ===
In the past, [[coal gas]], a mixture of hydrogen, [[carbon monoxide]] and other gases, was also used in balloons. It was widely available and cheap; the down side was a higher density (reducing lift) and the high toxicity of the carbon monoxide.

=== Acetylene ===
[[Acetylene]] is 10% lighter than air and could be used as a lifting gas. Its extreme flammability and low lifting power make it an unattractive choice.

=== Hydrogen cyanide ===
[[Hydrogen cyanide]], which is 7% lighter than air, is technically capable of being used as a lifting gas at temperatures above its boiling point of 25.6 &amp;deg;C. Its extreme toxicity, low buoyancy, and high boiling point have precluded such a use.

=== Neon ===
[[Neon]] is lighter than air and could lift a balloon. Like helium, it is incombustible. However, it is rare on Earth and expensive, and is among the heavier lifting gases.

=== Nitrogen ===
Pure [[nitrogen]] has the advantage that it is [[Inert gas|inert]] and abundantly available, because it is the major component of air. However, because nitrogen is only 3% lighter than air, it is not an obvious choice for a lifting gas.

[[File:Lana airship.jpg|thumb|The [[Francesco Lana de Terzi|de Lana-Terzi's]] [[vacuum airship]] (1670)]]

=== Vacuum ===
Theoretically, an aerostatic vehicle could be made to use a [[vacuum]] or partial vacuum. As early as 1670, over a century before the first manned hot-air balloon flight,&lt;ref&gt;Tom D. Crouch (2009). Lighter Than Air&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian monk [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] envisioned a ship with four vacuum spheres.

In a theoretically perfect situation with weightless spheres, a 'vacuum balloon' would have 7% more net lifting force than a hydrogen-filled balloon, and 16% more net lifting force than a helium-filled one. However, because the walls of the balloon must be able to remain rigid without imploding, the balloon is impractical to construct with all known materials. Despite that, sometimes there is discussion on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0610222 |author=Sean A. Barton |title=Stability Analysis of an Inflatable Vacuum Chamber |journal=Journal of Applied Mechanics |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=041010 |date=21 October 2009 |doi=10.1115/1.2912742|bibcode=2008JAM....75d1010B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plasma ===
Another medium that in theory could be used is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]: [[Ion]]s repelling each other could give a pressure intermediate between vacuum and hydrogen and hence that counteracts the atmospheric pressure. 
The energy and the containment requirements are extremely impractical, so that it may only be interesting for [[science fiction]].

=== Combinations ===
It is also possible to combine some of the above solutions. A well-known example is the [[Rozière balloon]] which combines a core of helium with an outer shell of hot air.

== Hydrogen versus helium ==
[[Hydrogen]] and [[helium]] are the most commonly used lift gases. Although helium is twice as heavy as (diatomic) hydrogen, they are both significantly lighter than air, making this difference negligible.

The lifting power in air of hydrogen and helium can be calculated using the theory of [[buoyancy]] as follows:

Thus helium is almost twice as dense as hydrogen. However, buoyancy depends upon the ''difference'' of the densities (ρ&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt;) − (ρ&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;) rather than upon their ratios. Thus the difference in buoyancies is about 8%, as seen from the buoyancy equation:
: F&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = (ρ&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; - ρ&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;times; g &amp;times; V
Where F&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = Buoyant force (in [[Newton (unit)|Newton]]); g = [[gravitational acceleration]] = 9.8066 m/s² = 9.8066 N/kg; V = volume (in m³).
Therefore, the amount of mass that can be lifted by hydrogen in air at sea level, equal to the density difference between hydrogen and air, is:
: (1.292 - 0.090) kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  = 1.202&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
and the buoyant force for one m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrogen in air at sea level is:
: 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 1.202&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 9.8 N/kg= 11.8&amp;nbsp;N
Therefore, the amount of mass that can be lifted by helium in air at sea level is:
: (1.292 - 0.178) kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.114&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
and the buoyant force for one m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of helium in air at sea level is:
: 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 1.114&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 9.8 N/kg= 10.9&amp;nbsp;N

Thus hydrogen's additional buoyancy compared to helium is:
: 11.8 / 10.9 ≈ 1.08, or approximately 8.0%

This calculation is at sea level at 0&amp;nbsp;°C.  For higher altitudes, or higher temperatures, the amount of lift will decrease proportionally to the air density, but the ratio of the lifting capability of hydrogen to that of helium will remain the same.  This calculation does not include the mass of the envelope need to hold the lifting gas.

[[File:Maxislaunch.jpg|thumb|MAXIS: a [[balloon]] that has been able to reach a height of 36 km]]

== High-altitude ballooning ==
At higher altitudes, the air pressure is lower and therefore the pressure inside the balloon is also lower. This means that while the mass of lifting gas and mass of displaced air for a given lift are the same as at lower altitude, the volume of the balloon is much greater at higher altitudes.

A balloon that is designed to lift to extreme heights ([[stratosphere]]), must be able to expand enormously in order to displace the required amount of air. That is why such balloons seem almost empty at launch, as can be seen in the photo.

A different approach for high altitude ballooning, especially used for long duration flights is the [[superpressure balloon]]. A superpressure balloon maintains a higher pressure inside the balloon than the external (ambient) pressure.

== Submerged balloons ==
Because of the enormous density difference between water and gases (water is about 1,000 times more dense than most gases), the lifting power of underwater gases is very strong. The type of gas used is largely inconsequential because the relative differences between gases is negligible in relation to the density of water. However, some gases can liquefy under high pressure, leading to an abrupt loss of buoyancy.

A submerged balloon that rises will expand or even explode because of the strong pressure reduction, unless gas is able to escape continuously during the ascent or the balloon is strong enough to withstand the change in pressure.

== Balloons on other celestial bodies ==
A balloon can only have buoyancy if there is a medium that has a higher average density than the balloon itself.
* Balloons cannot work on the [[Moon]] because it has no atmosphere.
* [[Mars]] has a very thin atmosphere – the pressure is only 1/160th of earth atmospheric pressure – so a huge balloon would be needed even for a tiny lifting effect. Overcoming the weight of such a balloon would be difficult, but several proposals to explore Mars with balloons have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/mars-balloon-04a.html |title=Exploring Mars With Balloons |publisher=Spacedaily.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Venus]] has a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere at the surface. Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is about 50% more dense than Earth air, ordinary Earth air could be a lifting gas on Venus. This has led to [[Floating city (science fiction)#Venus|proposals]] for a human habitat that would float in the atmosphere of Venus at an altitude where both the pressure and the temperature are earthlike.  In 1985, the Soviet [[Vega program#Balloon|Vega program]] sent two balloons to float in Venus' atmosphere at 54&amp;nbsp;km altitude. 
* [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Saturn]]'s largest moon, has a dense atmosphere of mostly nitrogen that is appropriate for ballooning. A use of [[Aerobot]]s was proposed [[Aerobot#Titan|on Titan]]. Also the [[Titan Saturn System Mission]] included a balloon to circumnavigate Titan.

[[File:Broadway and Times Square by night.jpg|thumb |right |The vicinity of [[Times Square]], New York City, has been famous for elaborate lighting displays incorporating neon signs since the 1920s. |alt=Photograph of a crowded city street at night. The street is in a commercial district; the buildings all have at least several stories, and some are high rise. The buildings have elaborate signs, many of which incorporate neon lighting.

'''Neon lighting''' consists of brightly glowing, electrified glass tubes or bulbs that contain [[Rarefaction|rarefied]] [[neon]] or other gases.  Neon lights are a type of [[cold cathode]] [[gas-discharge lamp|gas-discharge light]].  A neon tube is a sealed glass tube with a metal [[electrode]] at each end, filled with one of a number of gases at low pressure.  A high potential of several thousand [[volt]]s applied to the electrodes [[Ionization|ionizes]] the gas in the tube, causing it to emit colored light.  The color of the light depends on the gas in the tube.  Neon lights were named for [[neon]], a [[noble gas]] which gives off a popular orange light, but other gases and chemicals are used to produce other colors, such as [[hydrogen]] (red), [[helium]] (yellow), [[carbon dioxide]] (white), and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (blue).  Neon tubes can be fabricated in curving artistic shapes, to form letters or pictures.   They are mainly used to make dramatic, multicolored glowing [[signage]] for advertising, called [[neon sign]]s, which were popular from the 1920s to the 1950s.      
 
The term can also refer to the miniature [[neon lamp|neon glow lamp]], developed in 1917, about seven years after neon tube lighting.&lt;ref name=SI /&gt; While neon tube lights are typically meters long, the neon lamps can be less than one centimeter in length and glow much more dimly than the tube lights. They are still in use as small indicator lights. Through the 1970s, neon glow lamps were widely used for numerical displays in electronics, for small decorative lamps, and as signal processing devices in circuity. While these lamps are now antiques, the technology of the neon glow lamp developed into contemporary [[plasma display]]s and [[televisions]].&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |title=Display interfaces: fundamentals and standards |last1=Myers |first1=Robert L. |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2002 |pages=69–71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilHvFwoAZDMC&amp;pg=PA69 |isbn=978-0-471-49946-6 |quote=Plasma displays are closely related to the simple neon lamp.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weber |first=Larry F. |authorlink=Larry F.

Neon was discovered in 1898 by the British scientists [[William Ramsay]] and [[Morris W. Travers]]. After obtaining pure neon from the atmosphere, they explored its properties using an [[Geissler tube|"electrical gas-discharge" tube]] that was similar to the tubes used for neon signs today. [[Georges Claude]], a French engineer and inventor, presented neon tube lighting in essentially its modern form at the [[Paris Motor Show]] from December 3–18, 1910.&lt;ref name=vanDulken&gt;{{cite book |title=Inventing the 20th century: 100 inventions that shaped the world : from the airplane to the zipper |last1=van Dulken |first1=Stephen |last2= |first2= |page=42 |publisher=New York University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8147-8812-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVHRRoQvW60C&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poster&gt;The dates of the 1910 Paris Motor Show are incorporated into [[:Image:12eSalondelAutomobile.jpg|this poster]] for the show.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Testelin&gt;{{cite web |title=Reportage - Il était une fois le néon No. 402 |last=Testelin |first=Xavier |url=http://www.xaviertestelin.com/photo-402.html |accessdate=2010-12-06 }} Claude lit the [[peristyle]] of the ''[[Grand Palais]]'' in Paris with neon tubes; this webpage includes a contemporary photograph that gives an impression of the effect.

Neon lighting is closely related to [[fluorescent lighting]], which developed about 25 years after neon tube lighting.&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt; In fluorescent lights, the light emitted by rarefied gases within a tube is used exclusively to excite fluorescent materials that coat the tube, which then shine with their own colors that become the tube's visible, usually white, glow. Fluorescent coatings and glasses are also an option for neon tube lighting, but are usually selected to obtain bright colors.&lt;!--Technically, fluorescents are hot-cathode devices, and neon lights are cold-cathode devices. They have rather different transformers/ballasts, and somewhat different lifetimes in use. A discussion in Bright also suggests that the distinction we draw today may derive from a licensing agreement between Claude Neon Light and General Electric in 1938 that separated the markets for interior lighting, including fluorescent, from exterior lighting, which was dominated by the fashion for neon signage at that time.--&gt;

==History and science==
[[File:NeTube.jpg|thumb|right|[[Geissler tube|Gas discharge tube]] containing neon, which was first displayed by Ramsay and Travers; "Ne" is the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] for neon, one of the chemical elements. |alt=Photograph of glass tube that's been bent to form the connected letters "Ne". The tube is glowing brightly with a red color.]]

[[Neon]] is a [[noble gas]] [[chemical element]] and an [[inert gas]] that is a minor component of the Earth's atmosphere. It was discovered in 1898 by the British scientists [[William Ramsay]] and [[Morris W. Travers]]. When Ramsay and Travers had succeeded in obtaining pure neon from the atmosphere, they explored its properties using an [[Geissler tube|"electrical gas-discharge" tube]] that was similar to the tubes used today for neon signs. Travers later wrote, "the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJIk9BPdNWcC&amp;pg=PA287|title=Discovery of the Elements: Third Edition (reprint)|last=Weeks|first=Mary Elvira|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7661-3872-8|page=287|authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks}}&lt;!--The probable original source for this quote is Travers' 1928 book: {{cite book |title=The Discovery of the Rare Gases |last=Travers |first=Morris W. |publisher=Edward Arnold &amp; Co. |location=London |year=1928}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure of examining the colors of the light emitted from gas-discharge (or "Geissler" tubes) was well-known at the time, since the colors of light (the "spectral lines") emitted by a gas discharge tube are, essentially, fingerprints that identify the gases inside.

Immediately following neon's discovery, neon tubes were used as scientific instruments and novelties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fleming |first=J. A. |authorlink=John Ambrose Fleming |title=The Propagation of Electric Waves along Spiral Wires, and on an Appliance for Measuring the Length of Waves Used in Wireless Telegraphy |journal=Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science |series=Sixth Series |volume=8 |issue=46 |date=October 1904 |page=417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA419}} Fleming used a tube of neon, without electrodes, to explore the amplitudes of radiofrequency waves by examining the intensity of the tube's light emission. He had obtained his neon directly from its discoverer, Ramsay.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scarcity of purified neon gas precluded its prompt application for electrical gas-discharge lighting along the lines of [[Moore tube]]s, which used more common [[nitrogen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] as the working gas, and enjoyed some commercial success in the US in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web |title=Lamp Inventors 1880-1940: Moore Lamp |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/bios/moore.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bright2&gt;{{cite book |title=The Electric-Lamp Industry |year=1949 |last=Bright, Jr. |first=Arthur A. |publisher=MacMillan |pages=221–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1902, [[Georges Claude]]'s company in France, [[Air Liquide]], began producing industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of the air liquefaction business.

In 1915 a US patent was issued to Claude covering the design of the electrodes for gas-discharge lighting;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=1125476 |title=Systems of Illuminating by Luminescent Tubes |invent1=Georges Claude |gdate=1915-01-19 |fdate=1911-11-09}} See [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090315205020/http://inventors.about.com/od/weirdmuseums/ig/History-of-Neon-Light-Gallery/Neon-Lamp-Patent-Drawing.htm reproduction of patent.]&lt;/ref&gt; this patent became the basis for the monopoly held in the US by his company, Claude Neon Lights, for neon signs through the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Claude Neon Lights Wins Injunction Suit: Also Gets Rights to Recover Profits and Damages Resulting From Patent Infringement |work=The New York Times |date=November 28, 1928}} Paid access.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude's patents envisioned the use of gases such as [[argon]] and [[mercury vapor]] to create different colors beyond those produced by neon. In the 1920s, fluorescent glasses and coatings were developed to further expand the range of colors and effects for tubes with argon gas or argon-neon mixtures; generally, the fluorescent coatings are used with an argon/mercury-vapor mixture, which emits [[ultraviolet]] light that activates the fluorescent coatings.&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt; By the 1930s, the colors from combinations of neon tube lights had become satisfactory for some general interior lighting applications, and achieved some success in Europe, but not in the US.&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt; Since the 1950s, the development of phosphors for color televisions has created nearly 100 new colors for neon tube lighting.&lt;ref name=Thielen /&gt;

Around 1917, [[Daniel McFarlan Moore]], then working at the [[General Electric Company]], developed the miniature [[neon lamp]]. The glow lamp has a very different design than the much larger neon tubes used for signage; the difference was sufficient that a separate US patent was issued for the lamp in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref patent| country=US |number=1316967 |status=patent |title=Gaseous Conduction Lamp |pubdate= |gdate=1919-09-23 |fdate=1917-11-30 |pridate= |invent1=Daniel McFarlan Moore |invent2= |assign1=General Electric Company |assign2= |class= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Smithsonian Institution website notes, "These small, low power devices use a physical principle called "coronal discharge." Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps. Glow lamps found practical use as electronic components, and as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the acceptance of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) starting in the 1970s."&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Although some neon lamps themselves are now antiques, and their use in electronics has declined markedly, the technology has continued to develop in artistic and entertainment contexts.&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt;&lt;ref name=Strattman /&gt;  Neon lighting technology has been reshaped from long tubes into thin flat panels used for [[plasma display]]s and plasma television sets.&lt;ref name=Weber /&gt;

==Neon tube lighting and signs==
{{main|Neon sign}}
[[File:Payday loan shop window.jpg|thumb|upright|Neon sign in [[Falls Church, Virginia]]]]
When Georges Claude demonstrated an impressive, practical form of neon tube lighting in 1910, he apparently envisioned that it would be used as a form of lighting, which had been the application of the earlier Moore tubes that were based on nitrogen and carbon dioxide discharges. Claude's 1910 demonstration of neon lighting at the ''[[Grand Palais]]'' (Grand Palace) in Paris lit a [[peristyle]] of this large exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Testelin /&gt; Claude's associate, Jacques Fonseque, realized the possibilities for a business based on signage and advertising. By 1913 a large sign for the vermouth [[Cinzano]] illuminated the night sky in Paris, and by 1919 the entrance to the [[Paris Opera]] was adorned with neon tube lighting.&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt;

Neon signage was received with particular enthusiasm in the United States. In 1923, [[Earle C. Anthony]] purchased two neon signs from Claude for his [[Packard]] car dealership in Los Angeles, California; these literally stopped traffic.&lt;ref name=vanDulken /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt; Claude's US patents had secured him a monopoly on neon signage, and following Anthony's success with neon signs, many companies arranged franchises with Claude to manufacture neon signs. In many cases companies were given exclusive licenses for the production of neon signs in a given geographical area; by 1931, the value of the neon sign business was $16.9 million, of which a significant percentage was paid to Claude Neon Lights, Inc. by the franchising arrangements. Claude's principal patent expired in 1932, which led to a great expansion in the production of neon signage. The industry's sales in 1939 were about $22.0 million; the expansion in volume from 1931 to 1939 was much larger than the ratio of sales in the two years suggests.&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt;

[[Rudi Stern]] has written, "The 1930s were years of great creativity for neon, a period when many design and animation techniques were developed. ... Men like O. J. Gude and, in particular, [[Douglas Leigh]] took neon advertising further than Georges Claude and his associates had ever envisioned. Leigh, who conceived and created the archetypal Times Square spectacular, experimented with displays that incorporated smells, fog, and sounds as part of their total effect. ... Much of the visual excitement of Times Square in the thirties was a result of Leigh's genius as a kinetic and luminal artist."&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt;&lt;!--p. 27--&gt; Major cities throughout the United States and in several other countries also had elaborate displays of neon signs. Events such as the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition (1933–34), the Paris World's Fair (1937) and New York World's Fair (1939) were remarkable for their extensive use of neon tubes as architectural features. Stern has argued that the creation of "glorious" neon displays for movie theaters led to an association of the two, "One's joy in going to the movies became inseparably associated with neon."

The Second World War (1939–1945) arrested new sign installations around most of the world. Following the war, the industry resumed. Marcus Thielen writes of this era, "...after World War II, government programs were established to help re-educate soldiers. The Egani Institute (New York City) was one of few schools in the country that taught neon-trade secrets. The American streamlined design from the 1950s would be unimaginable without the use of neon."&lt;ref name=Thielen /&gt; The development of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] as a resort city is inextricably linked with neon signage; [[Tom Wolfe]] wrote in 1965, "Las Vegas is the only city in the world whose skyline is made neither of buildings, like New York, nor of trees, like [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts]], but signs. One can look at Las Vegas from a mile away on route 91 and see no buildings, no trees, only signs. But such signs! They tower. They revolve, they oscillate, they soar in shapes before which the existing vocabulary of art history is helpless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby |last=Wolfe |first=Tom |publisher=MacMillan |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-312-42912-6 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwyU4YsvLsEC&amp;pg=PA7}} Includes a reprint of a 1965 essay, "Las Vegas (What?) Las Vegas (Can't Hear You Too Noisy) Las Vegas!!!!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, however, neon displays became less fashionable, and some cities discouraged their construction with ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;[[San Jose, California]] is one of many cities that had an anti-neon ordinance; see {{cite news |title=San Jose Changes Neon Sign Ordinance / Way is cleared for Knight Ridder offices |last=Gaura |first=Maria Alicia |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 26, 1998 |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-08-26/news/17728338_1_knight-ridder-rooftop-signs-neon-signs |accessdate=2010-11-27 |quote=Before yesterday's 8-to-2 vote to revise the ordinance, rooftop signs were not allowed on San Jose high-rise buildings, nor were colored neon signs.

[[Margalit Fox]] has written, "... after World War II, as neon signs were replaced increasingly by fluorescent-lighted plastic, the art of bending colored tubes into sinuous, gas-filled forms began to wane."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite news |title=Rudi Stern, Artist Whose Medium Was Light, Dies at 69  |last=Fox |first=Margalit |work=The New York Times |date=August 18, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/18/arts/18stern.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dark age persisted at least through the 1970s, when artists adopted neon with enthusiasm; in 1979 Rudi Stern published his manifesto, ''Let There Be Neon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Let There Be Neon |last=Stern |first=Rudi |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-8109-1255-7 |publisher=H. N. Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Thielen wrote in 2005, on the 90th anniversary of the US patent issued to Georges Claude, "The demand for the use of neon and cold cathode in architectural applications is growing, and the introduction of new techniques like fiberoptics and LED — into the sign market have strengthened, rather than replaced, neon technology. The evolution of the 'waste' product neon tube remains incomplete 90 years after the patent was filed.&lt;!--sic; the patent was filed for in 1913.--&gt;"&lt;ref name=Thielen /&gt;

{{main|Neon lamp}}
In neon glow lamps, the luminous region of the gas is a thin, [[Electric glow discharge#Basic operating mechanism|"negative glow" region]] immediately adjacent to a negatively charged electrode (or "cathode"); the positively charged electrode ("anode") is quite close to the cathode. These features distinguish glow lamps from the much longer and brighter "positive column" luminous regions in neon tube lighting.&lt;ref name=Strattman /&gt; The energy dissipation in the lamps when they are glowing is very low (about 0.1 W),&lt;ref name=Baumann&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumann |first=Edward |title=Applications of Neon Lamps and Gas Discharge Tubes |publisher=Carlton Press |year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the distinguishing term '''cold-cathode lighting'''.

Some of the applications of neon lamps include:&lt;ref name=Baumann /&gt;
*Pilot lamps that indicate the presence of electrical power in an appliance or instrument (e.g. an electric coffee pot or power supply).
*Decorative (or "figural") lamps in which the cathode is shaped as a flower, animal, etc.. The figures inside these lamps were typically painted with phosphorescent paints to achieve a variety of colors.
*Active electronic circuits such as electronic oscillators, timers, memory elements, etc..
*Intricate electronic displays such as the [[Nixie tube]] (see photograph).

[[File:Plasma display.jpg|thumb|right |A 2007 plasma television set. Each of the thousands of colored pixels in the image on the set is created by a tiny neon glow lamp that excites a phosphor. |alt=Photograph of a flat panel displaying an aquarium; the aquarium has several fish swimming around, a gravel bottom, and decorative rocks and plants.]]
The small size of the negative glow region of a neon lamp, and the flexible electronic properties that were exploited in electronic circuits, led to the adoption of this technology for the earliest [[Plasma display|plasma panel displays]]. The first monochrome dot matrix plasma panel displays were developed in 1964 at the University of Illinois for the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO educational computing system]]. They had the characteristic color of the neon lamp; their inventors, [[Donald Bitzer|Donald L. Bitzer]], H. Gene Slottow, and Robert H. Wilson, had achieved a working computer display that remembered its own state, and did not require constant refreshing from the central computer system. The relationship between these early monochrome displays and contemporary, color plasma displays and televisions was described by Larry F. Weber in 2006, "All plasma TVs on the market today have the same features that were demonstrated in the first plasma display which was a device with only a single cell. These features include alternating sustain voltage, dielectric layer, wall charge, and a neon-based gas mixture."&lt;ref name=Weber /&gt; As in colored neon lamps, plasma displays use a gas mixture that emits ultraviolet light. Each pixel has a phosphor that emits one of the display's base colors.

==Neon lighting and artists in light==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
{{see also|Light art#Artists in light}}&lt;!--A "neon art" or "artists in light" article doesn't appear to exist on Wikipedia; ideally, this would be referred to here.--&gt;

The mid to late 1980s was a period of resurgence in neon production. Sign companies developed a new type of signage called [[channel letters|channel lettering]], in which individual letters were fashioned from sheet metal.

While the market for neon lighting in outdoor advertising signage has declined since the mid twentieth century, in recent decades neon lighting has been used consciously in art, both in individual objects and integrated into architecture. [[Frank Popper]] traces the use of neon lighting as the principal element in artworks to [[Gyula Kosice|Gyula Košice]]'s late 1940s work in Argentina. Among the later artists whom Popper notes in a brief history of neon lighting in art are [[Stephen Antonakos]], the conceptual artists [[Joseph Kosuth]] and [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Chryssa]], [[Piotr Kowalski]], [[Maurizio Nannucci]] and [[François Morellet]]&lt;ref name=Popper /&gt; in addition to [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Dan Flavin]] or [[Mario Merz]].

Several museums in the United States are now devoted to neon lighting and art, including the [[Museum of Neon Art]] (founded by neon artist [[Lili Lakich]], Los Angeles, 1981), the [[Neon Museum]] (Las Vegas, founded 1996), the [[American Sign Museum]] (Cincinnati, founded 1999). These museums restore and display historical signage that was originally designed as advertising, in addition to presenting exhibits of neon art. Several books of photographs have also been published to draw attention to neon lighting as art.&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Len |title=Vintage Neon |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |date=July 1999 |isbn=978-0-7643-0857-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sprengnagel&gt;{{cite book |title=Neon World |last=Sprengnagel |first=Dusty |year=1999 |publisher=ST Publications |isbn=0-944094-26-0}} A collection of photographs of neon signs from cities around the world, most unannotated.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Christian Schiess has published an anthology of photographs and interviews devoted to fifteen "light artists".&lt;ref name=Schiess&gt;{{cite book |title=The Light Artist Anthology: Neon and Related Media |last=Schiess |first=Christian |isbn=978-0-944094-00-6 |year=1994 |publisher=ST Media Group International}} Schiess' anthology includes Stephen Antonakos, [[Valerij Bugrov]], [[Chris Freeman (artist)|Chris Freeman]], [[Peter Freeman (artist)|Peter Freeman]], [[Michael Hayden (artist)|Michael Hayden]], [[Craig Kraft]], [[Dante Leonelli]], [[Cork Marcheschi]], [[Bill Parker (artist/inventor)|Bill Parker]], [[Alejandro &amp; Moira Siña (Sinha)]], [[Keith Sonnier]], and [[Willem Volkersz]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nirmalapura Wind Farm''' is a {{Nowrap|10 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} wind farm consisting of seven [[wind turbine]]s, located on the west coast of [[Puttalam|Nirmalapura, Puttalam]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The plant is owned by {{Nowrap|Nirmalapura Wind Power (Private) Limited}}, and was commissioned in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka Hayleys wind power plant to start in Sept|url=http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/news/sri-lanka-hayleys-wind-power-plant-to-start-in-sept/324823745|accessdate=5 October 2013|newspaper=[http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/ LankaBusinessOnline.com]|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akbar.lk: Wind power projects|url=http://www.akbar.lk/power/wind_power.php|publisher=Akbar.lk|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subculture of frequently undocumented workers do the dirty, difficult, and potentially dangerous work shunned by regular employees.

Some personnel were not properly trained resulting in their own exposure to toxic amounts of radiation. At several facilities there are ongoing failures to perform required radiological screenings or to implement corrective actions.

Many questions regarding these nuclear worker conditions go unanswered, and with the exception of a few whistleblowers, the vast majority of laborers - unseen, underpaid, overworked and exploited, have few incentives to share their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krolicki|first=Kevin and Chisa Fujioka|title=Japan's "throwaway" nuclear workers|url=http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/japans-throwaway-nuclear-workers|publisher=Reuters, MMN: Mother Nature Network|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The median annual wage for hazardous radioactive materials removal workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is $37,590 in the U.S - $18 per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=Hazardous Materials Removal Workers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/hazardous-materials-removal-workers.htm|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 15-country collaborative cohort study of cancer risks due to exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation, involving 407,391 nuclear industry workers showed significant increase in cancer mortality.

== Uranium mining and milling ==

=== Canada ===
In 1942 thirty indigenous Dené men were recruited to mine uranium, locally known as "the money rock" for three dollars per day at the [[Port Radium]] mine. By 1998, 14 of these workers had died of lung, colon and kidney cancers, according to the North West Territory's Cancer Registry. The Dené were not told of the hazards of mining uranium, and breathed radioactive dust, slept on the ore, and ate fish from the tailings ponds. Ottawa was the world's largest supplier of uranium at that time, and the United States the biggest buyer, according to declassified U.S. documents. In subsequent decades, thousands of Native miners were not warned of the risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nikiforuk|first1=Andrew|title=Echoes of the Atomic Age: Cancer kills fourteen aboriginal uranium workers|url=http://www.ccnr.org/deline_deaths.html|accessdate=13 December 2014|publisher=Calgary Herald|date=March 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Namibia ===
[[File:Arandis Mine hochformat.jpg|thumb|Rössig open-pit uranium mine near [[Arandis, Namibia]]]]

Namibia's [[Rössing Uranium Mine]] is the longest-operating open-pit uranium mine, and one of the largest in the world. The company is owned and operated by [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]], one of the world's largest mining groups, and Rössing Uranium Limited. The uranium mill tailings dam has been leaking for a number of years, and on January 17, 2014, a catastrophic structural failure of a leach tank caused a major spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WISE Uranium Project|title=Issues at Rössing Uranium Mine, Namibia|url=http://www.wise-uranium.org/umoproe.html|publisher=World Information Service on Energy, Uranium Project|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The France-based laboratory, Commission de Recherche et d'Information Independentantes sur la Radioactivite (CRIIAD) reported elevated levels of radioactive materials in the area surrounding the mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Commission de Recherche et d'Information Indépendantes sur la Radioactivité|title=Preliminary results of CRIIRAD radiation monitoring near uranium mines in Namibia|url=http://www.criirad.org/actualites/dossier2012/namibie/CRIIRAD-namibia-press.pdf|work=April 11, 2012|publisher=CRIIAD|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Commission de Recherche et d'Information Indépendantes sur la Radioactivité|title=CRIIRAD Preliminary Report No. 12-32b Preliminary results of radiation monitoring near uranium mines in Namibia|url=http://www.criirad.org/actualites/dossier2012/namibie/CRIIRAD-namibia-prelim.pdf|work=April 5, 2012|publisher=CRIIRAD EJOLT Project|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand and Australia ===
The American and British demand for large quantities of uranium to use in nuclear weapons initiated New Zealand's uranium survey during WWII. In 1944 in Wellington, geologists and physicists assembled two exploration teams to survey South Island, particularly the granite deposits and black beach sand areas. In 1945, Fiordland, Milford Sound, Nancy Sound and other locations were surveyed, resulting in the December 7, 1945 NZ Atomic Energy Act granting full ownership of any discovered radioactive elements - however not to the indigenous peoples whose ancestral lands contained these materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Te Ara: Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/radioactive-minerals/page-1|publisher=Government of New Zealand|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, another rich uranium deposit was discovered by prospectors Frederick Cassin and Charles Jacobsen. In the following years prospectors traveled through rainforests and other terrain with Geiger counters, jackhammers and drills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Te Ara: Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/radioactive-minerals/page-3|publisher=Government of New Zealand|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers were exposed to unsafe levels of radiation through exposure to and inhalation of dust. In Australia, uranium mining was no less unrestrained than in New Zealand. At the Nabarlek, Rum Jungle, Hunter's Hill, Rockhole and Moline mines, gamma radiation exceeded safe levels by 50% causing chronic health problems for miners and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sovacool|first1=Benjamin K.|last2=Dworkin|first2=Michael H.|title=Global Energy Justice|date=September 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107665088|page=162|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G_hkBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=new+zealand+uranium+mine+workers#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20zealand%20uranium%20mine%20workers&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shiprock, New Mexico uranium mill aerial photo.png|thumb|Shiprock, New Mexico uranium mill aerial photo]]Between 1949 and 1989, over 4,000 uranium mines in the Four Corners region produced more than 225,000,000 tons of uranium ore.

Although Hayashi was provided with protective gear, he thinks the agency engaged in "bait and switch" approaches to recruitment. Later he accepted a second contract job from another agency at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi plant, working on spent fuel rod tanks. He reported that the new contracting agency only paid him 2/3rds of his wages.

France is an international leader in the nuclear power industry throughout the world. A study by the National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in France concluded that the largest and least visible population of chronic exposure to ionizing radiation are the nuclear industry's "thousands and even hundreds of thousands of workers who perform daily maintenance and upkeep operations and tasks in nuclear plants, nuclear testing facilities, research centers, reprocessing plants, and nuclear waste management centers." France's 50-year long nuclear industry has not historically kept records of worker's internal and external exposure to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thebaud-Mony|first=Annie|title=Nuclear Servitude: Subcontracting and Health in the French Civil Nuclear Industry (Work, Health and Environment)|year=2011|publisher=Baywood Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-89503-380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of risk to workers and the impact of subcontracting the most dangerous tasks within the industry is intensified by nuclear secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Desbordes|first=J.P.|title=Atomic parc.

McCluskey received the highest dosage of americium of any human being, 500 times the occupational standard, and was so radioactive, his body had to be removed by remote control and placed in a steel and concrete isolation tank where glass and metal were removed from his skin and tissues. He survived the accident. After five months of treatment, involving scrubbings and shots of zinc DTPA, he was permitted to return home, as his radiation count had fallen from 500 above standard to 200 times above safe occupational level.

[[File:SL-1 - Dismantling of the foundation piers.jpg|thumb|SL-1 - Dismantling of the foundation piers]]

[[Idaho National Laboratory]] near Arco, Idaho was founded in 1949 as a nuclear reactor testing laboratory. Some consider it to be the site of the first fatal accident in the nuclear military/industrial sector when the SL-1 boiling water reactor melted down, killing two reactor operators, a third operator died shortly thereafter. When a control rod in the reactor was removed manually causing a power surge and ensuing criticality, a steam explosion occurred in the reactor vessel. The event caused the reactor lid to be blown nine feet into the air. The three operators were heavily irradiated and their remains were buried in lead coffins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Radiation Works|title=The SL-1 Reactor Accident|url=http://www.radiationworks.com/sl1reactor.htm|publisher=Radiation Works|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1957-1964, Rocketdyne located at the [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]], 30 miles north of Los Angeles, California operated ten experimental nuclear reactors. Numerous accidents occurred including a core meltdown. Experimental reactors of that era were not required to have the same type of containment structures that shield modern nuclear reactors. During the Cold War time in which the accidents that occurred at Rockedyne, these events were not publicly reported by the Department of Energy. 
* 1957: a fire raged out of control in the Hot Lab leading to "massive contamination." 
* 1959: the AE6 reactor released fission gasses, later that year the SRE facility suffered a partial nuclear reactor core meltdown, releasing 459 times the radiation as the Three Mile Island accident. 
* 1964: 80% of the SNAP8-ER reactor's fuel was damaged. 1969: the SNAP8-DR reactor lost one third of its fuel. 
* 1971: a radioactive fire broke out from the combustion of sodium reactor coolant that had been contaminated with fission products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laramee|first=Eve Andree|title=Tracking Our Nuclear Legacy|journal=WEAD|url=http://weadartists.org/tracking-our-atomic-legacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site====
The most famous of U.S. case of on an incident involving a nuclear worker is that of [[Karen Silkwood]], an employee of the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site]] in Crescent, Oklahoma. Silkwood was a technician, whose job was to make plutonium fuel pellets for assembly into nuclear reactor fuel rods. She was also a labor union activist negotiating for higher health and safety standards. In 1974, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union stated that the Kerr-McGee plant had not only manufactured defective fuel rods, but that it had falsified records, and put employees' safety at risk.&lt;ref name="Vol. 74, No. 5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Annas|first=George, JD, MPH.|title=The Case of Karen Silkwood|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=May 1984|volume= 74|issue= 5|pages=516–8|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.74.5.516|doi=10.2105/AJPH.74.5.516|pmid=6369995|pmc=1651625}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time that she was involved in these labor disputes, on November 5, 1974, she found that she had been contaminated with plutonium over 400 times the legal limit. On November 7, it was found that her internal lung contamination was dangerously high during breath tests, and urine samples. On November 13, 1974, Silkwood was driving to a union meeting with documents regarding her case. She died on the way to the meeting from a severe hit-and-run automobile crash that damaged both the rear end and front end of her vehicle. There is much speculation that her car was forced off the road by another vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kleiner|first=Diana J.|title=Karen Gay Silkwood|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsi35|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Los Alamos Science|title=The Karen Silkwood Story: A True Measure of Exposure|url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/00326645.pdf|work=No. 23|publisher=Los Alamos Science|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was examined by Los Alamos Laboratory Tissue Analysis Program as requested by the Atomic Energy Commission and the State Medical Examiner.

{{Main|Waste Isolation Pilot Plant}}
[[File:DOE Begins Mining Operations for Salt Disposal Investigations at WIPP 2.jpg|thumb|DOE Begins Mining Operations for Salt Disposal Investigations at WIPP 2]]
The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, was designed as a pilot, test study site for deep geologic storage of radioactive waste. It is managed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and currently serves as the nation's only deep geological repository for transuranic (TRU) nuclear waste generated by the military and defense industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WIPP Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Recovery|url=http://www.wipp.energy.gov/wipprecovery/recovery.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in Southern New Mexico near the border of Texas and Mexico. It has been disposing of waste 2,150 feet underground in the ancient Permian Sea salt formation since 1999, accepting waste from 22 national atomic legacy sites. Designed to last tens thousand years, the WIPP site had its first leak of airborne radioactive materials on February 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleck|first=John|title=WIPP radiation leak was never supposed to happen|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/364795/news/leak-never-supposed-to-happen.html|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=Albuquerque Journal|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Happened at WIPP in February 2014|url=http://www.wipp.energy.gov/wipprecovery/accident_desc.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 140 employees working underground at the time were sheltered indoors. 13 of these tested positive for internal [[radioactive contamination]]. Internal exposure to radioactive isotopes is more serious than external exposure, as these particles lodge in the body for decades, irradiating the surrounding tissues, thus increasing the risk of future cancers and other health effects. A second leak at the plant occurred shortly after the first, releasing plutonium and other radiotoxins, causing concern for communities living near the repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jamail|first=Dahr|title=Radiation Leak at New Mexico Nuclear Waste Storage Site Highlights Problems|url=http://truth-out.org/news/item/22599-radiation-leak-at-new-mexico-nuclear-waste-storage-site-highlights-problems|publisher=Truth-Out.org|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since opening in 1999, the WIPP "pilot site" has received over 11,000 shipments of TRU waste (transuranic waste). During the February 14, 2014 leak, 22 workers were exposed to radioactive materials. Don Hancock, Director of the Nuclear Waste Safety Program for the SouthWest Research and information Center describes the theory of how nitrate salts in the "kitty litter" absorbent interacted with plutonium causing the breach of one or more 55-gallon drums stored at WIPP through a chemical reaction that caused an inflagration. Fundamental questions remain regarding the Department of Energy's clean up standards for WIPP, as there is not a "clean-up" standard or regulation for the underground site, by either the DOE oversight or the company contracted to oversee the site, Nuclear Waste Partnership. Over the past 15 years, 91,000 cubic meters of radioactive waste, and more than 171,000 containers of radioactive waste have been placed at WIPP - more than any other site in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=V.B. and Hancock, Don|title=Insight New Mexico: Don Hancock's update on recent WIPP Leak|url=http://newmexicomercury.com/blog/comments/insight_new_mexico_don_hancocks_update_on_recent_wipp_leak|website=New Mexico Mercury|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optical lift''' is an [[optics|optical]] analogue of [[aerodynamic lift]], in which a [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] refractive object with differently shaped top and bottom surfaces experiences a stable transverse lift force when placed in a uniform stream of [[light]].&lt;ref name='Nature Photonics'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Stable optical lift | journal = Nature Photonics | volume = 5 | pages = 48 | date = 5 December 2010 | first = Grover A. | last = Swartzlander Jr | author2 = Timothy J.

== Discovery ==
[[File:Force components of optical lift, generated model.jpg|thumb|Optical lift is a component of force imparted from uniform light.]] [[File:First CP1 fabricated flying carpets.jpg|thumb|First CP1 fabricated flying carpets]] The ability of light to apply pressure to objects is known as [[radiation pressure]], which was first postulated in 1619 and proven in 1900.  This is the principle behind the [[solar sail]], which uses light [[radiation pressure]] to move through [[outer space|space]].  A 2010 study by physicist Grover Swartzlander and colleagues of the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in Rochester, New York shows light is also capable of creating the more complex force of "[[lift (force)|lift]]", which is the force generated by [[airfoil]]s that make an airplane rise upwards as it travels forward. This study was published on December 2010 in ''[[Nature Photonics]]'' journal.  Swartzlander predicted, observed and experimentally verified at a micrometer-scale that when applying a beam of [[laser]] light to a semi-cylindrical refractive rod, it automatically torques into a stable [[angle of attack]], and then exhibits uniform [[Motion (physics)|motion]].&lt;ref name='Nature Photonics'/&gt;

The experiment began as [[computer model]]s that suggested when light is incident on a tiny object shaped like a [[wing]], a stable lift force is applied to the particle. Then the researchers decided to do physical experiments in the laboratory, and they created tiny, transparent, micrometer-sized rods that were flat on one side and rounded on the other, rather like airplane wings. They immersed the lightfoils in water and bombarded them with 130&amp;nbsp;mW [[infrared]] laser light from underneath the chamber. [[Radiation pressure]] pushes the particles along the direction of propagation, this is called the [[optical tweezers|scatter force]], but the excitement came when the particles were forced to the side in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagating light.  The transverse force on the particles is the lift force.  The researchers discovered not only that the rods experienced stable lift, but that, depending on refractive index, the rod could have up to two stable angles of attack it rotated to when exposed to the laser light. Symmetrical spheres tested did not exhibit this same lift effect.&lt;ref name='Physorg'&gt;{{cite news | first = Lin | last = Edwards | title = Optical lifting demonstrated for the first time | date = 7 December 2010 | url = http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-optical-video.html | work = Physorg | accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In optical lift, created by a "lightfoil", the lift is created within the transparent object as light shines through it and is [[refraction|refracted]] by its inner surfaces. In the lightfoil rods a greater proportion of light leaves in a direction perpendicular to the beam and this side therefore experiences a larger radiation pressure and hence, lift.&lt;ref name='Physorg'/&gt;

== Potential uses ==
[[File:Diagram of flying carpets on solar sail.jpg|thumb|Using optical lift to steer solar sails]] The 2010 discovery of stable optical lift is considered by some physicists to be "most surprising".&lt;ref name='BBC'/&gt; Unlike [[optical tweezers]], an intensity gradient is not required to achieve a transverse force. Many rods may therefore be lifted simultaneously in a single quasi-uniform beam of light. Swartzlander and his team propose using optical lift to power micromachines, transport microscopic particles in a liquid, or to help on self-alignment and steering of [[solar sails]],&lt;ref name='BBC'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jason | last = Palmer | title = 'Lightfoil' idea shows light can provide lift | date = 8 December 2010 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11927793 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[spacecraft propulsion]] for interstellar space travel. Solar sails are generally designed to harness light to "push" a spacecraft, whereas Swartzlander designed their lightfoil to lift in a perpendicular direction; this is where the idea of being able to steer a future solar sail spacecraft may be applied.&lt;ref name='Kaku'&gt;{{cite news | first = Michio | last = Kaku | title = Optical Lift May Allow Us to Steer Solar Sail Spacecrafts and Nano Devices | date = 7 December 2010 | url = http://bigthink.com/ideas/25305 | work = Big Think | accessdate = 2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swartzlander said the next step would be to test lightfoils in air and experiment with a variety of materials with different refractive properties, and with incoherent light.&lt;ref name='Physorg'/&gt;

[[Maurice Allais]], a French researcher, invented the paraconical pendulum around 1950, and during the 1950s he conducted six marathon series of long-term observations, during each of which his team manually operated and manually monitored his pendulum non-stop over about a month. The objective was to investigate possible changes over time of the characteristics of the motion, hypothesized to yield information about asymmetries of [[inertial space]] (sometimes described as "aether flow").

== Characterization and experiments ==

The defining feature of the "paraconical" or "ball-borne" pendulum is that the pendulum is carried upon a ball which rests upon a flat, thus permitting it to rotate about its vertical axis as well as swinging in two perpendicular directions. Therefore a paraconical pendulum has three degrees of freedom. When the rotation of the Earth is taken into account, the formal equations in classical mechanics of the behavior of this [[dynamical system]] are rather complex. The rolling friction of the ball upon the flat is extremely low, so that a paraconical pendulum has a high Q factor, principally determined by air resistance. Typically a paraconical pendulum is built as a solid body with a stiff rod, rather than with a flexible wire or cord, and its length is usually about one meter. If an accurately spherical ball and an accurately planar flat are used, a paraconical pendulum is a highly sensitive instrument: as first noted by Allais, and now confirmed by modern researchers, its motion exhibits a 24.8 hour cyclic pattern, presumably a manifestation of lunar influence.

'''Electrical power system simulation''' involves power system modeling and network simulation in order to analyze electrical power systems using design/offline or real-time data. Power system simulation software's are a class of [[computer simulation]] programs that focus on the operation of electrical power systems. These types of computer programs are used in a wide range of planning and operational situations for:
# Electric power generation - Nuclear, Conventional, Renewable
# Commercial facilities
# Utility transmission
# Utility distribution
# Railway power systems
# Industrial power systems
Applications of power system simulation include:
#Long-term generation and transmission expansion planning
#Short-term operational simulations
#Market analysis (e.g. price forecasting)

These programs typically make use of [[mathematical optimization]] techniques such [[linear programming]], [[quadratic programming]], and [[mixed integer programming]].

Key elements of power systems that are modeled include:
#Load flow ([[power flow study]])
#Short circuit or fault analysis
#Protective device coordination, discrimination or selectivity
#Transient or dynamic stability
#Harmonic or power quality analysis
#Optimal power flow

There are many power simulation software packages in commercial and non-commercial forms that range from utility-scale software to study tools.

==Load flow calculation==
The load-flow calculation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J. Arockiya|first=Xavier Prabhu|year=2016|title=Design of electrical system based on load flow analysis using ETAP for IEC projects|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7584103/#|journal=Power Systems (ICPS)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common network analysis tool for examining the undisturbed and disturbed network within the scope of operational and strategic planning.  

Using network topology, transmission line parameters, transformer parameters, generator location and limits, and load location and compensation, the load-flow calculation can provide voltage magnitudes and angles for all nodes and loading of network components, such as cables and transformers. With this information, compliance to operating limitations such as those stipulated by voltage ranges and maximum loads, can be examined. This is, for example, important for determining the transmission capacity of underground cables, where the influence of cable bundling on the load capability of each cable has to be taken also into account.

Due to the ability to determine losses and reactive-power allocation, load-flow calculation also supports the planning engineer in the investigation of the most economical operation mode of the network.

When changing over from single and/or multi-phase infeed low-voltage meshed networks to isolated networks, load-flow calculation is essential for operational and economical reasons. Load-flow calculation is also the basis of all further network studies, such as motor start-up or investigation of scheduled or unscheduled outages of equipment within the outage simulation.

Especially when investigating motor start-up,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hui|first=Zhu|year=2014|title=The Simulation Analysis of Motor Startup Based on the ETAP Platform|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7046191/|journal=International Conference on Mathematics and Computers in Sciences and in Industry|volume=10.1109/MCSI.2014.36|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the load-flow calculation results give helpful hints, for example, of whether the motor can be started in spite of the voltage drop caused by the start-up current.

==Short circuit analysis==
Short circuit analysis analyzes the power flow after a [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] occurs in a power network. The faults may be three-phase short circuit, one-phase grounded, two-phase short circuit, two-phase grounded, one-phase break, two-phase break or complex faults. Results of such an analysis may help determine the following: 
# Magnitude of the fault current 
# Circuit breaker capacity
# Rise in voltage in a single line due to ground fault 
# Residual voltage and relay settings 
# Interference due to power line.&lt;ref&gt;Soonee, Sushil Kuman. "Short Circuit Analysis for Power System." RCC "Feedback"6.12 (1983): 3-5. POSOCO. POWER SYSTEM OPERATION CORPORATION LIMITED. Web. 22 Nov. 2016. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://posoco.in/papers/Short%20Circuit%20Analysis%20for%20Power%20System_RCC_1983.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transient stability simulation==
The goal of transient stability simulation of power systems is to analyse the stability of a power system from sub-second to several tens of seconds. Stability in this aspect is the ability of the system to quickly return to a stable operating condition after being exposed to a disturbance such as for example a tree falling over an overhead line resulting in the automatic disconnection of that line by its protection systems. In engineering terms, a power system is deemed stable if the substation voltage levels and the rotational speeds of motors and generators return to their normal values in a quick and continuous manner.
[[File:CBEMA Curve.png|alt=CBEMA Curve|thumb|Figure 1. Specifies the acceptable amount of time it takes grid voltages return to their intended levels, which may vary depending on the magnitude of voltage disturbance.]]

Models typically use the following inputs:
* Number, size and type of generators with any available mechanical, electrical, and control (governor, voltage regulation, etc.) parameters,
* a mix of residential, commercial and industrial load at each bus,
* location and specifications for distributed control devices such as tap-changing transformers, switched shunt compensation, static Var compensators, flexible AC transmission systems, etc.,
* location and specifications for protection devices such as relays and load shedding, and
* location and specifications of any other relevant control and/or protection devices.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael. “Electric Power System Modeling &amp; Simulation.” 15 Feb. 2010. Powerpoint presentation. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.cs.nmt.edu/~jholten/ModelingAndSimulation/lectures/9b_EP_System_Modeling.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The acceptable amount of time it takes grid voltages return to their intended levels is dependent on the magnitude of voltage disturbance, and the most common standard is specified by the CBEMA curve in Figure. 1. This curve informs both electronic equipment design and grid stability data reporting.&lt;ref&gt;"CBEMA Curve– The Power Acceptability Curve for Computer Business Equipment." Power Quality In Electrical Systems. N.p., 3 Apr. 2011. Web. 22 Nov. 2016. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.powerqualityworld.com/2011/04/cbema-curve-power-quality-standard.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unit commitment==
The problem of unit commitment involves finding the least-cost dispatch of available generation resources to meet the electrical load.

Generating resources can include a wide range of types:
#[[Nuclear power|Nuclear]]
#[[Thermal]] (using coal, gas, other [[fossil fuels]], or [[biomass]])
#[[Renewables]] (including hydro, wind, wave-power, and solar)

The key decision variables that are decided by the computer program are:
#Generation level (in megawatts)
#Number of generating units ''on''

The latter decisions are binary {0,1}, which means that the mathematical problem is not continuous.

In addition, generating plants are subject to a number of complex technical constraints, including:
#Minimum stable operating level
#Maximum rate of ramping up or down
#Minimum time period the unit is ''up'' and/or ''down''

These constraints have many different variants; all this gives rise to a large class of [[Unit commitment problem in electrical power production|mathematical optimization problems]].

==Optimal power flow==

Electricity flows through an AC network according to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Laws]].  Transmission lines are subject to thermal limits (simple megawatt limits on flow), as well as voltage and [[electrical stability]] constraints.

The simulator must calculate the flows in the AC network that result from any given combination of unit commitment and generator megawatt dispatch, and ensure that AC line flows are within both the thermal limits and the voltage and stability constraints.  This may include contingencies such as the loss of any one transmission or generation element - a so-called security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF), and if the unit commitment is optimized inside this framework we have a security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC).

In optimal power flow (OPF) the generalised scalar objective to be minimised is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; f(u_0, x_0) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'' is a set of the control variables, ''x'' is a set of independent variables, and the subscript 0 indicates that the variable refers to the pre-contingency power system.''

The SCOPF is bound by equality and inequality constraint limits. The equality constraint limits are given by the pre and post contingency power flow equations, where ''k'' refers to the ''k''th contingency case:

: &lt;math&gt; g^k(u^k, x^k)=0 \qquad\text{for }k=1,2,\ldots,n \, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- Should those be subscripts instead of superscripts? --&gt;

The equipment and operating limits are given by the following inequalities:

: &lt;math&gt; U^k_{\min} \le U^k \le U^k_{\max} \, &lt;/math&gt; represent hard constraints on controls

: &lt;math&gt; h^k_{\min} \le X^k \le X^k_{\max} \, &lt;/math&gt; represents hard/soft constraints on variables

: &lt;math&gt; h^k(u^k, x^k) \le 0 \text{ for } k=0,1,\ldots,n \, &lt;/math&gt; represents other constraints such as reactive reserve limits

The objective function in OPF can take on different forms relating to active or reactive power quantities that we wish to either minimise or maximise. For example we may wish to minimise transmission losses or minimise real power generation costs on a power network.

Other power flow solution methods like stochastic optimization incorporate the uncertainty found in modeling power systems by using the probability distributions of certain variables whose exact values are not known. When uncertainties in the constraints are present, such as for dynamic line ratings, chance constrained optimization can be used where the probability of violating a constraint is limited to a certain value. Another technique to model variability is the [[Monte Carlo method]], in which different combinations of inputs and resulting outputs are considered based on the probability of their occurrence in the real world. This method can be applied to simulations for system security and unit commitment risk, and it is increasingly being used to model probabilistic load flow with renewable and/or distributed generation.&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, Binayak, and Syed Islam. "Modelling and Simulation of Power Systems." Smart Power Systems and Renewable Energy System Integration. By Dilan Jayaweera. Vol. 57. Cham: Springer International, 2016. 15-26. Studies in Systems, Decision and Control. Springer Link. Web. 22 Nov. 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-30427-4&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of competitive behavior==

The cost of producing a megawatt of electrical energy is a function of:
#fuel price
#generation efficiency (the rate at which potential energy in the fuel is converted to electrical energy)
#operations and maintenance costs

In addition to this, generating plant incur fixed costs including:
#plant construction costs, and
#fixed operations and maintenance costs

Assuming [[perfect competition]], the market-based price of electricity would be based purely on the cost of producing the ''next'' megawatt of power, the so-called ''short-run marginal cost'' (SRMC).  This price however might not be sufficient to cover the fixed costs of generation, and thus power market prices rarely show purely SRMC pricing.  In most established power markets, generators are ''free'' to offer their generation capacity at prices of their choosing.  Competition and use of financial contracts keeps these prices close to SRMC, but inevitably offers price above SRMC do occur (for example during the [[California energy crisis]] of 2001).

In the context of power system simulation, a number of techniques have been applied to simulate [[imperfect competition]] in electrical power markets:
#Cournot competition
#Bertrand competition
#Supply function equilibrium
#Residual Supply Index analysis

Various [[heuristics]] have also been applied to this problem.  The aim is to provide ''realistic'' forecasts of power market prices, given the forecast supply-demand situation.

== Long-term optimization ==
Power system long-term optimization focuses on optimizing the multi-year expansion and retirement plan for generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. The optimization problem will typically consider the long term investment cash flow and a simplified version of OPF / UC (Unit commitment), to make sure the power system operates in a secure and economic way. This area can be categorized as:

#Generation expansion optimization
#Transmission expansion optimization
#Generation-transmission expansion co-optimization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=You|first1=Shutang|last2=Hadley|first2=Stanton W.|last3=Shankar|first3=Mallikarjun|last4=Liu|first4=Yilu|title=Co-optimizing generation and transmission expansion with wind power in large-scale power grids—Implementation in the US Eastern Interconnection|journal=Electric Power Systems Research|date=1 April 2016|volume=133|pages=209–218|doi=10.1016/j.epsr.2015.12.023|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779615004009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Distribution network optimization

== Power System Study Specifications ==
A well-defined power systems study requirement is critical to the success of any project as it will reduce the challenge of selecting the qualified service provider and the right analysis software. The system study specification describes the project scope, analysis types, and the required deliverable. The study specification&lt;ref&gt;https://etap.com/docs/default-source/power-systems-study-specification/power_systems_study_specifications.pdf?sfvrsn=22&lt;/ref&gt; must be written to match the specific project and industry requirements and will vary based on the type of analysis.

== Power system simulation software ==
[[General Electric]]'s MAPS (Multi-Area Production Simulation) is a production simulation model used by various [[Regional transmission organization (North America)|Regional Transmission Organizations]] and [[Regional transmission organization (North America)#Independent System Operators (ISOs)|Independent System Operators]] in the United States to plan for the economic impact of proposed electric transmission and generation facilities in FERC-regulated electric wholesale markets. Portions of the model may also be used for the commitment and dispatch phase (updated on 5 minute intervals) in operation of wholesale electric markets for RTO and ISO regions. [[ABB]]'s PROMOD is a similar software package. These ISO and RTO regions also utilize a GE software package called MARS (Multi-Area Reliability Simulation) to ensure the power system meets reliability criteria (a loss-of-load-expectation (LOLE) of no greater than 0.1 days per year). Further, a GE software package called PSLF (Positive Sequence Load Flow) and a [[Siemens]] software package called PSSE (Power System Simulation for Engineering) analyzes load flow on the power system for short-circuits and stability during preliminary planning studies by RTOs and ISOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABB PROMOD Market Simulation|url=https://new.abb.com/enterprise-software/energy-portfolio-management/market-analysis/promod|work=new.abb.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Production Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/maps|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Reliability Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/mars|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Power System Load Flow Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/pslf|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYSRC 2018 IRM Study Report|url=http://www.nysrc.org/pdf/Reports/2018%20IRM%20Study%20Report%20Final%2012-8-17[2098].pdf|p=2|work=www.nysrc.org|date=December 8, 2017|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYISO Notice to Stakeholders of Request for MAPS data|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/documents/Legal_and_Regulatory/Notices/MP_Notices/Notice%20to%20Generators%20re%20GE%20MAPS%20database%20input%20files%20for%20CARIS%202%20-%209-9-14.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=August 2000|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens PSSE|url=https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/products/energy/services/transmission-distribution-smart-grid/consulting-and-planning/pss-software/pss-e.html|work=www.siemens.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York State Resource Planning Analysis (NYSPSC)|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/committees/mc/meeting_materials/2015-12-17/Agenda%2004_NYSDPS%20SRP%20Presentation_revised.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=December 17, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tol obtained an [[M.Sc.]] in [[econometrics]] &amp; [[operations research]] in 1992 and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] in 1997 at the VU University Amsterdam. His doctoral thesis was titled, ''A decision-analytic treatise of the enhanced greenhouse effect''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/decision-analytic-treatise-of-the-enhanced-greenhouse-effect/oclc/068588209 | title=A decision-analytic treatise of the enhanced greenhouse effect |author=Tol, Richard S.J. |year=1997 | publisher=Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam | accessdate=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he contributed with some nineteen other academics to a joint project of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] at his home university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feenstra|first=J.F.|date=1998 print|title=Handbook on Methods. for Climate Change Impact Assessment and Adaptation Strategies|url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/10440/1/f1.pdf|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He regularly participates in studies of the [[Energy Modeling Forum]], is an editor of [[Energy Economics (journal)|''Energy Economics'']], associate editor of ''[[Environmental and Resource Economics]]'', and a member of the [[editorial board]] of ''Environmental Science and Policy'', and ''Integrated Assessment''. [[Research Papers in Economics|IDEAS/RePEc]] ranks him among the top 250 economists in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html#pto90 Top 5% Authors on IDEAS/RePEc]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tol specialises in [[energy economics]] and [[environmental economics]], with a particular interest in [[climate change]], such as the [[economics of global warming]]. Previously, Tol was a Research Professor at the [[Economic and Social Research Institute]]. Before that, Tol was the Michael Otto Professor of Sustainability and Global Change and director of the Center for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and board member of the Center for Marine and Climate Research at the [[University of Hamburg]]. Tol was a board member of the International Max Planck Research Schools on Earth System Modeling and Maritime Affairs and the European Forum on Integrated Environmental Assessment.&lt;ref name=deniers&gt;{{cite book | last = Solomon | first = Lawrence | authorlink = Lawrence Solomon | year = 2010 | title = [[The Deniers|The Deniers: The world-renowned scientists who stood up against global warming hysteria, political persecution, and fraud]] | publisher = Richard Vigilante Books | location = United States | isbn = 978-0-9800763-7-0}}, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998–2008 he was an adjunct professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s Department of Engineering and Public Policy, and from 2010–2011 an adjunct professor at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]'s Department of Economics.

==Climate change==
According to Tol "the impact of climate change is relatively small".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

Tol characterises his position as arguing that the economic costs of climate policy should be kept in proportion to its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c5b9efaa-c52e-11dc-811a-0000779fd2ac.html Financial Times, Jan 17, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/801df604-a698-11db-937f-0000779e2340,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F801df604-a698-11db-937f-0000779e2340.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3Drichard+tol Financial Times, Jan 18, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19626324.000-economics-demands-action-on-climate-change.html New Scientist, Dec 5, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues against the 2 °C 'guardrail' target for limiting temperature rises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tol|first=Richard S. J.|date=January 2006 online; January 2007 print|title=Europe's long-term climate target: A critical evaluation|journal=Energy Policy|publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=35|issue=1|pages=424–432|url=http://www.fnu.zmaw.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/publication/tol/RM7208.pdf|accessdate=2008-07-20|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2005.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tol does not advocate another target, but has suggested that a [[carbon tax]] of $20/tC would be a policy in line with estimates of the cost of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2008-25 R.S.J. Tol (2008), The Social Cost of Carbon: Trends, Outliers and Catastrophes, Economics the E-Journal, 2008–25]&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledges that this level of taxation is too low to significantly discourage fossil fuel use but argues it would help to stimulate the development of fuel-saving technology and improve the competitiveness of renewable energy sources. He states that compliance may affect the coal and oil industries and the people they employ.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In an interview with [[Der Spiegel]] in 2005, he argued that temperature rises between 2–4 °C would also have advantages. North of a line drawn from [[Paris]] to [[Munich]], people would benefit, e.g., from reduced energy bills. However, south of it, people would be overall "losers" of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnu.zmaw.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/news/spiegel-Tol-interview.pdf Spiegel, Feb 21, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Tol predicted a reduction in annual economic growth by 0.4% in the [[Republic of Ireland]] if greenhouse gases were reduced by 3% per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2007/1220/1197997063183.html Irish Times, Dec 20, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Tol published an influential paper that combined data from several earlier studies, concluding that at least some amount of global warming could lead to economic gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1257/jep.23.2.29| title = The Economic Effects of Climate Change| journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 29| year = 2009| last1 = Tol | first1 = R. S. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he published an update, correcting missing minus signs that had turned economic costs into benefits and adding data overlooked before; the mistakes he attributed to "[[gremlin]]s". According to Tol, the old and new results were not significantly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1257/jep.28.2.221| title = Correction and Update: The Economic Effects of Climate Change| journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives| volume = 28| issue = 2| pages = 221| year = 2014| last1 = Tol | first1 = R.

Tol was a coordinating lead author for the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. Tol said in March 2014 that he had withdrawn from the writing team for the Summary for Policy Makers of the report in September 2013, citing disagreement with the profile of the report which he considered too alarmist and putting too little emphasis on opportunities to adapt to climate changes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/27/ipcc-author-climate-report-alarmist IPCC author brands upcoming climate report 'alarmist'] ''The Guardian''. 28 March 2014. Retrieved 29 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 2014, Tol wrote, in an article for [[FoxNews.com]], that the IPCC is alarmist because it favors initial scientific papers published on an issue, rather than the follow-up papers, which, he says, tend to "pooh-pooh the initial drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/05/20/un-climate-change-expert-reveals-bias-in-global-warming-report/ | title=UN climate change expert reveals bias in global warming report | work=Fox News | date=20 May 2014 | accessdate=20 May 2014 | author=Tol, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copenhagen Consensus===
[[Bjørn Lomborg]] chose Tol to participate in his "[[Copenhagen Consensus]]" project in 2008. In 2008, Tol collaborated with [[Gary Yohe]], [[Richard G. Richels]] and Geoffrey Blanford to prepare the "Challenge Paper" on global warming which examined three approaches devised by Lomborg for tackling the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last1 = Yohe | first1 = Gary
| last2 = Tol | first2 = Richard
| title = Copenhagen Consensus Challenge Paper 2008: Global Warming
| location = Copenhagen
| year = 2008
| url = http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fCC08%2fPapers%2f0+Challenge+Papers%2fCP_Global_Warming_-_Yohe.pdf
| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3 results were then compared with 27 similar investigations, 3 each relating to 9 other 'challenges' in the areas of health and environment. Of the 30 policy alternatives that resulted, Lomborg's ranking procedure rated the 2 dealing with controlling emissions of greenhouse gases 29th and 30th in terms of cost effectiveness.

A "perspective paper" by Anil Markandya of the [[University of Bath]] on the Yohe/Tol study stated that "a short time period analysis is misleading" when all the costs are incurred during the period examined but benefits continue to accrue after its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that the study "stops short of the most that can be supported on a cost benefit basis" and stated that "it does not seem reasonable" to rely solely on Tol's own FUND model when alternatives "reported in the peer-reviewed literature are also credible".

[[Gary Yohe]] later accused Lomborg of "deliberate distortion of our conclusions",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/climatechange.carbonemissions | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Climate change is real, compelling and urgent | first=Gary | last=Yohe | date=2008-08-22 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "as one of the authors of the Copenhagen Consensus Project's principal climate paper, I can say with certainty that Lomborg is misrepresenting our findings thanks to a highly selective memory". In a subsequent joint statement settling their differences, Lomborg and Yohe agreed that the "failure" of Lomborg's emissions reduction plan "could be traced to faulty design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange1 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=It's not about us | first=Björn | last=Lomborg | date=2008-09-01 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lomborg awarded Tol a position on his Copenhagen Consensus panel again in 2009. According to Tol, "Lomborg successfully punches holes in climate hysteria" and "plays a useful role in the debate on climate policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2010/04/30/economics-voodoo-and-climate-policy/ |title=The Irish Economy » Blog Archive » Economics, voodoo, and climate policy |publisher=Irisheconomy.ie |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change and conflict===
According to Tol, "it is not clear whether climate change would lead to conflict".&lt;ref name=Tol5&gt;{{cite journal |author= Tol, RSJ |year= 2008 |title= Why Worry About Climate Change? A Research Agenda |journal= Environmental Values |volume= 17 |pages= 437–470 |url= http://www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/publication/tol/RM8133.pdf |doi= 10.3197/096327108X368485 |issue= 4 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103630/http://www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/publication/tol/RM8133.pdf |archivedate= 2011-07-19 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing a lack of suitable methods for evaluating hypothetical conflicts numerically, he examines what he calls plausible scenarios, such as drought and migration in the [[Horn of Africa]] or an upsurge in terrorism.

Regarding terrorism, he says "it may well be that a Maldivian terrorist will try and blow up the headquarters of ExxonAramco".&lt;ref name=Tol5/&gt; Regarding the Horn of Africa scenario, he acknowledges it might cause substantial human suffering but assesses the probability of this actually happening as unlikely. He concludes that "poor and exhausted people are unlikely to take up arms, and if they do, they are probably not very effective".&lt;ref name=Tol5/&gt;

In early [[military engineer]]ing, a '''saucisson''' ([[French language|French]] for a large, dry-filled [[sausage]]) was a primitive type of [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]], consisting of a long tube or hose of cloth or leather, typically about an inch and half in diameter (37&amp;nbsp;mm), damp-proofed with [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] and filled with [[black powder]]. It was normally laid in a protective wooden trough, and ignited by use of a [[torch]] or [[slow match]]. Saucissons were used to fire [[fougasse (weapon)|fougasse]]s, [[petard]]s, [[Mining (military)|mines]] and [[camouflet]]s.

Very long [[fascine]]s were also called '''saucissons'''.

Later, in early 20th century [[mining]] [[jargon]], a '''saucisson''' referred to the flexible casings used for [[explosive]]s in mine operations.

[[File:MISB ST 0601.8 - Platform Sideslip Angle.png|thumb|400px|Aircraft sideslip angle]]
A '''slip''' is an [[aerodynamic]] state where an [[aircraft]] is moving ''somewhat'' sideways as well as forward relative to the oncoming airflow or [[relative wind]]. In other words, for a conventional aircraft, the nose will be pointing in the opposite direction to the bank of the wing(s). The aircraft is not in [[coordinated flight]] and therefore is flying inefficiently.

==Background==
Flying in a slip is aerodynamically inefficient, since the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] is reduced. More drag is at play consuming energy but not producing lift. Inexperienced or [[absent-mindedness|inattentive]] pilots will often enter slips unintentionally during turns by failing to coordinate the aircraft with the [[rudder]]. Airplanes can readily enter into a slip climbing out from take-off on a windy day. If left unchecked, climb performance will suffer. This is especially dangerous if there are nearby obstructions under the climb path and the aircraft is underpowered or heavily loaded.

A slip can also be a ''piloting maneuver'' where the pilot deliberately enters one type of slip or another. Slips are particularly useful in performing a short field landing over an obstacle (such as trees, or power lines), or to avoid an obstacle (such as a single tree on the extended centerline of the runway), and may be practiced as part of emergency landing procedures. These methods are also commonly employed when flying into farmstead or rough country airstrips where the landing strip is short. Pilots need to touch down with ample runway remaining to slow down and stop.

There are common situations where a [[aviator|pilot]] may deliberately enter a slip by using opposite rudder and [[aileron]] inputs, most commonly in a landing approach at low power.&lt;ref name="SHIF"&gt;John S. Denker, ''See How It Flies''. http://www.av8n.com/how/htm/snaps.html#sec-intentional-slip&lt;/ref&gt;

Without [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] or [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] it is difficult to increase the steepness of the glide without adding significant speed. This excess speed can cause the aircraft to fly in [[Ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effect]] for an extended period, perhaps running out of runway. In a forward slip much more drag is created, allowing the pilot to dissipate altitude without increasing airspeed, increasing the angle of descent (glide slope). Forward slips are especially useful when operating pre-1950s training aircraft, aerobatic aircraft such as the [[Pitts Special]] or any aircraft with inoperative flaps or spoilers.

Often, if an airplane in a slip is made to stall, it displays very little of the yawing tendency that causes a [[Skid (aerodynamics)|skidding]] stall to develop into a [[Spin (flight)|spin]]. A stalling airplane in a slip may do little more than tend to roll into a wings-level attitude. In fact, in some airplanes stall characteristics may even be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-3a-4of7.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027061402/http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-3a-4of7.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forward-slip vs. sideslip==
Aerodynamically these are identical once established, but they are entered for different reasons and will create different ground tracks and headings relative to those prior to entry. '''Forward-slip '''is used to steepen an approach (reduce height) without gaining much airspeed,&lt;ref name="The Forward Slip to Steepen an Approach"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thom|first=Trevor|title=The Flying Training Manual|year=1993|publisher=Aviation Theory Centre P/L|location=Vic. Australia|isbn=1-875537-18-X|page=8/19}}&lt;/ref&gt; benefiting from the increased drag. The '''sideslip '''moves the aircraft sideways (often, only in relation to the wind) where executing a turn would be inadvisable, drag is considered a byproduct. Most pilots like to enter sideslip just before flaring or touching down during a crosswind landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thom|first=Trevor|title=The Flying Training Manual|year=1993|publisher=Aviation Theory Centre P/L|location=Vic.

The forward slip changes the [[Aircraft heading|heading]] of the aircraft away from the down wing, while retaining the original ''track'' (flight path over the ground) of the aircraft.

To execute a forward slip, the pilot [[Aileron|banks]] into the wind and applies opposing rudder (e.g., right aileron + left rudder) in order to keep moving towards the target. If you were the target you would see the plane's nose off to one side, a wing off to the other side and tilted down toward you. The pilot must make sure that the plane's nose is low enough to keep airspeed up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Perform-a-Forward-Slip-in-a-Cessna-152-to-Descend-Rapidly|title=How to Perform a Forward Slip in a Cessna 152 to Descend Rapidly|author=|date=|website=wikihow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, airframe speed limits such as V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt; must be observed.&lt;ref&gt;[[V speeds#Regulatory V-speeds]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A forward-slip is useful when a pilot has set up for a landing approach with excessive height or must descend steeply beyond a tree line to touchdown near the runway threshold. Assuming that the plane is properly lined up for the runway, the forward slip will allow the aircraft ''track'' to be maintained while steepening the descent without adding excessive airspeed. Since the heading is not aligned with the runway, forward-slip must be removed before touchdown to avoid excessive side loading on the landing gear, and if a cross wind is present an appropriate '''sideslip''' may be necessary at touchdown as described below.

In the [[United States]], student pilots are required to know how to do forward slips before embarking on their first solo flight. The logic is that in the event of an engine failure, the pilot will have to land on the first attempt and will not have a chance to go around if the aircraft is too high or too fast {{dubious|date=May 2016}}.

===Sideslip===
The '''sideslip''' also uses aileron and opposite rudder. In this case it is entered by lowering a wing and applying exactly enough opposite rudder so the airplane does not turn (maintaining the same ''heading''), while maintaining safe airspeed with [[Elevator (aircraft)|pitch]] or [[Throttle|power]]. Compared to Forward-slip, less rudder is used: just enough to stop the change in the heading.

In the sideslip condition, the airplane's longitudinal axis remains parallel to the original flightpath, but the airplane no longer flies straight along its original track. Now, the horizontal component of lift forces the airplane to move sideways toward the low wing. This is the still-air, headwind or tailwind scenario. In case of crosswind, if the wing is lowered into the wind, the wind may push the airplane downwind and airplane may fly the original track. This is the sideslip approach technique used by many pilots in crosswind conditions [sideslip without slipping]. Other method is the crab-technique in which nose is pointed into the wind and the resulting drift keeps the airplane on the desired track. Wings are maintained level all the time.

A sideslip may be used exclusively to remain lined up with a runway centerline while on approach in a [[crosswind]] or be employed in the final moments of a crosswind landing. To commence sideslipping, the pilot [[Aileron|rolls]] the airplane toward the wind to maintain runway centerline position while maintaining heading on the centerline with the rudder. Sideslip causes one main landing gear to touch down first, followed by the second main gear. This allows the wheels to be constantly aligned with the track, thus avoiding any side load at touchdown.

The sideslip method for [[crosswind landing]]s is not suitable for long-winged and low-sitting aircraft such as [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]], where instead a crab angle (heading into the wind) is maintained until a moment before touchdown.

Aircraft manufacturer Airbus recommends sideslip approach only in low crosswind conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Airbus - Flight Operations Briefing Notes - Landing Techniques - Crosswind Landings&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sideslip angle====
The sideslip angle, also called angle of sideslip (AOS, AoS, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[beta (letter)|beta]]), is a term used in [[fluid dynamics]] and [[aerodynamics]] and [[aviation]]. It relates to the rotation of the aircraft centerline from the [[relative wind]]. In [[flight dynamics]] it is given the shorthand notation &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (beta) and is usually assigned to be "positive" when the relative wind is coming from the right of the nose of the airplane. The sideslip angle &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is essentially the directional [[angle of attack]] of the airplane. It is the primary parameter in [[directional stability]] considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In vehicle dynamics, side slip angle is defined as the angle made by the velocity vector to longitudinal axis of the vehicle at the center of gravity in an instantaneous frame. As the lateral acceleration increases during cornering, the side slip angle decreases. Thus at very high speed turns and small turning radius, there is a high lateral acceleration and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; could be a negative value.

==Uses of the slip==

===Other uses===

There are other, specialized circumstances where slips can be useful in aviation. For example, during aerial photography, a slip can lower one side of the aircraft to allow ground photos to be taken through a side window. Pilots will also use a slip to land in icing conditions if the front windshield has been entirely iced over—by landing slightly sideways, the pilot is able to see the runway through the aircraft's side window. Slips also play a role in [[aerobatics]] and [[aerial warfare|aerial combat]].

=== Notable employment of the slip ===
*[[Gimli Glider]] – a 767 captain who happened to have glider experience made a successful engine-out landing despite excessive approach altitude by employing a forward slip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/the-gimli-glider/|title=The Gimli Glider|author=|date=|website=www.damninteresting.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[TACA Flight 110]] – pilot Carlos Dardano of El Salvador had performed a side slip&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnX1u5vp1J4|title=YouTube|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to correct the course of the Boeing 737-300 airliner and then landed safely on a narrow grass levee in New Orleans, bringing the airplane to a safe stop.

==How a slip affects flight==
When an aircraft is put into a forward slip with no other changes to the throttle or elevator, the pilot will notice an increased rate of descent (or reduced rate of ''ascent''). This is usually mostly due to increased drag on the fuselage. The airflow over the fuselage is at a sideways angle, increasing the relative frontal area, which increases drag.

{{infobox terbium}}
'''Terbium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Tb''' and [[atomic number]] 65. It is a silvery-white, [[rare earth element|rare earth]] [[metal]] that is [[malleable]], [[ductile]], and soft enough to be cut with a knife. The ninth member of the [[lanthanide]] series, terbium is a fairly [[electropositive]] metal that reacts with water, evolving [[hydrogen]] gas. Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many [[mineral]]s, including [[cerite]], [[gadolinite]], [[monazite]], [[xenotime]], and [[euxenite]].

Swedish chemist [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]] discovered terbium as a chemical element in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in [[yttrium oxide]], Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Yttrium and terbium are named after the village of [[Ytterby]] in Sweden. Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of [[ion exchange]] techniques.

Terbium is used to [[dopant|dope]] [[calcium fluoride]], calcium [[tungstate]] and [[strontium]] [[molybdate]], materials that are used in [[solid-state device]]s, and as a crystal stabilizer of [[fuel cell]]s which operate at elevated temperatures. As a component of [[Terfenol-D]] (an alloy that expands and contracts when exposed to magnetic fields more than any other alloy), terbium is of use in  [[actuator]]s, in naval [[sonar]] systems and in [[sensor]]s.

Most of the world's terbium supply is used in green phosphors. Terbium [[oxide]] is in [[fluorescent lamp]]s and television and monitor [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs). Terbium green [[phosphor]]s are combined with divalent [[europium]] blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide [[trichromatic]] lighting technology, a high-efficiency white light used for standard illumination in indoor lighting.

== Characteristics ==

===Physical properties===
Terbium is a silvery-white [[rare earth element|rare earth]] [[metal]] that is [[malleable]], [[ductile]] and soft enough to be cut with a knife.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; It is relatively stable in air compared to the earlier, more reactive lanthanides in the first half of the lanthanide series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.elementsales.com/re_exp/index.htm |title = Rare-Earth Metal Long Term Air Exposure Test| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terbium exists in two crystal [[allotropy|allotropes]] with a transformation temperature of 1289&amp;nbsp;°C between them.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; The 65 electrons of a terbium atom are arranged in the [[electron configuration]] [Xe]4f&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; normally, only three electrons can be removed before the nuclear charge becomes too great to allow further ionization, but in the case of terbium, the stability of the half-filled [Xe]4f&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; configuration allows further ionization of a fourth electron in the presence of very strong oxidizing agents such as [[fluorine]] gas.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

The terbium(III) cation is brilliantly [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]], in a bright lemon-yellow color that is the result of a strong green [[emission line]] in combination with other lines in the orange and red. The [[yttrofluorite]] variety of the mineral [[fluorite]] owes its creamy-yellow fluorescence in part to terbium. Terbium easily oxidizes, and is therefore used in its elemental form specifically for research. Single terbium atoms have been isolated by implanting them into [[fullerene]] molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shimada|first1=T.|last2=Ohno|first2=Y.|last3=Okazaki|first3=T.|last4=Sugai|first4=T.|last5=Suenaga|first5=K.|last6=Kishimoto|first6=S.|last7=Mizutani|first7=T.|last8=Inoue|first8=T.|last9=Taniguchi|first9=R.|last10=Fukui|display-authors=3 | first10=N.|last11=Okubo | first11=H.|last12=Shinohara | first12=H.|title=Transport properties of C&lt;sub&gt;78&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; and Dy@C&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt; fullerenes – nanopeapods by field effect transistors|journal=Physica E: Low-dimensional Systems and Nanostructures|year=2004|volume=21|issue=2–4|pages=1089–1092|doi=10.1016/j.physe.2003.11.197|bibcode = 2004PhyE...21.1089S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terbium has a simple [[ferromagnetic]] ordering at temperatures below 219 K. Above 219 K, it turns into a helical [[antiferromagnetic]] state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular [[basal plane]] layer are parallel, and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered [[paramagnetic]] state at 230 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Jackson, M. | title =Magnetism of Rare Earth| url =http://www.irm.umn.edu/quarterly/irmq10-3.pdf | journal = The IRM Quarterly | volume =10| issue = 3| page = 1| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
The most common oxidation state of terbium is +3, as in [[Terbium(III) oxide|{{chem|Tb|2|O|3}}]]. The +4 state is known in TbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Higher Oxides of the Lanthanide Elements: Terbium Dioxide|author=Gruen, D.M. |author2=Koehler, W.C. |author3=Katz, J.J. |date=April 1951|pages=1475–1479|volume=73|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|doi=10.1021/ja01148a020|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;
Terbium burns readily to form a mixed [[terbium(III,IV) oxide]]:&lt;ref name="reactions"/&gt;

In solution, terbium forms only trivalent ions. Terbium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form terbium hydroxide:&lt;ref name="reactions"/&gt;
:2&amp;nbsp;Tb + 6&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Tb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

Terbium metal reacts with all the halogens, forming white trihalides:&lt;ref name="reactions"/&gt;
:2&amp;nbsp;Tb + 3&amp;nbsp;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2&amp;nbsp;TbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (X = [[fluorine|F]], [[chlorine|Cl]], [[bromine|Br]], [[iodine|I]])

Terbium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form solutions containing the pale pink terbium(III) ions, which exist as [Tb(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes:&lt;ref name="reactions"&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/terbium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Terbium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terbium combines with nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic at elevated temperatures, forming various binary compounds such as TbH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, TbH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TbB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[terbium(III) sulfide|Tb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], TbSe, TbTe and [[terbium(III) nitride|TbN]].&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt; In those compounds, Tb mostly exhibits the oxidation states +3 and sometimes +2. Terbium(II) halogenides are obtained by annealing Tb(III) halogenides in presence of metallic Tb in tantalum containers. Terbium also forms sesquichloride Tb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be further reduced to TbCl by annealing at 800&amp;nbsp;°C. This terbium(I) chloride forms platelets with layered graphite-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page=1128| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3MWRONWAmMC&amp;pg=PA1128| title =Advanced inorganic chemistry| edition =6th| author= Cotton| publisher= Wiley-India| date = 2007| isbn =978-81-265-1338-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|isotopes of terbium}}
Naturally occurring terbium is composed of its only stable [[isotope]], terbium-159; the element is thus called [[mononuclidic element|mononuclidic]] and [[monoisotopic element|monoisotopic]]. Thirty-six [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, with the heaviest being terbium-171 (with [[atomic mass]] of 170.95330(86) [[Dalton (unit)|u]]) and lightest being terbium-135 (exact mass unknown).&lt;ref name="iso"&gt;{{cite journal |author=G.

All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are much less than a quarter of a year, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half a minute.&lt;ref name="iso"/&gt; The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;159&lt;/sup&gt;Tb, is [[electron capture]], which results in production of [[gadolinium]] isotopes, and the primary mode after is [[beta minus decay]], resulting in [[dysprosium]] isotopes.&lt;ref name="iso"/&gt;

The element also has 27 [[nuclear isomer]]s, with masses of 141–154, 156, and 158 (not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer). The most stable of them are terbium-156m, with half-life of 24.4 hours and terbium-156m2, with half-life of 22.7 hours; this is longer than half-lives of most ground states of radioactive terbium isotopes, except only those with mass numbers 155–161.&lt;ref name="iso"/&gt;

== History ==
[[Sweden|Swedish]] [[chemist]] [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]] discovered terbium in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in [[yttrium oxide]], Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Yttrium is named after the village of [[Ytterby]] in [[Sweden]]. Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of [[ion exchange]] techniques.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Mosander first separated yttria into three fractions, all named for the ore: yttria, erbia, and terbia. "Terbia" was originally the fraction that contained the pink color, due to the element now known as [[erbium]]. "Erbia" (containing what we now call terbium) originally was the fraction that was essentially colorless in solution. The insoluble oxide of this element was noted to be tinged brown.

Later workers had difficulty in observing the minor colorless "erbia", but the soluble pink fraction was impossible to miss. Arguments went back and forth as to whether erbia even existed. In the confusion, the original names got reversed, and the exchange of names stuck, so that the pink fraction referred eventually to the solution containing erbium (which in solution, is pink). It is now thought that workers using double sodium or [[potassium sulfate]]s to remove ceria from yttria inadvertently lost the terbium into the ceria-containing precipitate. What is now known as terbium was only about 1% of the original yttria, but that was sufficient to impart a yellowish color to the yttrium oxide. Thus, terbium was a minor component in the original fraction containing it, where it was dominated by its immediate neighbors, [[gadolinium]] and [[dysprosium]].

Thereafter, whenever other rare earths were teased apart from this mixture, whichever fraction gave the brown oxide retained the terbium name, until at last, the brown oxide of terbium was obtained in pure form. The 19th century investigators did not have the benefit of the UV fluorescence technology to observe the brilliant yellow or green Tb(III) fluorescence that would have made terbium easier to identify in solid mixtures or solutions.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book| page = 5| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1npz8pwmYwC&amp;pg=PA5| title =Extractive metallurgy of rare earths| author =Gupta, C.

== Occurrence ==
[[Image:Xenotim mineralogisches museum bonn.jpg|thumb|Xenotime]]
Terbium is contained along with other rare earth elements in many minerals, including [[monazite]] ((Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with up to 0.03% terbium), [[xenotime]] (YPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[euxenite]] ((Y,Ca,Er,La,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; with 1% or more terbium). The crust abundance of terbium is estimated as 1.2&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name=patnaik&gt;{{cite book | last =Patnaik | first =Pradyot  | date = 2003 | title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 920–921| isbn =978-0-07-049439-8 |  url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&amp;pg=PA243 | accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; No terbium-dominant mineral has yet been found.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/ |title=Mindat.org |author=Hudson Institute of Mineralogy |date=1993–2018 |website=www.mindat.org |access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the richest commercial sources of terbium are the ion-adsorption [[clay]]s of [[southern China]]; the concentrates with about two-thirds yttrium oxide by weight have about 1% terbia. Small amounts of terbium occur in [[bastnäsite]] and monazite; when these are processed by solvent extraction to recover the valuable heavy lanthanides as [[samarium]]-[[europium]]-[[gadolinium]] concentrate, terbium is recovered therein. Due to the large volumes of bastnäsite processed relative to the ion-adsorption clays, a significant proportion of the world's terbium supply comes from bastnäsite.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

== Production ==
Crushed terbium-containing minerals are treated with hot concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to pH 3–4. [[Thorium]] precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with [[ammonium oxalate]] to convert rare earths into their insoluble [[oxalate]]s. The oxalates are decomposed to oxides by heating. The oxides are dissolved in [[nitric acid]] that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Terbium is separated as a double salt with [[ammonium nitrate]] by crystallization.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;

The most efficient separation routine for terbium salt from the rare-earth salt solution is [[ion exchange]]. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. As with other rare earths, terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal. Calcium and [[tantalum]] impurities can be removed by vacuum remelting, distillation, amalgam formation or [[zone melting]].&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;

== Applications ==
Terbium is used as a [[dopant]] in [[calcium fluoride]], calcium [[tungstate]], and [[strontium]] [[molybdate]], materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of [[fuel cell]]s which operate at elevated temperatures, together with [[zirconium(IV) oxide|ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book | editor = Lide, D.

Terbium is also used in [[alloy]]s and in the production of electronic devices. As a component of [[Terfenol-D]], terbium is used in  [[actuator]]s, in naval [[sonar]] systems, [[sensor]]s, in the [[SoundBug]] device (its first commercial application), and other magnetomechanical devices. Terfenol-D is a terbium alloy that expands or contracts in the presence of a magnetic field. It has the highest [[magnetostriction]] of any [[alloy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.sna.2008.11.026|title=New elastomer–Terfenol-D magnetostrictive composites|date=2009|author=Rodriguez, C|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|volume=149|pages=251|last2=Rodriguez|first2=M.|last3=Orue|first3=I.|last4=Vilas|first4=J.|last5=Barandiaran|first5=J.|last6=Gubieda|first6=M.|last7=Leon|first7=L.|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terbium [[oxide]] is used in green [[phosphor]]s in fluorescent lamps and color TV tubes. [[Sodium]] terbium [[borate]] is used in [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices. The brilliant fluorescence allows terbium to be used as a probe in biochemistry, where it somewhat resembles [[calcium]] in its behavior. Terbium "green" phosphors (which fluoresce a brilliant lemon-yellow) are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide the [[trichromatic]] lighting technology which is by far the largest consumer of the world's terbium supply. Trichromatic lighting provides much higher light output for a given amount of electrical energy than does [[incandescent light]]ing.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

Terbium is also used to detect [[endospores]], as it acts as an assay of [[dipicolinic acid]] based on [[photoluminescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosen|first1=D. L.|last2=Sharpless|first2=C.|last3=McGown|first3=L.

== Precautions ==
As with the other [[lanthanide]]s, terbium compounds are of low to moderate toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Terbium has no known biological role.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

In June to August photochemical ozone production causes very high concentrations over the East Coast of the USA and China.]]

[[Ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[trace gas]] of the [[troposphere]], with an average concentration of 20-30 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), with close to 100 ppbv in polluted areas. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemistry of The Natural Atmosphere|last=Warneck|first=Peter|publisher=Academic Press|year=1999|isbn=9780080529066|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elte.prompt.hu/sites/default/files/tananyagok/AtmosphericChemistry/ch08s02.html|title=8.2 Tropospheric ozone|website=elte.prompt.hu|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ozone is also an important constituent of the [[stratosphere]], where the [[ozone layer]] exists. The [[troposphere]] is the lowest layer of the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere. It extends from the ground up to a variable height of approximately 14 kilometers above [[sea level]]. Ozone is least concentrated in the ground layer (or [[planetary boundary layer]]) of the troposphere. It's concentration increases as height above sea level increases, with a maximum concentration at the [[tropopause]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/facts/SH.html|title=Nasa Ozone Watch: Ozone facts|website=ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90% of total ozone in the atmosphere is in the stratosphere, and 10% is in the troposphere. Although tropospheric ozone is less concentrated than stratospheric ozone, it is of concern because of its [[Tropospheric Ozone#Health effects|health effects]]. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scied.ucar.edu/ozone-troposphere|title=Ozone in the Troposphere {{!}} UCAR Center for Science Education|website=scied.ucar.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone in the troposphere is considered a [[greenhouse gas]], and may contribute to [[Global warming#Greenhouse gases|global warming]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Photo-chemical and chemical reactions involving ozone drive many of the chemical processes that occur in the troposphere by day and by night. At abnormally high concentrations brought about by human activities (the largest source being emissions from combustion of fossil fuels), it is a [[pollutant]], and a constituent of [[smog]]. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccacoalition.org/en/slcps/tropospheric-ozone|title=Tropospheric ozone {{!}} Climate &amp; Clean Air Coalition|website=ccacoalition.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Photolysis]] of ozone occurs at wavelengths below approximately 310-320 [[Nanometre|nano-meters]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taniguchi|first=Nori|last2=Takahashi|first2=Kenshi|last3=Matsumi|first3=Yutaka|date=|title=Photodissociation of O3around 309 nm|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp001706i|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|language=en|volume=104|issue=39|pages=8936–8944|doi=10.1021/jp001706i|issn=1089-5639|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reeves|first=Claire E.|last2=Penkett|first2=Stuart A.|last3=Bauguitte|first3=Stephane|last4=Law|first4=Kathy S.|last5=Evans|first5=Mathew J.|last6=Bandy|first6=Brian J.|last7=Monks|first7=Paul S.|last8=Edwards|first8=Gavin D.|last9=Phillips|first9=Gavin|date=2002-12-11|title=Potential for photochemical ozone formation in the troposphere over the North Atlantic as derived from aircraft observations during ACSOE|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002JD002415|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|language=en|volume=107|issue=D23|pages=ACH 14–1-ACH 14-14|doi=10.1029/2002jd002415|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This reaction initiates the chain of chemical reactions that remove [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and other [[Hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]] from the atmosphere via [[Redox|oxidation]]. Therefore, the concentration of tropospheric ozone affects how long these compounds remain in the air. If the oxidation of carbon monoxide or methane occur in the presence of [[Nitric oxide|nitrogen monoxide]] (NO), this chain of reactions has a net product of ozone added to the system. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Measurement ==
[[Ozone]] in the atmosphere can be measured by [[remote sensing]] technology, or by [[In situ#Earth and atmospheric sciences|''in-situ'']] monitoring technology. Because ozone absorbs light in the [[UV spectrum]], the most common way to measure ozone is to measure how much of this light spectrum is absorbed in the atmosphere. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/assessments/ozone/2010/twentyquestions/Q5.pdf|title=How is ozone measured in the atmosphere?|last=ERSL NOAA|first=|date=|website=/www.esrl.noaa.gov/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-09-ozone-space.html|title=Measuring ozone from space|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the stratosphere has higher ozone concentration than the troposphere, it is important for remote sensing instruments to be able to determine altitude along with the concentration measurements. The [https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/total-ozone-mapping-spectrometer-earth-probe TOMS-EP] instrument aboard a satellite from [[NASA]] is an example of an ozone layer measuring satellite &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/total-ozone-mapping-spectrometer-earth-probe|title=total-ozone-mapping-spectrometer-earth-probe|last=NASA|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [https://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/ TES] is an example of an ozone measuring satellite that is specifically for the troposphere. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/|title=TES|last=NASA|first=|date=|website=tes.jpl.nasa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lidar]] is a common ground based remote sensing technique to measure ozone. [https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/TOLNet/ TOLnet] is the network of ozone observing lidars across the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/TOLNet/|title=NASA Tropospheric Chemistry Integrated Data Center|last=LaRC|first=Ali Aknan :|date=2005-06-22|website=www-air.larc.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozonesondes are a form of in situ, or local measurements. An ozonesonde is an ozone measuring instrument attached to a meteorological balloon, so that the instrument can directly measure ozone concentration at the varying altitudes along the balloon's upward path. The information collected from the instrument attached to the balloon is transmitted back using [[radiosonde]] technology. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] has worked to create a global network of tropospheric ozone measurements using ozonesondes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ozwv/ozsondes/|title=ESRL Global Monitoring Division - Ozone and Water Vapor Group|last=Laboratory|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, Earth System Research|website=www.esrl.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is also measured in [[air quality]] [[environmental monitoring]] networks. In these networks, in-situ [[Ozone monitor|ozone monitors]] based on ozone's UV-absorption properties are used to measure ppb-levels in ambient air.

== Formation ==
The majority of tropospheric ozone formation occurs when [[nitrogen oxides]] (NOx), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs), react in the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight, specifically the UV spectrum. NOx, CO, and VOCs are considered ozone precursors. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccacoalition.org/en/slcps/tropospheric-ozone|title=Tropospheric ozone {{!}} Climate &amp; Clean Air Coalition|website=ccacoalition.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scied.ucar.edu/ozone-troposphere|title=Ozone in the Troposphere {{!}} UCAR Center for Science Education|website=scied.ucar.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motor vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and chemical solvents are the major anthropogenic sources of these ozone precursors.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Although the ozone precursors often originate in urban areas, winds can carry NOx hundreds of kilometers, causing ozone formation to occur in less populated regions as well.

The chemical reactions that produce tropospheric ozone are a series of interrelated cycles (known as the HOx and NOx cycles); They start with the [[Redox|oxidation]] of carbon monoxide (CO) or VOCs (such as [[butane]]). To begin the process, CO and VOCs are oxidized by the [[hydroxyl radical]] (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH) to form carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) in the CO oxidation case. These oxidizing reactions then produce the [[Hydroperoxyl|peroxy radical]] (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;) that will react with NO to produce NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is subsequently photolyzed during by daytime, thus resulting in NO and a single oxygen atom. This single oxygen atom reacts with molecular oxygen O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce ozone. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reeves|first=Claire E.|last2=Penkett|first2=Stuart A.|last3=Bauguitte|first3=Stephane|last4=Law|first4=Kathy S.|last5=Evans|first5=Mathew J.|last6=Bandy|first6=Brian J.|last7=Monks|first7=Paul S.|last8=Edwards|first8=Gavin D.|last9=Phillips|first9=Gavin|date=2002-12-11|title=Potential for photochemical ozone formation in the troposphere over the North Atlantic as derived from aircraft observations during ACSOE|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002JD002415|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|language=en|volume=107|issue=D23|pages=ACH 14–1-ACH 14-14|doi=10.1029/2002jd002415|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An outline of the chain reaction that occurs in oxidation of CO, producing O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: &lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elte.prompt.hu/sites/default/files/tananyagok/AtmosphericChemistry/ch08s02.html|title=8.2 Tropospheric ozone|website=elte.prompt.hu|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

The reaction begins with the oxidation of CO by the [[hydroxyl radical]] (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH). The radical [[adduct]] (•HOCO) is unstable and reacts rapidly with oxygen to give a [[Hydroperoxyl|peroxy radical]], HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;:

: •OH + CO → •HOCO
: •HOCO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;• + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Peroxy-radicals then go on to react with NO to produce NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is [[Photolysis|photolysed]] by UV-A radiation to give a [[Ground state|ground-state]] atomic oxygen, which then reacts with molecular oxygen to form ozone. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

: HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; + NO → &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + hν → NO + O(&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P) ,  λ&lt;400 nm
: O(&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
: ''note that these three reactions are what forms the ozone molecule, and will occur the same way in the oxidation of CO or VOCs case.''

The amount of ozone produced through these reactions in ambient air can be estimated using a modified [[Leighton relationship]]. The limit on these interrelated cycles producing ozone is the reaction of •OH with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [[nitric acid]] at high [[NOx]] levels. If nitrogen monoxide (NO) is instead present at very low levels in the atmosphere (less than 10 approximately ppt), the of peroxy radicals (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;• ) formed from the oxidation will instead react with themselves to form [[peroxides]], and not produce ozone. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

== Health effects ==
{{See also|Ozone#Health_effects}}
Health effects depend on ozone precursors, which is a group of pollutants, primarily generated during the combustion of fossil fuels. Reaction with daylight ultraviolet (UV) rays and these precursors create ground-level ozone pollution (Tropospheric Ozone).
Ozone is known to have the following health effects at concentrations common in urban air:
* Irritation of the [[respiratory system]], causing coughing, throat irritation, and/or an uncomfortable sensation in the chest.
* Reduced [[lung]] function, making it more difficult to breathe deeply and vigorously. Breathing may become more rapid and more shallow than normal, and a person's ability to engage in vigorous activities may be limited.
* Aggravation of [[asthma]]. When ozone levels are high, more people with asthma have attacks that require a doctor's attention or use of medication. One reason this happens is that ozone makes people more sensitive to [[allergen]]s, which in turn trigger asthma attacks.
* Increased susceptibility to [[Upper respiratory tract infection|respiratory infections]].
* Inflammation and damage to the lining of the lungs. Within a few days, the damaged cells are shed and replaced much like the skin peels after a sunburn. Animal studies suggest that if this type of inflammation happens repeatedly over a long time period (months, years, a lifetime), lung tissue may become permanently scarred, resulting in permanent loss of lung function and a lower quality of life.

A statistical study of 95 large urban communities in the United States found significant association between ozone levels and premature death. The study estimated that a one-third reduction in urban ozone concentrations would save roughly 4000 lives per year (Bell et al., 2004). Tropospheric Ozone causes approximately 22,000 premature deaths per year in 25 countries in the European Union. (WHO, 2008)

==Problem areas==
[[Image:US-ozone-non-attainment-2007-06.png|thumb|right|300px]]
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has developed an Air Quality index to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. 8-hour average ozone [[mole fraction]]s of 76 to 95 nmol/mol are described as "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups", 96 nmol/mol to 115 nmol/mol as "unhealthy" and 116 nmol/mol to 404 nmol/mol as "very unhealthy" [http://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=health2.smog1#4].  The EPA has designated over 300 counties of the United States, clustered around the most heavily populated areas (especially in California and the Northeast), as failing to comply with the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]].

==Climate change==
Melting of [[Arctic sea ice decline|sea ice]] releases molecular [[chlorine]], which reacts with UV radiation to produce chlorine radicals. Because chlorine radicals are highly reactive, they can expedite the degradation of [[Atmospheric methane|methane]] and tropospheric ozone and the oxidation of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] to more toxic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
