Rock throwing from highway overpasses by teenagers along Interstate 75 caused two deaths in separate incidents in 2017: one in Michigan and one in Ohio.

==Michigan rock throwing death==

Kenneth White, 32, was killed on October 18, 2017 when a 6-pound rock thrown by a group of five teenage vandals crashed through the windshield of the van he was riding in on [[Interstate 75 in Michigan]], in Vienna Township, 80 miles north of Detroit. Other cars were also damaged by rocks a group of four boys were throwing.&lt;ref name="JohnsonPassenger"/&gt;

===Incident===
The teenagers confessed to having thrown multiple rocks at cars driving south on I-75 from their position on the Dodge Road overpass in Vienna Township.&lt;ref name="Gebel75"/&gt;  The five hooligans had gathered large rocks, one weighing {{convert|20|lbs}}, from a dead-end street in Vienna Township, loading them into the flatbed of a pickup truck, before driving to the overpass where they were dropped onto cars as they passed below.&lt;ref name="AdamsCase"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adams |first1=Dominic |title=With DNA results back, exam date set in fatal I-75 rock-throwing case |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/05/dna_test_results_back_judge_se.html |accessdate=12 November 2018 |publisher=MLive |date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MartindaleDeath"/&gt;

====Victim====
The victim, Kenneth White, 32, was seated in the passenger seat. He left a fiancee and four children.&lt;ref name="MogheCasarez"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moghe |first1=Sonia |last2=Casarez |first2=Jean |title=Michigan highway rock shatters more than one life |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/26/us/highway-rock-death-michigan-teens/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2018 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; White, a construction worker, was riding with a co-worker.&lt;ref name="ConstructionWorker"&gt;{{cite news |title=Teens accused of tossing rocks from overpass, killing construction worker |url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/teens-accused-of-tossing-rocks-from-overpass-killing-construction-worker |accessdate=12 November 2018 |publisher=Fox News |date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and convictions===
The young men throwing rocks that night were arrested and charged.&lt;ref name="InMichiganAP"&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen pleads guilty in fatal freeway rock-throwing case Four other teens were charged in the incident that killed a man in Michigan |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/teen-pleads-guilty-fatal-freeway-rock-throwing-case-n925166 |accessdate=12 November 2018 |agency=AP |publisher=NBC News |date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gebel75"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gebel |first1=Meira |title=Teens plead guilty in rock-throwing death on I-75 |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/10/29/teens-plead-guilty-overpass-rock-death/1804600002/ |accessdate=12 November 2018 |publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the five young men, all from the [[Clio, Michigan]] area, who were part of the group throwing rocks at cars driving on Interstate 75 that night accepted plea deals to a reduced charge of manslaughter. They are Mark Sekelsky, 16; Trevor Gray, 15; Alexzander Miller, 15; and Mikadkyn Payne, 16.  The fifth is Kyle Anger, 18.&lt;ref name="MartindaleDeath"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark |title=4 of 5 teens accept plea deal in I-75 rock-throwing death |url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/2018/07/16/4-teens-accept-plea-deal-75-rock-throwing-death/789011002/ |accessdate=12 November 2018 |publisher=[[The Detroit News]] |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohio rock-throwing death==
Marquise Byrd, 26, a resident of Warren, Michigan, was killed on Interstate 75 near [[Toledo, Ohio]] when teenagers dropped a sandbag from a bridge onto the car in which he was a passenger.&lt;ref name="JohnsonPassenger"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Alex |title=Ohio teens charged with murder after sandbag thrown from bridge hits car, kills passenger |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ohio-teens-charged-murder-after-sandbag-thrown-bridge-hits-car-n832756 |accessdate=12 November 2018 |publisher=NBC News |date=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeartyMan"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gearty |first1=Robert |title='Madness': Family outraged that 4 teens sentenced to youth treatment after sandbag hits car, kills man |url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/madness-family-outraged-that-4-teens-sentenced-to-youth-treatment-after-sandbag-hits-car-kills-man |accessdate=27 November 2018 |publisher=Fox News |date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Abd Allah al-Sheikh Muhammad ibn Yahya''' (also known as '''Abu Abdellah al-Shaykh Muhammad ben Yehya''', '''Abu Abdallah Sheikh Muhammad ibn Yahya''' or '''Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Sheikh''') was the first [[Wattasid dynasty|Wattasid]] Sultan of Morocco and King of Fez between 1472 and 1504.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Muzaffar Husain|last1=Syed|first2=Syed Saud|last2=Akhtar|first3=B D|last3=Usmani|title=Concise History of Islam|year=2011|place=New Delhi|publisher=Vij Books|isbn=978-9381411094|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Abu Abd Allah al-Sheikh Muhammad ibn Yahya was born into the powerful Wattasid family that had ruled the eastern [[Rif]] from Tazouta (near present-day [[Nador]]) since the late 13th century. While theoretically subject to the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinid]] sultans, they were largely autonomous. By the start of the 15th Century, the Wattasids had accumulated power while the Merinids were distracted attempting to repel Portuguese and Spanish invasions with the [[Emirate of Granada|Granadans]]. When [[Abd al-Haqq II]] came to power at the age of one in 1421, they held the regency, which they continued to hold when Abd al-Haqq II came of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles-André|last=Julien|title=Histoire de l'Afrique du Nord, des origines à 1830|publisher=Payot|place=Paris|year=1994|isbn=9782228887892|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1459, Abd al-Haqq II ordered the slaughter of the Wattasids, leaving Abu Abd Allah al-Sheikh Muhammad ibn Yahya one of the few of his family left alive.

==Rise to Power==
In the chaos that followed the [[1465 Moroccan revolt]], Abu Abd Allah al-Sheikh Muhammad ibn Yahya fought against the Joutey branch of the [[Idrisid]]s.  In 1471, he defeated their leader, Muhammad ibn Ali Amrani-Joutey, who had declared himself Sultan.  He went on to rule the [[Kingdom of Fez]] which controlled the northern part of Morocco.

==Succession==
He was succeeded by his son Abu Abd Allah al-Burtuqali Muhammad ibn Muhammad.

'''Ghiyath b. Ghawth b. al-Salt b. al-Tariqa al-Taghlibi''', commonly known as '''al-Akhtal''' (The Loquacious), was one of the most famous [[Arab]] poets of the [[Umayyad]] period. He belonged to the [[Banu Taghlib]] tribe, and was, like his fellow-tribesmen, a [[Monophysite Christian|Christian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esat|first=AYYILDIZ|date=2017|title=El-Ahtal'ın Emevilere methiyeleri|url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/26/2238/23239.pdf|journal=Ankara Üniversitesi Dil ve Tarih-Coğrafya Fakültesi Dergisi - DTCF Dergisi|volume=57|issue=2|pages=936–960|doi=10.1501/dtcfder_0000001545|issn=2459-0150}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biography==
al-Akhtal al-Taghlibî was one of the great panegyrists of the Umayyad period. He became famous for his satires and panegyrics in a period when poetry was an important political instrument. al-Akhtal was introduced to [[Yazid I|Yazîd b. Muʿâwiyah]] by [[Ka‘b b. Ju‘ayl]]. He became a close friend of the crown prince. [[Yazid I|Yazîd]], when he succeeded to the throne, was very kind to al-Akhtal. Although he was Christian, he was favoured by leading Umayyad caliphs. All his life al-Akhtal followed the reigning Umayyad Dynasty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esat|first=AYYILDIZ|date=2017|title=El-Ahtal'ın Emevilere methiyeleri|url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/26/2238/23239.pdf|journal=Ankara Üniversitesi Dil ve Tarih-Coğrafya Fakültesi Dergisi - DTCF Dergisi|volume=57|issue=2|pages=936–960|doi=10.1501/dtcfder_0000001545|issn=2459-0150}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

He lauded in his panegyrics Yazîd, [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|ʿAbd al-Malik b. Marwân]] and [[Al-Walid I|al-Walîd b. ʿAbd al-Malik]] and in his satires attacked all opponents of the caliphs. al-Akhtal became official poet to the caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|‘Abd al-Malik]], to whom he dedicated a number of panegyrics. But he fell into disfavour under [[Al-Walid I|Walîd I]]. The pre-Islamic bedouin tradition is always apparent in the poems of al-Akhtal and his panegyrics show the continued vitality of this tradition. The panegyrics of al-Akhtal acquired a classical status. His poetry was accepted by critics as source of pure Arabic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esat|first=AYYILDIZ|date=2017|title=El-Ahtal'ın Emevilere methiyeleri|url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/26/2238/23239.pdf|journal=Ankara Üniversitesi Dil ve Tarih-Coğrafya Fakültesi Dergisi - DTCF Dergisi|volume=57|issue=2|pages=936–960|doi=10.1501/dtcfder_0000001545|issn=2459-0150}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Of al-Akhtal's private life few details are known, save that he was married and divorced, and that he spent part of his time in [[Damascus]], part with his tribe in Mesopotamia. In the [[Qays–Yaman rivalry#Ayyam raids|Taghlib–Qays war]] he participated on the battlefield, as well as by his [[satire]]s.{{sfn|Thatcher|1911}} In the literary strife between his contemporaries [[Jarir ibn Atiyah]] and [[Farazdaq]], Akhtal was induced to support the latter poet. Al-Akhtal, Jarir and Farazdaq form a trio celebrated among the Arabs, but as to superiority there is dispute. [[Abu Ubaidah (scholar)|Abu ʿUbaidah]] placed him highest of the three on the ground that among his [[poem]]s there were ten flawless [[qasida]]s, and ten more nearly so, and that this could not be said of the other two.{{sfn|Thatcher|1911}}

==Works==
''The Poetry of al-Akhtal'' has been published at the Jesuit press in Beirūt, 1891. A full account of the poet and his times is given in H. Lammens’ ''Le chantre des Omiades'' (Paris, 1895) (a reprint from the ''Journal Asiatique'' for 1894).{{sfn|Thatcher|1911}}

'''Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps''' (March 3, 1803{{snd}}August 22, 1860) was a French painter noted for his Orientalist works.

==Life==
Decamps was born in Paris. In his youth he travelled in the East, and reproduced Oriental life and scenery with a bold fidelity to nature that puzzled conventional critics. His powers, however, soon came to be recognized, and he was ranked along with [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Ingres]] as one of the leaders of the French school. At the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris Exhibition of 1855]] he received the grand or council medal. Most of his life was passed in the neighborhood of Paris. He was fond of animals, especially dogs, and indulged in all kinds of field sports.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Decamps, Alexandre Gabriel |volume=7 |page=909}} Endnote:
*[[Adolphe Moreau]], ''Decamps et son oeuvre'' (Paris, 1869)&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1860 in consequence of being thrown from a horse while hunting at [[Fontainebleau]].

==Founding father of Orientalism==
Decamps was the founding father of Orientalism since he revealed everyday Oriental life in the 1831 Salon in Paris. His subjects and style with strong contrast of light and thick material became the reference for painters but also photographers and writers.
He was the most influential painter on Orientalism and was proclaimed the chief of the new Orientalist School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garnier|first1=Nicole|title=Delacroix et l'aube de l'orientalisme, de Decamps à Fromentin|date=2012|publisher=Somogy Editions d'art - Domaine de Chantilly|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-7572-0609-6|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delacroix referred to him in the ''Women of Algiers'' (1834),  and the ''Fanatics of Tangiers'' (1838). Théophile Gautier’s ''Constantinople'' (1853) was described as an “immense verbal Decamps” by Henry James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Henry|title=French Poets and Novelists|date=1878|publisher=Macmillan and Co|location=London|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxime Du Camp named him the Christopher Columbus of the Orient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Du Camp|first1=Maxime|title=Les Beaux-Arts à l'Exposition universelle de 1855|date=1855|publisher=Librairie nouvelle|location=Paris|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Théophile Gautier compared his role as the discoverer of the Orient to the role of Jean-Jacques Rousseau as the discoverer of nature in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gautier|first1=Théophile|title=Les Beaux-Arts en Europe|date=1855|publisher=Michel Lévy frères|location=Paris |page=193 of 217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christine Peltre concludes that the only equivalent to his fame were the ''Arabian Nights'' (''One Thousand and One Nights'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peltre |first1=Christine |title=L'Atelier du voyage |date=1995 |publisher=Le Promeneur |location=Paris |page=89; 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Decamps' style was characteristically and intensely French. It was marked by vivid dramatic conception, bold and even rough brushstrokes, and startling contrasts of color and of light and shade. His subjects embraced an unusually wide range. He availed himself of his travels in the East in dealing with scenes from [[Biblical canon|Scripture history]], which he was probably the first of European painters to represent with their true and natural local background. Of this class were his ''Joseph sold by his Brethren'', ''Moses taken from the Nile'', and his scenes from the life of [[Samson]], nine vigorous sketches in charcoal and white.
[[File:La pattuglia turca.jpg|left|thumb|A version of ''The Turkish Patrol'' (1831)]]
Perhaps the most impressive of his historical pictures is ''Defeat of the Cimbri'', representing the conflict between a horde of barbarians and a disciplined army. Decamps produced a number of genre pictures, chiefly scenes from French and Turkish domestic life, the most marked feature of which is humour. The same characteristic attaches to many of his numerous animal paintings; Decamps was especially fond of painting monkeys. His well-known painting ''The Monkey Connoisseurs'' satirizes the jury of the [[French Academy of Painting]], which had rejected several of his earlier works on account of their divergence from any known standard.

His paintings and drawings were first made familiar to the English public through the lithographs of [[Eugene le Rouit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60256">'''Alonzo Potter''' (6 July 1800 – 4 July 1865) was an American [[bishop]] of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]] who served as the third bishop of the [[Diocese of Pennsylvania]]. Potter "identified himself with all the best interests of society."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=374}}
[[File:Episopal Bishop Alonzo Potter.jpg|thumb|{{Center|&lt;big&gt;Bishop Alonzo Potter&lt;/big&gt;}}]]

==Early life==
Alonzo Potter was born on July 6, 1800, in [[Beekman, New York]]. He was the sixth child of Anna and Joseph Potter, who was a farmer. His ancestors emigrated from England to [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]], in the mid-sixteenth century. There have been in the Potter family two brothers who were bishops in the Episcopal Church: Alonzo Potter was bishop of the Diocese of Pennsylvania and his younger brother [[Horatio Potter]] was bishop of the [[Episcopal Diocese of New York]].{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=6}}{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=15}} 

==Education==
The child Alonzo first attended the district school in his hometown. Although he was a "bright" student, he did not care for reading until he read [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBcUAAAAQAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s  ''The Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe''.] Potter was so taken with the story that he could not put it down except for eating and sleeping. He later said that from then on, "I took pleasure in books."{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=16-17}}

When Potter was twelve years old, he entered an academy in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]].  Within three years, his teacher said that, "by capacity and scholarship," Potter was ready for college.{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=17}} At age fifteen,  Potter passed the entrance examination and enrolled in [[Union College]] in Schenectady, New York.  In 1818, at age eighteen, he graduated with honors, and he "won the prize of college ambition." At his [[graduation]], he gave the [[Valedictorian#Valedictory address|Valedictory Oration]].{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=7}}{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=17}}

After graduating from Union College, Potter moved to Philadelphia to be with his brother, who was a bookseller. During this time, his interest in books continued. He also became interested in the Episcopal Church.{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|p=18}}

==Religious convictions==
During his time in Philadelphia with his brother, Potter's "religious convictions became so decided" that he joined the Episcopal Church. He had not been baptized, so he requested and received it in [[St. Peter's Episcopal Church, Society Hill, Philadelphia|St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia]]. Later, In [[Christ Church, Philadelphia]], he was [[Confirmation|confirmed]] by [[William White (bishop of Pennsylvania)|Bishop White]]. Shortly after that, Potter decided that he wanted to be ordained in the Episcopal Church. He began theological studies under the direction of the Rev. Dr. Samuel H. Turner, afterward for many years a distinguished Professor in the General Theological Seminary. He continued studying theology after he returned to Union College as a Tutor.{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=18}}{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=7-8}}

While still in Philadelphia before he returned to Union College, he gave instruction to "colored persons."  This action foreshadowed his later concern as a bishop for "equal rights and opportunities in Church and State to all sorts and conditions of men."{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=21-22}}

==Union College: 1821–1826==
In 1821, after his time with his brother in Philadelphia, Potter returned to Union College as a Tutor and soon became "Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy."{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|p=18}}
[[File:Union1804.jpg|thumb|{{Center|&lt;big&gt;Union College, 1804 &lt;/big&gt;}}]]

While he was teaching at Union College, Potter was ordained Deacon in 1822 by Bishop [[John Henry Hobart]]. When he was twenty-four years old, he was ordained Priest in 1824 by Bishop [[Thomas Church Brownell]]. Shortly after he was ordained, Potter gathered "a little congregation of blacks in Schenectady" and became their minister.{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=19-21}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89077000669;view=2up;seq=8  S. F. Hotchkin, ''The First Six Bishops of Pennsylvania'' (Diocese of Pennsylvania Church House, 1911), 22-28.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, Potter published his first book. It was ''A Tractate on Logarithms'', by which he came known "as a proficient mathematician."{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=18-19}}

In 1825, [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] offered the twenty-five-year-old Potter its presidency. However, he declined the offer.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=10}}

==Marriages and family==
Potter married three times: first to Sarah Maria Nott, next to her first cousin, Sarah Benedict, and last to Frances Seton.{{sfn|Potter|1923|p=11}}

'''Sarah Maria Nott Potter'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Mrs. Alonzo Potter (Sarah Maria Nott).jpg|thumb|115x115px|{{Center|&lt;small&gt;Mrs. Alonzo Potter&lt;br/&gt;(Sarah Maria Nott)&lt;/small&gt;}}]]
In 1824, Potter married Sarah Maria Nott. She was the only daughter of [[Eliphalet Nott]], President of [[Union College]].{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=8}} On March 16, 1839, Sarah Nott Potter died about four hours after giving birth to her seventh child and only daughter. Potter described his wife's many virtues: "she gave herself, seemingly without a pang, to her household, to her friends, and to anyone whom she could make more happy." She was "a centre of delight to all who knew her."{{sfn|Hodges|1915|p=13}}&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bourgeois, ''All Things Human: Henry Codman Potter and the Social Gospel in the Episcopal Church'' (University of Illinois Press, 2010), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=89-90}} 

'''Sarah Benedict Potter'''&lt;br/&gt;
According to his wife's request, the children were placed under the care of her cousin Sarah Benedict. Alonzo married Miss Benedict in 1840. She was thirty-one years old. They had three boys.{{sfn|Hodges|1915|pp=13-14}}&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bourgeois, ''All Things Human: Henry Codman Potter and the Social Gospel in the Episcopal Church'' (University of Illinois Press, 2010), 7. and [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MX5T-9QQ "Sarah Potter United States Census, 1860."]&lt;/ref&gt; Before her death Sarah Benedict Potter suffered from [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], which made her "too ill to do active work."{{sfn|Potter|1923|p=11}}

'''Frances Seton'''&lt;br/&gt;
In 1865, Potter married his third wife Miss Frances Seton. They were married only three months before he died on July 4, 1865.{{sfn|Potter|1923|p=12}} She died on October 27, 1909 in Flushing, Long Island, N. Y.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=68935162 Rev Alonzo Potter.]&lt;/ref&gt; Her will bequeathed $10,700 to charitable and religious bodies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', Brooklyn, New York.

===Children===

Potter," pages 1-4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==St. Paul’s, Boston: 1826–1831==
In 1826, Potter accepted a call as rector of [http://www.stpaulboston.org/ St. Paul's Church, Boston, Massachusetts] and was instituted on August 29, 1826. He succeeded Dr. [http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/jarvis-samuel-farmar Samuel Farmar Jarvis], who, leaving the parish in 1827, left it without a rector. At the time, there was no rectorship in the Episcopal Church "more important or more difficult to fill." St. Paul's had been founded in 1820, but it did not attract a sufficient congregation, so the bishop and his presbyters vacated the rectorship. The parish was "left prostrated, depleted and in debt."{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=24-15}}{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=10}}

Under Potter's ministry, "a large parish was formed." His ministry includes sermons, lectures, and pastoral visits. Potter's sermons were "always Gospel truths" and "illustrated plainly."  He gave weekly "evangelical lectures" on Tuesday evenings. Pastoral visits were the third factor in Potter's success. He spent all day Monday and Tuesday mornings making "general visits" to parishioners. The visits included Scripture reading and prayer. He made "visits to the sick and dying" as needed.{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=27-30}}

On May 12, 1829, Potter preached a sermon on "behalf of missions" before the Board of Directors of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Episcopal Church.&lt;ref&gt;''An Appeal in Behalf of Missions: Addressed to Episcopalians. A Sermon Preached before the Board of Directors of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, in St. James' Church, Philadelphia, on Tuesday, May 12, 1829'' ®. P. &amp; C. Williams, 1829).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spirit of the Pilgrims'', which was a short-lived (1828-1833) religious magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congregationallibrary.org/sites/all/files/SpiritofPilgrims0162.pdf  "Spirit of Pilgrims-Magazine."]&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the sermon with these words: "We have seldom read a more earnest and touching appeal on the subject of missions, particularly foreign missions, than this sermon presents. . . . His discourse, wherever circulated, cannot fail of doing good."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mc9DAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA462&amp;lpg=PA462&amp;dq=%22An+appeal+in+behalf+of+missions:+addressed+to+Episcopalians.+A+sermon+preached+before+the+Board+of+Directors+of+the+Domestic+and+Foreign+Missionary+Society+of+the+Protestant+Episcopal+Church+in+the+United+States+of+America,+in+St.+James%27+Church,+Philadelphia,+on+Tuesday,+May+12,+1829.+.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZD3vaMdfzt&amp;sig=_RR-FbA2GmeYEnZiacz7O6rfBVk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiti4m384rSAhXhhFQKHRfzBHAQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22An%20appeal%20in%20behalf%20of%20missions%3A%20addressed%20to%20Episcopalians.%20A%20sermon%20preached%20before%20the%20Board%20of%20Directors%20of%20the%20Domestic%20and%20Foreign%20Missionary%20Society%20of%20the%20Protestant%20Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America%2C%20in%20St.%20James'%20Church%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20on%20Tuesday%2C%20May%2012%2C%201829.%20.%22&amp;f=false  ''The Spirit of the Pilgrims, Volume 2'', August 1829 (Peirce and Williams), 462-462.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter's work became too much for him. He began to suffer from a "partial loss of voice" and "impaired health," so, in 1831, he resigned and went back to Union College to teach. His five years in Boston had been "a marked success." Potter came to a parish marked by dissension and debt and it marked by "unity, quietness, strength and prosperity."{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=33, 46}}{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=11}}

==Union College: 1831–1845==
In 1831, Potter returned to Union College as professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy. Also, on demand, he taught "Greek and Latin, algebra and geometry, logic and rhetoric, technology and trigonometry."{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|p=18}} In 1838, he was elected vice-president of the college and served in that capacity until be became a bishop in 1845. While at the college and later as bishop, Potter was nationally known "as a leader in education."&lt;ref name="EB1911Cite"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Potter, Alonzo|volume=22|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=13-16}}

While at Union College, Potter declined three offers. In November 1835, he declined the Professorship of Ecclesiastical History in the [[General Theological Seminary]].{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=61}} Also in 1835, Potter declined a call to [[Grace Church (Boston)|Grace Church, Boston]].{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=62}} In 1838, he declined election as bishop coadjutor of the Diocese of Massachusetts.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=14-16}} Although Potter's health had improved, it was, "especially in his vocal powers, far from satisfactory."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=85}}

==Bishop of Diocese of Pennsylvania: 1845–1865==
In 1845, Bishop [[Henry Ustick Onderdonk]] resigned his office as bishop of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania]] because of  "widespread dissatisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ANcCAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=Onderdonk#v=onepage&amp;q=Onderdonk&amp;f=false  Hermon Griswold Batterson, ''A Sketch-book of the American Episcopate'' (Lippincott, 1878), 95.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the diocese was divided between [[Tractarians]] and those who wanted a more [[Protestant]] Episcopal Church.{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=104}}

[[File:Christ Church Philadelphia 1876.jpg|thumb|{{Center|&lt;big&gt;Christ Church, Philadelphia&lt;/big&gt;}}]]
The Diocesan Convention met in May 1845 to elect a bishop. After four days, no nominee had been elected by both orders. Then, on May 23, 1845, Potter was nominated. On the first ballot, he was elected by the clergy. The laity gave Potter their unanimous vote. On June 4, 1845, Potter wrote his "formal letter of acceptance." He was consecrated September 23, 1845 in Christ Church, Philadelphia. Bishop [[John Henry Hopkins]] of Vermont was the preacher.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=16-17}}{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=106, 111, 123}}

On September 24, 1845, the day after his consecration, Potter  consecrated a new church. Five days later, he began making visitations to the part of his Diocese farthest from Philadelphia. By May 1846, Potter "had visited every parish in his Diocese but two."{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=22}}

===Lowell Lectures in Boston===
Potter had already committed himself to deliver the [[Lowell Institute|Lowell Lectures]] in Boston. The Diocese of Pennsylvania allowed him to take time off from his episcopal duties to prepare for the lectures and deliver them. In 1847, 1848, 1849 and 1853 Potter delivered five courses of lectures on "Natural Theology and Christian Evidences." When he delivered the lectures, the [[Federal Street Theatre]], the largest auditorium in Boston, was packed. He delivered the lectures without a manuscript. At most, he used a small piece of paper outlining his arguments. The lectures showed Potter's "intellectual power" and his "compass of knowledge."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=121}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AmYAAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge: Embracing Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology and Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Biography from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'', Volume 9 (Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1911), s. v. POTTER, ALONZO, page 144.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===
Besides preparing and delivering Lowell Lectures in Boston, Potter began working on philanthropic projects, which he believed the Episcopal Church should undertake, within a year after his consecration. 

''The Academy.'' In the winter of 1846, Potter, in co-operation with the Trustees, reopened the [http://www.episcopalacademy.org/about-ea/history Academy of the Protestant Episcopal Church], located in Philadelphia, in the spring of 1846. The Academy attracted so many students that a new building was opened in September 1850 to accommodate one hundred and fifty youths.{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=136-137}}

''Convocation System.'' In 1846, Potter began the Convocation system. He saw this as a better "means of promoting ministerial unity" and of "cultivating missionary work" than could be done with the existing "large districts." They worked out as he had hoped.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=23-24}}

''Young Man’s Institute.'' When Potter moved to Philadelphia, he was shocked by the many lawless and violent young men, drinking and fighting in the streets at night. They had jobs, but they were illiterate and had no other activities available. Therefore, in 1849 and 1850, he began work which led to the formation of the [http://discover.hsp.org/Record/ead-4052/Description#tabnav Young Man’s Institute]. The Institute provided night-schools with libraries and reading rooms for young men more than sixteen years of age.{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=162-165}}

''Clergy Daughters’ Fund.'' In his address to the Diocesan Convention of 1849, Potter announced the establishment of the [http://www.diopa.org/clergy-daughters/ Clergy Daughters’ Fund]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The purpose of the Fund was "to provide free scholarships at different schools for the daughters of such Pastors as receive small salaries and live where good schools are not yet established."{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=170-171}}

''Church Hospital.'' [https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=75054329 Dr. Caspar Morris], a Philadelphia physician had appealed for a hospital. Potter responded to the appeal and began work to establish "the Hospital of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia." In 1850, "a comfortable house and grounds" were donated and "the Hospital began its work."{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=24}}

The Hospital was opened on December 11, 1852. However, the house was too small and inadequate in plan for a Hospital. Money was raised for a new building and a cornerstone was laid by Potter on May 24, 1860. Enough of the Hospital had been completed by 1862 that it could be used to treat Union soldiers wounded in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Hospital of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia'' (J.B. Lippincott, 1869),12. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Training Candidates for Holy Orders.'' In Potter's first address to his Diocesan Convention in 1846, he spoke about the need for of a Diocesan Training School to instruct Candidates for Holy Orders in the City of Philadelphia who were not able to attend the Episcopal Church's regular Seminaries. In his 1857 address Potter reported that in the last year sixteen Candidates and Deacons in Philadelphia had been instructed by him and a few of the Clergy. To more adequately meet the need for training Candidates for Holy Orders, Potter founded the [[Philadelphia Divinity School]] in 1861.{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=172, 178-179}}

'''First allusion to impaired health'''&lt;br/&gt;
In his address to the 1855 Diocesan Convention, Potter, for the first time spoke about his "impaired health" and that "he might need relief." For now, he said that he might reduce his activities outside the Church "to the extent, which his reduced physical ability might indicate to be proper."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=301}}

===Ten years as bishop: 1855===
During the 1855 Diocesan Convention, Potter "reviewed the labors and results of the ten years since his election to the Episcopate." First he reviewed his official acts. They included officiating "in public on two thousand two hundred and eighty-four occasions" and preaching "seventeen hundred sermons." Then, regarding the diocese as a whole, Potter reported that fifty-four churches had been built. The number of Clergymen had increased from121 to 167. The number of Parishes had grown from 100 to 156. Communicant strength had increased from 8,865 to 12,600. Sunday-school pupils had increased from 9,305 to 15,004.{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=301-303}}

'''Winter of 1855–56 in Florida'''&lt;br/&gt;
As with Potter, Mrs. Potter's health was declining. They spent the winter of 1855–56 in Florida with the hope that the mild weather would help restore their health. From Florida, Potter wrote a letter to his son [[Henry C. Potter|Henry]], who was a student at the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]]. He said,  "I hope my winter will not be lost. . . . I seem to have so much work and so short a time to live that I can poorly afford so long a vacation. It will not be lost, however, if I can renew my labors with recruited powers."{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=304-306}}

Potter reported on the state of his health at the Diocesan Convention of 1856. He was not  "sanguine in respect to the future," but he assured the Convention that he would perform his "proper discharge of duty." For the future, he said that he would "not feel authorized to apply for an Assistant unless in my own judgment and that of my medical advisers such a measure is urgently required." In the mean time, he suggested that "the whole subject" of his health be put to rest.{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=304}}

===Illness and trip to Europe: 1858===

On February 10, 1858, Potter was ordaining a deacon in Christ Church, Greensburg, where his son Henry was rector. During the service, Potter faltered "once or twice" and "slightly stumbled." After the service, he went to his son's house and laid down. At dinner, "he became very ill" and "staggered"  with his son's assistance, to his room. In a week, he had improved enough ("though still feeble") to return to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=29}}

After this attack, at the urging of "his friends and the Diocese," Potter left for Europe on April 30, 1858 to recuperate to recuperate. He spent most of the time in England at [[Great Malvern]], a healing resort. However, his stay there did not "give him strength." He also spent time at a "resort for invalids in the South of France." After his attempt to recuperate in Europe, Potter returned with a "faded look and shrunken form."{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=30-31, 33}}

During Potter's time in Europe, [[Samuel Bowman]] was elected as his assistant bishop. However, Bishop Bowman died of a heart attack in less than three years. In October 18, 1861, the Convention elected [[William Bacon Stevens]] as the assistant bishop.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=33-34, 35}}

===Race relations===
Potter's care for blacks "had been manifested in his boyhood, at his brother’s house in Philadelphia, and again in his ministry to the colored people while a Professor at Schenectady."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=234}}

In 1845, the first year of Potter's episcopate, he supported the efforts of some Episcopal laymen to provide for the "spiritual good" for the "colored population of Philadelphia" that lived in neighborhoods "festering with filth and corruption."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=231}} In 1846, the [http://www.crucifixionphiladelphia.org Church of the Crucifixion] was founded. It was an integrated church with black and white worshiping together. The Church of the Crucifixion had the distinction of being "admitted into communion with the Diocese at one convention and thrown out at the next."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crucifixionphiladelphia.org/#/history Church of the Crucifixion: History.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the church was admitted into union with the Diocesan Convention, its representatives were white and nothing was said about its being mostly "composed of people of African descent." When that became known, at the next Convention the representatives were not admitted and the issue was debated "for several successive Conventions." When "the issue was finally to be decided," Potter, believing "that truth and justice were . . . compromised," spoke to a Convention, as the presiding officer in his episcopal "gown of office." With honesty and passion, he spoke against the "prejudice and injustice" that denied the Church of the Crucifixion admission to the Convention. When Potter put the question for a vote, called his name first rather than last so that it could be known by the convention.{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=59-60}}

===Muhlenberg Memorial===
In 1853, at the Episcopal Church's General Convention, the Rev. [[William Augustus Muhlenberg]] and others presented what came to be called [https://web.archive.org/web/20150909091025/http://bishop.jmstanton.com/smu/pdf_files/Muhlenberg_Memorial_linenum.pdf "The February 16, 2017Muhlenberg Memorial."] The Memorial "upheld the traditional catholic teaching of the Episcopal Church concerning the Creeds, the Eucharist, and episcopal ordination." At the same time, it asked for "as much freedom in opinion, discipline, and worship as is compatible with the essential faith and order of the Gospel." The Memorial urged two specific things: 1. Episcopal bishops should ordain Protestant clergy "who could accept the basic teachings of the Episcopal Church" and 2. The Episcopal Church should relax "somewhat the rigidity of her Liturgical services."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/muhlenberg-memorial "Muhlenberg Memorial."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter was "the chief defender" of the Memorial. This placed him "on the side of liberty and church expansiveness."{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|p=101}} In his essay on "Church Comprehension and Church Unity," published soon after in the 1857 volume of [https://books.google.com/books?id=LEcOAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Memorial Papers''], Potter wrote: "Our Church recognizes the cardinal fact that large diversities of opinion are compatible with loyalty to a common Saviour . . . . Advances toward the restoration of Christian unity can be made more gracefully by no Church than by ours."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LEcOAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Memorial Papers'' (E. H. Butler &amp; Co., 1857), 108-110.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church unity===
Church unity was one of the issues which Potter addressed.{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|p=95}}

'''Within the Episcopal Church'''&lt;br/&gt;
Potter was "opposed to party prejudices." He warned his son [[Henry C. Potter| Henry]] "against excessive views or censorious judgments of those with whom he could not agree."  Potter believed the Episcopal Church should embrace both [[high church]] and [[low church]] members.{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|p=21}} Alonzo Potter's son Eliphalet Nott Potter wrote about his father's not belonging to any Church party: "He did not believe in the necessity of partisan action within the Church," and "he did not claim to belong to any Church party as such."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archive.org/stream/religiousphiloso00pott?ref=ol#page/n5/mode/2up ''Religious Philosophy or Nature, Man, and the Bible Witnessing to God and to Religious Truth'' (J. B. Lippencott, 1872), xii-xiii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter of June 7, 1845, Potter wrote that God was preparing to fill the church "not only with unity, but also with purity."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=109}} The next year, in May 1846, after becoming a bishop, Potter said in his first address to the Diocesan Convention that a bishop should live "for the promotion of a spirit of unity and peace in the household of faith."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=141}} The Episcopal Church's General Convention of October 1853, established a Commission on Church Unity. Potter was an active member.{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=244}}

In Potter's 1857 essay on [https://books.google.com/books?id=LEcOAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "Church Comprehension and Church Unity,"] published  in the volume of ''Memorial Papers'', he wrote that "The theory of our Church recognizes the cardinal fact that large diversities of opinion are compatible with loyalty to a common Saviour."{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=244-245}}

'''Between denominations'''&lt;br/&gt;
Potter believed that the Episcopal Church should lead the way "toward the restoration of Christian unity" because it can be made "more gracefully" by the Episcopal Church than any other.{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=247}} Regarding the [[Roman Catholic Church]], Potter said that a "union with Rome . . . must not be solely through concessions of ours." Rome must also make concessions, by which it would become a reasonable union resulting from "principles common to us both." Potter saw "the process of reunion" as a matter of give and take compromise.{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|pp=102-103}}

===Controversy with Bishop Hopkins over slavery===
Potter was an opponent of slavery and published a reply to the pro-slavery arguments of Bishop [[John Henry Hopkins]] (1792-1868) of Vermont.&lt;ref name="EB1911Attr"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Potter, Alonzo|volume=22|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1861, Hopkins gave several men who had asked for his opinions regarding "the Biblical argument on the subject of Negro slavery in the Southern States."  Hopkins sent them a pamphlet he had written on the [https://archive.org/stream/bibleviewofslave00hopk#page/n5/mode/2up  ''Bible View of Slavery''] in which he argued that "there was a clear ''biblical sanction'' for the practice." The pamphlet and its contents were widely disseminated in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;T Felder Dorn, ''Challenges on the Emmaus Road: Episcopal Bishops Confront Slavery, Civil War, and Emancipation (The University of South Carolina Press, 2013), 286, 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1863, after President [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] Bishop Hopkins authorized the publication of his paper entitled "Bible View of Slavery,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bibleviewofslave00dris John Henry Hopkins, "Bible View of Slavery (C. S. Westcott &amp; Co., 1863).]&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper, Hopkins argued that "there was a clear ''biblical sanction'' for slavery that it "should be gradually abolished with respect for the rights of southern states, but that abolition had no biblical or theological warrant."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bourgeois, ''All Things Human: Henry Codman Potter and the Social Gospel in the Episcopal Church'' (University of Illinois Press, 2010), 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter and some two hundred of his clergy issued a response, wherein they said,&lt;ref&gt; [http://credo.library.umass.edu/view/pageturn/murb003-i049/#page/2/mode/2up John Rogers Bolles, ''A Reply to Bishop Hopkins’ View of Slavery and a Review of the Times'' (1865), 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This attempt not only to apologize for Slavery in the abstract, but to advocate it as it exists in the cotton States, and in the States which sell men and women in the open market as their staple product, is, in their judgment, unworthy of any servant of Jesus Christ, as an effort to sustain, on Bible principles, the States in rebellion against the Government, in the wicked attempt to establish, by force of arms, a tyranny under the name of a Republic, whose corner-stone shall be the perpetual bondage of the African, it challenges their indignant reprobation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1864, Hopkins published a response  to ''A Scriptural, Ecclesiastical, and Historical View of Slavery: From the Days of the Patriarch Abraham, to the Nineteenth Century. Addressed to the Right Rev. Alonzo Potter''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=S1ZEtrmbPRwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A Scriptural, Ecclesiastical, and Historical View of Slavery: From the Days of the Patriarch Abraham, to the Nineteenth Century. Addressed to the Right Rev. Alonzo Potter'' (W. I. Pooley &amp; Company, 1864).]&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Bishop Hopkins said to Potter, "I am sorry to be obliged to charge you, not only with a gross insult against your senior, but with the more serious offense of a false accusation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=S1ZEtrmbPRwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A Scriptural, Ecclesiastical, and Historical View of Slavery: From the Days of the Patriarch Abraham, to the Nineteenth Century. Addressed to the Right Rev. Alonzo Potter'' (W. I. Pooley &amp; Company, 1864), 44.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter not only opposed Hopkins’ defense of slavery, he was also worried about "the danger of clerical demagoguery." Therefore, he wrote to the diocesan clergy "urging them to remember that as Ministers of the Prince of Peace" and that "it is our duty as far as possible to avoid all unseemly exhibitions of feeling and to bear with serene patience any seeming provocation that may be presented."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bourgeois, ''All Things Human: Henry Codman Potter and the Social Gospel in the Episcopal Church'' (University of Illinois Press, 2010), 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potter by characteristics==
William Bacon Stevens, who succeeded Potter as bishop of the Diocese of Pennsylvania, delivered ''A Discourse'' about Potter to the 1865 General Convention of the Episcopal Church in which spoke about Potter's "several characteristics and labours," namely, an educationist, a parochial minister, a legislator in the Church, a philosopher, a philanthropist, a patriot, and a bishop.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=46}}

'''Potter as an educator'''&lt;br/&gt;
Potter was a leader in all the educational movements of his time.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=49}} He worked "to perfect and extend the benefits of popular education."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=73}}

Potter was active in the formation of the American Association for the Advancement of Education, which was a forerunner of the modern [[National Education Association#History|National Education Association]]. He participated in the first meetings in 1849 and 1850. At the second meeting, Potter was appointed as chairman of a committee to write a constitution for the Association. He presided over the 1851 and 1820 meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r5E6AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Alonzo+Potter+To+the+friends+of+education.&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''National Education Association of the United States: Fiftieth Anniversary Volume: 1857-1906'' (National Education Association of the United, 1907), 472.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, Potter wrote the first part of [https://archive.org/stream/theschoolschoolm00pottiala#page/n7/mode/2up ''The School and the Schoolmaster''] with the title of  "The School; its Objects, Relations, and Uses."  Thirteen thousand copies were distributed in New York state and five thousand copies in Massachusetts. Also, thousands of copies were distributed in the other states.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=47}}

'''Potter as a parochial minister'''&lt;br/&gt;
Potter served as a parochial minister only during the five years he was the Rector of St. Paul's from 1826 to 1831. However, his "effective work" demonstrated his capability as a parochial minister. When Potter arrived, St. Paul's was "almost like a dismantled and half water-logged ship ready to sink." By his ministry, the parish was "righted and refitted." {{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=49}}

'''Potter as a legislator in the Church'''&lt;br/&gt;
As a Legislator in the Church, Potter was viewed "as wise and progressive." In the Massachusetts and New York Diocesan Conventions, he took "a prominent part" and his views were respected.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=50-51}}

As a member of the House of Bishops, Potter influenced its legislation in "beneficial" ways.legislation.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=51}} In 1835, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150909091025/http://bishop.jmstanton.com/smu/pdf_files/Muhlenberg_Memorial_linenum.pdf Muhlenberg Memorial] urged the House of Bishops to relax "somewhat the rigidity of her Liturgical services."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.episcopalchurch.org/109399_14836_ENG_HTM.htm "Muhlenberg Memorial."]&lt;/ref&gt;
Potter was "the most able and influential champion" of the Memorial.{{sfn|Hodges|1915|p=36}} In this he took a position "on the side of liberty and church expansiveness."{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=52}}

'''Potter as a philosopher'''&lt;br/&gt;
Potter studied and mastered "the theory, history, definitions and criticism of the great schools of philosophy."  His  [[Lowell Institute|Lowell Lectures]] in Boston demonstrate that Potter was "a Christian philosopher of the highest order."{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=55-57}}

'''Potter as a philanthropist'''&lt;br/&gt;
As a Philanthropist, Potter was "a benefactor of humankind."&lt;ref&gt;"Philanthropist: a benefactor of humankind; one who behaves benevolently towards others". ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Online (Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Potter's ministry, the [[Temperance movement|temperance]] problem was one of the issues he addressed.{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|p=95}} By his refusal to drink or serve alcoholic drinks and by his lectures and writings, Potter worked "to overcome the far-spreading evils of intemperance."{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=59}} In 1852, Potter gave an address in Pittsburgh on [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Drinking_Usages_of_Society.html?id=8NcXAAAAYAAJ  ''Drinking Usages of Society''] which became a national temperance influence in pamphlet form." Alonzo told "those earlier Pittsburghers, "Our simple duty is to prevent drunkenness"; or when he declares, "To arrest an evil effectually we must know its nature and its cause." In his preface to a volume of ''Discourses'' published in 1851, he claims that his general purpose is to deal with "topics connected with the interests of the clerical profession, i.e., the extension of the Christian church and the welfare of society."{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|p=100}}

Potter was actively involved in "the relief of the sick, the poor, the infirm." He held office in the [[Pennsylvania School for the Deaf|Institution for the Deaf and Dumb]], in the [[New York House of Refuge]], and in the [http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/twiki/pub/AmLegalHist/AndersPauleyWikiProject/First_Annual_Report_of_the_Boston_Prison_Discipline_Socy_(1826).pdf Prison Discipline Society]. He served as President of the [http://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Episcopal_Hospital Hospital of the Protestant Episcopal Church] and of the Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children. Potter was so active in philanthropic agencies because he believed that the Church should create and administer them.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=59-60}}

In Potter's ministry, "the Negro question" was one of the issues he dealt with.{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|p=95}} Right after graduating from Union College, Potter gave instruction to "colored persons" in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=21-22}} As a bishop, he continued his concern for "equal rights and opportunities in Church and State to all sorts and conditions of men," including the "colored race."{{sfn|Howe|1871|pp=21-22}} 

'''Potter as a patriot'''&lt;br/&gt;
On Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 1848, Potter delivered a discourse in which he laid out four teachings from his biblical text about patriotism:
# That nations, as well as individuals, are immediately accountable to God.&lt;br/&gt;
# That they ought to look with increased abhorrence on war and on all its accessories.&lt;br/&gt;
# That they should shun alike law without liberty and liberty without law, and &lt;br/&gt;
# That they should ever beware of a civilization, however refined, which is not enlightened and animated by a healthy national conscience—or in other words, which is not founded on the immovable rock of public and private morality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R2XkEIjC_fAC&amp;dq=Alonzo+Potter+Thanksgiving+discourse+St.+Luke%27s)+Church+1848&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''A Discourse Delivered in St. Luke's Church, Philadelphia: November 23, 1848, Being the Day of Public Thanksgiving'' (King &amp; Baird, 1848), 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter strongly supported the United States government during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89077000669;view=2up;seq=8  S. F. Hotchkin, ''The First Six Bishops of Pennsylvania'' (Diocese of Pennsylvania Church House, 1911), 25.]&lt;/ref&gt; After the war began, Potter's address to the next Diocesan Convention about the situation included these words: "Let us implore in behalf of all who are in civil or military authority the heavenly wisdom and longsuffering which they so much need." After President [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s [[Emancipation Proclamation]], Potter saw the need to provide the Freedmen with food, education, and the Christian religion.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=62-63}}

'''Potter as a bishop'''&lt;br/&gt;
Potter understood his office as a bishop as "guiding the Church, shaping great institutions of charity or learning, moulding the clergy."  For his work as a bishop, he was "honored not only by the Episcopal Church, but by all denominations of Christians."{{sfn|Stevens|1866|p=65}}

Sympathy with his Clergy was of the marks of Potter's Episcopate. In part his sympathy was expressed in "individual expressions of friendship, consolatory, vindicative and admonitory." He also expressed his sympathy by "securing a better provision for the maintenance and comfort of themselves and their families."{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=197}}

==Last voyage, death, and burial: 1865==
On March 30, 1865, Potter left from New York for California as a guest of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. This seemed a good way to regain his health. On the voyage he was active. He held services and preached on the voyage. Along the way, when the ship stopped at major ports, Potter went ashore and engaged in activities such as sightseeing, conducting worship services, and meeting local people. On June 29, 1865, as the ship was nearing San Francisco, Potter became dangerously ill. When the ship arrived in San Francisco on July 1, 1865, Potters was too sick to leave his cabin, The  physician diagnosed the disease as the malignant [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/panama-fever/ Panama Fever]. Potter died in July 4, 1865. His corpse was taken to [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco]], until it could be sent to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Stevens|1866|pp=36-37, 42-44}}

Potter's funeral was in Christ Church, Philadelphia, on September 11, 1865. It was in this church that Potter had been consecrated bishop on September 23, 1845.{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=374}} He was buried in [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]], Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=68935162  Rev Alonzo Potter.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In [http://christchurchschenectady.org/ Christ Church, Schenectady, N.

In his 1871 ''Memoirs'', [[Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe (bishop)|Bishop Howe]] wrote that Potter "had identified himself with all the best interests of society, and good men of every name felt that a beneficent power was withdrawn when Alonzo Potter" died.{{sfn|Howe|1871|p=374}}

The [[Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]] said that Potter was considered one of the best American preachers of his time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AmYAAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge: Embracing Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology and Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Biography from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'', Volume 9 (Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1911), s. v. Preaching,187.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1933 biography of Potter said that as bishop of the Diocese of Pennsylvania, he left "a record of twenty years in that office probably never surpassed."  Except for the Revolutionary hero, [[William White (bishop of Pennsylvania)|Bishop White]], Potter was "the greatest bishop ever ruling in the State of Pennsylvania."{{sfn|Sheerin|1933|pp=20, 186}}

'''Arthur Adam''' was the Chief Telephonist at [[Adolf Hitler]]’s [[Wolf's Lair|Wolfschanze]] HQ at [[East Prussia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hitler Book - The Secret Dossier prpared for Stalin from the Interrogation of Hitler's Personal Aides|last=PARPAROV|first=Fyodor|last2=SALEYEV|first2=Igor|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2005|isbn=9781586483661|location=New York|pages=157; 162; 248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam was a ''Wachtmeister'' [[Master sergeant|(Master Sargeant]]) in the German Army.

== Bomb attempt against Hitler ==
When Colonel Count [[Claus von Stauffenberg|Claus Schenk von Staufenberg]] carried out a [[20 July plot|bomb attempt against Hitler’s life]] on July 20th, 1944, it was first supposed that it had been a time bomb left by the workers of the [[Organisation Todt|Todt Organization]] &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operación Walkiria|last=HERNÁNDEZ|first=Jesus|publisher=Ediciones Nowtilus SL.|year=2008|isbn=9788497636339|location=Madrid|pages=143–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been renovating the bunkers in the period just before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the following hours, von Stauffenberg was not a suspect. Arthur Adam's telephone hall was next to the vestibule where Stauffenberg had left his cap and his belt.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operation Valküre|last=KNIEBE|first=Tobias|publisher=Rowohlt verlag GmbH|year=2009|isbn=9788576654261|location=Berlin|pages=195|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the Chief Telephonist Arthur Adam who saw Stauffenberg running away from the HQ, leaving his belongings behind did not know what to do. He walked about the site of the explosion. It was not his duty to take part in the investigation, however, he wanted to tell the investigators what he saw.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He systematically tried to approach various army officers to report that he saw the suspicious Stauffenberg escapade. However, he was often called to attention and reminded not to raise suspicion against such a highly reputed colonel.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Adam did not give up his detective role and came to see  Hitler’s personal adjutant [[Heinz Linge|Heinz Lienge]] to inform him that Colonel von Stauffenberg came out of the conference room and went straight into a car out of the HQ.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

They end up telling the story to [[Martin Bormann]], Hitler's Secretary and in the practice, the most powerful man in the Nazi Party after Hitler himself.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Adam tells Bormann that he is sure that Stauffenberg must have committed the attempt against the [[Führer|Füher]]'s life, as he saw the colonel  leaving the conference in a hurry without his cap, his valise and his belt.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bormann does not hesitate for a moment and takes Adam directly before Hitler.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When Hitler heard Adam’s testimony, he is supposed to have declared: “''Stauffenberg is the perpetrator of the attack! Arrest him immediately''!”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For identifying Stauffenberg, Adam received a bônus (of 30,000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or 20,000&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Reichsmark|Reichmarks]]) and a (large&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or small&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;) house in Berlin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He is described to be the chief intelligence officer in the Chancellery of the Reich on April 26, 1945.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= Oxford |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17 |quote=In ''The Origin'', Darwin provided an alternative hypothesis for the development, diversification, and design of life.

However, many favoured [[The eclipse of Darwinism|competing explanations]] and it was not until the emergence of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution.&lt;ref name=JvW&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b3847&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=178–179, 338, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the [[life sciences]], explaining the [[biodiversity|diversity of life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html The Complete Works of Darwin Online&amp;nbsp;– Biography.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107165048/http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html |date=7 January 2007 }} ''darwin-online.org.uk''.

It is one of the two or three most significant works of all time—one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world...It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling." {{cite book |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection |editor=Carroll, Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview |location= Peterborough, Ontario|isbn= 1-55111-337-6|page=15 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]]; instead, he helped to investigate [[marine invertebrates]]. Studies at the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]]) encouraged his passion for [[natural science]].&lt;ref name=whowas&gt;{{Harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/WhoWas.html About Charles Darwin]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|five-year voyage]] on {{HMS|Beagle}} established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported [[Charles Lyell]]'s [[uniformitarian]] ideas, and publication of his [[The Voyage of the Beagle|journal of the voyage]] made him famous as a popular author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 210, 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=263–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=184, 187}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|both of their theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beddall | first1 = B.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
{{See also|Charles Darwin's education|Darwin-Wedgwood family}}
Charles Robert Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|The Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Desmond|first=Adrian J.|title=Charles Darwin|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=13 September 2002|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin|access-date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/|title= The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin)|author= John H. Wahlert|date= 11 June 2001|work= Darwin and Darwinism|publisher= [[Baruch College]]|accessdate= 26 November 2008|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/68brqWXRx?url=http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/naturalscience/biology/darwin/|archivedate= 22 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier [[Robert Darwin]] and [[Susannah Darwin]] (''née'' Wedgwood). He was the grandson of two prominent [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]]: [[Erasmus Darwin]] on his father's side, and [[Josiah Wedgwood]] on his mother's side.

[[File:Charles Darwin 1816.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length portrait of seated boy smiling and looking at the viewer. He has straight mid-brown hair, and wears dark clothes with a large frilly white collar. In his lap he holds a pot of flowering plants| Painting of seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816.]]
Both families were largely [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though the Wedgwoods were adopting [[Anglicanism]]. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a [[Freethought#England and France|freethinker]], had baby Charles [[baptism|baptised]] in November 1809 in the Anglican [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]], but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] attending the nearby Anglican [[Shrewsbury School]] as a [[boarding school|boarder]].&lt;ref name=skool&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 12–15}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=21 21–25]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] (at the time the best medical school in the UK) with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned [[taxidermy]] in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from [[John Edmonstone]], a freed black slave who had accompanied [[Charles Waterton]] in the South American [[rainforest]].&lt;ref name=eddy&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=48 47–51]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=18–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Darwin's second year at the university he joined the [[Plinian Society]], a student [[natural history|natural-history]] group featuring lively debates in which [[radicalism (historical)#Popular agitation|radical democratic]] students with [[materialism|materialistic]] views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=31–34}} He assisted [[Robert Edmond Grant]]'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of [[marine invertebrates]] in the [[Firth of Forth]], and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in [[oyster]] shells were the eggs of a skate [[leech]]. One day, Grant praised [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]'s [[Lamarckism|evolutionary ideas]]. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=72–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was rather bored by [[Robert Jameson]]'s natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between [[Neptunism]] and [[Plutonism]]. He learned the [[alpha taxonomy|classification]] of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the [[Royal Museum|University Museum]], one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly sent him to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country [[parson]]. As Darwin was unqualified for the ''[[Tripos]]'', he joined the ''ordinary'' degree course in January 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=47–48, 89–91}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[shooting sports|shooting]] to studying. His cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] introduced him to the popular craze for [[beetle]] collecting; Darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in [[James Francis Stephens]]' ''Illustrations of British entomology''. He became a close friend and follower of botany professor [[John Stevens Henslow]] and met other leading [[parson-naturalist]]s who saw scientific work as religious [[natural theology]], becoming known to these [[University don|dons]] as "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity''&lt;ref name=dar57&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 73–79}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=59 57–67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1794). In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ''ordinary'' degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley's ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' (first published in 1802), which made an [[teleological argument|argument for divine design in nature]], explaining [[adaptation]] as God acting through [[Physical law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He read [[John Herschel]]'s new book, ''Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy'' (1831), which described the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] as understanding such laws through [[inductive reasoning]] based on observation, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal Narrative'' of scientific travels in 1799–1804. Inspired with "a burning zeal" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit [[Tenerife]] with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the [[tropics]]. In preparation, he joined [[Adam Sedgwick]]'s [[geology]] course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping [[strata]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=69 67–68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=128–129, 133–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey voyage on HMS ''Beagle''===
{{details|Second voyage of HMS Beagle}}
[[File:Voyage of the Beagle-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|alt=Route from Plymouth, England, south to Cape Verde then southwest across the Atlantic to Bahia, Brazil, south to Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, the Falkland Islands, round the tip of South America then north to Valparaiso and Callao.

After leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a week with student friends at [[Barmouth]], then returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) [[natural history|naturalist]] for a self-funded [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] place on {{HMS|Beagle}} with captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], emphasising that this was a position for a [[gentleman]] rather than "a mere collector". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-105.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 105&amp;nbsp;– Henslow, J.

After delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS ''Beagle'' [[hydrography|surveyed and charted]] coasts.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name=kix&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=12 ix–xi]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|his journal]] for his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting [[marine invertebrates]], but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal.&lt;ref name=fnGal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|title=Darwin's field notes on the Galapagos: 'A little world within itself'|author=Gordon Chancellor|author2=[[Randal Keynes]]|date=October 2006|publisher=[[Darwin Online]]|accessdate=16 September 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qybOGZ?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with [[plankton]] collected in a calm spell.&lt;ref name=kix /&gt;&lt;ref name=plankton&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1925&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=53 21–22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]] in [[Cape Verde]], Darwin found that a white band high in the [[volcanic rock]] cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', which set out [[uniformitarian]] concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,{{Ref label|B|II|none}} and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=183–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When they reached [[Brazil]], Darwin was delighted by the [[Bahia coastal forests|tropical forest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=73 41–42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but detested the sight of [[slavery]], and disputed this issue with Fitzroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=75 73–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey continued to the south in [[Patagonia]]. They stopped at [[Bahía Blanca]], and in cliffs near [[Punta Alta]] Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct [[mammal]]s beside modern seashells, indicating recent [[extinction]] with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known ''[[Megatherium]]'' by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him to be like a giant version of the armour on local [[armadillo]]s. The finds brought great interest when they reached England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 223–235}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=7 7]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=138 206–209]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On rides with [[gaucho]]s into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and [[anthropology|anthropological]] insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of [[rhea (bird)|rhea]] had separate but overlapping territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 189–192, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as [[raised beach]]es showing a series of elevations. He read Lyell's second volume and accepted its view of "centres of creation" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 131, 159}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=16 174–179]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HurrahChiloe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|title=Darwin Online: 'Hurrah Chiloe': an introduction to the Port Desire Notebook|accessdate=24 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qzBb03?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Fuegians on board had been seized during the [[HMS Beagle#First voyage|first ''Beagle'' voyage]], then during a year in England were educated as missionaries. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at [[Tierra del Fuego]] he met "miserable, degraded savages", as different as wild from domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205–208]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with [[Monogenism|a shared origin]] and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 243–244, 248–250, 382–383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named [[Jemmy Button]] lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=258 226–227]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin experienced [[1835 Concepción earthquake|an earthquake in Chile]] and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including [[mussel]]-beds stranded above high tide. High in the [[Andes]] he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, [[island|oceanic islands]] sank, and [[coral reef]]s round them grew to form [[atoll]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 160–168, 182}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=278 260]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atolls&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=100 p 98–99]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the geologically new [[Galápagos Islands]], Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older "centre of creation", and found [[mockingbird]]s allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island. He heard that slight variations in the shape of [[tortoise]] shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food.&lt;ref name=k356&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=388 356–357]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulloway|1982|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the [[marsupial]] [[Potoridae|rat-kangaroo]] and the [[platypus]] seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work.&lt;ref name=Crows&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|title=Darwin Online: Coccatoos &amp; Crows: An introduction to the Sydney Notebook|accessdate=2 January 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114015611/http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|archivedate=14 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] "good-humoured &amp; pleasant", and noted their depletion by European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=430 398–399].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cape Town]], Darwin and FitzRoy met [[John Herschel]], who had recently written to Lyell praising his [[uniformitarianism]] as opening bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others" as "a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".&lt;ref name=Rascals&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=21 197]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the [[Falkland Islands wolf|Falkland Islands fox]] were correct, "such facts undermine the stability of Species", then cautiously added "would" before "undermine".&lt;ref name=xix&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=22 xix–xx]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that such facts "seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=16 p. 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inception of Darwin's evolutionary theory===
{{details|Inception of Darwin's theory}}

When the ship reached [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], on 2 October 1836, Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles as in December 1835 [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_LettersOnGeology.html editorial introduction]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin visited his home in Shrewsbury and saw relatives, then hurried to [[Cambridge]] to see Henslow, who advised him on finding naturalists available to catalogue the collections and agreed to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded [[gentleman scientist]], and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections. Zoologists had a huge backlog of work, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]] eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist [[Richard Owen]], who had the facilities of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct [[ground sloth]]s as well as the ''[[Megatherium]]'', a near complete skeleton of the unknown ''[[Scelidotherium]]'' and a [[hippopotamus]]-sized [[rodent]]-like skull named ''[[Toxodon]]'' resembling a giant [[capybara]]. The armour fragments were actually from ''[[Glyptodon]]'', a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1840|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=26 16], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=83 73], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=116 106]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206 /&gt; These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 201–205}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=349–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=345–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his first paper, showing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with Lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the [[Geological Society of London]] on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]. The ornithologist [[John Gould]] soon announced that the Galapagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of [[Common blackbird|blackbirds]], "[[Grosbeak|gros-beaks]]" and [[finch]]es, were, in fact, twelve [[Darwin's finches|separate species of finches]]. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 207–210}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of scientists and [[expert]]s such as [[Charles Babbage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-346.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 346&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Darwin stayed with his [[freethought|freethinking]] brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]], part of this [[British Whig Party|Whig]] circle and a close friend of the writer [[Harriet Martineau]], who promoted [[Malthusianism]] underlying the controversial Whig [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law reforms]] to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] implications of [[transmutation of species]], promoted by [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]] and younger surgeons influenced by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy]]. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=201, 212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in [[John Herschel]]'s letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a [[Physical law|natural cause]] of the origin of new species.&lt;ref name=Rascals /&gt;

Gould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos [[mockingbird]]s from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "[[wren]]" was also [[Warbler-finch|in the finch group]]. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=9, 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[rhea (bird)|rheas]] were also distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=360}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1643&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1|title=Darwin, C.

By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his ''Red Notebook'' on the possibility that "one species does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange ''[[Macrauchenia]]'', which resembled a giant [[guanaco]]. His thoughts on lifespan, [[asexual reproduction]] and [[sexual reproduction]] developed in his "B" notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring "to adapt &amp; alter the race to ''changing'' world" explaining the [[Galápagos tortoise]]s, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent, then a [[genealogy|genealogical]] branching of a single [[tree of life (science)|evolutionary tree]], in which "It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another", discarding Lamarck's independent [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]] progressing to higher forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1980|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1583e&amp;pageseq=9 7–10]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=44}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1837|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&amp;pageseq=1 1–13, 26, 36, 74]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=229–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overwork, illness, and marriage===
{{See also|Charles Darwin's health}}
While developing this intensive study of [[transmutation of species|transmutation]], Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his ''Journal'', he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow's help obtained a Treasury grant of [[pound sterling|£]]1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]'', a sum equivalent to about £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|1000|1837|r=-3}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}.{{inflation-fn|UK}} He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=367–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Victorian era]] began, Darwin pressed on with writing his ''Journal'', and in August 1837 began correcting [[Galley proof|printer's proofs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=21 xix]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's health suffered under the pressure. On 20 September he had "an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart", so his doctors urged him to "knock off all work" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury he joined his Wedgwood relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]], nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah]] pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under [[loam]] and suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, inspiring "a new &amp; important theory" on their role in [[pedogenesis|soil formation]], which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–234}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 404&amp;nbsp;– Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838|accessdate=23 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629192234/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|archivedate=29 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Whewell]] pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the grind of writing and editing the ''Beagle'' reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience such as farmers and [[pigeon keeping|pigeon fanciers]].&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244, 426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an [[orangutan]] in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emma Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length portrait of woman aged about 30, with dark hair in centre parting straight on top, then falling in curls on each side. She smiles pleasantly and is wearing an open necked blouse with a large shawl pulled over her arms|Darwin chose to marry his cousin, [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]].]]
The strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe [[boil]]s, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of [[Charles Darwin's illness|Darwin's illness]] remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 252, 476, 531}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=119 115]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June, he took a break and went "geologising" in Scotland. He visited [[Glen Roy]] in glorious weather to see the parallel "roads" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine [[raised beach]]es, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a [[proglacial lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 254}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=377–378}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=86 84]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed ''"Marry"'' and ''"Not Marry"''. Advantages included "constant companion and a friend in old age&amp;nbsp;... better than a dog anyhow", against points such as "less money for books" and "terrible loss of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=238 232–233]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having decided in favour, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit Emma on 29 July. He did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=256–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malthus and natural selection====
Continuing his research in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', and on 28 September 1838 he noted its assertion that human "population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio", a [[geometric progression]] so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. Darwin was well prepared to compare this to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]]'s "warring of the species" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the "final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, &amp; adapt it to changes", so that "One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name="134e"&gt;{{cite web | title = Darwin transmutation notebook D pp. 134e–135e | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | accessdate = 4 June 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120718105154/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | archivedate = 18 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in the formation of new species.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 264–265}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 385–388}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1556&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=39 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he later wrote in his ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|Autobiography]]''''':'''

{{Quote|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work..."&lt;ref name="autobio 120"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=124 120]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By mid December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in [[selective breeding]], and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that "every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 75 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628082830/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |archivedate=28 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking this comparison "a beautiful part of my theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 71|accessdate=17 March 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628080656/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|archivedate=28 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later called his theory [[natural selection]], an analogy with what he termed the [[artificial selection]] of selective breeding.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;

On 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Belief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Belief: historical essay|accessdate=25 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225124103/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/ |archivedate=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you." He found what they called "Macaw Cottage" (because of its gaudy interiors) in [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], then moved his "museum" in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1839|elected a Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).&lt;ref name=frs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FitzRoy's ''Narrative'' was published in May 1839, Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal and Remarks]]'' was such a success as the third volume that later that year it was published on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=39003&amp;pageno=32 p. 32.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to [[Charles Lyell]], who noted that his ally "denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]'' on his theory of [[atoll]] formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first "pencil sketch" of his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=292–293}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1556&amp;pageseq=18 xvi–xvii]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural [[Down House]] in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=118 114]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], writing with melodramatic humour "it is like confessing a murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=7 183–184]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-729.html#back-mark-729.f6|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 729&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Darwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in [[marine invertebrates]], dating back to his student days with [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]], by dissecting and classifying the [[barnacle]]s he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Hooker read the "Essay" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin's opposition to continuing acts of [[creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 320–323, 339–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. [[James Manby Gully|James Gully]]'s [[Great Malvern|Malvern]] spa and was surprised to find some benefit from [[hydrotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1236.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 1236&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

In eight years of work on [[barnacle]]s (Cirripedia), Darwin's theory helped him to find "[[homology (biology)|homologies]]" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some [[genus|genera]] he found minute males [[parasitism|parasitic]] on [[hermaphrodite]]s, showing an [[Androdioecy|intermediate stage]] in evolution of [[Gonochorism|distinct sexes]].&lt;ref name=barlowbio117&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=121 117–118]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, it earned him the [[Royal Society]]'s Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a [[biology|biologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 383–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 he became a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London]], gaining postal access to its library.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2007|pp=107, 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to "diversified places in the economy of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of the theory of natural selection===

By the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and [[seed]]s could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was firmly against the transmutation of species. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a "big book on species" titled ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]'', which was to include his "note on Man". He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; "Theory applied to Races of Man", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ''Natural Selection'', which omitted [[human evolution|human origins]] and [[sexual selection]]. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, "so surrounded with prejudices", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that "I go much further than you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412–441, 457–458, 462–463}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=283–284, 290–292, 295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection. Shocked that he had been "forestalled", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace,&lt;ref&gt;Ball, P. (2011).

His family was in crisis with children in the village dying of [[scarlet fever]], and he put matters in the hands of his friends. After some discussion, Lyell and Hooker decided on a joint presentation at the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] on 1 July of ''[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection]]''. On the evening of 28 June, Darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 466–470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=40–42, 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor [[Samuel Haughton]] of Dublin claimed that "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=126 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his "big book", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends. Lyell arranged to have it published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 374–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 477}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Darwin set out "one long argument" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=477 p 459]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the case for [[common descent]], he included evidence of [[Homology (biology)|homologies]] between humans and other mammals.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2008}}{{Ref label|C|III|none}} Having outlined [[sexual selection]], he hinted that it could explain differences between [[Race (human categorization)|human races]].&lt;ref name=SS_man&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=217&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 199]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | p=199}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|1}} He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=506 488]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | pp=199, 488}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|2}} His theory is simply stated in the introduction:
{{quotation|As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be ''naturally selected''. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20 p 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the end of the book he concluded that:
{{quotation|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=508 p 492]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last word was the only variant of "evolved" in the first five editions of the book. "[[Evolutionism]]" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with [[Prenatal development (biology)|embryological development]], and Darwin first used the word [[evolution]] in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of ''The Origin of Species''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=59}}, {{harvnb|Freeman|1977|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=80&amp;itemID=A1&amp;viewtype=text 79–80]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Reaction to On the Origin of Species}}
The book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|corresponded on it]] with colleagues worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=103–104, 379}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,&lt;ref name="light on man" /&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|3}} but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radick|2013|pp=174–175}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|Kettlewell|1965|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first review asked, "If a monkey has become a man–what may not a man become?" and said it should be left to theologians as it was too dangerous for ordinary readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=87}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Leifchild|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst early favourable responses, Huxley's reviews swiped at [[Richard Owen]], leader of the scientific establishment Huxley was trying to overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=477–491}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Owen's review attacked Darwin's friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. [[Patrick Matthew]] drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=158, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]]'s response was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]] and [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] dismissed the ideas, but [[liberal Christianity|liberal clergymen]] interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] seeing it as "just as noble a conception of Deity".&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/|title=Darwin and design: historical essay|year=2007|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project|accessdate=17 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615191012/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/ |archivedate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted [[clergy|clerical]] attention from Darwin, with its ideas including [[higher criticism]] attacked by church authorities as [[heresy]]. In it, [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that [[miracle]]s broke God's laws, so belief in them was [[atheism|atheistic]], and praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume &amp;#91;supporting&amp;#93; the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 487–488, 500}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asa Gray]] discussed [[teleology]] with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on [[theistic evolution]], ''Natural Selection is not inconsistent with [[natural theology]]''.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{Harvnb|Miles|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous confrontation was at the public [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]] during a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], where the [[Bishop of Oxford]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]], though not opposed to [[transmutation of species]], argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] argued strongly for Darwin, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]]'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even Darwin's close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education,&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt; aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen's claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate [[order (biology)|biological order]] from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the "[[Great Hippocampus Question]]", and discredited Owen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darwinism]] became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863 [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]]'s ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'' by [[Henry Walter Bates]] provided empirical evidence of natural selection.&lt;ref name=B217&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=217–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]], awarded on 3 November 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4652.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 4652&amp;nbsp;– Falconer, Hugh to Darwin, C.

The ''Origin of Species'' was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the "working men" who flocked to Huxley's lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=507–508}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=128–129, 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time{{Ref label|E|V|none}} and became a key fixture of popular culture.{{Ref label|F|VI|none}} Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way.

Despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, Darwin's work continued. Having published ''On the Origin of Species'' as an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his "big book". He covered [[human evolution|human descent]] from earlier animals including evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.

Enquiries about insect [[pollination]] led in 1861 to novel studies of wild [[orchid]]s, showing adaptation of their flowers to [[Pollination syndrome|attract specific moths]] to each species and ensure [[heterosis|cross fertilisation]]. In 1862 ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of [[vine|climbing plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=50–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admiring visitors included [[Ernst Haeckel]], a zealous proponent of ''Darwinismus'' incorporating [[Lamarckism]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605110511/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Cambridge University Press.

Darwin's book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' (1868) was the first part of his planned "big book", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of [[pangenesis]] attempting to explain [[heredity]]. It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freeman|1977|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A1&amp;pageseq=123 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] had already popularised human prehistory, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] had shown that anatomically humans are apes.&lt;ref name=B217 /&gt; With ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'' published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented [[sexual selection]] to explain impractical animal features such as the [[peacock]]'s plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural [[Race (human categorization)|racial classification]], while emphasising that humans are all one species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=402 385–405]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=339–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research using images was expanded in his 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the [[evolutionary psychology|evolution of human psychology]] and its continuity with the [[ethology|behaviour of animals]]. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that "everybody is talking about it without being shocked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=359–369}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=145 133]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion was "that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system–with all these exalted powers–Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=422 405]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on Orchids, ''[[Insectivorous Plants (book)|Insectivorous Plants]], [[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'', different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''. His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including [[Grant Allen]] and [[H. G. Wells]], and [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10359900&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0007087416000352 helped transform plant science] in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

==Legacy==
[[File:Charles Robert Darwin by John Collier.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three-quarter portrait of a senior Darwin dressed in black before a black background. His face and six-inch white beard are dramatically lit from the side. His eyes are shaded by his brows and look directly and thoughtfully at the viewer.|In 1881 Darwin was an eminent figure, still working on his contributions to evolutionary thought that had an enormous effect on many fields of science. Portrait by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]].]]
By the time of his death, Darwin had convinced most scientists that [[evolution]] as [[common descent|descent with modification]] was correct, and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas. In June 1909, though few at that time agreed with his view that "natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification", he was honoured by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in [[Cambridge]] to [[Darwin Day|commemorate his centenary]] and the fiftieth anniversary of ''On the Origin of Species''.&lt;ref name=b222&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=222–225}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F391&amp;pageseq=449 421]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the 20th century, a period that has been called "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms, which eventually proved untenable. [[Ronald Fisher]], an English [[statistics|statistician]], finally united [[Mendelian genetics]] with natural selection, in the period between 1918 and his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/154/4/1419.full The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection An introduction to the book by [[A.

Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], which set the frame of reference for modern debates and refinements of the theory.&lt;ref name=b3847 /&gt;

During Darwin's lifetime, many geographical features were given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the [[Beagle Channel]] was named ''[[Darwin Sound]]'' by [[Robert FitzRoy]] after Darwin's prompt action, along with two or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing [[glacier]] caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F10.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=267 216–8]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nearby [[Mount Darwin (Andes)|Mount Darwin]] in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/timeline/time_04.html Darwin's Timeline]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''[[HMS Beagle|Beagle]]'' was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend [[John Lort Stokes]] sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain [[John Clements Wickham|Wickham]] named ''[[Port Darwin]]'': a nearby settlement was renamed [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=NTDoPaI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918153343/http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archivedate=18 September 2006|title=Territory origins| accessdate=15 December 2006|publisher=Northern Territory Department of Planning and Infrastructure, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annie Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length studio photo of seated girl about nine years old, looking slightly plump and rather solemn, in a striped dress, holding a basket of flowers on her lap.|In 1851 Darwin was devastated when his daughter [[Anne Darwin|Annie]] died. By then his faith in Christianity had dwindled, and he had stopped going to church.&lt;ref name=jvw41&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Darwin's family tradition was [[nonconformist]] [[Unitarianism]], while his father and grandfather were [[freethought|freethinkers]], and his [[baptism]] and [[boarding school]] were [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name=skool /&gt; When going to Cambridge to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman, he did not doubt the [[Biblical inerrancy|literal truth]] of the Bible.&lt;ref name=dar57 /&gt; He learned [[John Herschel]]'s science which, like [[William Paley]]'s [[natural theology]], sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw [[adaptation]] of species as [[teleological argument|evidence of design]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=db /&gt; On board HMS ''Beagle'', Darwin was quite [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and would quote the Bible as an authority on [[morality]].&lt;ref name=biorelig&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=87 85–96]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He looked for "centres of creation" to explain distribution,&lt;ref name=k356 /&gt; and suggested that the very similar [[antlion]]s found in Australia and England evidence of a divine hand.&lt;ref name=Crows /&gt;

By his return, he was [[Historical criticism|critical of the Bible as history]], and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid.&lt;ref name=biorelig /&gt; In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the [[transmutation of species]], he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife [[Emma Darwin|Emma]], whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning.&lt;ref name=Belief /&gt; The [[theodicy]] of Paley and [[Thomas Malthus]] vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=8–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the [[ichneumon wasp]] paralysing [[caterpillar]]s as live food for its eggs.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt; He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and ''On the Origin of Species'' reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a [[tribe|tribal]] survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of [[deism|God as an ultimate lawgiver]]. He was increasingly troubled by the [[problem of evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=4–5, 12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin remained close friends with the [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of Downe, [[John Brodie Innes]], and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Darwin and the church: historical essay |accessdate=26 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128133709/https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |archivedate=28 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but from around 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church.&lt;ref name=jvw41 /&gt; He considered it "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist"&lt;ref name=Fordyce&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html Letter 12041] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107174817/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html |date=7 November 2009 }}&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

The "[[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope Story]]", published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were repudiated by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2005}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Yates|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human society===
Darwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He grew up in a family of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported [[Reform Act 1832|electoral reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation of slaves]]. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave [[John Edmonstone]], who he long recalled as "a very pleasant and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the ''Beagle'' voyage.{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=196–198, 240}} These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century,&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|2008|pp=408–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|G|VII|none}} Darwins interaction with [[Yaghan]]s (Fuegians) such as [[Jemmy Button]] during the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle]] had a profound impact on his view of primitive peoples. At his arrival to [[Tierra del Fuego]] he made a colorful description of "[[Fuegian]] savages".&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt; This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rozzi |first1=Ricardo|author-link=Ricardo Rozzi |date=2018 |title=Transformaciones del pensamiento de Darwin en cabo de hornos: Un legado para la ciencia y la etica ambiental|trans-title=Transformations of Darwin’s thought in cape horn: A legacy for science and environmental ethics |url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-22442018000100267&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=es|language=Spanish |journal=[[Magallania]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages= |doi=10.4067/S0718-22442018000100267 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While interested in Yaghan culture Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] detailing 32-thousand words.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt;

He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect that savage peoples who did not become civilised faced extinction. Darwin's theories presented this as natural, and were cited to promote policies that went against his humanitarian principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tony|last=Barta|title=Mr Darwin's shooters: on natural selection and the naturalizing of genocide|url= http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a713721865&amp;fulltext=713240928|work=Patterns of Prejudice, Volume 39, Issue 2 |publisher=Routledge |pages=116–137 |doi=10.1080/00313220500106170 |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought men's eminence over women was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] in her 1875 book ''[[The Sexes Throughout Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Vandermassen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vandermassen, Griet |title=Sexual Selection: A Tale of Male Bias and Feminist Denial |url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |year=2004 |volume=11 |issue=9 |doi=10.1177/1350506804039812 |accessdate=24 November 2009 |pages=11–13 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012141736/http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |archivedate=12 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was intrigued by his [[Cousin#Additional terms|half-cousin]] [[Francis Galton]]'s argument, introduced in 1865, that [[Historiometry|statistical analysis]] of [[heredity]] showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a "caste" of "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it "the sole feasible, yet I fear [[utopian]], plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=556–557, 572, 598}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=180 167–173], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=419 402–403]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin|accessdate=8 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102150434/http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Galton named this field of study "[[eugenics]]" in 1883.{{Ref label|H|VIII|1}}

==Evolutionary social movements==
[[File:VanityFair-Darwin2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Full length portrait of a very thin white bearded Darwin, seated but leaning eagerly forward and smiling.|[[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|Caricature of Darwin]] from 1871 ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'']]
{{Further|Darwinism|Eugenics|Social Darwinism}}
Darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.

[[Thomas Malthus]] had argued that [[Malthusian catastrophe|population growth beyond resources]] was ordained by God to get humans to [[Protestant work ethic|work productively]] and show restraint in getting families, this was used in the 1830s to justify [[workhouse]]s and [[laissez-faire economics]].&lt;ref name=wm&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|1997}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and [[Herbert Spencer]]'s 1851 book ''Social Statics'' based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sweet|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the ''Origin'' was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's "[[survival of the fittest]]" as free-market progress, and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[polygenism|polygenistic]] ideas of [[Ernst Haeckel#Polygenism and racial theory|human development]]. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat dog capitalism, [[colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included "dependence of one being on another"; thus [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bannister|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in "positive eugenics". During the "[[Eclipse of Darwinism]]", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. Negative eugenics to remove the "feebleminded" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and [[eugenics in the United States]] introduced [[compulsory sterilization]] laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, [[Nazi eugenics]] brought the field into disrepute.{{Ref label|H|VIII|2}}

The term "[[Social Darwinism]]" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by [[Richard Hofstadter]] to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like [[William Graham Sumner]] who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Kotzin|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wm /&gt;

==Works==
{{details|Charles Darwin bibliography}}

Darwin was a prolific writer. Even without publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of [[coral atoll]]s, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on [[barnacle]]s. While ''On the Origin of Species'' dominates perceptions of his work, ''The Descent of Man'' and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' had considerable impact, and his books on plants including ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]'' were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balfour|1882}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Brummitt|first = R.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''{{small|I}}.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} Darwin was eminent as a [[naturalist]], geologist, [[biologist]], and author. After working as a physician's assistant and two years as a [[medical student]], he was educated as a clergyman; he was also trained in [[taxidermy]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|Browne|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|II}}.''' {{Note label|B|II|none}} [[Robert FitzRoy]] was to become known after the voyage for [[biblical literalism]], but at this time he had considerable interest in Lyell's ideas, and they met before the voyage when Lyell asked for observations to be made in South America. FitzRoy's diary during the ascent of the River Santa Cruz in [[Patagonia]] recorded his opinion that the plains were [[raised beach]]es, but on return, newly married to a very religious lady, he recanted these ideas.{{Harv|Browne|1995|pp=186, 414}}

'''{{small|III}}.''' {{Note label|C|III|none}} In the section [[Morphology (biology)|"Morphology"]] of Chapter XIII of ''On the Origin of Species'', Darwin commented on [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] bone patterns between humans and other mammals, writing: "What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=452&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 434]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the concluding chapter: "The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse … at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=497&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 479]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|IV}}.''' {{Note label|D|IV|1}}{{Note label|D|IV|2}}{{Note label|D|IV|3}}
In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' Darwin mentioned [[human evolution|human origins]] in his concluding remark that "In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man" /&gt;

In "Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory" he referred to [[sexual selection]]: "I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous."&lt;ref name=SS_man /&gt;

In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' of 1871, Darwin discussed the first passage:
"During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=14&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1874|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=13&amp;itemID=F944&amp;viewtype=text vi]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|V}}.''' {{Note label|E|V|none}} See, for example, WILLA volume 4, ''[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall95/DeSimone.html Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Feminization of Education]'' by Deborah M. De Simone: "Gilman shared many basic educational ideas with the generation of thinkers who matured during the period of "intellectual chaos" caused by Darwin's Origin of the Species. Marked by the belief that individuals can direct human and social evolution, many progressives came to view education as the panacea for advancing social progress and for solving such problems as urbanisation, poverty, or immigration."

'''{{small|VI}}.''' {{Note label|F|VI|none}} See, for example, the song "A lady fair of lineage high" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Princess Ida]]'', which describes the descent of man (but not woman!) from apes.

'''{{small|VII}}.''' {{Note label|G|VII|none}} Darwin's belief that black people had the same essential humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from [[John Edmonstone]] in 1826.&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; Early in the ''Beagle'' voyage, Darwin nearly lost his position on the ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. {{Harv|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=76 74]}} He wrote home about "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." {{harv|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=264 246]}} Regarding [[Fuegians]], he "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like [[Jemmy Button]]: "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here."{{Harv|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205, 207–208]}}

In the ''Descent of Man'', he mentioned the similarity of Fuegians' and Edmonstone's minds to Europeans' when arguing against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=227 214], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 232]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejected the ill-treatment of native people, and for example wrote of massacres of [[Patagonia]]n men, women, and children, "Every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war, because it is against barbarians. Who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilized country?"{{harv|Darwin|1845|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F14&amp;pageseq=115 102]}}

'''{{small|VIII}}.''' {{Note label|H|VIII|1}}{{Note label|H|VIII|2}} [[Genetics|Geneticists]] studied human heredity as [[Mendelian inheritance]], while [[eugenics]] movements sought to manage society, with a focus on social class in the United Kingdom, and on disability and ethnicity in the United States, leading to geneticists seeing this as impractical [[pseudoscience]]. A shift from voluntary arrangements to "negative" eugenics included [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws in the United States, copied by [[Nazi Germany]] as the basis for [[Nazi eugenics]] based on virulent racism and "[[racial hygiene]]".&lt;br /&gt;({{Cite news | url =http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/5-supp/text/thurtle.html| title =the creation of genetic identity| last = Thurtle| first =Phillip| date =17 December 1996| issue =Supplement: Cultural and Technological Incubations of Fascism| volume = 5| ref = harv| periodical =SEHR| accessdate =11 November 2008}}{{Cite news| url =http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/154/4/1419#The_Eclipse_of_Darwinism| title =The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection

==Complexity of organisms and biosphere==
A complete definition of [[complexity]] for individual organisms, species, ecosystems, biological evolution and the biosphere has eluded researchers, and still is an ongoing issue.&lt;ref name="Bonner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heylighen, Francis (2008). "Complexity and Self-Organization". In Bates, Marcia J.; Maack, Mary Niles. Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences. CRC. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-9712-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|thumb|right]]

Most [[complex system]] models are often formulated in terms of concepts drawn from statistical physics, information theory and non-linear dynamics; however, such approaches are not focused on, or do not include,  the conceptual part of complexity related to organization and topological attributes or algebraic topology, such as network connectivity of genomes, interactomes and biological organisms that are very important.&lt;ref name="Rosen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;^ Heylighen, Francis (2008). "Complexity and Self-Organization". In Bates, Marcia J.; Maack, Mary Niles. Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences.

Retrieved 2010-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the two complementary approaches based both on [[information theory]], [[network topology]]/[[graph theory|abstract graph theory]] concepts are being combined for example in the fields of [[neuroscience]] and [[cognition|human cognition]].&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/10101/npre.2011.6115.1 Wallace, Rodrick. When Spandrels Become Arches: Neural crosstalk and the evolution of consciousness. Available from Nature Precedings  (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally agreed that there is a [[hierarchy]] of complexity levels of organization that should be considered as distinct from that of the levels of reality in [[ontology]].&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 2001a | title = The Basic Problem of the Theory of Levels of Reality | url = | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 12 | issue = 3–4| pages = 261–283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 1998 | title = Levels | url = | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 9 | issue = 1–2| pages = 197–211 | doi=10.1007/bf02681712| pmid = 8053082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy of complexity levels of organization in the biosphere is also recognized in modern classifications
of taxonomic ranks, such as: [[domain (biology)|biological domain]] and biosphere, [[Kingdom (biology)|biological kingdom]], [[Phylum]], [[Class (biology)|biological class]], [[Order (biology)|order]], [[Family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] and [[species]]. Because of their dynamic and composition variability, intrinsic "fuzziness",  autopoietic attributes, ability to self-reproduce, and so on, organisms do not fit into the 'standard' definition of general systems, and they are therefore 'super-complex' in both their function and structure; organisms can be thus be defined in CSB only as '[[meta-system]]s' of simpler dynamic systems&lt;ref name="springerlink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MST.html Metasystem Transition Theory], [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Cliff Joslyn]], 1993-1997&lt;/ref&gt; Such a meta-system definition of organisms, species, 'ecosystems', and so on, is  not equivalent to the definition of a ''system of systems'' as in [[Autopoiesis|Autopoietic System]]s Theory,;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net Reflexive Autopoietic Systems Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; it also differs from the definition proposed for example by K.D.

Tessellation or [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] provide however an intuitive, visual/computational insight into the lower levels of complexity, and have therefore become an increasingly popular, discrete model studied in computability theory, applied mathematics, physics, computer science, theoretical biology/systems biology, cancer simulations and microstructure modeling.

{{Euthanasia}}
The '''''Declaration on Euthanasia''''' is the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s official document on the topic of [[euthanasia]], a statement that was issued as by the [[Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="vatican-euth"&gt;
{{cite web
 |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19800505_euthanasia_en.html 
 |title=Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. "Declaration on Euthanasia," May 5, 1980 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic teaching purports that euthanasia is a "crime against life".&lt;ref name="vatican-euth"/&gt; The teaching of the Catholic Church on euthanasia rests on several core principles of Catholic ethics, including the [[sanctity of human life]], the [[dignity]] of the human person, concomitant [[human rights]], due [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] in [[Casuistry|casuistic]] remedies, the unavoidability of death, and the importance of [[charity (virtue)|charity]].&lt;ref name="vatican-euth" /&gt; 

In Catholic [[medical ethics]] official pronouncements strongly oppose ''active euthanasia,'' whether voluntary or not... {{quote|...no one is permitted to ask for this act of killing, either for himself or herself or for another person entrusted to his or her care, nor can he or she consent to it, either explicitly or implicitly. nor can any authority legitimately recommend or permit such an action."&lt;ref name="vatican-euth"/&gt;}} ....while allowing dying to proceed without medical interventions that would be considered "extraordinary" or "disproportionate."  The Declaration on Euthanasia states that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When inevitable death is imminent... it is permitted in conscience to take the decision to refuse forms of treatment that would only secure a precarious and burdensome prolongation of life, so long as the normal care due to a sick person in similar cases is not interrupted."&lt;ref name="vatican-euth"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Declaration concludes that doctors, beyond providing medical skill, must above all provide patients "with the comfort of boundless kindness and heartfelt charity".

Although the Declaration allows people to decline ''heroic'' medical treatment when death is imminently inevitable, it unequivocally prohibits the hastening of death and restates [[Vatican II]]'s condemnation of "crimes against life 'such as any type of murder, genocide, abortion, euthanasia, or willful suicide'".&lt;ref name="vatican-euth"/&gt;

'''Denver Cuello''' (born December 12, 1986 in [[Cabatuan, Iloilo|Cabatuan]], [[Iloilo]], [[Philippines]]) is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]]. Born in Cabatuan, Iloilo, he currently resides in [[Binangonan]], [[Rizal]], Philippines. Cuello is trained by Frankie and Sol Jaro at the Jaro Boxing Stable in Binangonan.

==Professional career==
Cuello made his professional debut on September 26, 2004, against Marlon Villanueva. The bout took place at the Taytay Gym in [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]], [[Rizal]] and ended in a technical draw early in the fight.

He won the vacant WBC International minimumweight title on April 19, 2009, defeating Japanese boxer Hiroshi Matsumoto via technical knockout in the 4th round. The bout was held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]], Philippines. He later took on Ruslee Samoh in a non-title bout and won by unanimous dedicion. Cuello defended his title for the first time on November 27, 2009, against Mating Kilakil at the Ynares Plaza Gymnasium in Binangonan, Rizal, Philippines.

On March 26, 2011 Cuello defended his WBC championship belt against [[Samat Chaiyong]] from Thailand at the Angono Gym in Angono, Rizal. He stopped the Thai challenger via a TKO on the 9th round with the referee stopping the match with still one minute and 12 seconds left in the round. The win improved Cuello's record to 26 wins (with 16 coming by way of knockout) against four losses and six draws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=2011-03-27| author=KY, JVP| url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/216277/sports/boxing/cuello-stops-thai-foe-retains-wbc-105-lb-belt| title=Cuello stops Thai foe, retains WBC 105-lb belt| work=GMA News| publisher=GMA Network.com| accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dionisiy.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of Saint Dionysius I, Metropolitan of Kiev.]]

Saint '''Dionysius I''' ({{lang-ru|Дионисий}}); secular name: David (1300? – October 15, 1385) was a [[Russian Orthodox]] [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] in 1384–1385.

A native of the Duchy of Kiev as a young man David entered the [[Kiev Caves Lavra]], where he was [[tonsure]]d a [[hieromonk]] and given the [[religious name]] Dionysius. He is known to have spent a number of years living in a [[cave]] that he dug out himself on the banks of the [[Volga River]] not far from [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. Later, Dionysius founded the [[cave monastery|Pechersky]] [[Monastery]] on that same spot, which was dedicated in honour of the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension of the Lord]]. In 1374, he was [[consecrated]] the [[Bishop]] of [[Suzdal]] and won love and respect on the part of the locals.

In 1378, Dionysius was recommended as [[Metropolitan of Kiev]] by [[St. Sergius of Radonezh]] after the death of Metropolitan [[Alexius, Metropolitan of Kiev|Alexius]]. However, [[Grand Prince]] [[Dmitri Donskoi]] had his own candidate – a priest by the name of Mikhail (Mityaya). Dionysius was one of a number of bishops at the council who opposed Mikhail, who was suspected of [[heresy]] ([[Strigolniki]]). If elected, Mikhail wanted to introduce a new way of [[kathedra|enthroning]] the Metropolitan at home, in [[Russia]], rather than traveling to [[Constantinople]] to be installed by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]] (at the time, Russia was not yet an [[autocephalous]] church). In 1379 Dionysius went to Constantinople carrying a protest against the choice of Mikhail addressed to the Patriarch. Mikhail was afraid that Dionysius would get the patriarch's blessing and followed him to Constantinople. However, Mikhail died on his way there and one of his accompanying clergymen, [[Archmandrite]] [[Pimen, Metropolitan of Moscow|Pimen]], reached Constantinople ([[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''[[Tzargrad]]'') before Dionysius and was named Metropolitan of Moscow and All Rus' in place of Mikhail.

In 1382 the Dionysius received the title of [[archbishop]] from the Patriarch, who was impressed with his piety and humility. In 1383, Dionysius returned from this long journey to his [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] at Suzdal and continued his struggle against the Strigolniki. He also implored Dmitri Donskoi against Pimen, whom he viewed as a usurper, since no one in the Russian Church, not even the Great Prince himself, had been consulted before Pimen was appointed Metropolitan. In 1384, Dionysius was sent back to Constantinople to ask for Pimen's [[deposition (politics)|deposition]] and his own appointment as Metropolitan. Patriarch [[Patriarch Nilus of Constantinople|Neilus Kerameus]] was not sure whether he could trust Dionysius and sent two metropolitans to [[Moscow]], who were supposed to depose Pimen and install the archbishop of Suzdal. On his way back to Moscow, Dionysius stopped in [[Kiev]], where he was detained by the Kievan prince [[Vladimir Olgerdovich]] at the insistence of [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], Archbishop of Kiev, who was to have succeeded as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1378 upon the death of Alexius, but who was not finally welcomed into Moscow until 1390. Dionysius died in [[Detention (Imprisonment)|detention]] on October 15, 1385. He was buried in the [[Near Caves|Caves of St. Anthony]] at Kiev, in the monastery in which he began his spiritual life.

The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] used to celebrate his [[feast day]] on July 19, but subsequently this tradition died down. He is now commemorated on October 15 of the traditional [[Julian Calendar]] (October 28 on the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]), where he is listed as "Metropolitan of Suzdal", since he was never able to take possession of his [[Metropolitan See]].

'''Drug distribution''' is the process by means of which people get access to [[medication]]. 

==Logistics==
Drug distribution has special safety considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marucheck|first1=Ann|last2=Greis|first2=Noel|last3=Mena|first3=Carlos|last4=Cai|first4=Linning|title=Product safety and security in the global supply chain: Issues, challenges and research opportunities|journal=Journal of Operations Management|date=November 2011|volume=29|issue=7-8|pages=707–720|doi=10.1016/j.jom.2011.06.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some drugs require [[cold chain]] management in their distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bishara|first1=Rafik H.|title=Cold Chain Management - An Essential Component of the Global Pharmaceutical Supply Chain|journal=American Pharmaceutical Review|date=January 2006|url=http://www.intelsius.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Pharma-Cold-Chain-Bishara_APR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry uses [[track and trace]] technology though the timings for implementation and the information required in local national laws and standards.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Regulation==
Because governments regulate access to drugs, governments control drug [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and the drug [[supply chain]] more than trade for other goods.&lt;ref name="weaknesses in supply chain 2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Committee on Understanding the Global Public Health Implications of Substandard, Falsified, and Counterfeit Medical Products|author2=Board on Global Health|author3=[[National Academy of Medicine]]|editor1-last=Buckley|editor1-first=Gillian J.|editor2-last=Gostin|editor2-first=Lawrence O.|title=Countering the problem of falsified and substandard drugs|date=2013|publisher=[[National Academies Press]]|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-26939-1|edition=Édition abrégée du rapport :  "Parer au problème des médicaments falsifiés ou de qualité inférieure" publié en 2013.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK202523/|chapter=Weaknesses in the Drug Distribution Chain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution begins with the [[pharmaceutical industry]] manufacturing drugs.&lt;ref name="weaknesses in supply chain 2013"/&gt; From there, intermediaries in the [[public sector]], [[private sector]], and [[non-governmental organizations]] acquire drugs to provide them to other intermediaries.&lt;ref name="weaknesses in supply chain 2013"/&gt; Eventually, the drugs reach different classes of consumers who use them.&lt;ref name="weaknesses in supply chain 2013"/&gt;

Good distribution practice (GDP) is a quality warranty system, which includes requirements for purchase, receiving, storage and export of drugs intended for human consumption. It regulates the division and movement of pharmaceutical products from the premises of the manufacturer of medicinal products, or another central point, to the end user thereof, or to an intermediate point by means of various transport methods, via various storage and/or health establishments.

===Argentina===
In 2011, Argentina introduced a catalogue of drugs covered but its national drug traceability scheme, listing more than 3,000 drugs that require the placing of unique serial numbers and tamper-evident features on the secondary packaging. The drugs listed are recorded in real time in a central database managed by the National Administration of Drugs, Foods, Medical Devices of Argentina (ANMAT), Regulation 3683, which uses Global Location Numbers (GLNs) to identify the various actors in the supply chain. The purpose of this program is to actively limit the use of illegal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Successful cases of Traceability in the Healthcare Sector in Argentina|date=January 2014|publisher=Association of Private Clinics, Sanatoriums and Hospitals of the Argentine Republic|url=https://www.gs1.org/docs/healthcare/Healthcare_local_cases_GS1_Argentina.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
The 2009 Brazilian Federal Law 11.903 and subsequent regulations of the National Agency for Sanitary Surveillance in Brazil (ANVISA) require that a 2D data matrix code be put on all secondary packaging. Under these provisions, manufacturers will be required to maintain a database of all transactions from manufacturing to dispensing, while distributors must report serialized transaction data to the manufacturer and keep a database of suppliers, medicine recipients, and packing companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pharmaceutical Serialization Track &amp; Trace: Easy Guide to Country-Wise Mandates|date=2014|publisher=Infosy Limited|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In 2008, China’s State Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) made serialization mandatory for over 275 therapeutic classes of individual saleable product units by December 2015. The CFDA does not follow an international standard. Manufacturers may only register their products and obtain their serial numbers by applying to the China Product Identification, Authentication and Tracking System (PIATS). They must also implement a quality control system with an electronic drug-monitoring system, a standardized documentation system, and bar codes to ensure pharmaceutical traceability. Companies importing drugs into China must designate a local pharmaceutical company or wholesaler as their electronic monitoring agent in the country.
In addition to legislative reforms, China has increased enforcement efforts at the provincial and local levels. In 2013, the Chinese government coordinated joint special enforcement campaigns targeting counterfeit drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buthusiem|first1=Edward J.|title=Drug Serialization Trends and Developments|url=http://www.pharmacompliancemonitor.com/drug-serialization-trends-and-developments/9016/|website=Pharmaceutical Compliance Monitor|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. China regulations are currently on hold.

===Europe ===
In Europe GDP is based on the Directive of the Board of the [[European Community]] 92/25/EEC regarding the wholesale distribution of drugs for human consumption

In 2016, the European Medicines Agency adopted the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD), which requires all pharmaceutical products sold in the EU to feature obligatory “safety features.” This directive is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2019. By February 9, 2019, all pharmaceutical companies will be required to connect their internal systems to the EU data repository, which contains the product master data and batch information. This will allow pharmacists and consumers to authenticate their medicines. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://clarkstonconsulting.com/insights/serialisation-eu-hub-challenges/|title=Serialisation Challenges and Solutions Under the EU’s Falsified Medicines Directive {{!}} Clarkston Consulting|date=2017-11-02|work=Clarkston Consulting|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the US GMP is based on the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] 21 CFR 210/211, and USP 1079.

The US Drug Supply and Chain Security Act (DQSA), was enacted by Congress on November 26, 2013 and outlines requirements to build electronic systems that identify and trace prescription drugs distributed in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugIntegrityandSupplyChainSecurity/DrugSupplyChainSecurityAct/|title=Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA)|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 27th 2023, full electronic track &amp; trace capability will be required for all partners in the supply chain. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://clarkstonconsulting.com/insights/what-is-serialization/|title=What is Serialization? {{!}} Clarkston Consulting|date=2017-10-11|work=Clarkston Consulting|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal drugs==
An [[illegal drug trade]] operates to distribute illegal drugs. The trade of illegal drugs overlaps with trade in [[contraband]] of all sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruinsma|first1=Gerben|last2=Bernasco|first2=Wim|title=Criminal groups and transnational illegal markets|journal=Crime, Law and Social Change|date=February 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=79–94|doi=10.1023/B:CRIS.0000015283.13923.aa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HALLER|first1=MARK H.|title=ILLEGAL ENTERPRISE: A THEORETICAL AND HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION *|journal=Criminology|date=May 1990|volume=28|issue=2|pages=207–236|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1990.tb01324.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal drug distribution does not overlap in obvious ways with the legal trade of legal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Passas|first1=Nikos|title=Cross-border Crime and the Interface between Legal and Illegal Actors|journal=Security Journal|date=1 January 2003|volume=16|issue=1|pages=19–37|doi=10.1057/palgrave.sj.8340123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elisabeth of Württemberg''' (Elisabeth Wilhelmine Luise; 21 April 1767 – 18 February 1790) was an [[Archduchess of Austria]] by marriage to [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Francis of Austria]].

==Life==

She was the eighth of the twelve children of [[Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg]], by his wife, [[Margravine Sophia Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt|Sophia Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt]]. She was baptised with the names ''Elisabeth Wilhelmine Luise''.

At the age of 15, she was called by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II]] to Vienna and educated in the ''Salesianerinnenkloster'' where she also converted to Catholicism. The purpose of this was to make her the future wife of Joseph II's nephew [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis]], the future emperor.

In [[Vienna]] on 6 January 1788, Elisabeth and Francis were married. At this time, Emperor Joseph was in ill health; the young archduchess was close to the emperor and brightened his last years with her youthful charm. At the end of 1789, Elisabeth became pregnant; however, her condition was very delicate. On the night of 18 February, she prematurely gave birth to [[Archduchess Ludovika Elisabeth of Austria]], who lived for only 16 months. Despite an emergency operation to save her life, Elisabeth did not survive the birth, which lasted more than 24 hours. She is buried in the [[Imperial Crypt]], in Vienna. The emperor died two days after the death of his niece.

==Issue==

#[[Archduchess Ludovika Elisabeth of Austria]] (18 Feb 1790 - 24 June 1791) died in infancy.

'''Ecology''' (from {{lang-el|οἶκος}}, "house", or "environment"; -λογία, "study of"){{Cref2|A}} is the branch of [[biology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ecology|title=the definition of ecology|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221095929/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ecology|archivedate=21 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which studies the interactions among organisms and their environment. Objects of study include interactions of [[organism]]s with each other and with [[abiotic component]]s of their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest include the [[biodiversity]], distribution, [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and [[population]]s of organisms, as well as cooperation and competition within and between [[species]]. [[Ecosystems]] are dynamically interacting systems of [[organisms]], the [[Community (ecology)|communities]] they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as [[primary production]], [[pedogenesis]], [[nutrient cycling]], and [[niche construction]], regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits. Biodiversity means the varieties of [[species]], [[gene]]s, and [[ecosystem]]s, enhances certain [[ecosystem services]].

Ecology is not synonymous with [[environmentalism]], natural history, or [[environmental science]]. It overlaps with the closely related sciences of [[evolutionary biology]], [[genetics]], and [[ethology]]. An important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function. Ecologists seek to explain:

* Life processes, interactions, and [[adaptations]]
* The movement of materials and [[energy]] through living communities
* The [[ecological succession|successional]] development of ecosystems
* The [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and distribution of organisms and biodiversity in the context of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

Ecology has practical applications in [[conservation biology]], wetland management, [[natural resource management]] ([[agroecology]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[agroforestry]], [[fisheries]]), city planning ([[urban ecology]]), [[community health]], [[Ecological economics|economics]], [[basic science|basic]] and [[applied science]], and human social interaction ([[human ecology]]). For example, the ''[[Circles of Sustainability]]'' approach treats ecology as more than the environment 'out there'. It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms (including humans) and [[Resource (biology)|resources]] compose [[ecosystem]]s which, in turn, maintain [[Biophysics|biophysical]] feedback mechanisms that moderate processes  acting on living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[abiotic]]) components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life-supporting functions and produce [[natural capital]] like  [[Biomass |biomass production]] (food, fuel, fiber, and medicine), the regulation of [[climate]], global [[biogeochemical cycles]], [[water filtration]], [[soil formation]], erosion control, flood protection, and many other natural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.

The word "ecology" ("Ökologie") was coined in [[1866]] by the German scientist [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy, particularly from ethics and politics.&lt;ref name="LaferrièreStoett2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Laferrière|author2=Peter J. Stoett|title=International Relations Theory and Ecological Thought: Towards a Synthesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWtncHw7ErIC&amp;pg=PA25|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-71068-3|pages=25–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624045150/https://books.google.com/books?id=HWtncHw7ErIC&amp;pg=PA25|archivedate=24 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] laid the foundations of ecology in their studies on [[natural history]]. Modern ecology became a much more rigorous [[natural sciences|science]] in the late 19th century. [[Evolution]]ary concepts relating to adaptation and [[natural selection]] became the cornerstones of modern [[Theoretical ecology|ecological theory]].

== Levels, scope, and scale of organization ==

The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., [[cell (biology)|cells]]) to a planetary scale (e.g., [[Earth's spheres|biosphere]]) [[phenomena]]. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic [[Resource (biology)|resources]] and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into [[population]]s which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain [[ecological succession|successional stages]] of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it.&lt;ref name="Stadler98"/&gt; Several generations of an [[aphid]] population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse [[bacteria]]l communities.&lt;ref name="Humphreys97"/&gt; The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole.&lt;ref name=Liere2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liere|first=Heidi|author2=Jackson, Doug|author3=Vandermeer, John|author4=Wilby, Andrew|title=Ecological Complexity in a Coffee Agroecosystem: Spatial Heterogeneity, Population Persistence and Biological Control|journal=PLoS ONE | date=20 September 2012|volume=7|issue=9 | pages=e45508 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045508|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...745508L |pmid=23029061|pmc=3447771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;

The main subdisciplines of ecology, [[population ecology|population]] (or [[community ecology|community]]) ecology and [[ecosystem ecology]], exhibit a difference not only of scale, but also of two contrasting paradigms in the field. The former focus on organisms distribution and abundance, while the later focus on materials and energy fluxes.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, S. T. A.; Kolasa, J.; Jones, C. G. (1994).

=== Hierarchy ===
{{See also|Biological organisation|Biological classification}}

{{quote box
| quote = System behaviors must first be arrayed into different levels of organization. Behaviors corresponding to higher levels occur at slow rates. Conversely, lower organizational levels exhibit rapid rates. For example, individual tree leaves respond rapidly to momentary changes in light intensity, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, and the like. The growth of the tree responds more slowly and integrates these short-term changes.| source = O'Neill et al. (1986)&lt;ref name="O'Neill86" /&gt;{{Rp|76}}| width = 25%| align = right}}

The scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as aphids migrating on a single tree, while at the same time remain open with regard to broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence, ecologists classify [[ecosystems]] hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, [[landscape]], and chronological scales.

To structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework, the biological world is organized into a [[Biological organisation|nested hierarchy]], ranging in scale from [[gene]]s, to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, to [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], to [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], to [[organism]]s, to [[species]], to [[population ecology|population]]s, to [[Community (ecology)|communities]], to [[ecosystem]]s, to [[biome]]s, and up to the level of the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name="Nachtomy01"/&gt; This framework forms a [[panarchy]]&lt;ref name="Holling01"/&gt; and exhibits [[non-linear]] behaviors; this means that "effect and cause are disproportionate, so that small changes to critical variables, such as the number of [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixers]], can lead to disproportionate, perhaps irreversible, changes in the system properties."&lt;ref name="Levin99"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

=== Biodiversity ===
{{main|Biodiversity}}
{{quote box

Biodiversity (an abbreviation of "biological diversity") describes the diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations, and there are many ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization.&lt;ref name="Noss90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholes08"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cardinale2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cardinale|first=Bradley J.|author2=Duffy, J.

=== Habitat ===
{{Main|Habitat}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Biodiversity of a [[coral reef]]. [[Coral]]s adapt to and modify their environment by forming [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons. This provides growing conditions for future generations and forms a habitat for many other species.&lt;ref name="Kiessling09" /&gt;]]
[[File:Long-tailed Broadbill (Psarisomus dalhousiae).jpg|thumb|[[Long-tailed broadbill]] building its [[Bird nest|nest]]]]
The habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result.&lt;ref name="Whittaker73"/&gt; More specifically, "habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal."&lt;ref name="Beyer10"/&gt;{{Rp|745}} For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a [[Montane ecosystem|montane]] or [[alpine tundra|alpine]] ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population of a species of tropical lizards (''Tropidurus hispidus'') has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental [[life history theory|life history]] of amphibians, and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. [[Biotope]] and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas the latter applies to a species' environment.&lt;ref name="Whittaker73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schoener75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vitt97"/&gt;

=== Niche ===
{{Main|Ecological niche}}

[[File:Termite mound-Tanzania.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Termite]] mounds with varied heights of chimneys regulate gas exchange, temperature and other environmental parameters that are needed to sustain the internal physiology of the entire colony.&lt;ref name="Laland99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes08"/&gt;]]

Definitions of the niche date back to 1917,&lt;ref name="Wiens05"/&gt; but [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] made conceptual advances in 1957&lt;ref name="Hutchinson57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson57b"/&gt; by introducing a widely adopted definition:  "the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes."&lt;ref name="Wiens05" /&gt;{{Rp|519}} The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub-divided into the ''fundamental'' and the ''realized'' niche. The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists.&lt;ref name="Wiens05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson57b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Begon05"/&gt; The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a "[[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[N-dimensional space|hyperspace]] whose ''dimensions'' are defined as environmental variables and whose ''size'' is a function of the number of values that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has ''positive fitness''."&lt;ref name="Hardesty75"/&gt;{{rp|71}}

[[Biogeography|Biogeographical]] patterns and [[Range (biology)|range]] distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species' [[trait (biology)|traits]] and niche requirements.&lt;ref name="Pearman08"/&gt; Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, [[phenotype]], or [[Phenotypic trait|characteristic]] of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits.&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt; Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The [[competitive exclusion principle]] states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting [[Resource (biology)|resource]]; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements.&lt;ref name="Hardin60"/&gt; Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities.&lt;ref name="Scheffer06"/&gt; The habitat plus the niche is called the [[ecotope]], which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.&lt;ref name="Whittaker73" /&gt;

===Niche construction===
{{Main|Niche construction}}
{{See also|Ecosystem engineering}}

Organisms are subject to environmental pressures, but they also modify their habitats. The [[negative feedback|regulatory feedback]] between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local (e.g., a [[beaver]] [[pond]]) to global scales, over time and even after death, such as decaying logs or [[silica]] skeleton deposits from marine organisms.&lt;ref name="Hastings07"/&gt; The process and concept of [[ecosystem engineering]] is related to [[niche construction]], but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as: "organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats."&lt;ref name="Jones94"/&gt;{{Rp|373}}

The ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The term "niche construction" is more often used in reference to the under-appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche.&lt;ref name="Laland99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Write06"/&gt; An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of [[social insects]], including ants, bees, wasps, and termites. There is an emergent [[homeostasis]] or [[homeorhesis]] in the structure of the nest that regulates, maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony. Termite mounds, for example, maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air-conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover, a nest can survive over successive generations, so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes08"/&gt;

=== Biome ===
{{main|Biome}}

Biomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation.&lt;ref name="Palmer94"/&gt; There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include [[tropical rainforest]], [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]], [[temperate deciduous forest]], [[taiga]], [[tundra]], [[hot desert]], and [[polar desert]].&lt;ref name="Prentice92"/&gt; Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic [[microbiome]]s. To a [[microorganism|microbe]], the human body is a habitat and a landscape.&lt;ref name="Turnbaugh07"/&gt; Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in [[molecular genetics]], which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays a significant role in the ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.&lt;ref name="DeLong09"/&gt;

=== Biosphere ===
{{main|Biosphere}}
{{See also|Earth's spheres}}
The largest scale of ecological organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. [[Ecological relationship]]s regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate all the way up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals.&lt;ref name="igamberdiev06"/&gt; Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the [[Gaia hypothesis]] is an example of [[holism]] applied in ecological theory.&lt;ref name="Lovelock73"/&gt; The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent [[feedback loop]] generated by the [[metabolic theory of ecology|metabolism]] of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.&lt;ref name="Lovelock03"/&gt;

=== Population ecology ===
{{Main|Population ecology}}
{{See also|Lists of organisms by population}}

Population ecology studies the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; A population consists of individuals of the same species that live, interact, and migrate through the same niche and habitat.&lt;ref name="Waples06"/&gt;

A primary law of population ecology is the [[Malthusian growth model]]&lt;ref name="Turchin01"/&gt; which states, "a population will grow (or decline) exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant."&lt;ref name="Turchin01" /&gt;{{Rp|18}} Simplified population [[Scientific modelling|models]] usually start with four variables: death, birth, [[immigration]], and [[emigration]].

An example of an introductory population model describes a closed population, such as on an island, where immigration and emigration does not take place. Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that [[random]] processes create the observed data. In these island models, the rate of population change is described by:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}N}{\operatorname{d}T} = bN - dN = (b - d)N = rN, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the total number of individuals in the population, ''b'' and ''d'' are the per capita rates of birth and death respectively, and ''r'' is the per capita rate of population change.&lt;ref name="Turchin01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandermeer03"/&gt;

Using these modelling techniques, Malthus' population principle of growth was later transformed into a model known as the [[Law of population growth|logistic equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dT} = aN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of individuals measured as [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] density, ''a'' is the maximum per-capita rate of change, and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of the population. The formula states that the rate of change in population size (''dN/dT'') is equal to growth (''aN'') that is limited by carrying capacity (1&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''N''/''K'').

Population ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand demographic processes in real study populations. Commonly used types of data include [[Biological life cycle|life history]], [[fecundity]], and survivorship, and these are analysed using mathematical techniques such as [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]]. The information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas.&lt;ref name="Vandermeer03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berryman92"/&gt; In cases where basic models are insufficient, ecologists may adopt different kinds of statistical methods, such as the [[Akaike information criterion]],&lt;ref name="Anderson00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Anderson | first1=D.

=== Metapopulations and migration ===
{{Main|Metapopulation}}
{{See also|Animal migration}}
The concept of metapopulations was defined in 1969&lt;ref name="Levins69"/&gt; as "a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize".&lt;ref name="Levins70"/&gt;{{Rp|105}} Metapopulation ecology is another statistical approach that is often used in [[conservation biology|conservation research]].&lt;ref name="Smith05"/&gt; Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality,&lt;ref name="Hanski98"/&gt; and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement; because, it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat.&lt;ref name="Nebel10"/&gt; Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved an expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging, territorial behaviour, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration; because, it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population.&lt;ref name="Clark98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dingle96"/&gt;

In metapopulation terminology, migrating individuals are classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of [[Juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and [[field study|field studies]] to explain metapopulation structure.&lt;ref name="Hanski04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacKenzie06"/&gt;

=== Community ecology ===

Community ecology is the study of the interactions among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure [[species diversity]] in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.

[[File:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA) is an example of [[ecosystem ecology]]]]

Ecosystems may be habitats within biomes that form an integrated whole and a dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological complexes. Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials (e.g. carbon, phosphorus) between different pools (e.g., tree biomass, soil organic material). Ecosystem ecologist attempt to determine the underlying causes of these fluxes. Research in ecosystem ecology might measure [[primary production]] (g C/m^2) in a [[wetland]] in relation to decomposition and consumption rates (g C/m^2/y). This requires an understanding of the community connections between plants (i.e., primary producers) and the decomposers (e.g., [[fungi]] and bacteria),&lt;ref name="Brinson81"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Brinson| first1 = M.

The underlying concept of ecosystem can be traced back to 1864 in the published work of [[George Perkins Marsh]] ("Man and Nature").&lt;ref name="Marsh64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Neil01"/&gt; Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted.&lt;ref name="Tansley35"/&gt; Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space.&lt;ref name="Levin98"/&gt; Ecosystems are broadly categorized as [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]], [[Freshwater ecosystem|freshwater]], atmospheric, or [[Marine ecosystem|marine]]. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are [[technoecosystems]], which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;

=== Food webs ===
{{Main|Food web}}
{{See also|Food chain}}

[[File:Chesapeake Waterbird Food Web.jpg|thumb|right|Generalized food web of waterbirds from [[Chesapeake Bay]]]]

A food web is the archetypal [[ecological network]]. Plants capture [[solar energy]] and use it to synthesize [[simple sugars]] during [[photosynthesis]]. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing [[herbivores]], and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal [[trophic species]] to a top consumer is called the [[food chain]]. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of [[concept map]] or a [[heuristic]] device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.&lt;ref name="O'Neill86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimm02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimm91"/&gt;

Food webs are often limited relative to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web [[Microcosm (experimental ecosystem)|microcosm]] studies are extrapolated to larger systems.&lt;ref name="Worm03"/&gt; Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which can be difficult to decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web.&lt;ref name="McCann07"/&gt; Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Wilbur97"/&gt;

Food webs exhibit principles of ecological emergence through the nature of trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., [[omnivores]]) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., [[predator|primary predators]]). Theoretical and empirical studies identify [[Random#In biology|non-random]] emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time.&lt;ref name="Emmerson"/&gt; Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability.&lt;ref name="Kraus03"/&gt; Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.&lt;ref name="Pimm91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Egerton07b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shurin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards83"/&gt;

=== Trophic levels ===
{{Main|Trophic level}}

[[File:TrophicWeb.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.05|A trophic pyramid (a) and a food-web (b) illustrating [[ecological relationship]]s among creatures that are typical of a northern [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] terrestrial ecosystem. The trophic pyramid roughly represents the biomass (usually measured as total dry-weight) at each level. Plants generally have the greatest biomass. Names of trophic categories are shown to the right of the pyramid. Some ecosystems, such as many wetlands, do not organize as a strict pyramid, because aquatic plants are not as productive as long-lived terrestrial plants such as trees. Ecological trophic pyramids are typically one of three kinds: 1) pyramid of numbers, 2) pyramid of biomass, or 3) pyramid of energy.&lt;ref name="Odum05"/&gt;{{rp|598}}]]

A trophic level (from Greek ''troph'', τροφή, trophē, meaning "food" or "feeding") is "a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the lower adjacent level (according to [[ecological pyramid]]s) nearer the abiotic source."&lt;ref name="Hariston93"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or [[trophism]] among species. Biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids, in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators, and the horizontal dimension represents the [[Relative species abundance|abundance]] or biomass at each level.&lt;ref name="Duffy07"/&gt; When the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level, they naturally sort into a 'pyramid of numbers'.&lt;ref name="Elton27" /&gt;

Species are broadly categorized as [[autotrophs]] (or [[primary producers]]), [[heterotrophs]] (or [[consumer]]s), and [[Detritivore]]s (or [[decomposers]]). Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or [[chemosynthesis]]. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production).&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including [[primary consumers]] (strict herbivores), [[Trophic dynamics|secondary consumers]] ([[carnivorous]] predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators).&lt;ref name="David03"/&gt; Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.&lt;ref name="Oksanen91"/&gt;

Trophic levels are part of the [[holistic]] or [[complex systems]] view of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Loehle88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulanowicz79"/&gt; Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions, giving a macroscopic view of the system.&lt;ref name="Li00"/&gt; While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top-down control within food webs, it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems. This has led some ecologists to "reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete, homogeneous trophic levels is fiction."&lt;ref name="Polis96"/&gt;{{rp|815}} Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist, but "above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores."&lt;ref name="Thompson07"/&gt;{{rp|612}}

=== Keystone species ===
{{main|Keystone species}}
[[File:Sea otters holding hands, cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Sea otter]]s, an example of a keystone species]]
A keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the [[food-web]]. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role. The many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.&lt;ref name="Fisher06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Libralato06"/&gt;

[[Sea otter]]s (''Enhydra lutris'') are commonly cited as an example of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of [[sea urchins]] that feed on [[kelp]]. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure.&lt;ref name="Mills93"/&gt; Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'').&lt;ref name="Anderson95"/&gt; While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a [[Conservation biology|conservation]] tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.&lt;ref name="Mills93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polis00"/&gt;

== Ecological complexity ==
{{Main|Complexity}}
{{See also|Emergence}}

Complexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This [[biocomplexity]] stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other, such as transitional areas or [[ecotones]] spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy, and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts. "What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one."&lt;ref name="Novikoff45"/&gt;{{rp|209}} Small scale patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena, otherwise captured in the expression (coined by Aristotle) 'the sum is greater than the parts'.&lt;ref name="Schneider01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Molnar04"/&gt;{{Cref2|E}}

"Complexity in ecology is of at least six distinct types: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric."&lt;ref name="Loehle04"/&gt;{{rp|3}} From these principles, ecologists have identified [[emergence|emergent]] and [[Self-organization#Self-organization in biology|self-organizing]] phenomena that operate at different environmental scales of influence, ranging from molecular to planetary, and these require different explanations at each integrative level.&lt;ref name="Lovelock03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum1977"/&gt; Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems that transition to multiple shifting steady-states directed by random fluctuations of history.&lt;ref name="Holling01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter01"/&gt; Long-term ecological studies provide important track records to better understand the complexity and resilience of ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales. These studies are managed by the International Long Term Ecological Network (LTER).&lt;ref name="urlWelcome to ILTER — ILTER"/&gt; The longest experiment in existence is the [[Park Grass Experiment]], which was initiated in 1856.&lt;ref name="Siverton06"/&gt; Another example is the [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest|Hubbard Brook study]], which has been in operation since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbardbrook.org/ |title=Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study Front Page |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324131250/http://www.hubbardbrook.org/ |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holism ===
{{Main|Holism}}

Holism remains a critical part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary ecological studies. Holism addresses the [[Biological organisation|biological organization]] of life that [[Systems biology|self-organizes]] into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to non-reducible properties. This means that higher order patterns of a whole functional system, such as an [[ecosystem]], cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts.&lt;ref name="Liu09"/&gt; "New properties emerge because the components interact, not because the basic nature of the components is changed."&lt;ref name="Odum05"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Ecological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to [[reductionistic]].&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikkelson10"/&gt; Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without reference to the whole system, which leads to 3) a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from [[mysticism]] that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the [[biomolecular]] properties of the exterior shells.&lt;ref name="Wilson88"/&gt;

== Relation to evolution ==
{{main|Evolutionary ecology}}

Ecology and evolutionary biology are considered sister disciplines of the life sciences. [[Natural selection]], [[Biological life cycle|life history]], [[Developmental biology|development]], [[adaptation]], [[populations]], and [[heredity|inheritance]] are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and evolutionary theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the historical development of a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as [[phylogenetics]] or the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system of taxonomy]].&lt;ref name="Miles93"/&gt; The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal ''[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]]''.&lt;ref name="TREE"&gt;{{cite web | editor-last=Craze | editor-first=P. | title=Trends in Ecology and Evolution | publisher=Cell Press, Elsevier, Inc | url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/home | date=2 August 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724103422/http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/home | archivedate=24 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization.&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock03" /&gt; While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes,&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt; and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Yoshida | first=T | title=Rapid evolution drives ecological dynamics in a predator–prey system | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6946/abs/nature01767.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015001148/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6946/abs/nature01767.html | archivedate=15 October 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioural ecology ===
{{Main|Behavioural ecology}}

[[File:Chameleon spectra.jpg|left|upright=1.45|thumb|Social display and colour variation in differently adapted species of [[chameleons]] (''Bradypodion'' spp.). Chameleons change their skin colour to match their background as a behavioural defence mechanism and also use colour to communicate with other members of their species, such as dominant (left) versus submissive (right) patterns shown in the three species (A-C) above.&lt;ref name="Stuart-Fox08"/&gt;]]

All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, including memory and communication.&lt;ref name="Karban08"/&gt; Behavioural ecology is the study of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology is the study of observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile [[sperm]] of plants, mobile [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]] swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by [[weevils]], the mating dance of a [[salamander]], or social gatherings of [[amoeba]].&lt;ref name="Tinbergen63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamner85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strassmann00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakurai85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson61"/&gt;

Adaptation is the central unifying concept in behavioural ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavecol.com/pages/society/welcome.html |title=Behavioral Ecology |publisher=International Society for Behavioral Ecology |accessdate=15 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410105207/http://www.behavecol.com/pages/society/welcome.html |archivedate=10 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited in much the same way that eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness.&lt;ref name="Gould82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson00"/&gt;

[[File:Common jassid nymphs and ants02.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Symbiosis:''' [[Leafhopper]]s (''Eurymela fenestrata'') are protected by [[meat ant|ants]] (''Iridomyrmex purpureus'') in a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship. The ants protect the leafhoppers from predators and in return the leafhoppers feeding on plants exude honeydew from their anus that provides energy and nutrients to tending ants.&lt;ref name="Eastwood04"/&gt;]]

Predator-prey interactions are an introductory concept into food-web studies as well as behavioural ecology.&lt;ref name="Ives04"/&gt; Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators, such as avoid, flee, or defend. Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency.&lt;ref name="Begon05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krebs93"/&gt; For example, "[t]he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk"&lt;ref name="Webb10"/&gt; or "[t]he optimal [[Escape distance|flight initiation distance]] occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk."&lt;ref name="Cooper10"/&gt;

Elaborate sexual [[display (zoology)|displays]] and posturing are encountered in the behavioural ecology of animals. The [[birds-of-paradise]], for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during [[courtship]]. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. The displays are driven by [[sexual selection]] as an advertisement of quality of traits among [[suitors]].&lt;ref name="Kodric-Brown84"/&gt;

=== Cognitive ecology ===

Cognitive ecology integrates theory and observations from [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[neurobiology]], primarily [[cognitive science]], in order to understand the effect that animal interaction with their habitat has on their cognitive systems and how those systems restrict behavior within an ecological and evolutionary framework.&lt;ref name=Palacios&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biology Research |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=95–99 |year=2003 |title=An "enactive" approach to integrative and comparative biology: Thoughts on the table |author=Adrian G Palacios, Francisco Bozinovic |url=http://www.bio.puc.cl/caseb/casebpdf/P,%20y%20Bozinovic1.pdf |doi=10.4067/S0716-97602003000100008 |pmid=12795209 |last2=Bozinovic |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623182048/http://www.bio.puc.cl/caseb/casebpdf/P,%20y%20Bozinovic1.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Until recently, however, cognitive scientists have not paid sufficient attention to the fundamental fact that cognitive traits evolved under particular natural settings.

=== Social ecology ===
{{main|Social ecology (academic field)}}

Social ecological behaviours are notable in the [[social insects]], [[slime moulds]], [[social spider]]s, [[human society]], and [[naked mole-rat]]s where [[eusocialism]] has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates&lt;ref name="Strassmann00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman95"/&gt; and evolve from kin and group selection. [[Kin selection]] explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s are most famously studied for this type of relationship because the male drones are [[Cloning|clones]] that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; In contrast, [[group selection]]ists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members survive better than groups with predominantly selfish members.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson07"/&gt;

=== Coevolution ===
{{main|Coevolution}}
[[File:Bombus 6867.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bumblebee]]s and the [[flower]]s they [[pollination|pollinate]] have coevolved so that both have become dependent on each other for survival.]]
[[File:Parasitismus.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Parasitism:''' A harvestman [[arachnid]] being parasitized by [[mite]]s. The harvestman is being consumed, while the mites benefit from traveling on and feeding off of their host.]]

Ecological interactions can be classified broadly into a [[host (biology)|host]] and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate.&lt;ref name="Page91"/&gt; Relationships [[Interspecific interaction|within a species]] that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called [[mutualisms]]. Examples of mutualism include [[fungus-growing ants]] employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the [[fig wasp]] and [[yucca moth]] pollination complex, [[lichen]]s with fungi and photosynthetic [[algae]], and [[coral]]s with photosynthetic algae.&lt;ref name="Herre99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert90"/&gt; If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called [[symbiosis]]. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with [[arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for [[nutrients|mineral nutrients]].&lt;ref name="Kiers06"/&gt;

Indirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart. For example, trees living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called [[commensalism]]; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strain | first1=B. R.|year=1985|title=Physiological and ecological controls on carbon sequestering in terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=219–232|doi=10.1007/BF02187200}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called [[parasitism]]. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or [[propagule]]s, denying the services of a beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast.&lt;ref name="Bronstein01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irwin10"/&gt; Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The [[Red Queen Hypothesis]], for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.&lt;ref name="Boucher82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="King09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=King | first1=K.

=== Biogeography ===
{{Main|Biogeography}}

Biogeography (an amalgamation of ''biology'' and ''geography'') is the comparative study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time.&lt;ref name="Parenti90"/&gt; The ''[[Journal of Biogeography]]'' was established in 1974.&lt;ref name="JBiog"&gt;{{cite web | title = Journal of Biogeography - Overview | publisher = Wiley | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2699/homepage/ProductInformation.html | accessdate = 16 March 2018 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130209095040/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2699/homepage/ProductInformation.html | archivedate = 9 February 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, [[Island biogeography|the theory of island biogeography]], published by the Robert MacArthur and [[Edward O. Wilson]] in 1967&lt;ref name="MacArthur67" /&gt; is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory.&lt;ref name="Wiens04"/&gt;

Biogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies.&lt;ref name="Parenti90" /&gt; Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as [[Animal migration|migration]] and [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]].&lt;ref name="Wiens04" /&gt; and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called [[Allopatric speciation|vicariance biogeography]] and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography.&lt;ref name="Morrone95"/&gt; There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Svennin08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Landhäusser09"/&gt;

==== r/K selection theory ====
{{Main|r/K selection theory}}

A population ecology concept is r/K selection theory,{{Cref2|D}} one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain [[Life history theory|life-history evolution]]. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to [[population densities|population density]]. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available [[Resource (biology)|resources]] for rapid population growth. These early phases of [[population growth]] experience ''density-independent'' forces of natural selection, which is called ''r''-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called ''K''-selection.&lt;ref name="Reznick02"/&gt;

In the ''r/K''-selection model, the first variable ''r'' is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size and the second variable ''K'' is the carrying capacity of a population.&lt;ref name="Begon05" /&gt; Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An ''r''-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of [[fecundity]] in ''r''-selected species. Many kinds of insects and [[invasive species]] exhibit ''r''-selected [[Phenotypic trait|characteristics]]. In contrast, a ''K''-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting ''K''-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.&lt;ref name="MacArthur67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pianka72"/&gt;

=== Molecular ecology ===
{{Main|Molecular ecology}}

The important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]]. The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication ''[[Molecular Ecology]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref name="MolEcol"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Molecular Ecology | editor-last=Rieseberg | editor-first= L. | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/(ISSN)1365-294X | journal = Molecular Ecology }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molecular ecology]] uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, [[John Avise]] also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, ''Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution''.&lt;ref name="Avise94"/&gt; Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and [[nematode]]s. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology.&lt;ref name="Avise94"/&gt; For example, molecular ecology revealed [[promiscuous]] sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in [[tree swallow]]s previously thought to be socially [[monogamous]].&lt;ref name="Obryan07"/&gt; In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called [[phylogeography]].&lt;ref name="Avise00"/&gt;

Ecology is as much a biological science as it is a human science.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; Human ecology is an [[interdisciplinary]] investigation into the ecology of our species. "Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bioecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three."&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gross04"/&gt;

The ecological complexities human beings are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the [[Anthropocene]]. The unique set of circumstances has generated the need for a new unifying science called [[coupled human and natural systems]] that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology.&lt;ref name="Liu09" /&gt; Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in [[social capital|social]]-[[natural capital]], which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from [[ecosystem services|ecosystem goods and services]]. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.&lt;ref name="Liu09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MEA05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="de Groot02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aguirre09"/&gt;

Ecology is an employed science of restoration, repairing disturbed sites through human intervention, in natural resource management, and in [[environmental impact assessment]]s. Edward O. Wilson predicted in 1992 that the 21st century "will be the era of restoration in ecology".&lt;ref name="Wilson92"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Wilson | first1=E.

Ecological science is used in the methods of sustainable harvesting, disease, and fire outbreak management, in fisheries stock management, for integrating land-use with protected areas and communities, and conservation in complex geo-political landscapes.&lt;ref name="Hammond09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grumbine94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slocombe93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Slocombe | first1=D.

== Relation to the environment ==
{{main|Natural environment}}

The environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes. It is dynamically interlinked, and contains [[Resource (biology)|resources]] for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason57"/&gt; Like ecology, the term environment has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of nature. Environment "includes the physical world, the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation."&lt;ref name="Kleese01"/&gt;{{Rp|62}} The physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation, including [[abiotic]] factors such as temperature, radiation, light, chemistry, [[climate]] and geology. The biotic environment includes genes, cells, organisms, members of the same species ([[conspecific]]s) and other species that share a habitat.&lt;ref name="Campbell06"/&gt;

The distinction between external and internal environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration of cause and effect between the environment and life. The laws of [[thermodynamics]], for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated [[materialism|material]] parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or ''holocoenotic'' system as it was once called. This is known as the [[dialectical]] approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or [[umwelt]]). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt;

=== Disturbance and resilience ===
{{Main|Resilience (ecology)}}

Ecosystems are regularly confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances over time and geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation.&lt;ref name="Hughes10"/&gt; Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods,&lt;ref name="Levin92"/&gt; and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity.&lt;ref name="Hughes10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holling73" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Folke04"/&gt; Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting as a kind of regenerative insurance.&lt;ref name="Folke04"/&gt;

=== Metabolism and the early atmosphere ===

{{quote box
| quote = Metabolism – the rate at which energy and material resources are taken up from the environment, transformed within an organism, and allocated to maintenance, growth and reproduction – is a fundamental physiological trait.

The Earth was formed approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Allègre95"/&gt; As it cooled and a crust and oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by [[hydrogen]] to one composed mostly of [[methane]] and [[ammonia]]. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into a mixture of [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of [[Redox|reducing and oxidizing]] gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.&lt;ref name="Wills01"/&gt;

[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|left|thumb|The [[leaf]] is the primary site of [[photosynthesis]] in most plants.]]

Throughout history, the Earth's atmosphere and [[biogeochemical cycles]] have been in a [[dynamic equilibrium]] with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability.&lt;ref name="Goldblatt06"/&gt; The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic [[methanogen]] microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane (4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). [[Anoxygenic photosynthesis]] reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting [[hydrogen sulfide]] into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + h''v'' → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2S). Early forms of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the ''[[Great Oxygenation Event|Great Oxidation]]'') did not begin until approximately 2.4–2.3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1&amp;nbsp;billion years prior.&lt;ref name="Goldblatt06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Catling05"/&gt;

=== Radiation: heat, temperature and light ===
{{Anchor|Sunlight}}&lt;!-- E.g. in [[Neritic zone]] --&gt;
The biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures. Heat is a form of energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and [[primary production]]. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of [[solar radiation]]. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of [[temperature]] greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of [[biodiversity]] and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. [[Poikilotherms]], for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, [[homeotherms]] regulate their internal body temperature by expending [[food energy|metabolic energy]].&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt;

There is a relationship between light, primary production, and ecological [[energy budget]]s. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of [[electromagnetic energy]] of different [[wavelength]]s. [[Radiant energy]] from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts as a catalyst for [[genetic mutation]].&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt; Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through [[photosynthesis]]. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] are [[autotrophs]]. Autotrophs — responsible for primary production — assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as [[potential energy]] in the form of biochemical [[Enthalpy|enthalpic]] bonds.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt;

=== Physical environments ===

==== Water ====
{{Main|Aquatic ecosystem}}
{{quote box
| quote = Wetland conditions such as shallow water, high plant productivity, and anaerobic substrates provide a suitable environment for important physical, biological, and chemical processes. Because of these processes, wetlands play a vital role in global nutrient and element cycles.
| source = Cronk &amp; Fennessy (2001)&lt;ref name="Cronk01" /&gt;{{Rp|29}}
| width = 25%
| align = right}}
Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] (an environment with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration below 2&amp;nbsp;mg/liter) and eventually completely [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] where [[anaerobic bacteria]] thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral composition]] of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles.&lt;ref name="Cronk01"/&gt; Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces ([[aerenchyma]]) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants ([[halophytes]]) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and [[osmoregulation|osmoregulating]] their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in [[Estuary|estuarine]], [[brackish]], or [[ocean]]ic environments. Anaerobic soil [[microorganism]]s in aquatic environments use [[nitrate]], [[Manganese|manganese ions]], [[ferric|ferric ions]], [[sulfate]], [[carbon dioxide]], and some [[organic compounds]]; other microorganisms are [[facultative anaerobes]] and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the [[Reduction potential|oxidation-reduction]] potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) by methanogenic bacteria.&lt;ref name="Cronk01"/&gt; The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form [[electrochemical gradient]]s that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.&lt;ref name="Evans99"/&gt;

==== Gravity ====

The shape and energy of the land is significantly affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale, the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of [[tectonic plates]] as well as influencing [[geomorphic]] processes such as [[orogeny]] and [[erosion]]. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth ([[gravitropism]]), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the [[biomechanics]] and size of animals.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt; Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves.&lt;ref name="Swenson08"/&gt; The [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular systems]] of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).&lt;ref name="Garnter10"/&gt;

==== Pressure ====

Climatic and [[osmotic pressure]] places [[physiological]] constraints on organisms, especially those that fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths.&lt;ref name="Neri" /&gt; These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt; For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen08"/&gt; [[Xylem|Water transportation]] by plants is another important [[ecophysiology|ecophysiological]] process affected by osmotic pressure gradients.&lt;ref name="Strook08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pockman95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimmermann02"/&gt; [[Fluid pressure|Water pressure]] in the depths of oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as [[whale]]s, [[dolphin|dolphins,]] and [[seal (animal)|seals]] are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences.&lt;ref name="Kastak98"/&gt; Differences between [[hagfish]] species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.&lt;ref name="Nishiguchi10"/&gt;

==== Wind and turbulence ====

[[File:Grassflowers.jpg|thumb|The architecture of the [[inflorescence]] in grasses is subject to the physical pressures of wind and shaped by the forces of natural selection facilitating wind-pollination ([[anemophily]]).&lt;ref name="Friedman04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harder09"/&gt;]]

[[Turbulent forces]] in air and water affect the environment and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global [[trade winds]]. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt; For example, wind running over the surface of a lake creates turbulence, mixing the [[water column]] and influencing the environmental profile to create [[thermally layered zones]], affecting how fish, algae, and other parts of the [[aquatic ecosystem]] are structured.&lt;ref name="Shimeta95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Etemad01"/&gt; Wind speed and turbulence also influence [[evapotranspiration rates]] and energy budgets in plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Cronk01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf96"/&gt; Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the [[westerlies]] come into contact with the [[coastal]] and interior mountains of western North America to produce a [[rain shadow]] on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called [[orographic lift]] and can cause precipitation.{{clarify|this sounds as if the rain would fall on the leeward side of the mountains, which can't be right|date=August 2012}} This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the [[xeric]] ecosystems (e.g., of the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]] in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.&lt;ref name="Daubenmire75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele05"/&gt;

{{multiple image

Plants convert carbon dioxide into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere. By approximately 350 million years ago (the end of the [[Devonian period]]), photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above 17%, which allowed combustion to occur.&lt;ref name="Lenton00"/&gt; Fire releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and converts fuel into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression.&lt;ref name="Lobert93"/&gt; While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time,&lt;ref name="Garren43"/&gt; [[Charles F. Cooper (ecologist)|Charles Cooper]] brought attention to the issue of forest fires in relation to the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Cooper60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper61"/&gt;

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native North Americans]] were among the first to influence fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials.&lt;ref name="Wagtendonk07"/&gt; Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment.&lt;ref name="Boerner82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goubitz03"/&gt; Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'') cannot [[germination|germinate]] until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called [[serotiny]].&lt;ref name="Neeman04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flematti04"/&gt; Fire plays a major role in the persistence and [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Holling73"/&gt;

==== Soils ====
{{main|Soil ecology}}

Soil is the living top layer of mineral and organic dirt that covers the surface of the planet. It is the chief organizing centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The [[decomposition]] of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing [[minerals]] and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the [[pedosphere]] where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the [[detritivore]]s that regulate soil formation.&lt;ref name="Coleman04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson09"/&gt; Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called [[bioturbation]]. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil [[microorganisms]] are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils.&lt;ref name="Phillips09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Phillips | first1=J.

==== Biogeochemistry and climate ====
{{Main|Biogeochemistry}}
{{See also|Nutrient cycle|Climate}}

Ecologists study and measure nutrient budgets to understand how these materials are regulated, flow, and [[recycling (ecological)|recycled]] through the environment.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt; This research has led to an understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements ([[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[sulfur]], and [[phosphorus]]; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.&lt;ref name="Falkowoski08"/&gt;

The ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between biodiversity and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year.&lt;ref name="Grace04"/&gt; There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic [[outgassing]], the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]].&lt;ref name="Pearson00"/&gt;

In the [[Oligocene]], from twenty-five to thirty-two million years ago, there was another significant restructuring of the global [[carbon cycle]] as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved in response to the drop in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations below 550 ppm.&lt;ref name="Pagani05"/&gt; The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, [[biodiversity loss]], agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of [[permafrost]] are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane in the context of the global carbon cycle, because methane is a [[greenhouse gas]] that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a 100-year time scale.&lt;ref name="Zhuan07"/&gt; Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref name="Liu09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Erwin09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Erwin | first1=D.

Ecology has a complex origin, due in large part to its interdisciplinary nature.&lt;ref name="Egerton01"/&gt; Ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] were among the first to record observations on natural history. However, they viewed life in terms of [[essentialism]], where species were conceptualized as static unchanging things while varieties were seen as aberrations of an [[Idealism|idealized type]]. This contrasts against the modern understanding of [[Theoretical ecology|ecological theory]] where varieties are viewed as the real phenomena of interest and having a role in the origins of adaptations by means of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benson00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sober80"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sober | first1=E. | title=Evolution, population thinking, and essentialism | journal=Philosophy of Science | volume=47 | issue=3 | pages=350–383 | jstor=186950 | doi=10.1086/288942| year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early conceptions of ecology, such as a balance and regulation in nature can be traced to [[Herodotus]] (died ''c''. 425 BC), who described one of the earliest accounts of [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] in his observation of "natural dentistry". Basking [[Nile crocodile]]s, he noted, would open their mouths to give [[sandpiper]]s safe access to pluck [[leech]]es out, giving nutrition to the sandpiper and oral hygiene for the crocodile.&lt;ref name="Egerton01" /&gt; Aristotle was an early influence on the philosophical development of ecology. He and his student [[Theophrastus]] made extensive observations on plant and animal migrations, biogeography, physiology, and on their behaviour, giving an early analogue to the modern concept of an ecological niche.&lt;ref name="Hughes85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes75"/&gt;

Ecological concepts such as food chains, population regulation, and productivity were first developed in the 1700s, through the published works of microscopist [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723) and botanist [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] (1688?–1732).&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; Biogeographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769–1859) was an early pioneer in ecological thinking and was among the first to recognize ecological gradients, where species are replaced or altered in form along [[environmental gradient]]s, such as a [[cline (biology)|cline]] forming along a rise in elevation. Humboldt drew inspiration from [[Isaac Newton]] as he developed a form of "terrestrial physics". In Newtonian fashion, he brought a scientific exactitude for measurement into natural history and even alluded to concepts that are the foundation of a modern ecological law on species-to-area relationships.&lt;ref name="Kingsland04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkins01"/&gt;  Natural historians, such as Humboldt, [[James Hutton]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (among others) laid the foundations of the modern ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="McIntosh85"&gt;{{cite book | last1=McIntosh | first1=R.

[[Ernst Haeckel]] indepedently introduced the term a year later, in his book ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen'' (1866). Haeckel was a zoologist, artist, writer, and later in life a professor of comparative anatomy.&lt;ref name="Stauffer57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friederichs58"/&gt;

Opinions differ on who was the founder of modern ecological theory. Some mark Haeckel's definition as the beginning;&lt;ref name="Hinchman07"/&gt; others say it was [[Eugenius Warming]] with the writing of [[Plantesamfund|Oecology of Plants: An Introduction to the Study of Plant Communities]] (1895),&lt;ref name="Goodland75"/&gt; or [[Carl Linnaeus]]' principles on the economy of nature that matured in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name="Egerton07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormandy78"/&gt; Linnaeus founded an early branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature.&lt;ref name="Egerton07"/&gt; His works influenced Charles Darwin, who adopted Linnaeus' phrase on the ''economy or polity of nature'' in ''[[The Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Stauffer57" /&gt; Linnaeus was the first to frame the [[balance of nature]] as a testable hypothesis. Haeckel, who admired Darwin's work, defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature, which has led some to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous.&lt;ref name="Kormandy78" /&gt;

[[File:Darwin EcoExperiment.JPG|thumb|The layout of the first ecological experiment, carried out in a grass garden at [[Woburn Abbey]] in 1816, was noted by Charles Darwin in ''The Origin of Species''. The experiment studied the performance of different mixtures of species planted in different kinds of soils.&lt;ref name="Hector02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinclair26" /&gt;]]

From Aristotle until Darwin, the natural world was predominantly considered static and unchanging. Prior to ''The Origin of Species'', there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment.&lt;ref name="Benson00"/&gt; An exception is the 1789 publication ''Natural History of Selborne'' by [[Gilbert White]] (1720–1793), considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology.&lt;ref name="May99"/&gt; While [[Charles Darwin]] is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution,&lt;ref name=Darwin/&gt; he was one of the founders of [[soil ecology]],&lt;ref name="Meysman06"/&gt; and he made note of the first ecological experiment in ''The Origin of Species''.&lt;ref name="Hector02"/&gt; Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="Acot97"/&gt;

=== Since 1900 ===
Modern ecology is a young science that first attracted substantial scientific attention toward the end of the 19th century (around the same time that evolutionary studies were gaining scientific interest). The scientist [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] may have first introduced the term "[[oekology]]" (which eventually morphed into [[home economics]]) in the U.S. as early 1892.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Caroline Louisa | title = The life of Ellen H. Richards | publisher = [[Whitcomb &amp; Barrows]] | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1912 | isbn = | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofellenhrich00huntrich }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, ecology transitioned from a more [[metaphysics|descriptive form]] of [[natural history]] to a more [[scientific method|analytical form]] of ''scientific natural history''.&lt;ref name="Kingsland04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McIntosh85" /&gt; [[Frederic Clements]] published the first American ecology book in 1905,&lt;ref name="Clements05"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Clements | first1=F.

Comp. | place=Lincoln, Neb. | year=1905 | isbn=0-405-10381-6 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRy-VJctJjcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Research+Methods+in+Ecology#v=onepage&amp;q=Research%20Methods%20in%20Ecology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting the idea of plant communities as a [[superorganism]]. This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of [[seral development]] that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by [[Henry Gleason]],&lt;ref name="Simberloff80"/&gt; who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates to the development of community associations.&lt;ref name="Gleason26"/&gt;

The Clementsian superorganism theory was an overextended application of an [[idealism|idealistic form]] of holism.&lt;ref name="Levins80"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levins |first1=R. |last2=Lewontin |first2=R. |title=Dialectics and reductionism in ecology |journal=Synthese |volume=43 |pages=47–78 |year=1980 |url=http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/comunidades/pdf/pdf%20curso%20posgrado%20Elena/Tema%201/LevinsLewontinSynthese1980.pdf |doi=10.1007/bf00413856 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510183920/http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/comunidades/pdf/pdf%20curso%20posgrado%20Elena/Tema%201/LevinsLewontinSynthese1980.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson88" /&gt; The term "holism" was coined in 1926 by [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]], a South African general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired by Clements' superorganism concept.&lt;ref name="Foster08"/&gt;{{Cref2|C}} Around the same time, [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book ''Animal Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Elton27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elton|first=C.

Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text.&lt;ref name="Allee32"/&gt; [[Alfred J. Lotka]] brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology.

In 1942, [[Raymond Lindeman]] wrote a landmark paper on the  [[Trophic dynamics#Trophic dynamics|trophic dynamics]] of ecology, which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for its theoretical emphasis. Trophic dynamics became the foundation for much of the work to follow on energy and material flow through ecosystems. [[Robert MacArthur]] advanced mathematical theory, predictions, and tests in ecology in the 1950s, which inspired a resurgent school of theoretical mathematical ecologists.&lt;ref name="McIntosh85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook77"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Cook | first1=R.

Ecology surged in popular and scientific interest during the 1960–1970s [[environmental movement]].

In 1962, marine biologist and ecologist [[Rachel Carson]]'s book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' helped to mobilize the environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic [[pesticide]]s, such as [[DDT]], [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulating]] in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and [[ecosystem health]].

'''Ernest''' ({{lang-de|Ernst}}, 1027 – 10 June 1075), known as '''Ernest the Brave''' (''Ernst der Tapfere''), was the [[Margrave]] of [[March of Austria|Austria]] from 1055 to his death in 1075. He was a member of the [[House of Babenberg]].&lt;ref name=""&gt;Lingelbach 1913, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born to Margrave [[Adalbert, Margrave of Austria|Adalbert of Austria]] and his wife [[Frozza Orseolo]], daughter of Doge [[Otto Orseolo]] of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. He increased the territory of his margraviate by amalgamating the [[Bohemia]]n and [[Hungarian March|Hungarian]] frontier [[March (territory)|marches]] up to the [[Thaya]], [[Morava (river)|March]] and [[Leitha]] rivers in what is today [[Lower Austria]]. In his time, the colonisation of the remote ''[[Waldviertel]]'' region was begun by his [[ministeriales]], the [[Burgschleinitz-Kühnring|Kuenring]] knights. 

Ernest received his [[epithet]] due to his fighting against King [[Béla I of Hungary]] and his son [[Géza I of Hungary|Géza I]] on behalf of their rival [[Solomon, King of Hungary|Solomon]] according to the chronicler [[Lambert of Hersfeld]]. In the commencing [[Investiture Controversy]], he sided with King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Germany]] and battled against the [[Saxon Rebellion|Saxons]], dying at the [[Battle of Langensalza (1075)|Battle of Langensalza]].

==Marriage and children==
In 1060 Ernest married [[Adelaide of Eilenburg]] (1040 – 26 January 1071), daughter of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margrave [[Dedi I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Dedi I]] of [[March of Lusatia|Lusatia]], who gave him three children:
*[[Leopold II, Margrave of Austria]] (1050 – 1095)
*Justitia (d. 1120/22), married Count Otto II of [[Counts of Andechs|Wolfratshausen]]
*Adalbert of [[Pernegg]], Count of [[Bogen, Germany|Bogen]]
In 1072 he secondly married [[Swanhilde of Ungarnmark|Swanhild]], daughter of Count Sighard VII in the Hungarian March.

In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''expert system''' is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.&lt;ref name="Jackson1998"&gt;{{Citation |title= Introduction To Expert Systems |year= 1998 |publisher= Addison Wesley |edition= 3 |last= Jackson |first= Peter |isbn= 978-0-201-87686-4 |page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by [[automated reasoning|reasoning]] through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as [[Rule-based system|if–then rules]] rather than through conventional [[Procedural programming|procedural code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=conventional+programming&amp;i=40325,00.asp |title=Conventional programming |publisher=Pcmag.com |access-date=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="durkinhistory"&gt;{{cite book |first= Cornelius T. |last= Leondes |title= Expert systems: the technology of knowledge management and decision making for the 21st century |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-12-443880-4 |pages= 1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) software.&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Schuster"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|date=1995|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-13-103805-2|pages=22–23|url=http://stpk.cs.rtu.lv/sites/all/files/stpk/materiali/MI/Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach.pdf|access-date=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=227–331}}{{sfn|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 17.4}}{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=327–335, 434–435}}{{sfn|Crevier|1993|pp=145–62, 197−203}} However, some experts point out that expert systems were not part of true [[artificial intelligence]] since they lack the ability to learn autonomously from external data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas and Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land? On the Interpretations, Illustrations and Implications of Artificial Intelligence, Business Horizons, 62(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the [[inference engine]] and the [[knowledge base]]. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrmars.com/admin/pics/261.pdf Nwigbo Stella and Agbo Okechuku Chuks], School of Science Education, Expert system: a catalyst in educational development in Nigeria: "''Knowledge-based systems collect the small fragments of human know-how into a knowledge-base which is used to reason through a problem, using the knowledge that is appropriated''"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Expert systems were introduced around 1965&lt;ref&gt;[http://biology.kenyon.edu/slonc/bio3/AI/TIMELINE/timeline.html kenyon.edu: AI Timeline], retrieved October 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by [[Edward Feigenbaum]], who is sometimes termed the "father of expert systems"; other key early contributors were Bruce Buchanan and Randall Davis. The Stanford researchers tried to identify domains where expertise was highly valued and complex, such as diagnosing infectious diseases ([[Mycin]]) and identifying unknown organic molecules ([[Dendral]]). The idea that "intelligent systems derive their power from the knowledge they possess rather than from the specific formalisms and inference schemes they use"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Feigenbaum, 1977. Paraphrased by Hayes-Roth, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; – as Feigenbaum said – was at the time a significant step forward, since the past research had been focused on heuristic computational methods, culminating in attempts to develop very general-purpose problem solvers (foremostly the conjunct work of [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert_A._Simon|Herbert Simon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|pages=6–7|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expert systems became some of the first truly successful forms of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) software.&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Schuster"/&gt;{{sfn|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=227–331}}{{sfn|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 17.4}}{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=327–335, 434–435}}{{sfn|Crevier|1993|pp=145–62, 197−203}}

Research on expert systems was also active in France. While in the US the focus tended to be on rule-based systems, first on systems hard coded on top of [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] programming environments and then on expert system shells developed by vendors such as [[IntelliCorp (software)|Intellicorp]], in France research focused more on systems developed in [[Prolog]]. The advantage of expert system shells was that they were somewhat easier for nonprogrammers to use.  The advantage of Prolog environments was that they weren't focused only on ''if-then'' rules; Prolog environments provided a much fuller realization of a complete [[First Order Logic]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Luger and William A. Stubblefield, Benjamin/Cummings Publishers, Rule Based Expert System Shell: example of code using the Prolog rule based expert system shell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://promethee.philo.ulg.ac.be/engdep1/download/prolog/htm_docs/prolog.htm A. Michiels], Université de Liège, Belgique: "PROLOG, the first declarative language&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, expert systems proliferated.  Universities offered expert system courses and two thirds of the [[Fortune 500]] companies applied the technology in daily business activities.&lt;ref name=durkinhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durkin, J. Expert Systems: Catalog of Applications. Intelligent Computer Systems, Inc., Akron, OH, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was international with the [[Fifth generation computer|Fifth Generation Computer Systems project]] in Japan and increased research funding in Europe.

In 1981, the first [[IBM PC]], with the [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] operating system, was introduced. The imbalance between the high affordability of the relatively powerful chips in the PC, compared to the much more expensive cost of processing power in the mainframes that dominated the corporate IT world at the time, created a new type of architecture for corporate computing, termed the [[client-server model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfali|first=Robert|title=The Essential Client/Server Survival Guide|year=1996|publisher=Wiley Computer Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-471-15325-7|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calculations and reasoning could be performed at a fraction of the price of a mainframe using a PC. This model also enabled business units to bypass corporate IT departments and directly build their own applications. As a result, client server had a tremendous impact on the expert systems market. Expert systems were already outliers in much of the business world, requiring new skills that many IT departments did not have and were not eager to develop. They were a natural fit for new PC-based shells that promised to put application development into the hands of end users and experts. Until then, the main development environment for expert systems had been high end [[Lisp machine]]s from [[Xerox]], [[Symbolics]], and [[Texas Instruments]]. With the rise of the PC and client server computing, vendors such as Intellicorp and Inference Corporation shifted their priorities to developing PC based tools. Also, new vendors, often financed by [[venture capital]] (such as Aion Corporation, [[Neuron Data]], Exsys, and many others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurwitz|first=Judith|title=Smart or Lucky: How Technology Leaders Turn Chance into Success|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son|isbn=1118033787|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3KrTQzQHl7AC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=expert+systems+failed+to+live+up+to+hype#v=onepage&amp;q=expert%20systems%20failed%20to%20live%20up%20to%20hype&amp;f=false|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert J. |last=Dunn |date=September 30, 1985 |title=Expandable Expertise for Everyday Users |page=30 |journal=InfoWorld |volume=7 |issue=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iS8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |access-date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;), started appearing regularly.

The first expert system to be used in a design capacity for a large-scale product was the SID (Synthesis of Integral Design) software program, developed in 1982. Written in [[LISP]], SID generated 93% of the [[VAX 9000]] CPU logic gates.&lt;ref name="SIDDTJ"&gt;Carl S. Gibson, et al, VAX 9000 SERIES, Digital Technical Journal of Digital Equipment Corporation, Volume 2, Number 4, Fall 1990, pp118-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Input to the software was a set of rules created by several expert logic designers. SID expanded the rules and generated software [[logic synthesis]] routines many times the size of the rules themselves. Surprisingly, the combination of these rules resulted in an overall design that exceeded the capabilities of the experts themselves, and in many cases out-performed the human counterparts.  While some rules contradicted others, top-level control parameters for speed and area provided the tie-breaker. The program was highly controversial, but used nevertheless due to project budget constraints. It was terminated by logic designers after the VAX 9000 project completion.

In the 1990s and beyond, the term ''expert system'' and the idea of a standalone AI system mostly dropped from the IT lexicon. There are two interpretations of this. One is that "expert systems failed": the IT world moved on because expert systems didn't deliver on their over hyped promise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0501.htm#w AI Expert Newsletter: W is for Winter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejlt.org//article/view/14/1 Leith P., "The rise and fall of the legal expert system", in European Journal of Law and Technology, Vol 1, Issue 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The other is the mirror opposite, that expert systems were simply victims of their success: as IT professionals grasped concepts such as rule engines, such tools migrated from being standalone tools for developing special purpose ''expert'' systems, to being one of many standard tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haskin|first=David|title=Years After Hype, 'Expert Systems' Paying Off For Some|journal=Datamation|date=January 16, 2003|url=http://www.datamation.com/netsys/article.php/1570851/Years-After-Hype-Expert-Systems-Paying-Off-For-Some.htm|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the leading major business application suite vendors (such as [[SAP (software)|SAP]], [[Siebel Systems|Siebel]], and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) integrated expert system abilities into their suite of products as a way of specifying business logic – rule engines are no longer simply for defining the rules an expert would use but for any type of complex, volatile, and critical business logic; they often go hand in hand with business process automation and integration environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SAP News Desk|title=SAP News Desk IntelliCorp Announces Participation in SAP EcoHub|url=http://laszlo.sys-con.com/node/946452|work=laszlo.sys-con.com |publisher=LaszloTrack|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pegasystems|title=Smart BPM Requires Smart Business Rules|url=http://www.pega.com/business-rules |work=pega.com|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Zhao |first=Kai |first2=Shi |last2=Ying |first3=Linlin |last3=Zhang |first4=Luokai |last4=Hu |title=Achieving business process and business rules integration using SPL |book-title=Future Information Technology and Management Engineering (FITME) |date=9–10 Oct 2010 |volume=2 |pages=329–332 |location=Changzhou, China |publisher=IEEE |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5656297&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5656297 |doi=10.1109/fitme.2010.5656297 |isbn=978-1-4244-9087-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software architecture ==
An expert system is an example of a [[knowledge-based system]]. Expert systems were the first commercial systems to use a knowledge-based architecture. A knowledge-based system is essentially composed of two sub-systems: the [[knowledge base]] and the [[inference engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Reid |title=Knowledge-Based Systems Concepts, Techniques, Examples |url=http://www.reidgsmith.com/Knowledge-Based_Systems_-_Concepts_Techniques_Examples_08-May-1985.pdf |website=Reid G. Smith |access-date=9 November 2013|date=May 8, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge base represents facts about the world. In early expert systems such as Mycin and Dendral, these facts were represented mainly as flat assertions about variables. In later expert systems developed with commercial shells, the knowledge base took on more structure and used concepts from object-oriented programming. The world was represented as classes, subclasses, and instances and assertions were replaced by values of object instances. The rules worked by querying and asserting values of the objects.

The inference engine is an [[automated reasoning system]] that evaluates the current state of the knowledge-base, applies relevant rules, and then asserts new knowledge into the knowledge base. The inference engine may also include abilities for explanation, so that it can explain to a user the chain of reasoning used to arrive at a particular conclusion by tracing back over the firing of rules that resulted in the assertion.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth 1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are mainly two modes for an inference engine: [[forward chaining]] and [[backward chaining]]. The different approaches are dictated by whether the inference engine is being driven by the antecedent (left hand side) or the consequent (right hand side) of the rule. In forward chaining an antecedent fires and asserts the consequent. For example, consider the following rule:

&lt;math&gt;R1: \mathit{Man}(x) \implies \mathit{Mortal}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

A simple example of forward chaining would be to assert Man(Socrates) to the system and then trigger the inference engine. It would match R1 and assert Mortal(Socrates) into the knowledge base.

Backward chaining is a bit less straight forward. In backward chaining the system looks at possible conclusions and works backward to see if they might be true. So if the system was trying to determine if Mortal(Socrates) is true it would find R1 and query the knowledge base to see if Man(Socrates) is true. One of the early innovations of expert systems shells was to integrate inference engines with a user interface. This could be especially powerful with backward chaining. If the system needs to know a particular fact but doesn't, then it can simply generate an input screen and ask the user if the information is known. So in this example, it could use R1 to ask the user if Socrates was a Man and then use that new information accordingly.

The use of rules to explicitly represent knowledge also enabled explanation abilities. In the simple example above if the system had used R1 to assert that Socrates was Mortal and a user wished to understand why Socrates was mortal they could query the system and the system would look back at the rules which fired to cause the assertion and present those rules to the user as an explanation. In English if the user asked "Why is Socrates Mortal?" the system would reply "Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man".  A significant area for research was the generation of explanations from the knowledge base in natural English rather than simply by showing the more formal but less intuitive rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccis2k.org/iajit/PDF/vol.4,no.1/9-Nabil.pdf Nabil Arman], Polytechnic University of Palestine, January 2007, Fault Detection in Dynamic Rule Bases Using Spanning Trees and Disjoin Sets: ""&lt;/ref&gt;

As expert systems evolved, many new techniques were incorporated into various types of inference engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mettrey|first=William|title=An Assessment of Tools for Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems|journal=AI Magazine|year=1987|volume= 8 |issue= 4|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most important of these were:

* Truth maintenance. These systems record the dependencies in a knowledge-base so that when facts are altered, dependent knowledge can be altered accordingly. For example, if the system learns that Socrates is no longer known to be a man it will revoke the assertion that Socrates is mortal.
* Hypothetical reasoning. In this, the knowledge base can be divided up into many possible views, a.k.a. worlds. This allows the inference engine to explore multiple possibilities in parallel. For example, the system may want to explore the consequences of both assertions, what will be true if Socrates is a Man and what will be true if he is not?
* Fuzzy logic. One of the first extensions of simply using rules to represent knowledge was also to associate a probability with each rule. So, not to assert that Socrates is mortal, but to assert Socrates ''may'' be mortal with some probability value. Simple probabilities were extended in some systems with sophisticated mechanisms for uncertain reasoning and combination of probabilities.
* Ontology classification. With the addition of object classes to the knowledge base, a new type of reasoning was possible. Along with reasoning simply about object values, the system could also reason about object structures. In this simple example, Man can represent an object class and R1 can be redefined as a rule that defines the class of all men.  These types of special purpose inference engines are termed [[Deductive classifier|classifiers]]. Although they were not highly used in expert systems, classifiers are very powerful for unstructured volatile domains, and are a key technology for the Internet and the emerging [[Semantic Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|access-date=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|first2=James|last2=Hendler|first3=Ora|last3=Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34–43|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages  ==
The goal of knowledge-based systems is to make the critical information required for the system to work explicit rather than implicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|page=6|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a traditional computer program the logic is embedded in code that can typically only be reviewed by an IT specialist. With an expert system the goal was to specify the rules in a format that was intuitive and easily understood, reviewed, and even edited by domain experts rather than IT experts. The benefits of this explicit knowledge representation were rapid development and ease of maintenance.

Ease of maintenance is the most obvious benefit. This was achieved in two ways. First, by removing the need to write conventional code, many of the normal problems that can be caused by even small changes to a system could be avoided with expert systems.  Essentially, the logical flow of the program (at least at the highest level) was simply a given for the system, simply invoke the inference engine. This also was a reason for the second benefit: [[rapid prototyping]]. With an expert system shell it was possible to enter a few rules and have a prototype developed in days rather than the months or year typically associated with complex IT projects.

A claim for expert system shells that was often made was that they removed the need for trained programmers and that experts could develop systems themselves. In reality, this was seldom if ever true. While the rules for an expert system were more comprehensible than typical computer code, they still had a formal syntax where a misplaced comma or other character could cause havoc as with any other computer language. Also, as expert systems moved from prototypes in the lab to deployment in the business world, issues of integration and maintenance became far more critical. Inevitably demands to integrate with, and take advantage of, large legacy databases and systems arose. To accomplish this, integration required the same skills as any other type of system.&lt;ref name="Wong 1995 141–152"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Bo K.|first2=John A.|last3=Monaco|title=Expert system applications in business: a review and analysis of the literature|journal=Information and Management|date=September 1995|volume=29|issue=3|pages=141–152|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218565&amp;CFID=383824649&amp;CFTOKEN=44575196|access-date=29 November 2013|doi=10.1016/0378-7206(95)00023-p|last2=Monaco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
The most common disadvantage cited for expert systems in the academic literature is the [[knowledge acquisition]] problem. Obtaining the time of domain experts for any software application is always difficult, but for expert systems it was especially difficult because the experts were by definition highly valued and in constant demand by the organization. As a result of this problem, a great deal of research in the later years of expert systems was focused on tools for knowledge acquisition, to help automate the process of designing, debugging, and maintaining rules defined by experts. However, when looking at the life-cycle of expert systems in actual use, other problems – essentially the same problems as those of any other large system – seem at least as critical as knowledge acquisition: integration, access to large databases, and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Performance could be especially problematic because early expert systems were built using tools (such as earlier Lisp versions) that interpreted code expressions without first compiling them. This provided a powerful development environment, but with the drawback that it was virtually impossible to match the efficiency of the fastest compiled languages (such as [[C (programming language)|C]]). System and database integration were difficult for early expert systems because the tools were mostly in languages and platforms that were neither familiar to nor welcome in most corporate IT environments – programming languages such as Lisp and Prolog, and hardware platforms such as [[Lisp machine]]s and personal computers. As a result, much effort in the later stages of expert system tool development was focused on integrating with legacy environments such as [[COBOL]] and large database systems, and on porting to more standard platforms. These issues were resolved mainly by the client-server paradigm shift, as PCs were gradually accepted in the IT environment as a legitimate platform for serious business system development and as affordable [[minicomputer]] servers provided the processing power needed for AI applications.&lt;ref name="Wong 1995 141–152"/&gt;

== Applications ==
Hayes-Roth divides expert systems applications into 10 categories illustrated in the following table. The example applications were not in the original Hayes-Roth table, and some of them arose well afterward. Any application that is not footnoted is described in the Hayes-Roth book.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth 1983"/&gt; Also, while these categories provide an intuitive framework to describe the space of expert systems applications, they are not rigid categories, and in some cases an application may show traits of more than one category.

Hearsay was an early attempt at solving voice recognition through an expert systems approach. For the most part this category or expert systems was not all that successful. Hearsay and all interpretation systems are essentially pattern recognition systems—looking for patterns in noisy data. In the case of Hearsay recognizing phonemes in an audio stream. Other early examples were analyzing sonar data to detect Russian submarines. These kinds of systems proved much more amenable to a [[artificial neural network|neural network]] AI solution than a rule-based approach.

CADUCEUS and [[MYCIN]] were medical diagnosis systems. The user describes their symptoms to the computer as they would to a doctor and the computer returns a medical diagnosis.

Dendral was a tool to study hypothesis formation in the identification of organic molecules. The general problem it solved—designing a solution given a set of constraints—was one of the most successful areas for early expert systems applied to business domains such as salespeople configuring [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[VAX]] computers and mortgage loan application development.

Mistral &lt;ref name="Mistral"/&gt; is an expert system to monitor dam safety, developed in the 90's by Ismes (Italy).

==Early life and career==
Fiona Stewart was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 1966. She was educated at [[Lauriston Girls' School]].&lt;ref name="school"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2005/03/30/famous-alumni-on-lathams-hit-list/ |title=Lathams Alumni Hit List|accessdate=2015-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her BA from [[Monash University]] in 1987 followed by a Graduate Diploma in Public Policy ([[Melbourne University]]) in 1992, Master of Policy and Law ([[La Trobe University]]) in 1994 and her [[Ph.D.]] in [[health sciences]] from Latrobe in 1998.  She graduated from [[Charles Darwin University]] Law School in 2015. From 1997 to 1999 Stewart held a postdoctoral fellowship at [[Deakin University]] for the study of ''‘Womens Lives: Choice, Change and Identity’''.&lt;ref name="deakin"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-47721379/simone-de-beauvoir-and-generations-of-feminists |title=Simone De Beauvoir and Generations of Feminists |accessdate=2015-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When her contract was not renewed, she turned to writing opinion columns for the media on [[Generation X]] and [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="genx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/20/1071868698281.html |title=Generation Xcluded |accessdate=2015-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Folklore''''' {{efn|{{nihongo|FolksSoul -失われた伝承-|FōkusuSōru -Ushinawareta Denshō-}} in Japanese}} is a 2007 [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Game Republic]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]. The game is set in Ireland and the [[Celtic Otherworld]] of [[Irish mythology]], centering on a young woman named Ellen, and a journalist named Keats, both playable characters who together unravel the mystery that the quaint village of [[Doolin]] hides, the mystery that can only be solved by seeking the memories of the dead in the dangerous, Folk-ridden Netherworld.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Folklore Screen.jpg|left|thumb|Ellen utilizing "folk" in combat]]

Folklore is an [[action role-playing game]], where players control characters in a [[Virtual camera system|third-person]] view to both explore their surroundings and engage in combat. From the start, players will have a choice to play the game as either of the two lead protagonists, the young woman Ellen or the journalist Keats, both having different yet intertwining plots and play styles. The game is split into two worlds, the real world set in small sea-side Irish village of [[Doolin]] and the more fantastical Netherworld inhabited by folk creatures and spirits.

In Doolin, players lead their chosen character throughout the village and surrounding area. When in this state, characters are unable to engage in combat or utilize their abilities and instead will be limited to exploring the village’s locations and interacting with its inhabitants, containing multiple search and slight puzzle-esque quests that progress the main story and eventually lead them to and from the Netherworld, acting as a hub between worlds and subsequent quests.

When characters pass into the Netherworld, the gameplay shifts entirely towards the action-adventure side of its genre. Basic attack techniques are performed by utilizing "folk", various creatures and spirits that upon defeat can be absorbed for the player’s use. When a folk is nearly defeated, its spirit will glow red, allowing players to absorb it by locking onto it and performing shaking and yanking motions with the [[Sixaxis]] motion control (rather than a conventional button interface) to reel in its energy for use. While the player can choose from nearly all folk encountered and absorbed, only four at a time can be mapped to the controller’s main four interface/action buttons and used in quick succession for combat with different kinds of folk being better suited for certain situations and techniques such as close-combat, projectile attacks or magic. The two playable characters themselves also differ between play styles. While Ellen uses a variety of folk as basic strategy and favoring a defensive stance with the ability to cloak herself with folk powers, Keats uses more straight up brute force attacks with usually all round stronger folk along with the ability to release built up energy to become invincible and perform stronger attacks for a period of time.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the present day. A young university student by the name of Ellen ([[Lisa Hogg]]) is lured to the sea-side village of Doolin, in Ireland, led by a letter from her supposedly dead mother, telling her to meet her at the Cliff of Sidhe, Doolin. Meanwhile Keats ([[Richard Coyle]]), a journalist from an occult magazine called ''Unknown Realms'', receives a telephone call from a woman in distress telling him to come to Doolin, and crying about Faerys who would kill her. Though he suspects it is a prank call, he pays a visit to Doolin Village.

When Ellen arrives at the Cliff of Sidhe, she sees a cloaked figure resting at the edge. Thinking it is her mother, she calls out to the figure, but it does not reply. Keats arrives on the scene then, and asks Ellen if she was the one who called him. When she, surprised, says no, he wonders aloud if the figure at the cliff was the one who called him.

A strong gust of wind suddenly blows across the cliff, and when it dies down, the figure has disappeared. Ellen, distraught, runs down to the beach to find the body and bumps into a girl from the village named Suzette. She questions Ellen, but she is so distressed that she faints. Keats arrives and, after questioning Suzette about Ellen, decides that the best thing would be to bring Ellen back into the village.

Suzette brings Ellen to a small hut and Keats to a base on the edge of the village. That night, they are both visited by strange voices who invite them to the village pub, where they meet creatures they had never before thought existed, and are taken to a place that surpasses all imagination: the Netherworld, realm of the dead. Soon Keats and Ellen find themselves in a 17-year-old murder mystery, where the answers seem to only be found in the Netherworld, the land that can only be accessed from one place in the world, Doolin. To solve the crime and reveal Ellen's forgotten past, they will need to venture to the Netherworld as travelers, where Faerys and Folks alike await them.

Along the way they meet a variety of different characters, like Scarecrow and Belgae, who help out both of them in their quest. Throughout the game, players learn about the chaos the Netherworld was put into by a previous Netherworld traveller. The eventual goal is to reach the core of the Netherworld and "fix" it. The game takes two different perspectives in the story that shows the different views and opinions of many different characters. While traveling in the Netherworld, many mysterious murders start to occur in the village of Doolin after the appearance of "The Hag." The people murdered are the only ones who knew the truth (or part of the truth) of Ellen's past.

==Development==
''Folklore'' was announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2006 which was said to be "The next generation of dark fantasy." It was to be developed by [[Game Republic]], under [[Yoshiki Okamoto]], a video game designer who worked on popular games, including ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. The game was originally titled ''Monster Kingdom: Unknown Realms'', and was intended as a companion piece to [[Gaia (game company)|Gaia]]'s ''[[Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner]]''. However, disappointing sales of ''Jewel Summoner'' led to the game being retitled ''Folklore''. Gaia however would assist the development of Folklore, contributing monster designs. Numerous creatures appearing in ''Folklore'' would later appear in Gaia's [[PlayStation Portable]] game ''[[Coded Soul: Uketsugareshi Idea]]'' the following year, which also featured connectivity with ''Folklore''.

A playable demo was first released on the Japanese [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN) on May 30, 2007. The demo features the two playable characters Keats and Ellen, with the ability to choose from either of them. The demo includes a series of short comic-style cutscenes, exploration of a sea-side village and a trek through a series of playable areas where a player is introduced to the gameplay basics (i.e. fighting, how to acquire new Ids, etc.). This demo was all in Japanese aside from the lines in English that both protagonists would occasionally exclaim during combat.

An English speech demonstration was released on the European PSN on August 22, 2007; as a limited time offering, it was removed from the [[PlayStation Store]] on August 31. This demo was released to the North American PSN on August 23, 2007. An English/Traditional Chinese speech version demo was released on the Asian PSN on September 4, 2007. The original Japanese demo was released in English version on European and US PlayStation Network Stores.

Upon release, ''Folklore'' received "favorable" reviews according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of three eights and a nine, for a total of 33 out of 40.&lt;ref name="Famitsu score"/&gt;

Most of the praise the game received was direct at the art design and a rich fairy tale/mythological setting and style. Ryan Clements of [[IGN]] was particularly impressed with the game’s style over the actual technical graphics engine, noting that "''Folklore'''s sheer visual beauty comes more from the stellar art direction and execution of the artistic design than the amount of processing power it requires,” helped further by the soundtrack described as "poignant and intrinsically atmospheric."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; This view was further echoed by Gaming Target, summing up with "technically the game looks great, with the realistic style of Doolin, mixed in with the colorful and absurdly Japanese stylings of the Netherworld levels," later including ''Folklore'' in their "52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GT staff |date=December 31, 2007 |url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=8069 |title=52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007 |publisher=Gaming Target |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle system where players would catch and utilize various "folk" was considered another positive aspect. [[GameSpy]] found that "what makes the enormous library of monsters and moves work so well is that each is most useful in a particular situation"&lt;ref name="GameSpy review"/&gt; and while [[GameTrailers]] also praised the feature finding that "switching folk in and out of your arsenal is easy thanks to well-organized menus," it also criticized brief loading times between shifting in and out of the menus that "puts a damper on the game’s flow."&lt;ref name="GameTrailers review"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]] on the other hand felt that the basic level design was "pretty standard dungeon crawling," if not "bland" at times. The use of the SIXAXIS motion control to reel in energy from downed folk was considered a better use of the feature compared to past games, with [[1UP.com]] calling it "the most subtle and sensible use of the PS3's motion control yet."&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barnholt |first=Ray |date=October 9, 2007 |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/folklore |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604003110/http://www.1up.com/reviews/folklore |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |title=Folklore |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the narrative was considered a strong point, with GameZone calling it "compelling," the method of telling much of the story in graphic-novel style still cutscenes however received a less than positive response.&lt;ref name="GameZone review"/&gt; Kevin VanOrd of [[GameSpot]] felt that while "an interesting design choice" is, in the end "weirdly flavorless."&lt;ref name="Gamespot review"/&gt; Another issue found in this method was the lack of voice-work outside of the full CGI cutscenes with [[GamesRadar]] (in-house) finding it to hinder the delivery of the overall story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesradar.com/us/ps3/game/reviews/article.jsp?articleId=2007092517183422088&amp;sectionId=1000&amp;pageId=20070925171854786003]{{Dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancelled sequel===
The now-defunct Game Republic was planning a [[PlayStation Portable]] or download only Move compatible ''Folklore'' sequel and had pitched the idea to Sony. The idea was well received by Sony but due to poor sales of the original ''Folklore'' were not keen to green light the project which failed to pass the internal review board at Sony by a few points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegamingliberty.com/index.php/2011/07/07/game-republic-were-planning-folklore-2-with-move-support |title=Game Republic were planning Folklore 2 with Move support |publisher=TheGamingLiberty.com |date=July 7, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716125923/http://thegamingliberty.com/index.php/2011/07/07/game-republic-were-planning-folklore-2-with-move-support |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Romero |first=Josh |date=January 5, 2009 |url=http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2009/01/05/folklore-2-and-brave-story-2-will-not-be-made-says-game-republic-founder.htm |title=Folklore 2 and Brave Story 2 will not be made, says Game Republic founder |publisher=Video Games Blogger |accessdate=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Morris plans to develop his views on the first-millennium BC transformations (the shift from religion-based power to bureaucratic and military one, and the rise of [[Axial age|Axial thought]]) in his new book.&lt;ref&gt;Note 24 to Chapter 5 in ''Foragers, Farmers, and Fossil Fuels''&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Why the West Rules—For Now''==
His 2010 book, ''[[Why the West Rules—For Now]]'', compares [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]] across the last 15,000 years, arguing that [[physical geography]], rather than culture, religion, politics, [[genetic history|genetics]], or [[great men theory|great men]], explains Western domination of the globe. ''[[The Economist]]'' has called it "an important book—one that challenges, stimulates and entertains. Anyone who does not believe there are lessons to be learned from history should start here."&lt;ref name="ll"&gt;{{cite news|title=On top of the world|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17199546?story_id=17199546&amp;fsrc=rss|accessdate=19 June 2017|work=The Economist|date=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book won several literary awards, including the 2011 [[PEN Center USA]] Literary Award for Creative Nonfiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcing the 2011 Literary Awards Festival Winners {{!}} PEN Center USA|url=http://penusa.org/2011-literary-awards-festival-winners|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=14 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714031530/http://penusa.org/2011-literary-awards-festival-winners|archivedate=14 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named as one of the books of the year by [[Newsweek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Smarter Reading - Newsweek|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/03/21-ways-to-be-smarter-in-2011/smarter-reading.html|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=19 January 2011|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119235437/http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/03/21-ways-to-be-smarter-in-2011/smarter-reading.html|archivedate=19 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foreign Affairs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Niall|title=Books for the World Ahead|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=2011|issue=November/December|page=7|url=http://ianmorris.org/docs/review-whythewest-foreignaffairs.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foreign Policy]],&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_global_thinkers_20_most_recommended_books?page=0,1  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120091014/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_global_thinkers_20_most_recommended_books?page=0%2C1 |date=20 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The New York Times]], and a number of other newspapers. It has been translated into 13 languages.

==''The Measure of Civilization''==
''[[The Measure of Civilization]]'' is a companion volume to ''Why the West Rules—For Now''. It provides details of the evidence and the statistical methods used by Morris to construct the social development index that he used in ''Why the West Rules'' to compare long-term Eastern and Western history. The [[International Studies Association]] and [[Social Science History Association]] devoted panels to discussing the book at their 2013 annual meetings. The book is being translated into Chinese.

==''War! What is it Good For?''==
''War!

For all of its horrors, over the last 10,000 years, war has made the world safer and richer, as it is virtually the only way that people have found to create large, internally pacified societies that then drive down the rate of violent death. The lesson of the last 10,000 years of military history, he argues, is that the way to end war is by learning to manage it, not by trying to wish it out of existence. Morris also devotes a chapter to the 1974-1978 [[Gombe Chimpanzee War]] in [[Tanzania]]. The German translation of the book, ''Krieg: Wozu er gut ist'', was published by Campus Verlag in October 2013. A Dutch translation was published in 2014 by Spectrum (Houten/Antwerp): ''Verwoesting en vooruitgang''. Five more translations are being prepared.

In [[United States patent law]], '''inequitable conduct''' is a breach of the applicant's duty of candor and good faith during [[patent prosecution]] or similar proceedings. A claim of inequitable conduct is a defense to allegations of [[patent infringement]]. Even in an instance when a valid patent suffers infringement, a court ruling on an allegation of infringement may exercise its power of [[Equity (law)|equitable discretion]] not to enforce the patent if the patentee (the patent owner) has engaged in inequitable conduct.

==Duty of candor==
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Rule 56 explains that patents are "affected with a public interest. The public interest is best served, and the most effective patent examination occurs when, at the time an application is being examined, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all information material to [[patentability]]."  Accordingly, each individual person "associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application has a '''duty of candor and [[good faith]]''' in dealing with the Office, which includes a '''duty to disclose''' to the Office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability."&lt;ref name="cfr156"&gt;[https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e319407 37 CFR § 1.56 (1977, revised 2012)], commonly referred to as Rule 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifics==
Inequitable conduct occurs when a patent applicant misrepresents or omits [[materiality (law)|material]] information with the specific [[intention|intent]] to [[deception|deceive]] the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]. In other words, the elements of inequitable conduct are materiality and deceptive intent. Deceptive intent may be inferred from indirect or circumstantial evidence but not from materiality.

Information is material if "the PTO would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior art" or if "affirmative egregious misconduct" has happened. See ''Therasense, Inc. v. Becton''.&lt;ref name="Therasense"&gt;[https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20110525163 Therasense, Inc. v. Becton], Dickinson and Co., 649 F.3d 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (en banc).&lt;/ref&gt; In response to ''Therasense,'' the USPTO rewrote its definition of materiality to say that information is material if
:(1) It establishes, by itself or in combination with other information, a ''[[prima facie]]'' case of [[patentability|unpatentability]] of a [[patent claim|claim]]; or 
:(2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant takes in:
::(i) Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office, or 
::(ii) Asserting an argument of patentability.&lt;ref name="cfr156" /&gt;

The misrepresentation or omission can include: 
:(a) failure to submit material [[prior art]] known by the applicant; 
:(b) failure to explain references in a foreign language or submit pre-existing full or partial translations of the references; 
:(c) misstatements of fact, including misstatements in [[affidavits]] concerning [[patentability]]; and 
:(d) mis-description of [[inventor (patent)|inventorship]] (authorship).

The party asking the court to decline to enforce the patent, usually the alleged [[patent infringement|infringer]], [[Legal burden of proof|bears the burden]] of proving inequitable conduct to the court. The moving party must show by [[clear and convincing evidence]] that the patentee intentionally withheld or [[Misrepresentation|misrepresented]] information, and that the information was [[Materiality (law)|material]].&lt;ref name="cfr156" /&gt; Proven inequitable conduct in any claim can expose the entire patent to [[Unenforceable|unenforceability]].

==History==
The [[unclean hands]] cases of ''Keystone Driller v. General Excavator'', ''Hazel-Atlas v. Hartford'', and ''Precision v. Automotive'' formed the basis for the doctrine of inequitable conduct that developed and evolved over time.&lt;ref name="Therasense" /&gt;

===''Keystone'' case===
In the 1933 ''Keystone'' case, the patentee manufactured and suppressed evidence in a patent application and its subsequent defense in two different infringement actions: the patentee paid the prior art user to perjure himself by signing a false affidavit that his use was an abandoned experiment, and bought the prior art user's agreement to keep secret the prior use details and to suppress that evidence. Unsurprisingly, the patentee also did not disclose those facts to the PTO or to co-litigants in the infringement actions. The defendants in the second action discovered and presented evidence of the malfeasance, and while the trial court refused dismissal on that ground, on appeal the Sixth Circuit reversed the trial court and remanded for dismissal, and the Supreme Court affirmed.&lt;ref name="Keystone"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=329697305044079257 Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co.], 290 US 240 at 243-47, 54 S.Ct. 146, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hazel-Atlas'' case===
In the 1944 ''Hazel-Atlas'' case, a patentee's attorneys also manufactured and suppressed evidence in support of a patent application by hiring an expert to publish an article in a trade journal under his own name praising the invention as a remarkable advance in the art. After the patent was approved and issued on that basis, the patentee brought an infringement action against Hazel-Atlas but was unsuccessful in the trial court, so the patentee then appealed the matter to the Third Circuit where the patentee introduced the procured trade journal article. That appellate court reversed the trial court and ruled for the patentee, after which Hazel-Atlas settled on the infringement claim, and the patentee then paid the expert more money. The patentee's lies were discovered, however, in ''US v. Hartford-Empire'',&lt;ref name="Hartford"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1853602258590948464 United States v. Hartford-Empire Co.], 46 F.Supp. 541 (N.D.Ohio 1942).&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon Hazel-Atlas petitioned the Third Circuit to reconsider its prior decision, and although it refused, the Supreme Court didn't and reversed, vacating the appellate court's decision and the judgment against Hazel-Atlas, and reinstating the trial court's original judgment dismissing the patentee's case.&lt;ref name="Hazel"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4362809569519461083 Hazel-Atlas Co. v. Hartford Co.], 322 U.S. 238 at 240 at 243-251, 64 S.Ct. 997, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Precision'' case===
In the 1945 ''Precision'' case, the patentee suppressed evidence of perjury before the PTO and attempted to enforce the perjury-tainted patent. In the application to the PTO the patentee claimed false dates of conception, disclosure, drawing, description, and reduction to practice, and then testified to the veracity of the same lies in an interference proceeding. The competing patentee discovered the truth, but procured rights to the patent by private settlement, complicit in the scheme, and then sought to enforce the patent against others. In a later enforcement action, a trial court learned of the facts and ruled against the patentee based on the patentee having unclean hands, but the Seventh Circuit appellate court reversed, and on further appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, reinstating the trial court's decision.&lt;ref name="Precision"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5728551271380833945 Precision Co. v. Automotive Co.], 324 U.S. 806 at 807-20, 65 S.Ct. 993, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landmark court cases==

===''McKesson'' case===
In the 2007 case ''McKesson v. Bridge Medical'',&lt;ref name="McKesson"&gt;"McKesson Info. Sols., Inc. v. Bridge Med., Inc., 487 F.3d 897, 902 (Fed. Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Circuit Court of Appeals]] found inequitable conduct because a patent attorney failed to provide to [[patent examiner]]s information from an [[office action]] in a related case. ''McKesson'' is a cautionary tale for patent applicants: be overly inclusive with patent submissions to insure no omission will jeopardize a patent.&lt;ref name="Stickevers"&gt;Stickevers, John, [http://sunsteinlaw.com/vague-allegations-no-longer-acceptable-when-asserting-inequitable-conduct-defense/ Vague Allegations No Longer Acceptable When Asserting Inequitable Conduct Defense], Sunstein IP Update, 2009-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Exergen'' case===
However, a subsequent CAFC decision seems to directly contradict the standard used in ''McKesson''. In the 2009 case ''Exergen Corp. v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and S.A.A.T. Systems'',&lt;ref name="Exergen"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12398472379994194888 Exergen Corp. v. Wal-Mart Stores], 575 F. 3d 1312, Ct. App. (Fed. Cir.) Aug. 2009. Nos. 2006-1491, 2007-1180.&lt;/ref&gt; SAAT attempted to defend with a claim of inequitable conduct, alleging Exergen was aware of two earlier patents that it did not cite to the examiner during prosecution. The district court denied SAAT's motion for inequitable conduct as a defense, however, holding that SAAT's allegations were not specific enough to meet the particularity requirement of FRCP 9(b). The [[Federal Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld this ruling, and ruled that such allegations must specify who engaged in inequitable conduct, what precisely that person knowingly withheld or misstated to the PTO, and how the omission or misstatement affected the patentability of individual claims.  The court opined that inequitable conduct is not a "magic incantation to be asserted against every patentee" by a "mere showing that art or information having some degree of materiality was not disclosed".&lt;ref name="Stickevers" /&gt;

'''Jennifer Aaker''' (born 1967, California) is an American social psychologist, author and General Atlantic Professor of Marketing at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]. Best known for her research on time, money and happiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Nancy|title=The Corporate Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1722637/corporate-pursuit-happiness|work=March, 2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker also focuses on the transmission of ideas through social networks, the power of story in decision making, and how to build global brands across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Brainiacs: Most Influential Women In Technology|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/women-in-tech/2011/brainiacs/jennifer-aaker|work=2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Profile:  Jennifer Aaker|url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/|publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the recipient of the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the [[Society for Consumer Psychology]] and the Stanford Distinguished Teaching Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Psychology Today |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |work=2014 |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306113958/http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Aaker was born in [[Palo Alto, California]], to Kay Aaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wake|first=Jennifer|title=The Gift of Time: Skilled Volunteers Found in Local Retirees|url=http://www.volunteereastbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The_Gift_of_Time.pdf|work=April 15, 2009|publisher=La Morinda Weekly|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Aaker]], a professor and brand consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David A. Aaker, Author Profile|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/David-A-Aaker/1451364|publisher=Simon and Schuster|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she studied under social psychologist [[Philip E. Tetlock]] and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Daniel Kahneman]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Psychology]] in 1989. In 1990, Aaker began postgraduate work at Stanford Graduate School of Business, earning a Ph.D. in marketing with a minor in psychology in 1995. Her dissertation on brand personality led to the publication of three academic papers  in ''Journal of Marketing Research'' and ''Journal of Consumer Research'' and won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors and Recognition |url=http://faculty.gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=2013 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aaker began her academic career in 1995 as an assistant professor at the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]].  In 1999, she returned to the Stanford Graduate School of Business as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 2001, and earned a full professorship in 2004. In 2005, Aaker was named General Atlantic Professor of Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaker CV at Stanford Graduate School of Business |url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=January, 2013 |publisher=Stanford University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722150424/http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been published in scholarly journals in psychology and marketing and has been highlighted in ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[Forbes]],'' [[NPR]], ''[[CBS MoneyWatch]]'', ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]].'' She serves as an advisory board member for several private companies.

As a social psychologist and marketer, Aaker began her research career by proposing a "Dimensions of Brand Personality" framework to describe and measure the "personality" of a brand, defined as the set of human characteristics associated with it. The five core dimensions are Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness.  In a global analysis of brands, Aaker and her colleagues revealed two novel brand personality dimensions. In Japan, individuals viewed brands as Peaceful, and in Spain, individuals viewed brands as Passionate.  Aaker’s model showed that brand personality dimensions influence consumer preference and choice and provided a framework that illuminated how to build strong global brands that meet multi-cultural needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaker|first=Jennifer|title=Dimensions of Brand Personality|date=August 1997|url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/Papers/Dimensions%20of%20BP%20JMR%201997.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Aaker shifted her research focus to understanding time, money and happiness. In this work, she suggested that time is a resource that, like money, is not only important but more subjective than we think. In 2010, she published two papers with [[Sepandar Kamvar|Sep Kamvar]] and Cassie Mogilner on the dynamic meaning of happiness.  Prior research had suggested that the meaning of happiness is either similar across individuals, or highly subjective and idiosyncratic.  Aaker and her colleagues show that the answer lies between the two and that there is in fact a predictable shift in the meaning of happiness and how it is experienced over one's life and even within the day or week. The research also showed that the meaning of happiness that one holds impacts the choices people make.

Aaker has also examined questions such as why people give to others, how small acts create significant change, and how those effects can be fueled by social media.

In 2010, Aaker and her husband, startup advisor Andy Smith, authored the book ''The Dragonfly Effect:  Quick, Effective and Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Drive Social Change.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.dragonflyeffect.com/|work=2013|publisher=Official Website|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    With a title inspired by the dragonfly’s unique ability to propel itself in any direction when its four wings worked in concert, the book examined the manner in which synchronized ideas can be used to create rapid transformations through social media. A literary award winner,[5] ''The Dragonfly Effect'' has been translated into over 10 languages. In 2013, Aaker, Smith and McCarthy published ''The Power of Stories'', a companion to ''The Dragonfly Effect'', which further explored social media through psychological insight and provided a hands-on tool to help companies put the model to work.

In a real world demonstration of the Dragonfly Effect, Aaker and her students founded 100K Cheeks,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Avril|title=Names You Need to Know|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avrildavid/2011/05/17/names-you-need-to-know-the-dragonfly-effect/|work=May 17, 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Stores|ISBN=1484184386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization dedicated to registering 100,000 South Asian donors in the National Bone Marrow Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Challenges (Get Involved) |url=http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |publisher=Haas Center for Public Service |accessdate=13 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221230214/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to utilizing social networks, Aaker ran the first ever cheek swab in India; as a result of these efforts, 100K Cheeks exceeded their goal by registering more than 115,000 potential donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.inktalks.com/discover/53/pursuit-of-happiness|work=November 27, 2011|publisher=Ink Talks|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beth Kanter Katie Delahaye Paine|first=Katie Delahaye Paine|title=Measuring the Networked Nonprofit: Using Data to Change the World|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-118-13760-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vL_lhYF0Uf4C&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=jennifer+aaker+100k+cheeks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/the_dragonfly_effect|work=October 2011|publisher=Stanford Social Innovation Review|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Social media is not inherently meaningful," Aaker said in an interview on the subject.

Polka is recognised as having insight into issues surrounding open peer review, preprint and early career progression, and has been quoted in numerous articles by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on these topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/12/nih-tweaks-plan-award-more-grants-younger-researchers|title=NIH tweaks plan to award more grants to younger researchers|date=2017-12-15|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Lindsay|date=2017-06-16|title=Biologists debate how to license preprints|url=https://www.nature.com/news/biologists-debate-how-to-license-preprints-1.22161|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22161|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/09/new-fellowship-aims-increase-diversity-life-sciences|title=New fellowship aims to increase diversity in the life sciences|date=2016-09-21|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Ewen|date=2017-04-26|title=BioRxiv preprint server gets cash boost from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative|url=https://www.nature.com/news/biorxiv-preprint-server-gets-cash-boost-from-chan-zuckerberg-initiative-1.21894|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=545|issue=7652|pages=18–18|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21894|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smaglik|first=Paul|date=2016-02-24|title=Activism: Frustrated postdocs rise up|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v530/n7591/full/nj7591-505a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=530|issue=7591|pages=505–506|doi=10.1038/nj7591-505a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolgin|first=Elie|date=2016-11-30|title=Big biology projects warm up to preprints|url=https://www.nature.com/news/big-biology-projects-warm-up-to-preprints-1.21074|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.21074|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Polka and Viviane Callier wrote an article for the careers column in ''Nature'' where they argue that funding agencies should support more than 16% of postdocs through fellowships.

==== Future of Research ====
Polka was one of the organisers of the first Future of Research Symposium in Boston in 2014. She was on the executive committee until she became President of the Board of Directors in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://futureofresearch.net/board-of-directors/|title=Board of Directors|date=2016-04-30|work=Future of Research|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polka is involved in creating debate amongst early-career scientists about the financial, historical and political influences on academic research. Future of Research was awarded the People of the Year award in 2015 by [[Science (journal)|Science]] journal for their "efforts to empower early-career and aspiring scientists...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2015/12/people-year-future-researchs-postdoc-activists|title=People of the Year: Future of Research's postdoc activists|date=2015-12-17|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ASAPbio ====
Polka was a founder of ASAPbio which began in 2015 after [[Ronald Vale|Ron Vale]] showed that [[University of California, San Francisco]] students were taking a long time to publish and proposed that [[preprint]]ing might mitigate the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vale|first=Ronald D.|date=2015-07-11|title=Accelerating Scientific Publication in Biology|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/07/11/022368|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=022368|doi=10.1101/022368|arxiv=1509.03775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vale recruited Polka, Daniel Colon-Ramos and [[Harold Varmus]] which led to the first ASAPbio meeting in February 2016 attended by scientists, representatives from funding agencies, journals and preprint servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asapbio.org/meeting-information/attendees|title=Attendees (2016 preprint meeting)|work=ASAPbio|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The meeting Polka led was widely recognized as a turning point in scholarly communication&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/the-rainbow-unicorn-trying-real-hard-to-transform-biology-publishing/|title=Biologists are working on a replacement for slow, stodgy peer review.

A survival guide for scientists|date=2017-09-21|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polka began working full-time at ASAPbio in 2016 after funding was granted from the [[Simons Foundation]], [[Sloan Foundation]], [[Arnold Foundation]], and [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2016/06/20/foundations-announce-support-for-scientist-driven-effort-to-promote-use-of-preprints-in-the-life-sciences/|title=Foundations Announce Support for Scientist-Driven Effort to Promote Use of Preprints in the Life Sciences {{!}} Simons Foundation|website=www.simonsfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Polka was described in the journal ''Nature'' as an "agent of change" for explaining how junior researchers can increase the impact of their work. For instance, ASAPbio encourages preprints within biology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gewin|first=Virginia|date=2016-10-26|title=Agents of change|url=https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7626-543a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=538|issue=7626|pages=543–545|doi=10.1038/nj7626-543a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASAPbio tries to mitigate the effect of lengthy waiting times before publications are reviewed and published, following the example of physics, computer science and maths, fields that have already adopted preprints. She has also taken an interest in strategies for preventing sexual harassment in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="MedicineAffairs2018"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyZnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR12|date=1 September 2018|publisher=[[National Academies Press]]|isbn=978-0-309-47087-2|pages=xii,228 |editor-last1=Johnson |editor-first1=Paula A. |editor-last2=Widnall |editor-first2=Sheila E. |editor-last3=Benya |editor-first3=Frazier F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017,[[PLOS]]cast interviewed Polka about her work which contributes to the changing way that science is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2017/10/24/episode26/|title=How ECRs like Jessica Polka are reinventing science publishing  {{!}} PLOScast|date=2017-10-24|work=PLOScast|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kate Bishop''' (1848 – 12 June 1923) was an English [[actress]] from [[Bristol]], a member of a theatrical family. Her brother and daughter were also successful actors. Her greatest success was in ''[[Our Boys]]'', which ran for more than four years in London. She temporarily retired from the theatre in the late nineteenth century, and returned to play character roles in the early years of the twentieth century.

==Biography==
Bishop was born into a theatrical family, the daughter of Charles Bishop. She began acting as a [[Child actor|child]] in [[Bristol]] in 1863.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''[[The Times]] obituary notice'', 13 June 1923, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Alfred also successfully entered the theatrical profession.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 May 1928, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
In 1868, Bishop appeared with [[Edward Askew Sothern]] in a revival of ''[[Our American Cousin]]'', in which ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' thought her "arch" but "lacking in dignity".&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 24 August 1868, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[West End theatre|West End]] she appeared in ''A Loving Cup'' at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 10 February 1869, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1871 at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in a succession of three new plays by [[W. S. Gilbert]], playing  Edith Temple in ''[[Randall's Thumb]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 January 1871, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Pipette in ''[[Creatures of Impulse]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 April 1871, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and Jessie Blake in ''On Guard''.  Of her performance in the last, ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "The notion of the irresistible flirt is completely realized by Miss Kate Bishop."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 November 1871, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop  played in ''About Town'' by Bertie Vyse in 1873&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 16 May 1873, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Ruy Blas Righted'' and ''Romulus and Remus'', both by [[Robert Reece]], in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 January 1874, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picturehistoryprints.com/product/id/19988 Picture History]. Retrieved 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Her most famous stage role was Violet Melrose in [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''[[Our Boys]]'', which she created in January 1875 and played practically continuously throughout its historic run of four years and four months.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; When ''Our Boys'' finally closed, it was by far the longest-running work of theatre up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Michael R. Review of plays by H. J. Byron including ''Our Boys'' in ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 82, No. 3, pp. 716-17 (July 1987; Modern Humanities Research Association)&lt;/ref&gt; Byron supplied a successor, ''The Girls'', in which Bishop had another leading role.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 April 1879, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Family life in Australia took her away from the English stage for some 15 years at the end of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; In 1900 she returned to the stage in ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', at the [[Garrick Theatre]], together with [[George Grossmith Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 December 1900, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; She played Mrs Percival de Hooley in [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''The Passing of the Third Floor Black'' in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 6 September 1908, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 she appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''Penelope'', by [[Somerset Maugham]], at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]]. Her last stage appearance was in 1915, as Lady Matilda Rye in [[Horace Annesley Vachell|H. A. Vachell's]] ''The Case of Lady Camber'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 13 June 1923, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1885, Bishop married Lewis J. Löhr, [[treasurer]] of the [[Melbourne]] [[Opera House]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Five years later their daughter [[Marie Lohr]], later a leading actress, was born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillan, Don.

Retrieved 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/marie-lohr-1 Answers.com] Retrieved 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop died in London, aged 75,&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18750">This article lists the fatal accidents that happened in the [[Suzuka Circuit]], a [[motorsport]] [[race track]] that is operated by Mobilityland, a subsidiary of [[Honda Motor Co., Ltd.]], located in [[Suzuka City]] in the [[Mie Prefecture]] of [[Japan]]. Twelve have involved [[car]]s, including one involving the [[safety car]], and seven have involved [[motorcycle]]s. Seventeen people have died in accidents at the track during its half-century of existence, almost all of them [[Japanese people|Japanese]] professional racers, with the exceptions of American [[safety car]] driver [[Elmo Langley]] and French driver [[Jules Bianchi]].

Deaths at the track have included that of [[Honda RC211V]] racer [[Daijiro Kato]] on April 20, 2003, after the [[Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix]] race.&lt;ref name="SuperbikePlanet.com October 11" /&gt;&lt;ref name = Kato/&gt; He died of a [[brain stem]] infarction after spending two weeks in a [[coma]]. [[Honda S600|Dome Karasu]] driver [[Tojiro Ukiya]] died in a test run on August 20, 1965, Lola T92/50 (with [[Mugen Honda]] engine) racer [[Hitoshi Ogawa]] on May 24, 1992, while on the way to the hospital immediately after the [[Japanese Formula 3000]] race; and [[United States|American]], [[NASCAR]] [[safety car]] driver [[Elmo Langley]] died on November 21, 1996.  Langley suffered a heart attack while driving the safety car.

The most recent death to have happened at the track is that of [[Jules Bianchi]] on October 5, 2014, who collided with a crane tractor that was deployed to pick up [[Adrian Sutil]]'s car, which had spun out earlier. Bianchi succumbed to his injuries on July 17, 2015 following a nine-month coma, making him the first non-Japanese driver to die on the track in a crash.

Controversially, rather than waving a [[racing flag#The red flag|red flag]] to allow the race to be stopped so the track can be safely cleared, corner workers dragged Kato's body off the track and threw him on a stretcher. The race was not stopped.

Kato spent two weeks in a coma following the accident before dying as a result of the injuries he sustained.  The cause of death was listed as [[brain stem]] [[infarction]]. The Japanese Motorcycle Grand Prix has not been held at Suzuka as of 2004 (with the race having been moved to Motegi which was the venue of the Pacific Grand Prix) following Kato's crash, with safety issues at the facility in light of the [[2002 Japanese Grand Prix|F1 race the previous October]] with 130R, including a serious crash involving Toyota F1 driver [[Allan McNish]] at 130R, it had been rebuilt over that winter, safety being cited as the reason.&lt;ref name = Kato&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Motorsport Memorial - Daijiro Kato: |url=http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ms&amp;n=1475 |work= |publisher=Motorsport Memorial |date= |accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucas Dolega''' (19 August 1978 – 17 January 2011), born '''Loucas von Zabiensky-Mebrouk''' and also called '''Lucas Mebrouk Dolega''', was a [[French people|French]]/[[Germans|German]] [[photojournalist]]. He was reportedly killed by Tunisian police while he was photographing a protest in [[Tunis]]. As reported in The Guardian (UK), Dolega was the first journalist killed during the [[2010-2011 Tunisian protests]], according to [[Reporters Without Borders]]. He was also the first journalist to die while on assignment during the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French photographer dies after being hit by police teargas canister in Tunisia |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2011-01-16 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/16/french-photographer-dies-tunisia-protests}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucas Mebrouk Dolega |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=2011-01-17 |accessdate=2011-10-16 |url=http://cpj.org/killed/2011/lucas-mebrouk-dolega.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French photographer dies from injury sustained on day of Ben Ali’s departure |publisher=Reporters without Borders |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |url=http://en.rsf.org/tunisia-french-photographer-dies-from-18-01-2011,39342.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was fatally injured on the same day that [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] fled Tunisia for exile.

==Personal information==
Dolega was born in Paris on 19 August 1978 to a German mother and a French father, a journalist and a doctor respectively. He grew up in Paris, before moving to Tangier in Morocco. He had French and German citizenship, and started work as a photographer for [[European Pressphoto Agency]] in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2011/01/16/97001-20110116FILWWW00194-tunisie-le-photographe-francais-vivant.php Tunisie: le photographe français vivant]", AFP story, ''Le Figaro,'' 16 January 2011. {{fr icon}} Accessed 25 January 2011.&lt;!-- backed up at https://www.webcitation.org/5vyT8NZwo?url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2011/01/16/97001-20110116FILWWW00194-tunisie-le-photographe-francais-vivant.php --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laurent"&gt;Olivier Laurent, "[http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/1937417/french-photographer-dies-tunisia UNESCO, French government call for investigation of Lucas Dolega's death &lt;nowiki&gt;[update 7]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119010423/http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/1937417/french-photographer-dies-tunisia |date=2011-01-19 }}", ''British Journal of Photography,'' 16 January 2011.

==Death==
On 14 January 2011, the day after Dolega arrived in Tunis, and at the end of a demonstration on Avenue Bourguiba, he was within a group of journalists at the corner of rue Gandhi and rue de Marseille. He was hit in the head by a [[tear gas]] canister, about 20&amp;nbsp;cm long and 5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, reportedly fired by police at short range and horizontally toward a group of photographers. He was taken first to a clinic and then to Tunis Rabta Neurologic Hospital where he was operated on but died on 17 January.&lt;ref name="laurent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pdn"&gt;David Walker, "[http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/news/Photographer-Dies-of-1505.shtml Photographer dies of injuries in Tunis]", ''Photo District News,'' 18 January 2011.

==Impact==
Dolega was the first of a number of journalists who were killed over the course of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. He was killed while on assignment. He is among a group of photojournalists who were killed while covering protests, such as [[Hiro Muramoto]], cameraman and journalist shot by a soldier in Bangkok, 2010; or [[Kenji Nagai]], who was photojournalist shot by a soldier in Rangoon, 2007.

==Legacy==
The Lucas Dolega Award (Prix Lucas Dolega) was established in 2011 to honor photojournalists who have reported under difficult circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters Without Borders.

==In popular culture==
Lucas Dolega is mentioned in the poem "A Love Letter from Emilie Blachère to Rémi Ochlik", written by [[Paris Match]] journalist Emilie Blachère on the occasion of the first anniversary of [[Rémi Ochlik|Rémi Ochlik's]] death.&lt;ref name=poem&gt;{{cite web|first=Emilie |last=Blachère |title=A love letter from Emilie Blachère to Rémi Ochlik |publisher=Le journal de la photographie |date=2013-03-04 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |url=http://lejournaldelaphotographie.com/entries/10393/a-love-letter-from-emilie-blachere-to-remi-ochlik}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes: "My angel, give Lucas a kiss for me. Take care of yourself. Take care of us."&lt;ref name=poem /&gt; After she read the poem on BBC [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4's]] [[Broadcasting House]] news program, radio host [[Paddy O'Connell]] broke down emotionally and could not bring himself to continue the news broadcast for  around 12 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam |last=Marsden |title=Choked BBC presenter falls silent after hearing love letter to photographer killed in Syria |newspaper=The Telegraph (UK) |date=2013-03-03 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9905627/Choked-BBC-presenter-falls-silent-after-hearing-love-letter-to-photographer-killed-in-Syria.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rémi Ochlik was a friend and colleague of Lucas Dolega, he was with Dolega when Dolega died, and he worked on establishing an award in Dolega's honor after his friend's death.&lt;ref name=nytimes2013&gt;{{cite news|first=Kerri |last=MacDonald |title=Parting glance: Rémi Ochlik |newspaper=New York Times |type=blog |date=2013-02-22 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/parting-glance-remi-ochlik/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Menarche''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɑːr|k|iː}} {{respell|mi|NAR|kee}}; Greek: {{lang|grc|μήν}} ''mēn'' "month" + {{lang|grc|ἀρχή}} ''arkhē'' "beginning") is the first [[menstrual cycle]], or first [[Menstruation|menstrual]] bleeding, in female [[human]]s. From both social and medical perspectives, it is often considered the central event of female [[puberty]], as it signals the possibility of [[fertility]].

Girls experience menarche at different ages. The timing of menarche is influenced by female [[biology]], as well as [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[environmental factor]]s, especially [[nutrition]]al factors. The mean age of menarche has declined over the last century, but the magnitude of the decline and the factors responsible remain subjects of contention. The worldwide average age of menarche is very difficult to estimate accurately, and it varies significantly by geographical region, race, ethnicity and other characteristics. Various estimates have placed it at 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rmohamed.kau.edu.sa/Files/140/Researches/59054_29400.pdf |title=Early teenage marriage and subsequent pregnancy outcome |journal=Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2000 |author=Shawky, S. |author2=Milaat, W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates suggest that the ''[[median]]'' age of menarche worldwide is 14, and that there is a later age of onset in [[Asia]]n populations compared to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indox.org.uk/node/34 |title=Risk Factors for Breast Cancer in India: an INDOX Case-Control Study |publisher=INDOX Cancer Research Network |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302035932/http://www.indox.org.uk/node/34 |archivedate=2013-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average age of menarche is about 12.5 years in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title=Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=844–50 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12671122 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.844}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12.72 in [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Age at menarche in Canada: results from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children &amp; Youth |journal=BMC Public Health |date=November 2010 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-736 |pmid=21110899 |volume=10 |pmc=3001737 |vauthors=Al-Sahab B, Ardern CI, Hamadeh MJ, Tamim H |page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 12.9 in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://vstudentworld.yolasite.com/resources/final_yr/gynae_obs/Hamilton%20Fairley%20Obstetrics%20and%20Gynaecology%20Lecture%20Notes%202%20Ed.pdf |format=PDF |page=29 |title=Obstetrics and Gynaecology |author=Hamilton-Fairley, Diana |edition=2nd |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=1-4051-2066-5 |accessdate=2013-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of girls in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], found the  median age at menarche to be 12.74 years.&lt;ref name="pmid21669888"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atay|first1=Z.|last2=Turan|first2=S.|last3=Guran|first3=T.|last4=Furman|first4=A.|last5=Bereket|first5=A|title=Puberty and Influencing Factors in Schoolgirls Living in Istanbul: End of the Secular Trend? |journal=Pediatrics |volume=128|issue=1|pages=e40–5|date=2011-06-13 |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-2267|pmid=21669888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==

===Puberty===
Menarche is the culmination of a series of [[physiological]] and anatomic processes of [[puberty]]:
*Attainment of a sufficient body mass (typically 17% body fat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frisch RE |title=Body fat, menarche, fitness and fertility |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=521–33 |date=August 1987 |pmid=3117838 |url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/6/521}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Disinhibition  of the [[GnRH]] pulse generator in the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]].
*Secretion of [[estrogen]] by the [[ovary|ovaries]] in response to [[pituitary]] [[hormone]]s.
*Over an interval of about 2 to 3 years, estrogen stimulates growth of the [[uterus]] (as well as height growth, [[breast]] growth, widening of the [[human pelvis|pelvis]], and increased regional [[adipose tissue]]).
*Estrogen stimulates growth and vascularity of the [[endometrium]], the lining of the uterus.
*Fluctuations of hormone levels can result in changes of adequacy of blood supply to parts of the endometrium.
*Death of some of the endometrial tissue from these hormone or blood supply fluctuations leads to ''deciduation'', a sloughing of part of the lining with some blood flow from the [[vagina]].

No specific hormonal signal for menarche is known; menarche as a discrete event is thought to be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen.

The ''menstruum'', or ''flow,'' consists of a combination of fresh and clotted blood with endometrial tissue. The initial flow of menarche is usually brighter than mature menstrual flow. It is often scanty in amount and may be very brief, even a single instance of "spotting." Like other [[menses]], menarche may be accompanied by [[abdominal pain|abdominal cramping]].

===Relation to fertility===
In most girls, menarche does not mean that [[ovulation]] has occurred. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were [[anovulatory]] in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year.&lt;ref name="Apter D 1980 107–20"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Apter D |title=Serum steroids and pituitary hormones in female puberty: a partly longitudinal study |journal=Clinical Endocrinology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=107–20 |date=February 1980 |pmid=6249519 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.1980.tb02125.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular ovulation is usually indicated by predictable and consistent intervals between menses, predictable and consistent durations of menses, and predictable and consistent patterns of flow (e.g., heaviness or cramping). Continuing ovulation typically requires a body fat content of at least 22%. An [[anthropology|anthropological]] term for this state of potential fertility is [[nubility]].

On the other hand, not every girl follows the typical pattern, and some girls ovulate before the first [[menstruation]]. Although unlikely, it is possible for a girl who has engaged in [[sexual intercourse]] shortly before her menarche to [[Conception (biology)|conceive]] and become [[pregnancy|pregnant]], which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy.  This goes against the widely held assumption that a woman cannot become pregnant until after menarche. A young age at menarche is not correlated with a young age at first sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marino | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Skinner | first2 = S. R. | last3 = Doherty | first3 = D. A. | last4 = Rosenthal | first4 = S. L. | last5 = Cooper Robbins | first5 = S. C. | last6 = Cannon | first6 = J. | last7 = Hickey | first7 = M. | doi = 10.1542/peds.2012-3634 | title = Age at Menarche and Age at First Sexual Intercourse: A Prospective Cohort Study | journal = Pediatrics | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = | volume=132 | pages=1028–1036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Onset===
When menarche occurs, it confirms that the girl has had a gradual [[estrogen]]-induced growth of the [[uterus]], especially the [[endometrium]], and that the "outflow tract" from the uterus, through the [[cervix]] to the [[vagina]], is open.

In very rare instances, menarche may occur at an unusually early age, preceding [[thelarche]] and other signs of puberty. This is termed '''''isolated premature menarche''''', but other causes of bleeding must be investigated and excluded. Growth is usually normal.&lt;ref name=AMN&gt;{{cite web |author1=R. Stanhope |author2=C. Traggiai |title=Isolated Menarche|work=Precocious Puberty (Complete, Partial) |url=http://www.health.am/gyneco/more/isolated-menarche/ |year=2006 |publisher=Armenian Health Network |accessdate=2006-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isolated premature menarche is rarely the first manifestation of [[precocious puberty]].

When menarche has failed to occur for more than 3 years after thelarche, or beyond 16 years of age, the delay is referred to as [[primary amenorrhea]].

Certain systemic or chronic illness can delay menarche, such as undiagnosed and untreated [[celiac disease]] (which often occurs without gastrointestinal symptoms), [[asthma]], [[diabetes mellitus type 1]], [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[inflammation|inflammatory diseases]], among others.&lt;ref name=UmlawskaKrzyzanowska2009&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Umławska W, Krzyzanowska M|title=Puberty in certain chronic illness|journal=Pediatr Endocrinol Diabetes Metab|volume=15|issue=3|pages=216–8|date=2009|pmid=20384185|doi=|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TraggiaiStanhope2003&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Traggiai C, Stanhope R|title=Disorders of pubertal development.|journal=Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol|volume=17|issue=1|pages=41–56|date=Feb 2003|pmid=12758225|doi=10.1053/ybeog.2003.0360|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LefflerGreen2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Leffler DA, Green PH, Fasano A|title=Extraintestinal manifestations of coeliac disease|journal=Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol|volume=12|issue=10|pages=561–71|date=Oct 2015|pmid=26260366|doi=10.1038/nrgastro.2015.131|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TersigniCastellani&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tersigni C, Castellani R, de Waure C, Fattorossi A, De Spirito M, Gasbarrini A, Scambia G, Di Simone N |title=Celiac disease and reproductive disorders: meta-analysis of epidemiologic associations and potential pathogenic mechanisms|date=2014|journal=Hum Reprod Update|volume=20|issue=4|pages=582–93|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu007|url= http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/4/582.long|pmid=24619876|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, because [[clinical chemistry|biochemical tests]] are not always discriminatory, underlying pathologies are not identified and the girl is classified as [[constitutional growth delay]].&lt;ref name=WeiCrowne2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wei C, Crowne EC|title=Recent advances in the understanding and management of delayed puberty|journal=Arch Dis Child|volume=101|date=Sep 9, 2015|pmid=26353794|doi=10.1136/archdischild-2014-307963|type=Review|pages=481–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short stature, delayed growth in height and weight, and/or delayed menarche may be the only clinical manifestations of [[celiac disease]], in absence of any other symptoms.&lt;ref name=LefflerGreen2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mearin2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=|title=The prevention of coeliac disease|journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol|volume=29|issue=3|pages=493–501|date=Jun 2015|pmid=26060113|doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2015.04.003|type=Review|author=Mearin ML}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuandaliniAssiri2014&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Guandalini S, Assiri A|title=Celiac disease: a review|journal=JAMA Pediatr|volume=168|issue=3|pages=:272–8|date=Mar 2014|pmid=24395055|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LevyBernstein2014&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Levy J, Bernstein L, Silber N|title=Celiac disease: an immune dysregulation syndrome|journal=Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care|volume=44|issue=11|pages = 324–7|date=Dec 2014|pmid=25499458|doi=10.1016/j.cppeds.2014.10.002|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects of stress and social environment====
Some of the least understood environmental influences on timing of puberty are social and psychological. Nearly all of the research on these effects has concerned girls, partly because female puberty requires greater physiological resources and partly because menarche involves a clear threshold event that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male. In most of these studies menarche was specifically examined, assuming it to be a valid "proxy" for the more general process of puberty. In comparison with the effects of genetics, nutrition, and general health, social influences are small, shifting timing by a few months rather than years. The most important part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family.

Some of the aspects of family structure and function reported to be independently associated with earlier menarche [antenatal and early childhood]
*Are non-white&lt;ref name="D.H. Morris, M.E. Jones 2010"/&gt;
*Experienced pre-eclampsia in the womb&lt;ref name="D.H. Morris, M.E. Jones 2010"/&gt;

*The increased incidence of [[childhood obesity]].&lt;ref name="D.H. Morris, M.E. Jones 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Determinants of age at menarche in the UK: analyses from the Breakthrough Generations Study|journal=British Journal of Cancer 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605978|year=2010|pmid=21045834|author1=D.H.

*Lacked exercise in childhood&lt;ref name="D.H. Morris, M.E. Jones 2010"/&gt;

Other research has focused on the effect of childhood [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] on timing of puberty, especially female. Stress is a vague term and studies have examined conditions ranging from family tensions or conflict to wartime refugee status with threat to physical survival. The more dire social conditions have been found to be associated with delay of maturation, an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy. There is more uncertainty and mixed evidence as to whether milder degrees of stress or early-life under-nutrition can accelerate puberty in girls as would be predicted by [[life history theory]] and demonstrated in many other mammals.

The understanding of these environmental effects is incomplete and the following observations and cautions are relevant:
*Mechanisms of these social effects are unknown, though a variety of physiological processes, including [[pheromone]]s, have been suggested based on animal research.
*Most of these "effects" are statistical associations revealed by [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] surveys. Statistical associations are not necessarily causal, and a variety of secondary variables and alternative explanations can be possibly intervening. Effects of such small size can never be confirmed or refuted for any individual child.
* Despite the small magnitude of effect, interpretations of the data are politically controversial because of the ease with which this type of research can be used for political advocacy. Accusations of bias based on political agenda sometimes accompany scientific criticism.
* [[Correlation does not imply causation]]. While correlation can be objectively measured, causation is statistically inferred. Some suggest that childhood stress is caused by precocious puberty recognized later, rather than being the cause of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Australian]], 3 April 2013.

====Changes in time of average age====

There were few systematic studies of timing of menarche before the later half of the 20th century. Most older estimates of average timing of menarche were based on observation of a small homogeneous population not necessarily representative of the larger population, or based on recall by adult women, which is also susceptible to various forms of error. Most sources agree that the average age of menarche in girls in modern societies has declined, though the reasons and the degree remain subjects of controversy. From the sixth to the fifteenth centuries in Europe, most women reached menarche on average at about 14, between the ages of 12 and 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Amundsen Darrel |author2=Dreis Carol Jean | year = 1973 | title = The Age of Menarche in Medieval Europe | url = | journal = Human Biology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 363–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A large North American survey reported only a 2-3 month decline from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=AndersonEtAl2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title=Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 |pages=844–850 |date=April 2003 |pmid= 12671122 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.844}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study found that each 1&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; increase in childhood [[body-mass index]] (BMI) can be expected to result in a 6.5% higher absolute risk of early menarche (before age 12 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21773002|year=2011|last1=Mumby|first1=HS|last2=Elks|first2=CE|last3=Li|first3=S|last4=Sharp|first4=SJ|last5=Khaw|first5=KT|last6=Luben|first6=RN|last7=Wareham|first7=NJ|last8=Loos|first8=RJ|last9=Ong|first9=KK|title=Mendelian Randomisation Study of Childhood BMI and Early Menarche|volume=2011|page=180729|doi=10.1155/2011/180729|pmc=3136158|journal=Journal of Obesity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fewer than 10% of U.S. girls start to menstruate before 11 years of age, and 90% of all US girls are menstruating by 13.75 years of age, with a median age of 12.43 years. This age at menarche is not much different (0.34 years earlier) than that reported for U.S. girls in 1973.  Age at menarche for non-Hispanic black girls was significantly earlier than that of white girls at 10%, 25%, and 50% of those who had attained menarche, whereas Mexican American girls were only slightly earlier than the white girls at 25%.&lt;ref name=Chumlea&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chumlea WC, Schubert CM, Roche AF, etal |title=Age at menarche and racial comparisons in US girls |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=110–3 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12509562 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.1.110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture and menstruation}}
{{See also|Seclusion of girls at puberty}}
Menstruation is a cultural as well as scientific phenomenon as many societies have specific rituals and cultural norms associated with it. These rituals typically begin at menarche and some are enacted during each menstruation cycle. The rituals are important in determining a status change for girls. Upon menarche and completion of the ritual, they have become a woman as defined by their culture.

For young women in many cultures, the first menstruation is a marker that signifies a change in status. Post-menarche, the young woman enters a stage called maidenhood, the stage between menarche and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=School-age Pregnancy and Parenthood: Biosocial Dimensions|year=1986|publisher=Aldine De Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=0-202-30321-7|pages=273–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cultures that have in past centuries, and in present, practiced rites of passage for a girl experiencing menarche.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Holly. ''Girlwonder: Every Girl's Guide to the Fantastic Feats, Cool Qualities, and Remarkable Abilities of Women and Girls.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celebratory ceremonies===
[[File:Sekihan.jpg|thumb|[[Sekihan]], a traditional Japanese dish of sticky rice steamed with azuki beans, is sometimes served after menarche.]]
In some cultures, a party, or celebration is thrown to show the girl's transition to womanhood. This party is similar to the [[quinceañera]] in Latin America, except that a specific age marks the transition rather than menarche. In [[Morocco]], the girl is thrown a celebration. All of her family members are invited and the girl is showered with money and gifts.

When a [[women in Japan|Japanese girl]] has her first period, the family sometimes celebrates by eating red-colored rice and beans ''([[sekihan]])''. The color of blood and the red of ''sekihan'' are not related. All the rice of ancient times of Japan was red. Since rice was precious in ancient Japan (usually, [[millet]] was eaten), it was eaten only during the celebration. ''Sekihan'' is the tradition of an ancient custom. The celebration is kept a secret from extended family until the rice is served.&lt;ref name="Girls almanac"&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegel|first=Alice|title=Information Please Girls' Almanac|year=1995|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0395694582|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jjdI-5tfGOIC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Ulithi+tribe+kufar#v=onepage&amp;q=Ulithi%20tribe%20kufar&amp;f=false|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[India]]n communities, young women are given a special menarche ceremony called [[Ruthu Sadangu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chockalingam|first=K|title=Census of India, 1971: A. General report|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OMsXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ruthu+Sadangu+menarche+india&amp;dq=Ruthu+Sadangu+menarche+india|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mescalero]] Apaches place high importance on their menarche ceremony and it is regarded as the most important ritual in their tribe. Each year there is an eight-day event celebrating all of the girls who have menstruated in the past year. The days are split between feasting and private ceremonies reflecting on their new womanly status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford O'Brien|first=Suzanne J.|title=American Indian religious traditions: an encyclopedia, Volume 2|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SEopBoB8ch0C&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=Mescalero+Apaches+menarche#v=onepage&amp;q=Mescalero%20Apaches%20menarche&amp;f=false|isbn=9781576075173|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rituals of learning===
In [[Australia]], the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]{{which|date=June 2014}} treat a girl to "love magic". She is taught the ways of womanhood by the other women in her tribe. Her mother builds her a hut to which she confines herself for the remainder of her menses. The hut is burned and she is bathed in the river at the end of menstruation. When she returns to the village{{clarify|date=June 2014}}, she is paired with a man who will be her husband.&lt;ref name="Girls almanac" /&gt;

In the [[United States]], public schools have a [[sex education]] program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect at the onset of menarche (often this takes place during the 4th grade). Historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model. Then, and to an extent now, menstruation was a private matter and a girl's menarche was not a community phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidenfelds|first=Lara|title=The Modern Period: Menstruation in Twentieth Century America|year=2009|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=0801892457|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n58U9B9BqhQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rituals of cleansing or purification===
The Ulithi tribe of [[Micronesia]] call a girl's menarche ''kufar''. She goes to a menstrual house, where the women bathe her and recite spells. She will have to return to the menstruation hut every time she menstruates. Her parents build her a private hut that she will live in until she is married.&lt;ref name="Girls almanac" /&gt;

In [[Sri Lanka]] an [[astrologer]] is contacted to study the alignment of stars when the girl experiences menarche because it is believed that her future can be predicted. The women of the family then gather in her home and scrub her in a ritual bathing ceremony. Her family then throws a familial party at which the girl wears white and may receive gifts.&lt;ref name="Girls almanac" /&gt;

In [[Ethiopia]], [[Ethiopian Jewish|Beta Jewish]] women were separated from male society and sent to menstruation huts during menarche and every menstruation following as the blood associated with menstruation in the Beta Jewish culture was believed to be impure. The Beta Jews built their villages surrounding and near bodies of water specifically for their women to have a place to clean themselves. The menstruation huts were built close to these bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tal|first=Ilana|title=Exploring the Meaning of Becoming a Woman in Non-Western Culture: A narrative Analysis of First Menstruation Stories of Ethiopian Jewish Women|year=2004|publisher=ProQuest Information and learning Company|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rituals of transformation and scarification===
In [[Nigeria]], the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] ethnic group cut four lines into the abdomen of their girls during menarche. The lines are supposed to represent fertility.&lt;ref name="Girls almanac" /&gt;

===Rituals of strength===
The [[Navajo people|Navajo]] have a celebration called [[Blessing Way|''kinaalda'']] (kinn-all-duh). Girls are expected to demonstrate their strength through footraces. The girls make a cornmeal pudding for the tribe to taste. The girls who experience menarche wear special clothes and style their hair like the Navajo goddess "[[Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé|Changing Woman]]".&lt;ref name="Girls almanac" /&gt;

The [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]] (also known as the Nootka) believe that physical endurance is the most important quality in young women. At menarche the girl is taken out to sea and left there to swim back.&lt;ref name="Girls almanac" /&gt;

===Movies===
Perhaps the most notable movie scene involving menarche is that from the 1976 [[horror movie]] ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]''. [[Carrie White]] experiences her first period as she showers after the school gym class, and unaware of what is happening to her, she panics and pleads for help, but the other girls respond by bullying her. The movie is an adaptation of the [[Carrie (novel)|novel with the same name]] by [[Stephen King]]. Carrie's first period unleashes her violent powers and is central to her dangerous  and out of control transformation. This theme is common to horror movies, another notable example being the 2000 Canadian horror film ''[[Ginger Snaps (film)|Ginger Snaps]]'', where the protagonist's first period is central to her gradual transformation into a [[werewolf]]. Girls experiencing their first period is part of many movies, though not central to their plot, including ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'', ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'', ''[[A Walk on the Moon]]''.

'''Michele Sindona''' (May 8, 1920 &amp;ndash; March 22, 1986) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[banker]] and convicted [[felony|felon]]. Known in banking circles as "The Shark", Sindona was a member of [[Propaganda Due]] (#0501),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Web of scandal entangles P2 | work= The Times | date = 1981-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a secret lodge of Italian [[Grande Oriente d'Italia|Freemasonry]], and had clear connections to the [[Sicilian Mafia]]. He was fatally poisoned in [[prison]] while serving a life [[sentence (law)|sentence]] for the murder of lawyer [[Giorgio Ambrosoli]].

==Early years==
Born at [[Patti, Sicily|Patti]], [[Sicily]], of poor parents, Michele Sindona was educated by the [[Jesuit]]s, and showed very early in his life an unusual aptitude for [[mathematics]] and [[economics]]. He graduated with a law degree from the [[University of Messina]] in 1942. Then, he moved from Sicily to the north where he worked as a tax lawyer and an accountant for companies such as [[Società Generale Immobiliare]] and [[SNIA S.p.A.|SNIA Viscosa]], but immediately turned away from the law and began working in [[smuggling]] operations with the Mafia.{{cn|date=July 2013}} He soon moved to [[Milan]], and his skill and dexterity in transferring money to avoid [[taxation]] soon became known to Mafia bosses. By 1957, he had become closely associated with the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino family]] and was chosen to manage their profits from [[heroin]] sales.

==International banker==
Within a year of the Gambino family's choosing him to manage their heroin profits, Sindona had bought his first bank. He also became a friend of future Pope [[Giovanni Battista Montini]]'s; Montini was at the time Cardinal of the [[Archdiocese of Milan]]. By the time Montini became Pope Paul VI, Sindona had acquired, through his holding company [[Fasco]], many more Italian banks, and his progress continued right up to the beginning of his association with the [[Vatican Bank]] in 1969. Huge amounts of money moved from Sindona's banks through the Vatican to [[Swiss banks]], and he began speculating against major currencies on a large scale.{{cn|date=July 2013}}

In 1972, Sindona purchased a controlling interest in [[Long Island]]'s [[Franklin National Bank]]. He was hailed as "the saviour of the lira" and was named "Man of the Year" in January 1974 by the US ambassador to Italy, [[John Volpe]]. But that April, a sudden stock market crash led to what is known as ''Il Crack Sindona''. The Franklin Bank's profit fell by as much as 98% compared to the previous year, and Sindona suffered a 40 million dollar loss. Consequently, he began losing most of the banks he had acquired over the previous seventeen years. On October 8, 1974, the bank was declared [[insolvent]] due to mismanagement and [[fraud]], involving losses in foreign currency [[speculation]] and poor loan policies.&lt;ref name=tim070480&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,921970,00.html |title=Account Settled|work=TIME|date= April 7, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[the Mafia]] ''[[pentito]]'' [[Francesco Marino Mannoia]], Sindona laundered the proceeds of heroin trafficking for the [[Stefano Bontade|Bontade]]-Spatola-[[Salvatore Inzerillo|Inzerillo]]-[[Rosario Gambino|Gambino]] network. The mafiosi were determined to get their money back and would play an important role in Sindona's attempt to save his banks.&lt;ref name=rep131002&gt;{{cite news|language=Italian|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/calvi/giuffre/giuffre.html |title=Anche Antonino Giuffré nell'inchiesta Calvi|work= La Repubblica|date=October 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest, trial and death==
On July 11, 1979, [[Giorgio Ambrosoli]], the lawyer who was commissioned as [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] of Sindona's banks, was murdered in [[Milan]]. [[Milan]]ese Councilman Antonio Amati turned the case over to a young judge, Giuliano Turone. It was discovered that Michele Sindona ordered Ambrosoli's murder (which was carried out by an American [[assassination|assassin]]). At the same time, the Mafia killed police superintendent [[Boris Giuliano]] in [[Palermo]]. He was investigating the Mafia’s heroin trafficking and had contacted Ambrosoli just two weeks before that to compare investigations.&lt;ref name=sterling190&gt;{{cite book|author=Sterling|title=Octopus|page= 190-202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While under indictment in the US, Sindona pretended to have been [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] in August 1979, to conceal a mysterious 11-week trip to Sicily before his scheduled fraud trial. The brother-in-law of Mafia boss [[Stefano Bontade]], Giacomo Vitale, was one of the persons who organized Sindona’s travel. The real purpose of the "kidnapping" was to issue thinly-disguised blackmail notes to Sindona’s past political allies – among them Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] – to engineer the rescue of his banks and recover the [[Cosa Nostra]]’s money.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Crimi later admitted to the judges that he went to [[Arezzo]] to talk with [[Licio Gelli]] about Sindona's situation. Licio Gelli then started to interest two judges, Giuliano Turone and [[Gherardo Colombo]].

The plot failed. After his supposed release from the kidnappers Sindona surrendered to the FBI. He was convicted in 1980 in the United States on 65 counts, including [[fraud]], [[perjury]], false bank statements, and misappropriation of bank funds. He was represented by one of the nation's leading attorneys, [[Ivan Fisher]]. While Sindona was serving time in US Federal Prison, the Italian government applied for his extradition back to Italy to stand trial for murder. "The Shark" was sentenced to 25 years in Italian prison on March 27, 1984. On March 18, 1986, he was poisoned with cyanide in his coffee, in his cell at the prison in [[Voghera]] while serving a life sentence for the murder of Giorgio Ambrosoli.&lt;ref name=nyt230386&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/23/world/michele-sindona-jailed-italian-financier-dies-cyanide-poisoning-65-center.html |title=Michele Sindona, Jailed Italian Financier, Dies of Cyanide Poisoning at 65|work=The New York Times|date= March 23, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mourning ring''' is a [[finger ring]] worn in memory of someone who has died.&lt;ref name=tait /&gt;  It often bears the name and date of death of the person, and possibly an image of them, or a motto. They were usually paid for by the person commemorated, or their heirs, and often specified, along with the list of intended recipients, in wills.&lt;ref name=Barton /&gt;  Stones mounted on the rings were usually black, and where it could be afforded [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] was the preferred option.&lt;ref name=cw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/fine-jewelry/mourning |title=Antique Mourning Jewelry |website=Collectors weekly |publisher=Market Street Media |access-date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise cheaper black materials such as  black [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] or [[Ebonite|vulcanite]] were used.&lt;ref name=cw /&gt; White enamel was used on occasion particularly where the deceased was a child.&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{cite book |last=Church |first=Rachel |date=2014 |title=Rings |publisher=V&amp;A Publishing |pages=67–73 |isbn=9781851777853}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also saw some use when the person being mourned had not married.&lt;ref name=ash1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/ash/objects/makedetail.php?pmu=153&amp;mu=154&amp;gty=asea&amp;sec=&amp;dtn=15&amp;sfn=Object,Accession%20Number%28s%29,Place%20of%20Production&amp;cpa=1&amp;obj=Mourning%20ring&amp;date=&amp;date=&amp;cre=&amp;anum=&amp;des=&amp;pop=&amp;rpos=3 |title=Mourning ring |website=ashmus.ox.ac.uk |publisher=University of Oxford - Ashmolean Museum |access-date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases a lock of hair of the deceased person would be incorporated into the ring.&lt;ref name=Church /&gt; The [[Hair jewellery|use of hair]] in mourning rings was not as widespread as it might have been due to concerns that the hair of the deceased would be substituted with other hair.&lt;ref name=wall&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/blog/posts/mourning-jewellery-remembering-the-dearly-departed |title=Mourning Jewellery:Remembering the Dearly Departed |last1=Wall |first1=Josie |date=19 Jan 2015 |website=birmingham museums |publisher=birmingham museums |access-date=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of mourning rings dates back to at least the 14th century,&lt;ref name=tait /&gt; although it is only in the 17th century that they clearly separated from more general [[Memento mori]] rings.&lt;ref name=Barton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2013/10/31/mourning-rings-portable-and-poignant-souvenirs/ |title=Mourning rings: portable and poignant souvenirs |last1=Barton |first1=Caroline |date=31 October 2013 |website=britishmuseum.org |publisher=British Museum |access-date=31 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402162649/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2013/10/31/mourning-rings-portable-and-poignant-souvenirs/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-18th century jewelers had started to advertise the speed with which such rings could be made.&lt;ref name=Church /&gt; The style largely settled upon was a single small stone with details of the decedent recorded in enamel on the hoop.&lt;ref name=Church /&gt; In the latter half of the 19th century the style shifted towards mass produced rings featuring a photograph mounted on the [[Bezel (jewellery)|bezel]] before the use of mourning rings largely ceased towards the end of the century.&lt;ref name=tait&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Tait |editor-first=Hugh |date=2006 |title=7000 Years of Jewellery |publisher=British Museum Press|page=239 |isbn=9780714150321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of mourning rings resurfaced in the 1930s and 1940s in the United States.&lt;ref name=Byrne /&gt; The rings were made of [[bakelite]] and mounted a small picture of the person being mourned.&lt;ref name=Byrne&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyextra.com/qa/funeral-practices |title=When did the practice of funeral rings begin/end and how widespread was it? |last1=Byrne |first1=Eugene |date=30 March 2012 |website=Historyextra |publisher=[[Immediate Media Company Ltd]] |access-date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mourning rings have sometimes been made to mark occasions other than a person's death.&lt;ref name=Elspeth63 /&gt; In 1793 one was made for [[William Skirving]] after he was sentenced to [[penal transportation]].&lt;ref name=Elspeth63&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Elspeth |date=1993 |title=The Hidden History of Glasgow's Women: The Thenew Factor |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |page=63 |isbn=1851584048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gehirn, medial - beschriftet lat.svg|thumb|Brain]] 
'''Pediatric acquired brain injury''' (PABI) is the number one cause of death and disability for children and young adults in the [[United States]]."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and effects most children ages (6-10) and adolescent ages (11-17) around the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  The injury can be traumatic or non-traumatic in nature, and most patients never return to normal after suffering from the injury.There are many different symptoms such as [[amnesia]], [[anhedonia]], and [[apraxia]]. Currently there isn’t a cure for the injury. PABI effects the family of the patient also, because the families of the patient will need to adapt to the new changes they will experience in their child.  It is recommended{{who|date=January 2015}} that the families decide to gain as much information as they can about the injury and what to expect by going to different program events and meetings. 

== Symptoms ==
[[File:PET-image.jpg|thumb|Brain Scan]]
Some symptoms that result from an acquired brain injury are amnesia, anhedonia, and apraxia.

=== Amnesia ===
"Childhood amnesia is the inability to remember one’s own childhood."  Researchers found that some everyday activities such as speaking, running, or playing a guitar, cannot be described or remembered.

=== Anhedonia ===
A child that is diagnosed with anhedonia would lack interest in some usual activities, such as hobbies, playing sports, or engaging with friends.  
It’s very essential for a child to be able to enjoy fun childhood activities because it can help them build a social life, and easily interact with others. Not being able to do these things at a young age will only make it harder to adapt as the child gets older.

=== Apraxia ===

"Apraxia is the inability to execute learned purposeful movements, despite having the desire and the physical capacity to perform the movements." In this case, the child could have still have the memory of doing a usual activity such as riding a bike, but still not be able to accomplish the movement.

== Pathophysiology  ==

The pediatric brain undergoes dramatic changes and significant pruning of neural networks throughout [[developmental biology|development]].  Whereby the areas for primary senses and motor skills are mostly developed by age 4, other areas, like the [[frontal cortices]] involved in higher level reasoning, [[decision-making]], [[emotion]], and [[impulsivity]] continue to develop well into the late teens to early 20s.  Therefore, the patient’s age and brain developmental state influence what neuronal systems become most affected post-injury.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toledo|first1=E|last2=Lebel|first2=A|last3=Becerra|first3=L|last4=Minster|first4=A|last5=Linnman|first5=C|last6=Maleki|first6=N|last7=Dodick|first7=DW|last8=Borsook|first8=D|title=The young brain and concussion: imaging as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis.|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=July 2012|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1510–31|pmid=22476089|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.03.007|pmc=3372677}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key structural features of the pediatric brain make the brain tissue more susceptible to the mechanical injury during TBI than the adult brain: a larger water content in the brain tissue and reduced myelination results in diminished shear resistance after injury. It has also been shown that more immature brains have an enlarged extracellular space volume and a decreased expression of glial [[aquaporin 4]] leading to an increased incidence of brain swelling after TBI.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=R|last2=Fritz|first2=H|title=Pathophysiology of traumatic injury in the developing brain: an introduction and short update.|journal=Experimental and Toxicologic Pathology|date=October 2004|volume=56|issue=1–2|pages=65–73|pmid=15581277|doi=10.1016/j.etp.2004.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Along with a delayed decrease in [[cerebral blood flow]], these unique features of the developing brain can mediate further secondary damage, through [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[excitotoxicity]], [[free radical]] damage, and [[neuroinflammation]] after the primary injury.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Even properties of these secondary events differ between the developing brain and the adult brain: (1) in the developing brain, the overexpression and activation of the [[N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor]] (NMDA-R) leads to an increased [[calcium]] influx and an increased capacity for excitoxicity when compared to the adult brain and (2) the developing brain has lower [[glutathione peroxidase]] activity and a decreased ability to maintain stores of glutathione peroxidase, therefore the developing brain is more vulnerable to [[oxidative stress]] than the adult brain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Damage to the developing brain, by any of the above mechanisms, can disturb neuronal maturation, leading to neuronal loss, axonal destruction, and demyelination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keightley|first1=ML|last2=Sinopoli|first2=KJ|last3=Davis|first3=KD|last4=Mikulis|first4=DJ|last5=Wennberg|first5=R|last6=Tartaglia|first6=MC|last7=Chen|first7=JK|last8=Tator|first8=CH|title=Is there evidence for neurodegenerative change following traumatic brain injury in children and youth?

=== ''Neurocognitive Problems in Children After Traumatic Brain Injury'' ===
Delayed physiological responses post-TBI can lead to neurodegeneration in various parts of the brain in both chronic and severe cases in children. The parts of the brain that have been proven to be affected include: the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], [[globus pallidus]], [[thalamus]], periventricular [[white matter]], [[cerebellum]], and [[brainstem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keightley|first1=Michelle|title=Is there evidence for neurodegenerative change following Traumatic Brain Injury in children and youth? A scoping review|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=March 2014|volume=8|issue=139|pages=1–6|pmid=24678292|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00139|pmc=3958726}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this can lead to behavioral and cognitive problems in [[child development]]. Behavioral changes have been characterized as "externalizing" and "internalizing" problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Liu|title=The effect of pediatric traumatic brain injury on behavioral outcomes: a systematic review|journal=Dev Med Child Neurol|date=January 2013|volume=55|issue=1|pages=37–45|pmid=22998525|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2012.04414.x|pmc=3593091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing problems include different forms of [[aggression]], [[hyperactivity]], and [[impulsivity]]. The most common of these problems result from changes in attention and focus, such as ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloom|first1=DR|title=Lifetime and novel psychiatric disorders after pediatric traumatic brain injury|journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry|date=May 2001|volume=40|issue=5|pages=572–579|pmid=11349702|doi=10.1097/00004583-200105000-00017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internalizing issues include psychiatric problems such as short-term and long-term [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety]], personality disorders, and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Several variables can determine the outcome of behavioral problems in children post-TBI. For example, children that are already suffer from behavioral issues before injury are more likely to develop long-term cognitive problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeates|first1=KO|title=Long-term attention problems in children with traumatic brain injury|journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry|date=June 2005|volume=44|issue=6|pages=574–584|pmid=15908840|doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000159947.50523.64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important factor is the severity of the injury, which can be a predictor of how long behavioral symptoms last and if they will increase over time.

Statistically about 54% to 63% of children develop novel psychiatric disorders about 24 months after severe TBI, and 10% to 21% after mild or moderate TBI, the most common of which is personality change due to TBI. The symptoms may last for 6 to 24 months on average.&lt;ref name=max&gt;{{cite journal |author=Max JE |title=Neuropsychiatry of Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury  |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=125–140 |date=January 2014 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psc.2013.11.003 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2013.11.003 |pmc=3977029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of [[post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] is common (68%) in the first few weeks post-injury with a decline in the course of 2 years. In cases of severe TBI about one third of children develop [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name="max"/&gt; Children with severe TBI also have some effects on working memory, visual immediate memory, and more prominent consequences in intellectual functioning, [[Executive functions|executive functioning]] (including speed processing and attention), and verbal immediate and delayed memory. Some recovery is observed during the first 2 years post-injury.&lt;ref name=babikan&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Babikian T, Asarnow R |title= Neurocognitive outcomes and recovery after pediatric TBI: meta-analytic review of the literature |journal= Neuropsychology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=283–96 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19413443 |pmc=4064005 |doi=10.1037/a0015268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with moderate TBI only show some decline in attention and problem solving, but larger effects in visual immediate memory.&lt;ref name="babikan"/&gt; The [[Frontal lobe injury|superior frontal lesions]] correlate with the type of outcome, but more importantly, subcortical network damage may affect the recovery due to the lesions in white matter tracts.&lt;ref name="max"/&gt; Children with severe TBI are at higher risk for not achieving developmentally appropriate gains and not catching up with peers at school due to the crucial stage of learning at which their neural networks are disrupted by the injury.&lt;ref name="babikan"/&gt;

=== ''Behavior of Those Suffering from Pediatric Brain Injury'' ===

In children and adolescents that have an [[acquired brain injury]], the cognitive and emotional difficulties that come about from their injury can negatively impact their level of participation in home, school and other social situations. This puts the patient at a disadvantage because they won’t nearly as social, or able to participate in a school setting as an ordinary child would. Involvement in social situations is important for the normal development of children as a means of gaining an understanding of how to effectively work together with others. Group work is a huge factor is academics today, and the child’s ability to work within groups will be ineffective. Furthermore, young people with an acquired brain injury are often reported as having insufficient problem solving skills. This has the potential to hinder their performance in various academic and social settings further. It is important for rehabilitation programs to deal with these challenges specific to children who have not fully developed at the time of their injury.
==Diagnosis==
===Definition===


The term "pediatric" in this case encompasses brain injuries sustained from birth up to age 25, since the developing brain does not finish maturing until that time. An acquired brain injury (ABI) can be sustained from [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) such as falls, motor vehicle incidents, sports concussions, blast injuries from war, assaults/child abuse, gunshot wounds, etc.) and non-traumatic brain injury (i.e. [[stroke]], [[brain tumors]], [[infection]], [[poisoning]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[ischemia]], [[encephalopathy]] or [[substance abuse]]).

== Training ==
There are many different ways to "train" the children diagnosed with Pediatric Brain Injury. The training mainly tests their brain, to see exactly what’s wrong with the patient, and what areas need to be focused on for improvement.

=== AIM Program ===
"AIM is a 10-week, computerized treatment program that incorporates goal setting, the use of metacognitive strategies, and computer-based exercises designed to improve various aspects of attention."&lt;ref name=Study&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sohlberg|first1=Mckay|last2=MacPherson|first2=Holly|last3=Wade|first3=Shari|title=A Pilot Study Evaluating Attention And Strategy Training Following Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury|date=2014|pages=2, 5, 6, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"During the initial meeting with the child, the computer program leads the clinician through an intake procedure that assists in identifying the nature and severity of the child’s attention difficulties and then facilitates the selection of attention training tasks and metacognitive strategies tailored to the needs of the child." The clinician’s role is to select the specific, presenting mental areas that are impaired, as well as to modify the tasks and strategies in response to improvements of the patients’ overtime.&lt;ref name=Study /&gt; This is a helpful way to figure out what problems the child/adolescent is facing, while also helping them to gradually improve their injury.

=== Parent’s Assistance for Patients ===
"Investigators have established that interventions for pediatric BI should target the family because changes in one family member will affect the entire family system."&lt;ref name=family /&gt;
"During rehabilitation, caregivers often receive skills training to improve their ability to care for their child after their brain injury.&lt;ref name=family /&gt;
Family realignment and adjusting the child’s environment are two major ways parents can make the distresses of the injury easier on their child. Some beneficial ways parents can realign their household are applying consequences to minimize problem behaviors, increasing the amount of positive communication between parents and child with injury, and establishing positive routines that will instill meaning into the child’s day-to-day life.&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=Wesley|last2=Paulos|first2=Stephanie|title=A Review of Family Intervention Guidelines for Pediatric Acquired Brain Injuries|date=2009|pages=2, 5, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pokémon FireRed Version''''' and '''''LeafGreen Version'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|''Pokémon FireRed Version'' and ''LeafGreen Version''|ポケットモンスターファイアレッド・リーフグリーン|Poketto Monsutā Faiareddo &amp; Rīfugurīn|lit. "Pocket Monsters: FireRed &amp; LeafGreen"}}}} are [[enhanced remake]]s of the 1996 video games [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']]. The new titles were developed by [[Game Freak]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and have compatibility with the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter]], which originally came bundled with the games. ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' were first released in Japan in January 2004 and released in North America and Europe in September and October respectively. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as [[Player's Choice]] titles. The two games hold the distinction of being the first enhanced remakes of previous games within the franchise.

The games are part of the third generation of the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' series]] of [[role-playing video game]]s. As in previous games, the player controls the [[player character]] from an [[Top-down perspective|overhead perspective]] and participates in [[turn-based]] combat encounters. However, new features such as a contextual help menu and a new region the player may access have also been added. Throughout the games, the player [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Catching Pokémon|captures]] and raises Pokémon for use in battle.

The games received mostly positive reviews, obtaining an aggregate score of 81&amp;nbsp;percent on [[Metacritic]]. Most critics praised the fact that the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and lacked improvement compared to the previous games, 
[[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]. ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide.

==Gameplay==
{{see also|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
[[File:Pokémon FireRed first battle.png|left|frame|alt=An orange lizard with a flame on its tail is on the bottom left, battling a blue turtle with a brown shell in the top right. At the very bottom is a text box, giving players four options (fight, use an item, change to another creature, leave the battle) they can usescene, the Pokémon at the top right of the screen is the opponent's; the Pokémon at the bottom left is the players. The player's options are shown at the bottom right.]]
As with all ''Pokémon'' role-playing games released for [[handheld game console|handheld consoles]], ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' are in [[third-person (video games)|third-person]], [[overhead perspective]]. The main screen is an [[overworld]], in which the player navigates the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Game Freak|title=Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Instruction Booklet|publisher =[[Nintendo]]|year=2004|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure his or her Pokémon, items, and gameplay settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Game Freak|title=Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|year=2004|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the player [[random encounter|encounters a wild Pokémon]] or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a [[turn-based]] battle screen that displays the player's Pokémon and the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a [[Pokémon moves|move]] for his or her Pokémon to perform, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. All Pokémon have [[health (gaming)|hit points]] (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, all of the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain amount of [[experience point]]s (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon may [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Game Freak|title=Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|year=2004|pages=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gameplay of Pokémon#Catching Pokémon|Capturing Pokémon]] is another essential element of the gameplay. During a battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a [[Poké Ball]] at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the type of Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.&lt;ref name="battle"&gt;{{cite book|author=Game Freak|title=Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Instruction Booklet|publisher =[[Nintendo]]|year=2004|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' are remakes of ''Red'' and ''Green'' (''Pokémon Green'' was only released in Japan, whereas the American version was ''Blue''), they contain usability enhancements such as a contextual tutorial feature which allows players to look up data at any point in the game. Additionally, when continuing a [[saved game]], players are shown the last four actions they performed, allowing them to remember what they were doing.&lt;ref name=ignpreview /&gt;

The games support the [[Game Link Cable#Third eneration|Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable]], through which connected players may trade or battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Game Freak|title=Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Instruction Booklet|publisher =[[Nintendo]]|year=2004|pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may also connect with [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], as well as with ''[[Pokémon Colosseum]]'', allowing them to obtain over 350 Pokémon.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/544/544549p1.html|title=Pokemon FireRed Version Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=2004-09-03|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' also have the ability to connect to the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and interact with ''[[Pokémon Box: Ruby and Sapphire]]''. In ''Box'', the player may organize and view his or her collected Pokémon, and in ''Colosseum'', Pokémon may be used in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Game Freak]]|title=Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Instruction Booklet|publisher =[[Nintendo]]|year=2004|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' are also the first games in the series to be compatible with the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter]], which comes prepackaged with the games.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The adapter can be plugged into the link port of the Game Boy Advance system and allows players within a radius of 30–50 feet (9–15 meters) to wirelessly interact with each other.&lt;ref name=ignpreview /&gt; In addition, as many as 30&amp;nbsp;players at a time may join a special location called the "Union Room", where they can trade, battle, or chat.&lt;ref name=IGN /&gt; Nintendo has set up "JoySpots" at Japanese retail locations for this purpose.&lt;ref name=ignpreview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/513/513263p1.html|title=Pokemon FireRed Version Preview|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2004-05-11|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting===
''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' takes place mostly in the fictional region of [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]]. This is one distinct region of many in the Pokémon world, which includes varied geographical habitats for the Pokémon species, human-populated towns and cities, and routes between locations. Some areas are only accessible once the player acquires a special item or one of the player's Pokémon learns a special ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Game Freak|title=Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|year=2004|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the plot, the protagonist is able to venture to the Sevii Islands, a new area not present in the original ''Red'' and ''Blue'' games. The Sevii Islands are an [[archipelago]] of seven islands and contain Pokémon normally exclusive to the Johto region, as well as several post-game missions. After the aforementioned missions on the Sevii Islands are completed, the ability to trade with [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] for Hoenn-exclusive Pokémon becomes available.

===Synopsis===
The silent protagonist of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' is a child who lives in a small town named Pallet Town. After players start a journey and venture alone into tall grass, a voice warns them to stop. [[Professor Oak]], a famous Pokémon researcher, explains to the player that such grass is often the habitat of wild Pokémon, and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, another aspiring [[Pokémon Trainer]]. The player and their rival are both instructed to select a [[starter Pokémon]] for their travels. The rival then challenges the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon and continues to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.

After reaching the next city, the player is asked to deliver a parcel to Professor Oak. Upon returning to the laboratory, the player is presented with a [[Pokédex]], a high-tech encyclopedia that records the entries of any Pokémon that are captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Game Freak|title=Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|year=2004|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oak asks the player to fulfill his dream of compiling a comprehensive list of every Pokémon in the game.

While visiting the region's cities, the player encounters special establishments called [[Pokémon game mechanics#Pokémon Gyms|Gyms]]. Inside these buildings are Gym Leaders, each of whom the player must defeat in a Pokémon battle to obtain a Gym Badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Game Freak|title=Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|year=2004|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a total of eight badges are acquired, the player is given permission to enter the Pokémon League, which consists of the best Pokémon trainers in the region. There the player battles the [[List of Pokémon characters#Kanto members|Elite Four]]. Also throughout the game, the player has to fight against the forces of [[Team Rocket]], a criminal organization that abuses Pokémon. They devise numerous plans to steal rare Pokémon, all of which the player must foil, meeting and defeating the organization boss Giovanni.

After the first time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of the members, Lorelei, disappears. After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with him. Once more, the protagonist must thwart the Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the Ruby and the Sapphire, and put them in the main computer at One Island. After that, the player can communicate, battle, trade, etc., with Ruby and Sapphire.

==Development==
[[File:JunichiMasudaJI1.jpg|right|thumb|Development director Junichi Masuda]]
''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' were first announced in September 2003 as upcoming remakes of the original [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pocket Monsters Red'' and ''Green'']] games that were released in Japan in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/pokemonred/news.html?sid=6075120&amp;mode=news|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xiyWsx3k?url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/pokemonred/news.html?sid=6075120&amp;mode=news|archivedate=2011-04-05|title=Pokémon remakes on the way|date=2003-09-15|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|author=GameSpot Staff|accessdate=2009-06-17|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Video game producer|Game director]] [[Junichi Masuda]] stated the new titles would be developed around the idea of simplicity,&lt;ref name="blog11"/&gt; as the game engine was a slightly modified version of the one used in [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]. As a result, ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' were made fully [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', allowing players to [[Global Trade Station|trade Pokémon]] between games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/437/437883p1.html|title=More Pokemon for GBA|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist)|date=2003-09-12|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'''s connectivity with the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter]] was heralded by Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] as being able "to enhance head-to-head battles, exchange of information, and communication with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/pokemonred/news.html?sid=6075891|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xiyI1vE5?url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/pokemonred/news.html?sid=6075891|archivedate=2011-04-05|title=TGS 2003: Wireless GBA multiplayer for 2004|date=2003-09-26|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=Justin|last=Calvert|accessdate=2009-06-17|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An enhanced interface was created for the game to increase usability for new players, as well as a contextual in-game help system that could aid lost or confused players during their journey. President of [[The Pokémon Company]] Tsunekazu Ishiharu noted, "We don't feel that this a remake at all. We feel that this is a new game, with wireless technology", referring to the bundled wireless adapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/514/514962p1.html|title=E3 2004: The Pokémon Creators Speak|date=2004-05-13|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music used in the titles was derived from the classic game consoles, and arranged by Go Ichinose. Masuda and Ichinose decided not to change the reused music from the basic background sounds used in the originals, and instead updated them by adding additional sounds. Some of the songs have additional key changes compared to the original soundtrack and some songs that are re-written for the GBA contain [[Portamento|sliding]] between notes.&lt;ref name="blog125"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hjhYMgTb?url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=143|archivedate=2009-06-23|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=143|title=Hidden Power of Masuda|date=2008-02-28|accessdate=2009-06-22|author=Masuda, Junichi|publisher=Game Freak|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-disc set of the music entitled ''GBA Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen Super Complete'' was released, with the first disc featuring all the music used normally in-game, while the second disc featured bonus tracks based on and inspired by the music in the games. Among these are two vocal tracks.&lt;ref name="RPGFan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/pokemon-fl/index.html|title=GBA Pokémon Firered &amp; Leafgreen Music Super Complete|publisher=RPGFan|author=Rubinshteyn, Dennis|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exclusive Japanese production run for ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' was limited to half a million copies, despite the success of ''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. [[IGN]] speculated that Nintendo was expecting less demand for the new games, or that it was limited by the production of the bundled wireless adapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/463/463431p1.html|title=Nintendo holds back on Pokémon|date=2004-01-16|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The east American versions of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' were secondly indirectly announced at [[D.I.C.E.

During its first week of release in Japan, ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' sold a combined total of 885,039 copies, which was less than the amount sold by [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] in that time period, but [[IGN]] reasoned that the smaller sales were due to the new titles being remakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/488/488976p1.html|title=Pokemania|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|date=2004-02-02|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of August before ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' were released in the U.S., the games received over 150,000 [[pre-order]]s, over twice the amount that ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' received. Nintendo's Senior Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Communication [[George Harrison (executive)|George Harrison]] remarked, "This pre-sell indicates more than twice the player interest!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/540/540749p1.html|title=Pokemon Games Receive Huge Pre-Order Numbers|publisher=IGN|first=James B.|last=Pringle|date=2004-08-20|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over one million copies of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' were sold in the US less than one month after their release in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/554/554381p1.html|title=GBA Game of the Month: September 2004|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist)|date=2004-10-05|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 31, 2008, the games had sold 11.82&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2008/080425e.pdf#page=6|title=Financial Results Briefing for Fiscal Year Ended March 2008|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2008-04-25|page=6|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games later entered Nintendo's [[Player's Choice]] line in North America and were re-marketed with a significantly lower retail price. However, unlike the original release, the Player's Choice edition games did not include a bundled [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter|Wireless Adapter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/721/721379p1.html|title=IGN: Player's Choice, Round Two|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=2006-07-26|accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' were mostly positive, and the games currently hold an aggregate score of 81&amp;nbsp;percent on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/gba/pokemonfirered?q=Pokemon|title=Pokemon FireRed (gba: 2004): Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618002929/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/gba/pokemonfirered?q=Pokemon |archivedate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Harris of [[IGN]] gave the games an "Outstanding" 9.0/10 rating and praised the creators of the games for creating a game that "works extremely well for the handheld market. It doesn't have quite the same variety as ''Ruby''/''Sapphire'', but it's still incredibly satisfying." Harris was less positive about the games' graphics, which he thought were "limited" and "basic".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Greg Kasavin, who gave the games 8.4 out of 10, commented that "though Pokémon could probably use a few new twists after all these years, FireRed and LeafGreen are great role-playing games on their own merits, filled with lots more content and more challenges than last year's Ruby and Sapphire, and offering up plenty of addictive gameplay that can be a lot of fun for players of all ages." Unlike Harris, Kasavin praised the games' graphics for their "colorful good looks and the endearing character designs that the series is known for."&lt;ref name="gamespotreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/pokemonred/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;review|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xiyMPfm1?url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/pokemonred/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;review|archivedate=2011-04-05|title=Pokemon FireRed Version Review|last=Kasavin|first=Greg|date=September 7, 2004|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-06-23|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' rated the games a "Very Good" 8/10 for being "a lot of fun", yet they saw the graphics as "utterly unremarkable" when compared to other handheld games.&lt;ref name="GI review"/&gt;

[[GameSpy]] reviewer Phil Theobald, who awarded the games four out of five stars, stated, "Before I knew it, I was hooked all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles was just too much to resist. And yeah, the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's just something about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the "ugly" original ''Red'' and ''Blue'' versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless adapter.&lt;ref name="gamespy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-fire-red/545280p1.html|title=GameSpy: Pokémon FireRed|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|first=Phil|last=Theobald|date=2004-09-07|accessdate=2009-06-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110142530/http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-fire-red/545280p1.html|archivedate=2009-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6647">The term "'''Polish Border Strip'''" ({{lang-de|Polnischer Grenzstreifen}}; {{lang-pl|polski pas graniczny}}) or "'''Polish Frontier Strip'''" refers to those territories which the [[German Empire]] wanted to annex from [[Congress Poland]] after [[World War I]]. It appeared in plans proposed by German officials as a territory to be annexed by [[German Empire]] after an expected German and [[Central Powers]] victory. German planners also envisioned forced expulsion and resettlement of the [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Jewish people|Jewish]] population which would be replaced by [[Germans|German]] colonists.&lt;ref name="border strip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goemans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legacies of Violence: Eastern Europe’s First World War  Jochen Böhler, Wlodzimierz Borodziej, Joachim von Puttkamer page 119  Germans in the East 1914-1918:Fantasies of Forced Movement&lt;/ref&gt;The proposed area of the Border Strip comprised up to 30,000 km² (approximately the size of Belgium), and up to 3 million people were to be ethnicly cleansed by the German Empire to make room for Germans.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elusive Alliance: The German Occupation of Poland in World War I  Jesse Kauffman - 2015 ''The ethnic cleansing foreseen by the border strip's champions''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Empires in World War I: Shifting Frontiers and Imperial Dynamics in a Global ConflictRichard Fogarty, Andrew Jarboe
I.B.Tauris, 2014 ''this idea developed into one of annexing a Polish border strip, or frontier strip ... by ethnically cleansing the area of nationalist Poles and colonising the region with Germans from das Altreich''&lt;/ref&gt; The strip was also intended to separate the Polish inhabitants of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]]-held [[Greater Poland]] from those in Congress Poland.

The idea of future "buffer zone" to be cleared of Poles and Jews as discussed officially at highest levels as early as 1914&lt;ref&gt;Germans, Poland, and Colonial Expansion to the East: 1850 Through the Present R. Nelson, page 80 "The Archive for Inner Colonization, the German East, and World War"
&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 1917 the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German supreme command]] under [[Erich Ludendorff|General Ludendorff]], as part of the debate and planning regarding the cession of the "border strip" to Germany, specified its own designs in a memorandum.&lt;ref name="border strip"&gt;Keith Bullivant, Geoffrey J. Giles, Walter Pape, ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042006889&amp;id=jXKk-gs-VNEC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22kingdom+of+Poland%22+1916&amp;sig=NjXAsXW-c7jn2mG-QckYol3iCoI Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identity and Cultural Differences]'', Rodopi (1999), p. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed annexing a greatly enlarged "border strip" of 20,000 square kilometres, and ethnically cleansing its Polish and Jewish population (numbering between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000&lt;ref name="Geiss"&gt;Immanuel Geiss ''Tzw. polski pas graniczny 1914-1918''. Warszawa (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;) from a territory of 8,000 square kilometres and settling it with ethnic Germans.&lt;ref name="border strip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goemans"&gt;Hein Erich Goemans, ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0691049440&amp;id=gsrFn2iR0eUC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;printsec=8&amp;dq=%22Kingdom+of+Poland%22+1916&amp;sig=z_Ubb4sE6O-WG07R0pRl7BmdL48 War and Punishment: The Causes of War Termination and the First World War]'', [[Princeton University Press]] (2000), p. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carole Fink, ''Defending the Rights of Others: The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection, 1878-1938'' Cambridge University Press (2006), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Poles living in Prussia, especially in the [[Province of Posen|province of Posen]], were to be "encouraged" by unspecified means to move into the German-ruled [[puppet state]] of [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Kingdom of Poland]].&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

The German minority living in Congress Poland, which had earlier suggested the annexation of all territory up to [[Łódź]] in a letter to the German government, also supported such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;
Aleksander Kraushar, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060928034304/http://www.biblioteka.warszawa1939.pl/books/book/okupacja/53.jpg Warszawa podczas okupacji niemieckiej 1915-1918]'', Lwów (1921), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The German government developed and agreed to these plans in March 1918, and in April gained support in the [[Prussian House of Lords]]; the plans for this were debated and developed across a wide spectrum of political parties and interested groups such as [[Political science|political scientists]], industrialists, and nationalist organisations like the [[Pan-German League]].&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

[[Friedrich von Schwerin]], head of administration in Frankfurt/Oder and chairman of the Society for Inner Colonization stated "The German people, the greatest colonizing people on earth, have again been given a great colonizing task. The current world war provides the opportunity for Germany to resume in a resolute way its colonizing mission in the East''.
For admnistrators like Schwerin the plan was to be accompanied by massive expulsion of Poles as in his words""new land can usually only be won at the expense of those who own the land"&lt;ref&gt;Shatterzone of Empires: Coexistence and Violence in the German, Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman Borderlands, Indiana University Press 2013, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;. The German nobility in certain versions of the plan were to become "colonial administration"&lt;ref&gt;Germany Turns Eastwards: A Study of Ostforschung in the Third Reich, 1991 Michael Burleigh, page 21
&lt;/ref&gt;
The plan has been described by historian Hajo Holborn as the first instance in modern European history of planning the removal of whole populations as a solution to national conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840-1945''. Princeton University Press (1982), p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the Polish population all resistance to Germanization of Polish territories would be bypassed&lt;ref&gt;hatterzone of Empires Coexistence and Violence in the German, Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman Borderlands Edited by Omer Bartov and Eric D Weitz 2013 page 55&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parts of the plans were adopted by Nazi Germany after the war, and implemented in the genocidal [[Generalplan Ost]].&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

'''Promession''' is an idea of how to dispose [[Disposal of human corpses|human remains]] by way of [[freeze drying]]. The concept of promession was developed by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[biologist]] Susanne Wiigh-Mäsak, who derived the name from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for "promise" (''promessa'').&lt;ref name=holst&gt;{{cite news|last=Holst|first=Karen|title=Swedish green-burial firm to turn frozen corpses in compost|url=http://www.thelocal.se/33178/20110413/|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She founded [[Promessa Organic]]&amp;nbsp;[[Aktiebolag|AB]] in 1997 to commercially pursue her idea.&lt;ref name=undertaker&gt;{{cite news|last=McNally|first=Patrick|title=Promession: A Return to the Living Soil|url=http://www.dailyundertaker.com/2008/09/promession-return-to-living-soil.html|accessdate=26 September 2012|newspaper=Daily Undertaker|date=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was liquidated 2015 without being able to produce a functioning facility. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bohuslaningen.se/nyheter/orust/promessa-slutligen-i-konkurs-1.925619|title=Promessa slutligen i konkurs|work=Bohusläningen|access-date=2018-09-12|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of promession is questioned and not a functional method according to critics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1637&amp;artikel=3818201|title=Ekologisk begravning - Studio Ett|last=Radio|first=Sveriges|website=sverigesradio.se|language=sv|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Promession involves five steps:
# [[Coffin]] separation: the body is placed into the chamber
# Cryogenic freezing: [[liquid nitrogen]] at −196 [[°C]] crystallizes the body
# Vibration: the body is disintegrated into particles within minutes
# Freeze drying: particles are freeze dried in a drying chamber, leaving approximately 30% of the original weight
# Metal separation: any metals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;tooth [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[Hip replacement|artificial hip]]s, etc.) are removed, either by magnetism or by sieving. The dry powder is placed in a [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] [[casket]] which is interred in the top [[Soil horizon|layers of soil]], where aerobic bacteria decompose the remains into [[humus]] in as little as 6–12 months.

Broadly speaking, a '''risk assessment''' is the combined effort of 1. identifying and analyzing potential (future) events that may negatively impact individuals, assets, and/or the environment (i.e., risk analysis); and 2. making judgments "on the tolerability of the risk on the basis of a risk analysis" while considering influencing factors (i.e., risk evaluation).&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EHeLmbUVh8C&amp;pg=PT21 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |title=Risk Assessment: Theory, Methods, and Applications |author=Rausand, M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–28 |year=2013 |isbn=9780470637647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqjLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |chapter=Chapter 1: Risk Assessments: Their Significance and the Role of the Safety Professional |title=Risk Assessment: A Practical Guide to Assessing Operational Risks |author=Manuele, F.A. |editor=Popov, G.; Lyon, B.K.; Hollcraft, B.  |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–22 |year=2016 |isbn=9781118911044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put in simpler terms, a risk assessment analyzes what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, what the potential consequences are, and how tolerable the identified risk is.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; As part of this process, the resulting determination of risk may be expressed in a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] or [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] fashion. The risk assessment plays an inherent part of an overall [[risk management]] strategy, which attempts to, after a risk assessment, "introduce control measures to eliminate or reduce" any potential risk-related consequences.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16" /&gt;

== Need ==
===Individual risk assessment===
Risk assessment is necessary in individual cases, including patient and physician interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbu.se/contentassets/e7039ddba84c4eca9b474d6b15c9c9ac/vop_eng_18_180521_lr.pdf|title=Getting Real About Both Benefits and Risks|last=Levi|first=Ragnar|date=June 1, 2018|website=Swedish Agency of Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services|pages=8–9|language=en|via=[https://www.sbu.se/en/publications/medical-science-and-practice/new-issue-sbu-newsletter-medical-science-and-practice/ Science &amp; Practice, English Special 2018]|issn=1104-1250|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual judgements or assessments of risk may be affected by psychological, ideological, religious or otherwise subjective factors, which impact rationality of the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A [[systematic review]] of patients and doctors from 2017 found that overstatement of benefits and understatement of risks occurred more often than the alternative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=Tammy C.|last2=Del Mar|first2=Chris|year=2015|title=Patients' expectations of the benefits and harms of treatments, screening, and tests: a systematic review|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=175|issue=2|pages=274–286|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.6016|issn=2168-6114|pmid=25531451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tendency for individuals to be less rational when risks and exposures concern themselves as opposed to others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also a tendency to underestimate risks that are voluntary or where the individual sees themselves as being in control, such as smoking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 2017 systematic review from the [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane collaboration]] suggests “well-documented decision aids” are helpful in reducing effects of such tendencies or biases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stacey|first=Dawn|last2=Légaré|first2=France|last3=Lewis|first3=Krystina|last4=Barry|first4=Michael J.|last5=Bennett|first5=Carol L.|last6=Eden|first6=Karen B.|last7=Holmes-Rovner|first7=Margaret|last8=Llewellyn-Thomas|first8=Hilary|last9=Lyddiatt|first9=Anne|date=12 April 2017|title=Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD001431|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28402085}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways statistics are expressed and communicated, both through words and numerically also impact the interpretation of benefit and harm. For example, a fatality rate may be interpreted as less benign than the corresponding survival rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Systems risk assessment===
Risk assessment can also be made on a much larger "systems" scale, for example assessing the risks of a nuclear power plant (an interactively complex mechanical, electronic, nuclear, and human system) or a hurricane (a complex meteorological and geographical system). Systems may be defined as linear and nonlinear (or complex), where linear systems are predictable and relatively easy to understand given a change in input, and non-linear systems unpredictable when inputs are changed.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13-6"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EHeLmbUVh8C&amp;pg=PT166 |chapter=Chapter 6: Accident Models |title=Risk Assessment: Theory, Methods, and Applications |author=Rausand, M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=137–76 |year=2013 |isbn=9780470637647}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, risk assessments of non-linear/complex systems tend to be more challenging.

In the engineering of complex systems, sophisticated risk assessments are often made within [[safety engineering]] and [[reliability engineering]] when it concerns threats to life, [[Natural environment|environment]], or machine functioning. The agriculture, nuclear, aerospace, oil, railroad, and military industries have a long history of dealing with risk assessment.&lt;ref name="VamanuCritical16"&gt;{{cite book |title=Critical Infrastructures: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment in Transportation of Dangerous Goods: Transportation by Road and Rail |author=Vamanu, B.I.; Gheorghe, A.V.; Kaina, P.F. |publisher=Springer |page=11 |year=2016 |isbn=9783319309316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, medical, hospital, [[social services|social service]],&lt;ref name="LaceyAnApp11"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lacey |first=Peter |title=An Application of Fault Tree Analysis to the Identification and Management of Risks in Government Funded Human Service Delivery |journal=Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Public Policy and Social Sciences |year=2011 |ssrn=2171117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and food industries control risks and perform risk assessments on a continual basis. Methods for assessment of risk may differ between industries and whether it pertains to general financial decisions or environmental, ecological, or public health risk assessment.&lt;ref name="VamanuCritical16" /&gt;

== Concept ==
Rapid technological change, increasing scale of industrial complexes, increased system integration, market competition, and other factors have been shown to increase societal risk in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; As such, risk assessments become increasingly critical in mitigating accidents, improving safety, and improving outcomes. Risk assessment consists of an objective evaluation of [[risk]] in which assumptions and uncertainties are clearly considered and presented. This involves identification of risk (what can happen and why), the potential consequences, the [[Outcome (probability)|probability of occurrence]], the tolerability or acceptability of the risk, and ways to mitigate or reduce probability of the risk.&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16" /&gt; Optimally, it also involves documentation of the risk assessment and its findings, implementation of mitigation methods, and review of the assessment (or risk management plan), coupled with updates when necessary.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; Sometimes risks can be deemed acceptable, meaning the risk "is understood and tolerated ... usually because the cost or difficulty of implementing an effective countermeasure for the associated vulnerability exceeds the expectation of loss."&lt;ref name="ShireyInternet07"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949 |title=Internet Security Glossary, Version 2 |author=Shirey, R. |work=Network Working Group |publisher=The IETF Trust |page=9 |date=August 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the difficulty in managing risk is that both the quantities by which risk assessment is concerned—potential loss and probability of occurrence—can be very difficult to measure. The chance of error in measuring these two concepts is high. Risk with a large potential loss and a low probability of occurrence is often treated differently from one with a low potential loss and a high likelihood of occurrence. In theory, both are of near equal priority, but in practice it can be very difficult to manage when faced with the scarcity of resources—especially time—in which to conduct the risk management process.

===Mathematical conceptualization===
[[Image:RiskAssessment.jpg|thumb|320px|Risk assessment from a financial point of view.]]
To see the risk management process expressed mathematically, one can define total risk as the sum over individual risks, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, which can be computed as the product of potential losses, &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, and their probabilities, &lt;math&gt;p(L_i)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;R_i=L_i p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{total}=\sum_i L_i p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Even though for some risks &lt;math&gt;R_i, R_j&lt;/math&gt;, we might have &lt;math&gt;R_i = R_j&lt;/math&gt;, if the probability &lt;math&gt;p(L_j)&lt;/math&gt; is small compared to &lt;math&gt;p(L_i)&lt;/math&gt;, its estimation might be based only on a smaller number of prior events, and hence, more uncertain. On the other hand, since &lt;math&gt;R_i = R_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt; must be larger than &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, so decisions based on this uncertainty would be more consequential, and hence, warrant a different approach.

Financial decisions, such as insurance, express loss in terms of dollar amounts.  When risk assessment is used for public health or environmental decisions, loss can be quantified in a common metric such as a country's currency or some numerical measure of a location's quality of life.  For public health and environmental decisions, loss is simply a verbal description of the outcome, such as increased cancer incidence or incidence of birth defects. In that case, the "risk" is expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;R_i= p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
If the risk estimate takes into account information on the number of individuals exposed, it is termed a "population risk" and is in units of expected increased cases per a time period. If the risk estimate does not take into account the number of individuals exposed, it is termed an "individual risk" and is in units of incidence rate per a time period.  Population risks are of more use for cost/benefit analysis; individual risks are of more use for evaluating whether risks to individuals are "acceptable".

====Quantitative risk assessment====
{{Further|Quantitative Risk Assessment software}}
In quantitative risk assessment an [[annualized loss expectancy]] (ALE) may be used to justify the cost of implementing countermeasures to protect an asset. This may be calculated by multiplying the [[single loss expectancy]] (SLE), which is the loss of value based on a single security incident, with the [[annualized rate of occurrence]] (ARO), which is an estimate of how often a threat would be successful in exploiting a vulnerability.

The usefulness of quantitative risk assessment has been questioned, however. [[Barry Commoner]], [[Brian Wynne]] and other critics have expressed concerns that risk assessment tends to be overly quantitative and reductive. For example, they argue that risk assessments ignore qualitative differences among risks. Some charge that assessments may drop out important non-quantifiable or inaccessible information, such as variations among the classes of people exposed to hazards, or social amplification.&lt;ref name="Kasperson"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kasperson, R.E., Renn, O., Slovic, P., Brown, H.S., Emel, J., Goble, R., Kasperson, J.X., Ratick, S.| year=1988 | title = The social amplification of risk: A conceptual framework|journal= Risk Analysis|volume=8|issue=2|pages=177–187|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01168.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Commoner and O'Brien claim that quantitative approaches divert attention from precautionary or preventative measures.&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, Barry. O'Brien, Mary. Shrader-Frechette and Westra 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] consider risk managers little more than "blind users" of statistical tools and methods.&lt;ref&gt;The fourth quadrant: a map of the limits of statistics [9.15.08] Nassim Nicholas Taleb An Edge Original Essay&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment of risk ==
The process of risk assessment may be somewhat informal at the individual social level, managing economic and household risks,&lt;ref name="HolzmannSocial01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social Risk Management: A New Conceptual Framework for Social Protection, and Beyond |journal=International Tax and Public Finance |author=Holzmann, R.; Jørgensen, S. |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=529–56 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1011247814590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NakašThree17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knowledgehub.cef-see.org/?p=1399 |title=Three Lessons About Risk Management from Everyday Life |author=Nakaš, N. |work=Knowledge Hub |publisher=Center of Excellence in Finance |date=21 November 2017 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a sophisticate process at the strategic corporal level. However, in both cases, ability to anticipate future events and create effective strategies for mitigating them when deemed unacceptable is vital.

At the individual level, a simple process of identifying objectives and risks, weighing their importance and creating plans, may be all that's necessary. At the strategic organisational level, more elaborate policies are necessary, specifying acceptable levels of risk, procedures to be followed within the organisation, priorities, and allocation of resources.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt;{{rp|10}} At the systematic level, management involved with the project produce project level risk assessments with the assistance of the available expertise as part of the planning process, and set up systems to ensure that required actions to manage the assessed risk are in place. At the dynamic level, the personnel directly involved may be required to deal with unforeseen problems in real time. The tactical decisions made at this level should be reviewed after the operation to provide feedback on the effectiveness of both the planned procedures and decisions made in response to the contingency.

The first step in risk assessment is to establish the context. This restricts the range of hazards to be considered.

This is followed by ''identification of visible and implied hazards'' that may threaten the project, and ''determining the qualitative nature of the potential adverse consequences'' of each hazard. Without a potential adverse consequence, there is no hazard.

It is also necessary to identify the potential parties or assets which may be affected by the threat, and the potential consequences to them if the hazard is activated.

If the consequences are dependent on dose, i.e. the amount of exposure, the relationship between dose and severity of consequence must be established, and the risk depends on the probable dose, which may depend on concentration or amplitude and duration or frequency of exposure. This is the general case for many health hazards where the mechanism of injury is toxicity or repetitive injury, particularly where the effect is cumulative.

For other hazards, the consequences may either occur or not, and the severity may be extremely variable even when the triggering conditions are the same. This is typical of many biological hazards as well as a large range of safety hazards. Exposure to a pathogen may or may not result in actual infection, and the consequences of infection may also be variable. Similarly a fall from the same place may result in minor injury or death, depending on unpredictable details. In these cases estimates must be made of reasonably likely consequences and associated probability of occurrence.

In cases where statistical records are available they may be used to evaluate risk, but in many cases there are no data or insufficient data available to be useful. Mathematical or experimental models may provide useful input.

=== Dose dependent risk ===
[[Image:Risk Based Sampling Nomogram (3yr).png|right|200px|thumb|Food risk assessment [[nomogram]]]]

#''Dose-Response Analysis'', is determining the relationship between dose and the type of adverse response and/or probability or the incidence of effect (dose-response assessment). The complexity of this step in many contexts derives mainly from the need to extrapolate results from experimental animals (e.g. [[mouse]], [[rat]]) to humans, and/or from high to lower doses, including from high acute occupational levels to low chronic environmental levels. In addition, the differences between individuals due to [[genetics]] or other factors mean that the hazard may be higher for particular groups, called susceptible populations. An alternative to dose-response estimation is to determine a concentration unlikely to yield observable effects, that is, a [[no effect concentration]]. In developing such a dose, to account for the largely unknown effects of animal to human extrapolations, increased variability in humans, or missing data, a prudent approach is often adopted by including safety or uncertainty factors in the estimate of the "safe" dose, typically a factor of 10 for each unknown step.
#''Exposure Quantification'', aims to determine the amount of a contaminant (dose) that individuals and populations will receive, either as a contact level (e.g., concentration in ambient air) or as intake (e.g., daily dose ingested from drinking water). This is done by examining the results of the discipline of [[exposure assessment]]. As different location, lifestyles and other factors likely influence the amount of contaminant that is received, a range or distribution of possible values is generated in this step. Particular care is taken to determine the exposure of the susceptible population(s).

The results of these steps are combined to produce an estimate of risk. Because of the different susceptibilities and exposures, this risk will vary within a population. An uncertainty analysis is usually included in a health risk assessment.

== Dynamic risk assessment ==
During an emergency response, the situation and hazards are often inherently less predictable than for planned activities (non-linear). In general, if the situation and hazards are predictable (linear), standard operating procedures should deal with them adequately. In some emergencies this may also hold true, with the prepared and trained responses being adequate to manage the situation. In these situations, the operator can manage risk without outside assistance, or with the assistance of a backup team who are prepared and available to step in at short notice.

Other emergencies occur where there is no previously planned protocol, or when an outsider group is brought in to handle the situation, and they are not specifically prepared for the scenario that exists but must deal with it without undue delay. Examples include police, fire department, disaster response and other public service rescue teams. In these cases ongoing risk assessment by the involved personnel can advise appropriate action to reduce risk.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt; HM Fire Services Inspectorate has defined dynamic risk assessment (DRA) as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The continuous assessment of risk in the rapidly changing circumstances of an operational incident, in order to implement the control measures necessary to ensure an acceptable level of safety.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lock|first1=Gareth|editor1-last=Phillips|editor1-first=Mark|title=Public Safety Diving-Dynamic Risk Assessment|journal=PS Diver Magazine|date=June 2017|issue=116|page=9|url=http://psdiver.com/images/PSDiver_Issue_116_-_SECURE.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2017|publisher=PSDiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dynamic risk assessment is the final stage of an integrated safety management system which can provide appropriate response during changing circumstances. It relies on experience, training and continuing education, including effective debriefing to analyse not only what went wrong, but also what went right, and why, and to share this with other members of the team and the personnel responsible for the planning level risk assessment.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt;

==Fields of application==
Application of risk assessment procedures is common in a wide range of fields, and these may have specific legal obligations, codes of practice and standardised procedures. Some of these are listed here.

=== General health ===
There are many resources that provide health risk information.

The [[National Library of Medicine]] provides risk assessment and regulation information tools for a varied audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk Assessment and Regulation Information from the NLM|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro/riskinformation.html|publisher=[[National Library of Medicine|NLM]]|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* TOXNET (databases on hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases on toxicology, hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|work=TOXNET|publisher=[[National Library of Medicine|NLM]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Household Products Database (potential health effects of chemicals in over 10,000 common household products),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Household Products Database|url=http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov/|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[TOXMAP]] (maps of the [[Superfund|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund]] and [[Toxics Release Inventory]] data).
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides basic information about environmental health risk assessments for the public for a wide variety of possible environmental exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk Assessment Portal|url=http://www.epa.gov/risk/|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency began actively using risk assessment methods to protect drinking water in the United States after passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. The law required the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on drinking water issues, and in its report the NAS described some methodologies for doing risk assessments for chemicals that were suspected carcinogens, recommendations that top EPA officials have described as perhaps the study’s most important part.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=11 Transcript] (see pages 11,14).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the increase in junk food and its toxicity, FDA required in 1973 that cancer-causing compounds must not be present in meat at concentrations that would cause a cancer risk greater than 1 in a million over a lifetime. The US Environmental Protection Agency provides extensive information about ecological and environmental risk assessments for the public via its risk assessment portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/risk/|title=Risk Assessment|last=EPA, ORD, NCEA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) supports a qualitative risk framework for public health protection from chemicals that display environmental and biological persistence, [[bioaccumulation]], toxicity (PBT) and long range transport; most global chemicals that meet this criteria have been previously assessed quantitatively by national and international health agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |issue=Edition |pages=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=March 30, 2012| doi= 10.1002/9781118184141.ch19 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118184141.ch19/summary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Small sub-populations ====
When risks apply mainly to small sub-populations, there is uncertainty at which point intervention is necessary. For example, there may be a risk that is very low for everyone, other than 0.1% of the population. It is necessary to determine whether this 0.1% is represented by:
* all infants younger than ''X'' days or
* recreational users of a particular product.

If the risk is higher for a particular sub-population because of abnormal exposure rather than susceptibility, strategies to further reduce the exposure of that subgroup are considered.  If an identifiable sub-population is more susceptible due to inherent genetic or other factors, public policy choices must be made. The choices are:
* to set policies for protecting the general population that are protective of such groups, e.g. for children when data exists, the Clean Air Act for populations such as asthmatics or
* not to set policies, because the group is too small, or the costs too high.

==== Acceptable risk criteria ====
The idea of not increasing lifetime risk by more than one in a million has become commonplace in public health discourse and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/iwachap10.pdf|title=Acceptable Risk|first1=Paul R.|last1=Hunter|first2=Lorna|last2=Fewtrell|publisher=''[[World Health Organization]]''|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a heuristic measure. It provides a numerical basis for establishing a negligible increase in risk.

Environmental decision making allows some discretion for deeming individual risks potentially "acceptable" if less than one in ten thousand chance of increased lifetime risk.  Low risk criteria such as these provide some protection for a case where individuals may be exposed to multiple chemicals e.g. pollutants, food additives or other chemicals.

In practice, a true zero-risk is possible only with the suppression of the risk-causing activity.

Stringent requirements of 1 in a million may not be technologically feasible or may be so prohibitively expensive as to render the risk-causing activity unsustainable, resulting in the optimal degree of intervention being a balance between risks vs. benefit. For example, emissions from hospital incinerators result in a certain number of deaths per year. However, this risk must be balanced against the alternatives.  There are public health risks, as well as economic costs, associated with all options. The risk associated with no [[incineration]] is potential spread of infectious diseases, or even no hospitals. Further investigation identifies options such as separating noninfectious from infectious wastes, or air pollution controls on a medical incinerator.

Intelligent thought about a reasonably full set of options is essential.  Thus, it is not unusual for there to be an iterative process between analysis, consideration of options, and follow up analysis.

===Auditing===
For audits performed by an outside audit firm, risk assessment is a crucial stage before accepting an audit engagement. According to ISA315 ''Understanding the Entity and its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement'', "the auditor should perform risk assessment procedures to obtain an understanding of the entity and its environment, including its internal control". Evidence relating to the auditor’s risk assessment of a material misstatement in the client’s financial statements. Then, the auditor obtains initial evidence regarding the classes of transactions at the client and the operating effectiveness of the client’s internal controls. Audit risk is defined as the risk that the auditor will issue a clean unmodified opinion regarding the financial statements, when in fact the financial statements are materially misstated, and therefore do not qualify for a clean unmodified opinion. As a formula, audit risk is the product of two other risks: Risk of Material Misstatement and Detection risk. This formula can be further broken down as follows:  [[inherent risk]] × [[control risk]] × [[detection risk]].

=== Public health ===
In the context of [[public health]], risk assessment is the process of characterizing the nature and likelihood of a harmful effect to individuals or populations from certain human activities. Health risk assessment can be mostly qualitative or can include statistical estimates of probabilities for specific populations. In most countries the use of specific chemicals or the operations of specific facilities (e.g. power plants, manufacturing plants) is not allowed unless it can be shown that they do not increase the risk of death or illness above a specific threshold. For example, the American [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates food safety through risk assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Richard A. "Food Safety Regulation: Reforming the Delaney Clause" in ''Annual Review of Public Health'', 1997, 18:313-40. This source includes a useful historical survey of prior food safety regulation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project management===
In [[project management]], risk assessment is an integral part of the risk management plan, studying the probability, the impact, and the effect of every known risk on the project, as well as the corrective action to take should an incident implied by a risk occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/managing-project-risks Managing Project Risks] - Retrieved May 20th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Of special consideration in this area are the relevant codes of practice that are enforced in the specific jurisdiction. Understanding the regime of regulations that risk management must abide by is integral to formulating safe and compliant risk assessment practices.

=== Information security ===
{{Main|IT risk management#Risk assessment}}

[[IT risk|Information technology risk]] assessment can be performed by a qualitative or quantitative approach, following different methodologies. One important difference{{clarify|reason=difference from what?|date=June 2017}} in risk assessments in information security is modifying the threat model to account for the fact that any adversarial system connected to the Internet has access to threaten any other connected system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global adversarial capability modeling|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7120797|journal = 2015 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 1–21|doi = 10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120797|first = J.|last = Spring|first2 = S.|last2 = Kern|first3 = A.|last3 = Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk assessments may therefore need to be modified to account for the threats from all adversaries, instead of just those with reasonable access as is done in other fields.

Another notable difference is the strategic nature of IT risk assessments.  Unlike tactical vulnerability assessments and penetration testing which aim to identify and close specific gaps in security, IT risk assessments are functional at the executive level to examine the broader picture of IT risk management.{{clarify|reason=what does this actually mean|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnold|first1=Rob|title=3 Types of Security Assessments|url=https://threatsketch.com/3-types-cyber-security-assessments/|website=Threat Sketch|publisher=Threat Sketch|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Megaprojects ===
[[Megaprojects]] (sometimes also called "major programs") are extremely large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than US$1 billion per project. They include bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defence systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts.

=== Software evolution ===
Studies have shown that early parts of the system development cycle such as requirements and design specifications are especially prone to error. This effect is particularly notorious in projects involving multiple [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] with different points of view. Evolutionary software processes offer an iterative approach to [[Requirements engineering|requirement engineering]] to alleviate the problems of uncertainty, ambiguity and inconsistency inherent in software developments.{{clarify|reason=What does this have to do with risk assessment?|date=June 2017}}

=== Shipping industry ===
In July 2010, shipping companies agreed to use standardized procedures in order to assess risk in key shipboard operation. These procedures were implemented as part of the amended [[International Safety Management Code|ISM Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISM CODE – Amendments from 1st July 2010 Risk Assessment |url=http://www1.veristar.com/veristar/dps_info.nsf/veristar/Dps_info.nsf/AllByDateInternal/353FC02A22D59873C1257734003EC51C?opendocument}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underwater diving ===
{{see also|List of diving hazards and precautions}}
Formal risk assessment is a required component of most [[Professional diving|professional dive planning]], but the format and methodology may vary. Consequences of an incident due to an identified hazard are generally chosen from a small number of standardised categories, and probability is estimated based on statistical data on the rare occasions when it is available, and on a best guess estimate based on personal experience and company policy in most cases. A simple matrix is often used to transform these inputs into a level of risk, generally expressed as unacceptable, marginal or acceptable. If unacceptable, measures must be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, and the final outcome of the risk assessment must be accepted by the affected parties before a dive commences. Higher levels of risk may be acceptable in special circumstances, such as military or search and rescue operations when there is a chance of recovering a survivor. [[Diving supervisor]]s are trained in the procedures of [[hazard identification and risk assessment]], and it is part of their planning and operational responsibility. Both health and safety hazards must be considered. Several stages may be identified. There is risk assessment done as part of the diving project planning, on site risk assessment which takes into account the specific conditions of the day, and [[dynamic risk assessment]] which is ongoing during the operation by the members of the dive team, particularly the supervisor and the working diver.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009"&gt;{{cite web |title=Diving Regulations 2009 |work=Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 – Regulations and Notices – Government Notice R41 |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/consol_reg/ohasa85o1993rangnr41716/ |publisher=Government Printer |location=Pretoria |via=Southern African Legal Information Institute |accessdate=3 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104080007/http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/consol_reg/ohasa85o1993rangnr41716/ |archivedate=4 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMCA D022 2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Staff|first=|title=Guidance for diving supervisors IMCA D 022|edition=Revision 1|date=August 2016|publisher=International Marine Contractors Association|location=London, UK|pages=15{{hyphen}}5|chapter=15 - General safety requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[recreational scuba diving]], the extent of risk assessment expected of the diver is relatively basic, and is included in the [[Buddy check|pre-dive checks]]. Several mnemonics have been developed by [[diver certification agencies]] to remind the diver to pay some attention to risk, but the training is rudimentary. Diving service providers are expected to provide a higher level of care for their customers, and [[diving instructor]]s and [[divemaster]]s are expected to assess risk on behalf of their customers and warn them of site-specific hazards and the competence considered appropriate for the planned dive. Technical divers are expected to make a more thorough assessment of risk, but as they will be making an informed choice for a recreational activity, the level of acceptable risk may be considerably higher than that permitted for occupational divers under the direction of an employer.&lt;ref name="Diving at Work Regulations 1997" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/2776/made |title=The Diving at Work Regulations 1997 |last=Staff |year=1977 |work=Statutory Instruments 1997 No. 2776 Health and Safety |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) |location=Kew, Richmond, Surrey |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurr 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Kevin |editor-last=Mount |editor-first=Tom|editor2-last=Dituri |editor2-first=Joseph|title=Exploration and Mixed Gas Diving Encyclopedia|edition=1st|date=August 2008|publisher=International Association of Nitrox Divers|location=Miami Shores, Florida|isbn=978-0-915539-10-9|pages=165–180|chapter=13: Operational Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor and wilderness adventure===
In outdoor activities including commercial outdoor education, wilderness expeditioning and [[Outdoor_recreation | outdoor recreation]], risk assessment refers to analysis of the probability and magnitude of unfavorable outcomes such as injury, illness, or property damage due to environmental and related causes, compared to the human development or other benefits of outdoor activity. This is of particular importance as school programs and others weigh the benefits of youth and adult participation in various outdoor learning activities against the inherent and other hazards present in those activities.  Schools, corporate entities seeking team-building experiences, parents/guardians, and others considering outdoor experiences expect or require&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nwais.org/uploaded/accreditation_resources/2018_Membership_AccredRubric.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; organizations to assess the hazards and risks of different outdoor activities—such as sailing, mountaineering, or camping—and select activities with acceptable risk profiles.

Outdoor education, wilderness adventure, and other outdoor-related organizations should, and are in some jurisdictions required, to conduct risk assessments prior to offering programs for commercial purposes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supportadventure.co.nz/adventure-activities-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2016/0019/latest/DLM6725703.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/aala/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Such organizations are given guidance on how to provide their risk assessments&lt;ref&gt;https://worksafe.govt.nz/topic-and-industry/adventure-activities&lt;/ref&gt; and external consultancy services provide these assessments as well&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outdoorsafetyinstitute.com/pages/reviews/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.viristar.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nols.edu/en/about/risk-services/&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Environment ===
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) aims at assessing the effects of stressors, often chemicals, on the local environment. A risk is an integrated assessment of likelihood and severity of an undesired event. In ERA, the undesired event often depends on the chemical of interest and on the risk assessment scenario.&lt;ref name="Goussen et al 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goussen|first=Benoit|last2=Price|first2=Oliver R.|last3=Rendal|first3=Cecilie|last4=Ashauer|first4=Roman|date=2016-10-26|title=Integrated presentation of ecological risk from multiple stressors|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep36004|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep36004|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5080554|pmid=27782171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This undesired event is usually a detrimental effect on organisms, populations or ecosystems. Current ERAs usually compare an exposure to a no-effect level, such as the [[Predicted environmental concentration|Predicted Environmental Concentration]]/[[Predicted no-effect concentration|Predicted No-Effect Concentration]] (PEC/PNEC) ratio in Europe. Although this type of ratio is useful and often used in regulation purposes, it is only an indication of an exceeded apparent threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jager|first=Tjalling|last2=Heugens|first2=Evelyn H. W.|last3=Kooijman|first3=Sebastiaan A. L.

=== Biodiversity ===
Biodiversity Risk Assessments evaluate risks to [[biological diversity]], specially the risk of [[species]] [[extinction]] or the risk of [[ecosystem collapse]]. The units of assessments are the biological (species, [[subspecies]] or [[population]]s) or ecological entities ([[habitat]]s, [[ecosystem]]s, etc), and the risk are often related to human actions and interventions (threats and pressures). Regional and national protocols have been proposed by multiple academic or governmental institutions and working groups,&lt;ref name="NicholsonRegan2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Emily|last2=Regan|first2=Tracey J.|last3=Auld|first3=Tony D.|last4=Burns|first4=Emma L.|last5=Chisholm|first5=Laurie A.|last6=English|first6=Valerie|last7=Harris|first7=Stephen|last8=Harrison|first8=Peter|last9=Kingsford|first9=Richard T.|last10=Leishman|first10=Michelle R.|last11=Metcalfe|first11=Daniel J.|last12=Pisanu|first12=Phil|last13=Watson|first13=Christopher J.|last14=White|first14=Matthew|last15=White|first15=Matt D.|last16=Williams|first16=Richard J.|last17=Wilson|first17=Bruce|last18=Keith|first18=David A.|title=Towards consistency, rigour and compatibility of risk assessments for ecosystems and ecological communities|journal=Austral Ecology|volume=40|issue=4|year=2015|pages=347–363|issn=14429985|doi=10.1111/aec.12148}}&lt;/ref&gt; but global standards such as the [[Red List of Threatened Species]] and the [[IUCN Red List of Ecosystems]] have been widely adopted, and are recognized or proposed as official indicators of progress toward international policy targets and goals, such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|Aichi targets]] and the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="KeithRodríguez2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=David A.|last2=Rodríguez|first2=Jon Paul|last3=Brooks|first3=Thomas M.|last4=Burgman|first4=Mark A.|last5=Barrow|first5=Edmund G.|last6=Bland|first6=Lucie|last7=Comer|first7=Patrick J.|last8=Franklin|first8=Janet|last9=Link|first9=Jason|last10=McCarthy|first10=Michael A.|last11=Miller|first11=Rebecca M.|last12=Murray|first12=Nicholas J.|last13=Nel|first13=Jeanne|last14=Nicholson|first14=Emily|last15=Oliveira-Miranda|first15=María A.|last16=Regan|first16=Tracey J.|last17=Rodríguez-Clark|first17=Kathryn M.|last18=Rouget|first18=Mathieu|last19=Spalding|first19=Mark D.|title=The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems: Motivations, Challenges, and Applications|journal=Conservation Letters|volume=8|issue=3|year=2015|pages=214–226|issn=1755263X|doi=10.1111/conl.12167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrooksButchart2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Butchart|first2=Stuart H.M.|last3=Cox|first3=Neil A.|last4=Heath|first4=Melanie|last5=Hilton-Taylor|first5=Craig|last6=Hoffmann|first6=Michael|last7=Kingston|first7=Naomi|last8=Rodríguez|first8=Jon Paul|last9=Stuart|first9=Simon N.|last10=Smart|first10=Jane|title=Harnessing biodiversity and conservation knowledge products to track the Aichi Targets and Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Biodiversity|volume=16|issue=2-3|year=2015|pages=157–174|issn=1488-8386|doi=10.1080/14888386.2015.1075903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Irish Pine''''' was a {{GRT|5621|link=off}} cargo ship which was built in 1919 for the [[United States Maritime Commission]] (USMC) and named '''''West Hematite'''''. She was [[bareboat charter|chartered]] in 1941 by [[Irish Shipping|Irish Shipping Ltd]] and renamed ''Irish Pine''. On 16 November 1942, ''Irish Pine'' was [[torpedo]]ed and sunk by {{GS|U-608||2}}.

==Description==
The ship was built to [[Design 1013 ship|Design 1013]] by [[J. F. Duthie &amp; Company]], [[Seattle, Washington]], was launched on 26 April 1919 and completed in June of that year.&lt;ref name=Miramar&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=2218111|accessdate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was {{convert|409|ft|7|in|m|2}} long, with a beam of {{convert|54|ft|2|in|m|2}} and a depth of {{convert|27|ft|2|in|m|2}}. She was propelled by a [[triple expansion steam engine]] which had cylinders of {{convert|24.5|in|cm}}, {{convert|41.5|in|cm}} and {{convert|72|in|cm}} bore and {{convert|48|in|cm}} stroke. It was built by the Llewellyn Iron Works, [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Hematite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30b1293.pdf |title=Lloyd's Register, Steamers &amp; Motorships|publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She could make {{convert|10.5|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=Miramar/&gt;

''Irish Pine'' was recorded in [[Lloyd's Register]] as being  {{convert|410|ft|4|in|m|2}} long, with a beam of  {{convert|54|ft|m|2}} and a depth of {{convert|30|ft|2|in|m|2}}.&lt;ref name=Pine/&gt;

On 26 September 1941,&lt;ref name=Uboat/&gt; ''West Hematite'' was chartered from the USSB by Irish Shipping Ltd and renamed ''Irish Pine''. {{SS|Irish Oak|1919|2}} was also chartered from the USSB.&lt;ref name=Forde&gt;{{cite book|last=Forde|first=Frank|title=The Long Watch|publisher=New Island Books|location=Dublin|page=40|origyear=1981|year=2000|isbn=1-902602-42-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 August 1942, the [[Union-Castle Line|Union-Castle Line's]] {{MV|Richmond Castle|1939|2}} was torpedoed and sunk by {{GS|U-176||2}} off [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]]. ''Irish Pine'' rescued 15 of the 50 survivors and landed them at [[Kilrush]].&lt;ref name=Richmond&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/andrew.etherington/1942/08/04.htm |title=August 4th, 1942 |publisher=Andrew Etherington |accessdate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At 00:15 on 16 November 1942, ''Irish Pine'' was hit by a single torpedo from ''U-608''.  Although the 33 crew started to take to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], the ship sank at 00:17, costing everyone on board their life.&lt;ref name=Uboat/&gt; Her position was {{coord|42|45|N|58|00|W|display=inline, title}}, in the North Atlantic south of [[Cape Breton Island]], Canada.&lt;ref name=Miramar/&gt; [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] had not declared war on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], and therefore ''Irish Pine'' was a neutral vessel.&lt;ref name=Neutral&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishseamensrelativesassociation.org/Crews%201.htm |title=Neutral Irish registered vessels and their crews lost as a result of belligerent action during 1939 - 46 |publisher=Irish Seamen's Relatives Association |accessdate=9 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032729/http://www.irishseamensrelativesassociation.org/Crews%201.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Logistic-curve.svg|thumb|320px|right|The [[logistic curve]]]]
[[Image:Error Function.svg|thumb|right|320px|Plot of the [[error function]]]]

A '''sigmoid function''' is a  [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] having a characteristic "S"-shaped curve or '''sigmoid curve'''.  Often, ''sigmoid function'' refers to the special case of the [[logistic function]] shown in the first figure and defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;S(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} = \frac{e^x}{e^x + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Special cases of the sigmoid function include the [[Gompertz curve]] (used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of x) and the [[ogee curve]] (used in the [[spillway]] of some [[dam]]s). Sigmoid functions have domain of all [[real number]]s, with return value [[monotonic function|monotonically increasing]] most often from 0 to 1 or alternatively from −1 to 1, depending on convention.

A wide variety of sigmoid functions including the logistic and [[hyperbolic tangent]] functions have been used as the [[activation function]] of [[artificial neuron]]s. Sigmoid curves are also common in statistics as [[cumulative distribution function]]s (which go from 0 to 1), such as the integrals of the [[logistic distribution]], the [[normal distribution]], and [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t'' probability density functions]].

==Definition==
A sigmoid function is a [[Bounded function|bounded]], differentiable, real function that is defined for all real input values and has a non-negative derivative at each point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Han |first1=Jun |last2=Morag |first2=Claudio |title=From Natural to Artificial Neural Computation |chapter=The influence of the sigmoid function parameters on the speed of backpropagation learning |editor1-last=Mira |editor1-first=José |editor2-last=Sandoval |editor2-first=Francisco |pages=195–201 |year=1995 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-59497-3_175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
In general, a sigmoid function is [[monotonic function|monotonic]], and has a first [[derivative]] which is bell shaped. A sigmoid function is constrained by a pair of [[horizontal asymptotes]] as &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \pm \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
[[File:Gjl-t(x).svg|thumb|320px|right|Some sigmoid functions compared. In the drawing all functions are normalized in such a way that their slope at the origin is 1.]]

*[[Logistic function]]
::&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} &lt;/math&gt;

*[[Hyperbolic function|Hyperbolic tangent]] (shifted and scaled version of the logistic function, above)
::&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \tanh x = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} &lt;/math&gt;

*[[Inverse trigonometric function|Arctangent function]]
::&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \arctan x &lt;/math&gt;

*[[Gudermannian function]]

::&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \operatorname{gd}(x) = \int_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{\cosh t} \, dt = 2\tanh\left(\arctan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;

*[[Error function]]
::&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \operatorname{erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt &lt;/math&gt;

*[[Generalised logistic function]]
::&lt;math&gt; f(x) = (1+e^{-x})^{-\alpha}, \quad \alpha &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

*[[Smoothstep]] function

::&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \begin{cases}
\displaystyle{
\frac{\int_{0}^{x} \bigl(1 - u^2 \bigr)^N \ du}
{\int_{0}^{1} {\bigl(1 - u^2 \bigr)^N \ du}}
}, &amp; |x| \le 1 \\
\sgn(x) &amp; |x| \ge 1 \\
\end{cases} \, \quad N \ge 1 &lt;/math&gt;

*Some [[algebraic function|algebraic functions]], for example
::&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[integral]] of any continuous, non-negative, "bump-shaped" function will be sigmoidal, thus the [[cumulative distribution function]]s for many common [[probability distribution]]s are sigmoidal. One such example is the error function, which is related to the cumulative distribution function of a [[normal distribution]].

==Applications==
[[File:Gohana inverted S-curve.png|thumb|right|320px|Inverted logistic S-curve to model the relation between wheat yield and soil salinity. &lt;ref&gt;Software to fit an S-curve to a data set [https://www.waterlog.info/sigmoid.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Many natural processes, such as those of complex system [[learning curve]]s, exhibit a progression from small beginnings that accelerates and approaches a climax over time.   When a specific mathematical model is lacking, a sigmoid function is often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Gibbs
 | first = M.N.

 | volume = 11

 | pages = 1458–1464
 | doi = 10.1109/72.883477
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[van Genuchten–Gupta model]] is based on an inverted S-curve and applied to the response of crop yield to [[soil salinity]].

Examples of the application of the logistic S-curve to the response of crop yield (barley) to both the soil salinity and depth to [[water table]] in the soil are shown in [[logistic function#In agriculture: modeling crop response]].

In [[artificial neural network]]s, sometimes non-smooth functions are used instead for efficiency; these are known as [[hard sigmoid]]s.

'''Sloughing''' (pronounced "sluffing") in [[biology]] refers to the act of shedding or casting off dead tissue, such as cells of the [[endometrium]], shed during [[menstruation]], or the shedding of skin in [[amphibians]].

[[Skin sloughing]] is the process of shedding dead surface cells from the skin.

In [[veterinary medicine]], it may refer to the process where [[Necrosis|necrotic]] surface [[epithelial cells]] are discarded from the small intestinal [[mucosa]] following various infections which may occur within both [[monogastric]]s or [[ruminants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Dyce KM, Sack WO, ((Wensing CJG)) |title=Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy |edition=Fourth |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], slough may start occurring in [[pressure ulcer|pressure ulcers]] also known as ''decubitus ulcers'' or as bed sores at the stage 3, and in stage 4{{clarify|date=November 2013}} levels of wound, infection, and damage.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In plants, sloughing occurs during [[Root#Root growth|root growth]], where cells from the [[root cap]] are shed to the soil where they are biologically processed by microorganisms. Also, when a root undergoes secondary growth (transition from a primary root to a "woody" root), the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] and epidermis become isolated from the rest of the root and are eventually sloughed.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

* [[Ecdysis]]- shedding of the skin or exoskeleton, mainly in [[arthropods]]
* [[Eschar]]- piece(s) of [[Necrosis|necrotic tissue]] that are dead and cast off from the surface of the skin from wounds as part of the healing process.
* [[Moulting]]- biological shedding of skin or integument in many animal species

'''Social constructivism''' is a [[sociological theory]] of [[knowledge]] according to which human development is socially situated and knowledge is constructed through interaction with others.&lt;ref name="McKinley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinley|first1=J.|title=Critical Argument and Writer Identity: Social Constructivism as a Theoretical Framework for EFL Academic Writing|journal=Critical Inquiry in Language Studies|date=2015|volume=12|issue=3|pages=184–207|doi=10.1080/15427587.2015.1060558|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/social_constructivism_mckinley_2015.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social constructionism==
Like [[social constructionism]], social constructivism states that people work together to construct [[Social artifact#Artifact|artifacts]]. While social constructionism focuses on the artifacts that are created through the social interactions of a group, social constructivism focuses on an individual's learning that takes place because of his or her interactions in a group.

A very simple example is an object like a cup. The object can be used for many things, but its shape does suggest some 'knowledge' about carrying liquids (see also [[Affordance]]). A more complex example is an [[online course]]—not only do the 'shapes' of the software tools indicate certain things about the way online courses should work, but the activities and texts produced within the group as a whole will help shape how each person behaves within that group. A person's cognitive development will also be influenced by the culture that he or she is involved in, such as the language, history and social context.

For a philosophical account of one possible social-constructionist [[ontology]], see the [[Representative realism#Criticism|'Criticism' section of ''Representative realism'']].&lt;ref&gt;See also Wright, Edmond (2005) Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 103–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Strong social constructivism as a philosophical approach tends to suggest that "the natural world has a small or non-existent role in the construction of scientific knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Collins, H. M.|year=1981|title=Stages in the Empirical Program of Relativism - Introduction|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=11|issue=1|page=3|doi=10.1177/030631278101100101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Maarten Boudry]] and Filip Buekens, [[Psychoanalysis#Freudian theory|Freudian psychoanalysis]] is a good example of this approach in action.&lt;ref name="Boudry, et al. (2011)"&gt;Boudry, M &amp; Buekens, F (2011) The Epistemic Predicament of a Pseudoscience: Social Constructivism Confronts Freudian Psychoanalysis. Theoria, 77, 159–179&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Boudry and Buekens do not claim that '[[bona fide]]' science is completely immune from all socialisation and [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm shifts]],&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T (1962) [[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]. Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; merely that the strong social constructivist claim that ''all'' scientific knowledge is constructed ignores the reality of scientific success.&lt;ref name="Boudry, et al. (2011)" /&gt;

One characteristic of social constructivism is that it rejects the role of [[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|superhuman necessity in either the invention/discovery of knowledge or its justification]]. In the field of invention it looks to contingency as playing an important part in the origin of knowledge, with historical interests and resourcing swaying the direction of mathematical and scientific knowledge growth. In the area of justification while acknowledging the role of logic and reason in testing, it also accepts that the criteria for acceptance vary and change over time. Thus [[mathematical proofs]] follow different standards in the present and throughout different periods in the past, as Paul Ernest argues.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest, Paul (1998), Social Constructivism as a Philosophy of Mathematics, Albany NY: SUNY Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology and religion==
One branch of social constructivist philosophy is best represented in the works of the psychologist [[Robert Rocco Cottone]]. Cottone has taken a radical philosophical position purporting a purest [[Relational sociology|relational realism]] (an ontology where everything is viewed as relationship). Things, accordingly, only exist in relation to observers who are able to understand their perceptions through social interchange. Cottone merged the works of the cognitive biologist [[Humberto Maturana]] with the works of the social psychologist [[Kenneth Gergen]] to produce a fully relational conception of the process of understanding experience. His most compelling concept is that of "Bracketed Absolute Truth" (also called a "consensuality"),&lt;ref&gt;Cottone, R. R. (2012). [http://smashwords.com/books/view/165398 "Paradigms of Counseling and Psychotherapy"].&lt;/ref&gt; where a truth is held within a community as absolute, but outside the community it is held by observers as relative to other truths. All understanding of experience is thereby socially constructed, but different communities can construct different interpretations of their shared experience. Truths are never constructed outside of interaction—truth is social. There are as many truths on any one topic as there are communities to construct them. Some truths on one topic may be consistent and others may be contradictory, depending on the perceptual and social linguistic contexts of the groups making the interpretations. Cottone used the example of religion to make his point.&lt;ref name="Cottone (2011)"&gt;Cottone, R. R. (2011). "Toward a positive psychology of religion: Belief science in the postmodern era." Winchester, UK: John Hunt Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Different communities may have different conceptions of a god, for example, even though historically they are speaking of the same godly origin (e.g. [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]]). Religion provides a compelling example of how people socially construct their understanding of experience by means of social-linguistic traditions. Each religion, therefore, represents a bracketed absolute truth. Cottone proposed that people operate in a matrix of multilayered consensualities and people progress through life by connecting with, disconnecting from, and continually negotiating through relationships that reflect communities of understanding (e.g., religions, professions, local communities, governments, etc.). He called this process "social trajectory".&lt;ref name="Cottone (2011)" /&gt; This branch of social constructivist thought does not purport that individuals socially construct a reality, rather it purports that people construct understanding of experience together, not alone. In effect, there are communities of understanding.

==Education==
Social constructivism has been studied by many educational psychologists, who are concerned with its implications for teaching and learning. Social constructivism extends constructivism by incorporating the role of other actors and culture in development. In this sense it can also be contrasted with [[social learning theory]] by stressing interaction over observation. For more on the psychological dimensions of social constructivism, see the work of A. Sullivan Palincsar.&lt;ref&gt;Palincsar, A.S. (1998). Social constructivist perspectives on teaching and learning. Annual Review of Psychology, 49, 345–375.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological tools are one of the key concepts in [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s sociocultural perspective.

An instructional strategy grounded in social constructivism that is an area of active research is [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL). This strategy gives students opportunities to practice 21st-century skills in communication, knowledge sharing, critical thinking and use of relevant technologies found in the workplace.

Additionally, studies on increasing the use of student discussion in the classroom both support and are grounded in theories of social constructivism. There is a full range of advantages that results from the implementation of discussion in the classroom. Participating in group discussion allows students to generalize and transfer their knowledge of classroom learning and builds a strong foundation for communicating ideas orally.&lt;ref name="Reznitskaya, et al. (2007)"&gt;Reznitskaya, A., Anderson, R.C., and Kuo, L.J. (2007). Teaching and Learning Argumentation. Elementary School Journal, 107: 449–472.&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies argue that discussion plays a vital role in increasing student ability to test their ideas, synthesize the ideas of others, and build deeper understanding of what they are learning.&lt;ref name="Reznitskaya, et al. (2007)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weber, et al. (2008)"&gt;K. Weber, C. Maher, A. Powell, and H. Lee (2008). Learning opportunities from group discussions: Warrants become the objects of debate. Educational Studies in Mathematics, 68, 247-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corden"&gt;Corden, R.E. (2001). Group discussion and the importance of a shared perspective: Learning from collaborative research. Qualitative Research, 1(3), 347-367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nystrand"&gt;Nystrand, M. (1996). Opening dialogue: Understanding the dynamics of language and learning in the English classroom. New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Large and small group discussion also affords students opportunities to exercise self-regulation, self-determination, and a desire to persevere with tasks.&lt;ref name="Corden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matsumara, et al (2008)"&gt;Matsumura, L.C., Slater, S.C., &amp; Crosson, A. (2008). Classroom climate, rigorous instruction and curriculum, and students’ interactions in urban middle schools. The Elementary School Journal, 108(4), 294-312.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, discussion increases student motivation, collaborative skills, and the ability to problem solve.&lt;ref name="Nystrand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matsumara, et al (2008)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyson|first=A. H.|year=2004|title=Writing and the sea of voices: Oral language in, around, and about writing. In R.B. Ruddell, &amp; N.J. Unrau (Eds.), Theoretical Models and Processes of Reading (pp. 146–162). Newark, DE: International Reading Association.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing students’ opportunity to talk with one another and discuss their ideas increases their ability to support their thinking, develop reasoning skills, and to argue their opinions persuasively and respectfully.&lt;ref name="Reznitskaya, et al. (2007)" /&gt; Furthermore, the feeling of community and collaboration in classrooms increases through offering more chances for students to talk together.&lt;ref name="Weber, et al. (2008)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barab, S., Dodge, T. Thomas, M.K., Jackson, C. &amp; Tuzun, H. (2007). Our designs and the social agendas they carry. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 16(2), 263-305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale, M.S. &amp; City, E.A. (2002). “But how do you do that?”: Decision making for the seminar facilitator. In J. Holden &amp; J.S. Schmit. Inquiry and the literary text: Constructing discussions in the English classroom / Classroom practices in teaching English, volume 32. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the advantages that result from discussion, it is surprising that it is not used more often. Studies have found that students are not regularly accustomed to participating in academic discourse.&lt;ref name="Corden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nystrand" /&gt; [[Martin Nystrand]] argues that teachers rarely choose classroom discussion as an instructional format. The results of Nystrand’s (1996) three-year study focusing on 2400 students in 60 different classrooms indicate that the typical classroom teacher spends under three minutes an hour allowing students to talk about ideas with one another and the teacher.&lt;ref name="Nystrand" /&gt; Even within those three minutes of discussion, most talk is not true discussion because it depends upon teacher-directed questions with predetermined answers.&lt;ref name="Corden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nystrand" /&gt; Multiple observations indicate that students in low socioeconomic schools and lower track classrooms are allowed even fewer opportunities for discussion.&lt;ref name="Weber, et al. (2008)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Corden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nystrand" /&gt; Teachers who teach as if they value what their students think create learners. Discussion and interactive discourse promote learning because they afford students the opportunity to use language as a demonstration of their independent thoughts. Discussion elicits sustained responses from students that encourage [[meaning-making]] through negotiating with the ideas of others. This type of learning “promotes retention and in-depth processing associated with the cognitive manipulation of information”.&lt;ref name="Nystrand" /&gt;

One recent branch of work exploring social constructivist perspectives on learning focuses on the role of social technologies and social media in facilitating the generation of socially constructed knowledge and understanding in online environments.&lt;ref&gt;Dougiamas, M. (1998, November). [https://web.archive.org/web/20131211222257/http://go.webassistant.com/wa/upload/users/u1000057/webpage_20553.html A journey into Constructivism].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic writing===
In a constructivist approach, the focus is on the sociocultural conventions of academic discourse such as citing evidence, hedging and boosting claims, interpreting the literature to back one's own claims, and addressing counter claims.  These conventions are inherent to a constructivist approach as they place value on the communicative, interpersonal nature of academic writing with a strong focus on how the reader receives the message. The act of citing others’ work is more than accurate attribution; it is an important exercise in critical thinking in the construction of an authorial self.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyson" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10597">'''Teasing'''  has multiple meanings and uses. In human interactions, teasing exists in three major forms: ''playful'', ''hurtful'',  and ''educative''. Teasing can have a variety of effects, depending on how it is utilized and its intended effect.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, V. (1991). Playing with others' expectations: Teasing and mucking about in the first year. (pp. 143-158) Basil Blackwell, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; When teasing is unwelcome, it may be regarded as [[harassment]] or [[mobbing]], especially in the work place and school, or as a form of [[bullying]] or emotional [[abuse]]. If done in public, it may be regarded as [[humiliation]]. Teasing can also be regarded as educative when it is used as a way of  [[Informal learning]]. Adults in some of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American Communities]] often tease children to playfully illustrate and teach them how their behaviour negatively affects the community. Children in many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American Communities]] also learn by observing what others do in addition to collaborating with them. Along with teasing, this form of informal learning is different from the ways that Western American children learn. Informal ways of child learning include mutual responsibility, as well as active collaboration with adults and peers. This differentiates from the more formal way of learning because it is not adult-oriented.

People may be teased on matters such as their appearance, weight, behavior, abilities, clothing, and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, R. (2000). I was only kidding: Victim and perpetrators' perceptions of teasing. ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]'', ''26'', 231-241.&lt;/ref&gt; From the victim's point of view, this kind of teasing is often hurtful, irrespective of the intention of the teaser.

One may also tease an [[animal]]. Some animals, such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, may recognize this both as play or harassment.

==The nature of teasing==
A common form of teasing is verbal bullying or [[taunt]]ing. This behavior is intended to distract, disturb, offend, sadden, anger, bother, irritate, or annoy the recipient. Because it is hurtful, it is different from joking and is generally accompanied by some degree of [[social rejection]]. Teasing can also be taken to mean "To make fun of; mock playfully" or be sarcastic about and use sarcasm.

[[Dacher Keltner]] utilizes Penelope Brown's classic study on the difference between "on-record" and "off-record" communication to illustrate how people must learn to read others' tone of voice and facial expressions in order to learn appropriate responses to teasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/magazine/07teasing-t.html|last=Keltner|first= Dacher|date=December 5, 2008|title=In defense of teasing|publisher= ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of teasing that is usually overlooked is educational teasing. This form is commonly used by parents and caregivers in two [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American Communities]] and Mexican Heritage communities to guide their children into responding with more [[Prosocial behavior]]. For example, when a parent teases a child who is throwing a tantrum for a piece of candy, the parent will pretend to give the child candy but then take it away and ask the child to correct their behavior before giving the child that piece of candy. In this way, the parent teaches the child the importance of maintaining self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Peter|title=The Educative Value of Teasing|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201301/the-educative-value-teasing-0|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When adults educate children through teasing, they are informally teaching the children. This type of learning is often overlooked because it is different from the way Western American Communities teach their children.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Another form of teasing is to pretend to give something which the other desires, or give it very slowly. This is usually done by arousing curiosity or desire, and may not actually involve the intent to satisfy or disclose. This form of teasing could be called "tantalizing", after the story of [[Tantalus]]. Tantalizing is generally playful among adults, although among children it can be hurtful, such as when one child acquires a possession of another's property and will not return it. It is also common in flirting and dating. For example, a man or woman who is interested in someone might reject an advance the first time in order to arouse interest and curiosity, and  give in the second or third time.

Whether teasing is playful or hurtful or educative is largely subject to the interpretation of the person being teased. If the person being teased feels harmed, then the teasing is hurtful. A difference in [[power (sociology)|power]] between people may also make the behavior hurtful rather than playful. Ultimately though, if someone perceives him or herself as the victim of teasing, and experiences the teasing as unpleasant, then it is considered hurtful. If parents' intentions are positive, as in many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American Communities]], then teasing to the community can be seen as an educational tool. The child may or may not understand that in the moment. If the other person continues to do it after being asked to stop then it is a form of bullying or abuse.

Another way to look at teasing is as an honest reflection on differences, expressed in a joking fashion with the goal of "clearing the air". It can express a comfort with the other which can be comforting. As opposed to being nice to someone's face while making disparaging remarks behind their back, teasing can be a way to express differences in a direct fashion rather than internalizing them.

==In indigenous American communities==

Some indigenous American communities use teasing to teach their children about the expectations and values of the community and to change negative behaviors. Teasing gives children a better understanding of how their behavior affects the people around them. Teasing in Indigenous American communities is used to learn community acceptance, humbleness, correcting a behavior and social control.

In some Mexican indigenous American communities, teasing is used in an effective educative way. Teasing is found more useful because it allows the child to feel and understand the relevant effect of their behavior instead of receiving out of context feedback. Some parents in Indigenous American communities believe it mildly embarrasses the children in a shared reference to give them a good sense of the consequences of their behavior. This type of teasing is thought to teach children to be less egocentric, teaches autonomy and responsibility to monitor their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=Katie|title=Teaching children through 'little dramas': Opinions about instructional ribbing from Mexican-heritage and European-American mothers.|journal=ProQuest, UMI Dissertations|date=2011|pages=1–66|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/926578064?accountid=14523|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental teasing also is practiced to encourage the child to think of their behavior in a social context. Some Indigenous American mothers have reported that this urges the children to understand how their behavior affects others around them. From examples in Eisenberg's article, parents use teasing as way of reinforcing relationships and participation in group/community activities ([[Prosocial behavior]]). Parents tease their children to be able to “control the behavior of the child and to have fun with them”.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, A. R. (1986). Teasing: Verbal play in two Mexicano homes. In B. B. Schieffelin &amp; E. Ochs (Eds.) Language socialization across cultures. (pp. 182-198). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Inuit]] principal of learning that follows a similar teasing pattern is known as issumaksaiyuk, meaning to cause thought. Oftentimes, adults pose questions or hypothetical situations to the children (sometimes dangerous) but in a teasing, playful manner, often dramatizing their responses. These questions raise the child's awareness to issues surrounding their community, as well as give them a sense of agency within the community as a member capable of having an effect and creating change. Once the child begins to answer the questions reasonably, like an adult, the questions would stop.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, J. (1998). ''Inuit morality play: The emotional education of a three-year-old''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Cherokee]] communities, teasing is a way of diffusing aggressive or hostile situations and teaching the individual about the consequences of their behavior. It allows the individual to feel how their behaviors are affecting others and control their behavior.

==Other usages==
To tease, or to "be a tease" in a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] sense can refer to the use of posture, language or other means of [[flirting]] to cause another person to become sexually aroused. Such teasing may or may not be a prelude to intercourse, an ambiguity which can lead to uncomfortable situations. In a more physical sense, it can also refer to [[sexual stimulation]].

Teasing is also used to describe playing part of a song at a concert. [[Jam band]]s will often quote the main riff of another song during jams.

"Tease it" is also used as a slang term to smoke marijuana. The word "tease" can also be used as a noun to stand for marijuana.

In a very different context, hair can be teased, "ratted", or more correctly, "[[backcombing|backcombed]]".  As the name suggests, backcombing involves combing the hair backwards from end to root to intentionally tangle the strands to create volume. It can also be done excessively in sections to create [[dreadlocks]].

====June 13–15====

In what had become the worst civil unrest in Iran in over a decade, clashes broke out between police and groups protesting the election results from early Saturday morning onward. Protests were initially mostly peaceful but became increasingly violent.&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt; Demonstrators chanted phrases such as "Down with the dictator", "Death to the dictator", and "Give us our votes back".&lt;ref name=youth&gt;{{cite news|first=Dudi|last=Cohen|date=June 14, 2009|accessdate=June 14, 2009|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3730786,00.html|title=Tehran youth: I'll never vote in Iran again}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=free/&gt; Mousavi urged for calm and asked that his supporters refrain from acts of violence.&lt;ref name=free&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Ahmadinejad defiant on 'free' Iran poll |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8099115.stm|date=June 13, 2009|accessdate=June 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, protests grew considerably in scope and violence, leading [[Al Jazeera English]] to describe the situation as the "biggest unrest since the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]]". It also reported that protests seemed spontaneous without any formal organization.&lt;ref name=al&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/06/2009613172130303995.html.|title=Poll results prompt Iran protests|publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]]|accessdate=June 13, 2009|date=June 13, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618073345/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/06/2009613172130303995.html.|archivedate=June 18, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buses and trash cans were burned, and parked cars blocked streets and highways in Tehran and routes leading into the city.

Since riot police are largely limited to Tehran, the IRGC and the Basij were dispatched to quell protests in other cities.

Reporters from the Italian state-owned television broadcaster [[RAI]] stated that one of its interpreters was beaten with clubs by riot police and the officers then confiscated the cameraman's tapes.&lt;ref name=abc /&gt; Also several [[BBC]] cameramen were beaten and arrested by [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|IRGC]] officials and had their tapes confiscated.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcjamming&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop the blocking now |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/06/stop_the_blocking_now.html|date=2009-06-14|accessdate=2009-06-14|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mousavi spokesman [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]] said "Mousavi's headquarters was wrecked by plainclothes police officers" with many staffers arrested, and Mousavi himself ordered by the Revolutionary Guard to stay silent.

Iranian Foreign Minister [[Manouchehr Mottaki]] rebuked Britain, France and Germany for raising questions about reports of voting irregularities. Mottaki charged France with taking "treacherous and unjust approaches," and accused Britain of flying intelligence agents into Iran before the election to interfere with the vote. The election, he insisted, was a "very transparent competition." British Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] categorically denied the charge against his country, adding: "This can only damage Iran's standing in the eyes of the world."&lt;ref name=eerie&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090621/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election In Tehran, an eerie calm as death toll jumps to 19], Associated Press (reprinted in Yahoo!

An Iranian official at the [[Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance]] announced the expulsion of [[BBC]] Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne but said the BBC office in Tehran would remain open.

[[Press TV]], an Iranian English-language news channel funded by the Iranian Government, reported that the Guardian Council admitted that there were some irregularities in the election, specifically that in over 50 cities more votes were cast than there were eligible voters. The council's spokesman, Abbas-Ali Kadkhodaei, stated that, "Statistics provided by [[Mohsen Rezaee|Mohsen Rezaei]] in which he claims more than 100% of those eligible have cast their ballot in 170 cities are not accurate -- the incident has happened in only 50 cities."  The council also reported that these regularities would affect approximately 3 million votes, but stated that, "it has yet to be determined whether the amount is decisive in the election results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail/98711.htm?sectionid=351020101 Guardian Council: Over 100% voted in 50 cities].

The Guardian Council, the body in charge of supervising and certifying the elections in Iran, declared the incumbent President Ahmadinejad winner after dismissing the vote challenges, according to a front-page report on CNN.com. The report said that PressTV, a semi-state run television network in the nation announced the decision via a spokesperson for the group. They said that while they agreed that in up to 50 cities votes were higher than those eligible to vote, but that it was not enough to result in anything beyond further investigations.

Speaking at a news conference on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman [[Hassan Qashqavi]] accused Western governments of explicitly backing violent protests aimed at undermining the stability of Iran's Islamic Republic. He said the West was acting in an "anti-democratic" manner, instead praising Iran's commitment to democracy and stressing once again that the results of the presidential election were unimpeachable. Iran has strongly criticised the US and UK governments in recent days, and Mr Qashqavi reserved special scorn for the [[BBC]] and for the [[Voice of America]] network, which he called "government channels". He spoke as Tehran remained tense but quiet amid heavy security aimed at preventing new protests against the result of Iran's presidential election. Mr [[Mousavi]] has told his supporters, who have taken to the streets in their tens of thousands for more than a week, to continue their protests but not to put their lives in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8112176.stm|title=West 'seeks Iran disintegration'|date=2009-06-22|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]]'s live blog reported that at approximately 1:30 pm, General [[Ali Fazli]], the newly appointed commander of the Revolutionary Guards in Tehran province, has been arrested for refusing to carry Khamenei's order to use force against demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2009/jun/22/iran-ayatollah-ali-khamenei Iran in crisis: live].

At 4:30 pm Tehran time, Iran's ambassador to London was summoned to the Foreign Office and told that Khamenei's remarks were unacceptable. British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] later condemned the "repression" and "brutality" used against the protesters. At approximately the same time the British Embassy in Tehran announced they were evacuating the families of embassy staff members and issued a [[travel advisory]] against visiting Iran. The Foreign Office noted that, "further violence is possible," but said it did not believe it was necessary for British nationals already in Iran to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/22/iran-embassy-staff-families-evacuated Britain evacuates families of embassy staff in Iran] [[The Guardian]] Published 22 June 2009 17.07 BST.

Former Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]] reportedly made a call for peaceful mass stand-ins in bazaars across Iran, with the aim of disrupting commerce while avoiding the violent police crackdowns which have accompanied the more overt protests and riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narcosphere.narconews.com/thefield/bazaar-comrades|title=To the Bazaar, Comrades!|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A caller into the [[CNN]] newsroom who is a female Iranian citizen claimed that in [[Baharestan]] Square, [[Basij]] forces shot bullets into the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02qY9K2iOqA |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also claimed that students and old men alike were being beaten by these guards. In addition, it was believed that these [[Basij]] guards did not speak [[Persian language|Persian]] because they did not understand nor did they respond to the cries from the protesters. She reported that these [[Basij]] militia-men came out of a local [[mosque]] by the hundreds to violently attack protesters.

On this day numerous violent confrontations with the [[Basij]] were reported. It seems as if the violence has started again in [[Tehran]], but again, as of this date, these reports are confirmed with few photos and videos.

There were also reports of protesters at the Iranian Parliament building coming under sniper fire from Basiji. While Wednesday's protests were relatively small in terms of the numbers of people involved, they are said to have been some of the bloodiest during the unrest. Iranian dissidents claim the day's violence raised the death toll to 249 the last ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/25/opposition-alters-tactics-to-avoid-protest-deaths/|title=Iran protesters alter tactics to avoid death|date=2009-06-25|publisher=The Washington Times|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirhossein Mousavi remained defiant, denouncing the election as an "evil conspiracy," and refusing to "withdraw [his protests] for even one moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/06/mousavis-graceful-resistance.html|title=Mousavi's Graceful Resistance|date=2009-06-25|publisher=Andrew Sullivan - The Atlantic|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the earlier violence, June 25 was the calmest day that Tehran had seen in nearly two weeks. A source for [[The Guardian (UK)|The Guardian]] reported that this was likely due, at least in part, to the national university entrance exams being conducted on that day, in which 1.5 million young Iranians participated.&lt;ref name="guardian-iran-crisis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2009/jun/25/iran-crisis|title=Iran crisis: live|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-06-29 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Nasaw | date=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another opposition candidate, [[Mahdi Karroubi]], postponed a vigil of mourning for the victims scheduled for June 25, pushing the date back at least a week. According to Karroubi's website, the memorial service was delayed because the authorities had not granted the organizers permission to hold the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/25/world/main5112528.shtml|title=Mousavi Faces Heat, But Vows Not To Crack|date=2009-06-25|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the relative quiet, there were still a few incidents. A group of mourners attempted to visit the grave of Neda Agha Soltan, but were turned away by riot police. Those who refused the order to disperse or were seen carrying green signs were arrested.&lt;ref name="guardian-iran-crisis" /&gt; Clashes were also reported in and around Enghelab square, a site of previous violence. Protesters were said to have come from two sides and tried to drive the police from the square. Youths reportedly threw stones at blockades and set a bus on fire, and gunfire was reported in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/06/livetweeting-the-revolution-day-10.html|title=Live-Tweeting The Revolution: Week 2|date=2009-06-28|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day also saw the releases of a number of prominent Iranians who had been arrested for their parts in the opposition. According to Human Rights Watch, sixty-six of the seventy Iranian professors arrested the previous night were released from jail. Also freed were Alireza Beheshti, editor-in-chief of the pro-Mousavi newspaper Kalameh, and a photographer from the citizen journalist organization [[Demotix]].&lt;ref name="guardian-iran-crisis" /&gt;

Ayatollah [[Ahmed Khatami]], a senior cleric [[Government of Iran|of Islamic republic]] called for pro-democracy protest leaders to be punished "without mercy" including execution for some. Khatami stated that "anyone who takes up arms to fight with [[An-Nas|the people]], they are worthy of execution," and "those who disturbed the peace and destroyed public property were 'at war with God'" and "should be 'dealt with without mercy'".&lt;ref name=nomercy&gt;{{Cite news |title=Call to execute Iran protest chiefs |newspaper=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/8579273 |date=June 26, 2009 | location=London | accessdate=March 28, 2010 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Human Rights Watch, Basijis carried out nighttime raids, destroying property and beating citizens, in attempts to stop the rooftop protest calls of "Allahu akbar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moriab.blogspot.com/2009/06/for-immediate-release-iran-night-raids.html |title=Iran Watch Canada |publisher=Moriab.blogspot.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Tehran University, students held a small, candlelight vigil in memory of those killed in the two weeks of unrest. The vigil apparently was peaceful, and proceeded without incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/27/iran-uprising-live-bloggi_n_221809.html |title=Iran Uprising Live-Blogging (Saturday June 27) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= June 27, 2009|accessdate=2010-03-30 |first=Nico |last=Pitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====June 28====

Responding to [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]]'s appeal, Iranian government legally approved a Sunday June 28, 2009, (or Tir 7th 1388 [[Anno Persico]]) peaceful prayer gathering at 6{{nbsp}}pm mourning those killed during the 2009 post-election clashes at the [[Qoba Mosque]] on Ghoba Alley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/1767515/fa/ghoba-street |title=ghoba street تهران |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (North of Hosseinie Ershad Mosque on Doktor Ali-ye Shariati) in Tehran. Diplomats from Muslim and Arab countries may attend. The government promised not to hurt the peaceful mourners present.

Snipers and intelligence officers are seen on the roofs near Ghoba, a unit of Anti-Riot Police warned people to leave, military helicopters hovering in the sky.

Thousands of people are gathered around the Ghoba-Shariati neighborhood.

An estimated 5,000 protesters marched slowly and silently through Tehran Sunday. Government was reportedly allowing demonstration.

The large crowd shouted "Ya [[Hussein]]" in a YouTube footage. A YouTube footage shows that [[Mehdi Karroubi]] entered the crowd at the Ghoba Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 juni 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgUvDmcwmWU |title=حضور کروبی در اعتراضات مردمی روبه روی مسجد قبا |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One witness reported at 8:30{{nbsp}}pm that [[Mohammad Khatami]] and [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]] are reportedly seen earlier at the Mosque. However, another witness said that [[Alireza Beheshti]], son of [[Mohammad Beheshti]] told the crowd that Mousavi was prevented from coming. [[Faezeh Hashemi]] was seen with people that ringed around the banner outside of the Mosque door. The slogans were: "Salam bar Beheshti, Dorood bar Mousavi." [[Mostafa Malekian]] stood in the Ghoba alley with the crowd and sported victory signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parsine.com/pages/?cid=8684 |accessdate=June 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719003416/http://parsine.com/pages/?cid=8684 |archivedate=July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Reza Attaran]] also joined the crowd, wearing a green T-shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 juni 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNvUGCIRZ_4 |title=Reza Attaran Popular TV &amp; Cinema Actor &amp; Director in ghoba رضا عطاران مسجد قبا |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also attending the gathering was [[Hojjat al-Islam]] [[Hadi Ghaffari]].

Because the Shariati Street entrance of Ghoba Alley and the other end were both blocked by barriers, about 2000 mourners packed in the alley, under surveillance of sharpshooters and heavy police presence, especially those fully deployed along Shariati Street. A witness reported that police used tear gas to disperse the people at the northern end of the Ghoba Alley.

There are Facebook posters who claimed to have attended the Ghoba gathering who disputed that there was serious clashes, claiming that the exit towards the United Nations office (which is at the northern end of Ghoba Alley) was peaceful and free of tear gassing or clashes. This claim, along with those of serious clashes, cannot be verified.

All YouTube postings that shows Ghoba setting are peaceful so far, including one with the crowd surrounding [[Alireza Beheshti]], who spoke via a loudspeaker, and was watched by a police officer behind. Beheshti conveyed to the crowd a message delivered by Mousavi over the phone. On the same day, there are new YouTube postings of some street (allegedly on Shariati Street leading to Ghoba Alley) marches with "[[Marg bar diktator]]" (death to dictator) shouted in unison, and some with smoldering objects and gunshots dispersing rioters. But these were clearly not shot at the narrow alley of Ghoba, and not necessarily on Sunday the 28th. The safety in the surrounding of a historical mosque, coinciding with an important memorial date in the Islamic Republic seem to have given police forces and the protesters such an uneasy moment of truce and standstill. This matches the pattern throughout centuries of Islamic history in which religiously-sanctioned gatherings became moments of freedom of political expression, and in which political dissents became symbiotic with a community held together by common interpretation of faith, which secular authorities had difficulties in outlawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 juni 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcvfXKe1y30 |title=June 28 Iranians rally at Ghoba Mosque (also spelled Qoba) on Shariati Street, Tehran |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-06-28 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to some witnesses to urge the Muslims among the Greens to pray silently in large numbers at mosques during prayer hours, especially on Fridays, as a silent protest against the government's prohibition on any gathering.

Despite this, the government's arrest of 8 British embassy employees (with 4 later released) is another indicator of its readiness to intimidate the international community. Khamenei has issued a statement warning "both sides"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/06/28/iran.demonstration/index.html |title=Thousands demonstrate silently in Tehran |publisher=CNN.com |date= June 28, 2009|accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to provoke each other, hinting that further wanton police brutality is perceived by the Supreme Leader, if not by Ahmadinejad's faction, to be costly for the regime's shaky rule.

The Sunday June 28 large gathering outside the [[Qoba Mosque]] in Tehran. And YouTube footage of the gathering outside Ghoba:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 juni 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v-OOpUbkm8 |title=مسجد قبا-شریعتی-هفتم تیر 88 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as Tehran time 7{{nbsp}}pm, most English mainstream media, including Washington Times and Al Jazeera,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/06/2009628192214829335.html |title=Middle East - Iranian police 'beat protesters' |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  reported "police clashing with 3000 protesters around Ghoba", but cited the lack of verifiable accounts from Tehran due to government press control. Injuries were reported, among them an elderly woman who was allegedly beaten by police. Her beating reportedly enraged nearby protestors, who attacked the police in turn&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/top/all/6501464.html ]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Sunday June 28 YouTube posting shows a riot raging in a northern Tehran neighborhood with the [[Alborz]] Mountain in the backdrop, which was on an unconfirmed date around sunset. The entire neighborhood was shrouded in smoke. Flame was visible on a street nearby. And the video camera, viewing from a tall building, could record a uniformed armed policeman randomly shooting into the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 juni 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EgJwm-IlNQ |title=28 June - Tehran - last News |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by midnight Tehran time, CNN described the Ghoba protest as "silent", with peaceful end. The Iranian government-funded [[Press TV]] also described the event as "silent", consisting of "hundreds" of people that are admittedly "Mousavi supporters" commemorating the 1981 martyrdom of [[Mohammad Beheshti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=99288&amp;sectionid=351020101 |title=Mousavi supporters join Beheshti commemorators |publisher=Presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701111805/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=99288&amp;sectionid=351020101 |archivedate=2009-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in a show of solidarity with the Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachaqs/sets/72157620539995973/ |title=#IranElection Paris rally - june 28, 2009 - a set on Flickr |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2009-06-28 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Egyptian security forces shut down a scheduled solidarity march through the streets of Cairo, planned in honor of Neda Agha Soltan. Egyptian dissidents accused their government of hypocrisy, for having denounced the Iranian regime's repressive actions only days before banning the march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2009/06/egypt-marsh-showing-solidarity-with-iranian-martyr-banned.html |title=EGYPT: Police shut down Iran solidarity march &amp;#124; Babylon &amp; Beyond &amp;#124; Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the floor of the Iranian Parliament, a physical confrontation broke out between MP Pezeshkian, who had urged the regime to show restraint, and hard-line MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.baztabonline.com/Default%2Cfa-IR%2CBaztabOnline%2CContent%2CNewsDetail%2CKey%2C15345.aspx&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto%7Cen&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8 |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signs of unrest continued today. Motorists in Tehran beeped their horns to signal their support for Mousavi, prompting basiji patrols to slash tires and break windshields. Meanwhile, in response to rumors of a human chain being formed, Tehran police massed at Valieasr Street to stop demonstrators from assembling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/29/iran-uprising-live-bloggi_n_222087.html |title=Iran Uprising Live-Blogging (Monday June 29) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2010-03-30 |first=Nico |last=Pitney}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this night, the rooftop chants of "Allahu akbar" continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/30/iran-uprising-live-bloggi_n_222970.html |title=Iran Uprising Live-Blogging (Tuesday June 30) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= June 30, 2009|accessdate=2010-03-30 |first=Nico |last=Pitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guardian Council reaffirmed Ahmadinejad's victory after recounting 10% of the votes. Upon the announcement of this news, protesters once again took to the streets of Tehran, and clashes were reported in the city. Although the police cleared the streets relatively quickly, citizens throughout the capital resumed the shouting of revolutionary slogans from the rooftops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/world/middleeast/30iran.html | work=The New York Times | title=Iran Council Certifies Ahmadinejad Victory | first=Michael | last=Slackman | date=June 30, 2009 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crowd of over 2,000 people gathered at a courthouse in [[Uromieh]] seeking information about jailed relatives. No protest activity or violence was reported at this gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/june-30-latest-updates-on-irans-post-election-turmoil/ | work=The New York Times | first=Rogene | last=Fisher | date=June 30, 2009 | accessdate=March 28, 2010 | title=June 30: Latest Updates on Iran's Post-Election Turmoil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many expatriates from [[Muslim countries]] expressed that they wish to visit the [[Behesht-e Zahra]] Cemetery in peace, or at least as close to the site of [[Neda Agha-Soltan]]'s first burial site as possible on Saturday-Sunday, July 4–5, the 2-week anniversary of her death, since the martyred woman wasn't given a proper Muslim funeral.

On the date of Ghoba, although some expatriates expressed that they would like to attend the Mosque gathering to show faith to Allah, the Ahmadinejad regime arrested 9 British diplomats as soon as they caught wind that certain Iranian-born British diplomats might be attending. Now most of the British diplomats were released under international pressure. But this{{Which|date=July 2009}} Iranian-born British diplomat is still under interrogation.

Recently, because Ahmadinejad has openly insulted the Prophet's two Sahaba,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/07/02/77608.html|title=Ahmadinejad unwelcome in Egypt: lawyer|publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] News Network|accessdate=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  he has drawn much anger from the Ikhwan al-Muslimin in Egypt, and much contempt from even [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Mubarak pointed out, he or the King of Saudi Arabia would never insult the [[Shia]] faith in such a manner. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

====July 2====

Thursday, July 2, thousands of relatives of dead protesters marched towards the [[Behesht-e Zahra]] cemetery, where mass graves were set aside for the dead, and where [[Neda Agha-Soltan]] is buried. These mourners were reportedly frustrated by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=2 juli 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gik9pHVyzhs |title=Tehran July 2 |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands mourn Neda Agha-Soltan at Behesht Cemetery, Tehran. Her grave was strewn with rose petals, and adorned with the slogan "We Are Neda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demotix.com/news/mourning-dead-tehran |title=Mourning the dead in Tehran |publisher=Demotix.com |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demotix.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_652x488_scaled/photos/99606.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demotix.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_652x488_scaled/photos/99605.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demotix.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_652x488_scaled/photos/99602.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; New YouTube video surfaced on July 3 of the moment before Neda was shot. Video was filmed on roof top. Even though Khosravi Street was not directly filled with violence, it was certainly not far from the view of bike-riding Basijis. The shot that killed her was not the only shot heard in the video, though the last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIyLCOSDIlo |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was apparent that the black-veiled woman (apparently Neda) accompanied by the blue-shirted old man (apparently Panahi), was shot by the bike-riding Basijis shooting at the "Marg bar diktator!" shouters, who were not close, but fully within view of the walking woman. This observation is in sharp contrast to the Iranian government's explanation that Neda's shooting was carefully set up by [[Arash Hejazi]]. If Neda's death was so carefully set up, the dozens of other violent deaths in Tehran in these few weeks can also be likewise explained, while the police and Basijis were the only people evidently armed with fire weapons, and were caught on films smashing private properties without provocation. It is also contrary to the account that the site of her shooting is entirely out of the range of rioting streets. What this video can not show, is whether there was any armed bike-riders going out of their way from the rioting street behind, to attack the woman at close range.

The Assembly of Teachers and Scientists at the [[Qom]] School for Shiite Clerics declared the 2009 election in which Ahmadinejad won "illegitimate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/world/middleeast/05iran.html | work=The New York Times | title=Clerical Leaders Defy Ayatollah on Iran Election | first1=Michael | last1=Slackman | first2=Nazila | last2=Fathi | date=July 5, 2009 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This date, being an anniversary of [[Iran student protests, July 1999|18 Tir Massacre]], had been predicted to be a day of massive protests in Tehran. Indeed, protests broke out, with about 700 people chanting "Death to dictator!" in front of Tehran University. Other protest, by about 200 people took place at Vali-e Asr Street. Both protests were dispersed by police using batons and tear gas, however protesters managed to regroup in other places again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124714734408618155|title=Hundreds Defy Authorities and Protest in Iran|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2009-07-09 | first=Farnaz | last=Fassihi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security operations against protests are difficult, as vast areas of Iranian territory were covered with [[dust storm]], including Tehran, where many offices and schools had to be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8139007.stm|title=Iran hit by sandstorm pollution|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-07-07}}
And also several university dormitories (such as the dorms of university of Amirkabir(Polytechnic) of Tehran, a highly ranked university of various types of engineering, were raided by the Basij militiamen, crucially beating the students in their rooms at about 2{{nbsp}}am and demolishing their belongings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian people held peaceful demonstrations all over the country.

July 30 morning 2{{nbsp}}am, [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]]'s aides sent out invitation for supporters to participate in the July 30th (Thursday Mordad 8th, 1388 [[Anno Persico]]) commemoration of the casualties of the protests, namely [[Neda Agha-Soltan]]. This day represented the end of 40th-day mourning cycle. The message asks supporters to attend peaceful and solemn ceremony at the [[Mosallah Mosque]] of Tehran, the largest mosque in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranfacts.blogspot.com/2007/05/iranian-experience-4.html |title=neo-resistance: Iranian Experience (4) |publisher=Iranfacts.blogspot.com |date=2007-05-14 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Abbas Abad (Tehran)|Abbas Abad]] district. Before the 6{{nbsp}}pm prayer, main activities took place at 4{{nbsp}}pm at the burial sites of the martyrs, namely the [[Behesht-e Zahra]] Cemeteries, which Mousavi and [[Mehdi Karrubi]] were set to attend. After the service at the mosque, the leaders paid visits to and show solidarity with some families who have lost their members in the violence. This message also ties into Mousavi's earlier message that "religious celebrations are opportunities for the display of the 'Green' movement's creativity."

After arriving to Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, Mousavi was forced by police to go back to his car and leave the site. Basij units were dispatched to halt demonstrations and disperse the crowd. Police forces reportedly used tear-gas against the mourners.

During Friday Prayer services in the capital, Ayatollah [[Ahmad Jannati]], a fundamentalist cleric who leads the powerful Guardian Council, called protesters "flagrant examples of the corrupt on Earth" and effectively urged that they be executed as "in the early days of the revolution."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In a public statement released through internet and to media outlets, Mir Hossein Mousavi declares he is ready to be [[martyr]]ed for his cause as hardliner clerics in the regime even call for his and other opposition leaders (including Mehdi Karoubi) execution. Mousavi said on his website: "I am not afraid to die for people's demands. Iran is in serious crisis. Harsh remarks will create internal uprising." As a way out of the crisis, Mousavi has put forward a five-point plan to the Government for political and social reforms. But he says Iran's leaders must accept responsibility for the crisis and stop its crackdown on dissent. He's called for the release of all political prisoners, more transparent election laws, and a recognition of the right to protest and a free press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2009/s2784149.htm Mousavi prepared to die for his cause]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="914">In '''''Tshabalala v Tshabalala''''', an important case in the [[South African law of succession]], the [[last will and testament|will]] in question comprised two pages, but the commissioner signed only the second page and neglected to sign the first page, which actually contained the contents of the will. The will was thus rejected.

The [[testator]]’s [[granddaughter]] (the sole [[wiktionary|heiress]] in the will) sought an order from the [[court of law|court]] declaring the will valid. The court held that the will did not comply with the statutory formalities, and was thus invalid; accordingly, the deceased was held to have died [[intestate]].

'''''Viva Piñata''''' is a Canadian-American [[animated cartoon|animated]] television series. It spawned an [[Xbox 360]] [[Viva Piñata|game]] a couple months later after its release. It is produced by an American company, [[4K Media Inc.|4Kids Productions]] and [[Bardel Entertainment]], a children's animation company in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://4kidsentertainment.com:80/docs/news/2007-0102.pdf|title=4Kids Entertainment Adds To The Growing Viva Pinata Licensing Program With Three New Licensing Deals|publisher=4kidsentertainment.com|date=January 2, 2007|accessdate=August 26, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204032438/http://4kidsentertainment.com/docs/news/2007-0102.pdf|archivedate=February 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It aired to high ratings as part of the [[4Kids TV]] programming block and later moved to [[Toonzai|The CW4Kids]] before being removed from the schedule on October 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://pinataisland.info/forum/showthread.php?p=232006|title=No season 3 for Viva Pinata?|date=August 14, 2008|accessdate=August 26, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227130239/http://pinataisland.info/forum/showthread.php?p=232006|archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is aired on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in Canada,  [[Nicktoons UK|Nicktoons Network]] and [[CITV]] in the UK and on [[Nickelodeon Australia|Nickelodeon]] in Australia.
The series began airing when Magical DoReMi (aka [[Ojamjo Doremi]]) left 4Kids TV due to TV difficulties on August 19, 2006, and the series began airing on August 26, 2006
Viva Pinata was executive produced by Lloyd Goldfine (''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]], [[Pokémon]]) at 4Kids in New York and Paul Griffin at Bardel in Vancouver.  The stories are edited by [[Mike deSeve]], leading a team that includes the award-winning ''[[Daria]]'' head-writer [[Anne Bernstein]] and ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'' story editor [[David Steven Cohen]].

The series has ended its run on January 18, 2009 in Canada. [[4Kids TV]] and [[Toonzai|The CW4Kids]] in the United States stopped airing the show on August 2, 2008 and October 18, 2008 respectively, but it continued to air in Canada on YTV until June 24, 2011.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* '''Hudson Horstachio''': (voiced by [[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]]) A horse piñata with a green teal body like a pistachio, Hudson is one of the most popular piñatas in the business. As a celebrity he sometimes has to disguise himself when in public. His friends often have to keep his ego in check. He enjoys dancing and making extravagant statements about himself.&lt;!-- Hudson ranked First place in the 4kids Viva Piñata Character poll. --&gt;
* '''Franklin Fizzlybear''': (voiced by [[Marc Thompson (voice actor)|Marc Thompson]]) A brown [[grizzly bear]] with purple and yellow stripes. He enjoys surfing, and typically speaks with a surfer accent and related expressions. He is fairly laid back and occasionally has moments of intellectualism. He is not good at lying. He also draws portraits of the other pinatas. In the video game, his surfboard is an item that the player can purchase.
* '''Paulie Pretztail''': (voiced by [[Brian Maillard (voice actor)|Brian Maillard]]) A cross between a pretzel and a red-tailed fox, Paulie is a no-nonsense kind of pinata who could easily be considered to be "the clever-cloggs" of the main cast (besides Les) and Fergy's best friend.  He shares Fergy's aversion of being sent to parties, though it seems more of an annoyance to him, rather than Fergy's idea of thinking of going to a party as frightening, and frequently avoids them. He seems to be good at cooking as shown from the episode ' Recipe for Disaster'.
* '''Fergy Fudgehog''': (voiced by [[David Wills (voice actor)|David Wills]]) A cross between fudge and a hedgehog, Fergy loves candy, but fears parties and Paulie's best friend. He is frequently sought out by Langston to attend parties but always manages to escape his bugcatcher's net. His catchphrase is "Oh, fudge!"
* '''Tina &amp; Teddington Twingersnap''': (voiced by [[Kathleen Delaney]] and [[Jamie McGonnigal]]) A two-headed serpent crossed with gingersnap. They share a body, but argue a lot. They have both been shown to have sub-par gardening skills. Despite the fact that they appear to hate each other (after all, they are Brother and Sister), in one episode when they are accidentally separated, they end up greatly missing their other half. Teddington is the worst singer on Pinata Island and for some reason has a refined British accent.
* '''Les Galagoogoo''': (voiced by [[Eric Stuart]]) A cross between a [[Galago]] and [[GooGoo Cluster|GooGoo]], Les is smart and dextrous, however, when he speaks, it comes out as high-pitched gibberish. Les ranked second place in the 4Kids Viva Piñata character poll. It appears that the main cast may be able to understand him, but simply ignore him. In one episode, he was able to speak, but he was ignored as he always had been.
* '''Ella Elephanilla''': (voiced by [[Rebecca Soler]]) A cross between an elephant and vanilla, Ella suffers from [[short-term]] [[memory loss]], thus contradicting the saying that an elephant never forgets. She enjoys ballet. Because of her elegant moves, this caused Paulie and Fergy to both get huge, temporary crushes on her. They even asked her to a dance, but she forgot they had both asked her. No evidence has been shown that both Fergy and Paulie still have a crush on her, if they do, they are very subtle about it.
* '''Langston Lickatoad''': (voiced by [[Mike Pollock (voice actor)|Mike Pollock]]) A cross between a licorice and a toad, Langston operates the Cannoñata. He regularly tries to catch the stealthy duo Fergy and Paulie in order to send them to parties.
* '''Professor Pester''': (voiced by [[Michael Alston Baley]]) The main villain of the series. In all the episodes he appears in, he and his Ruffians try to capture and destroy a piñata, (usually Hudson) if not all of them, to obtain their candy. Note that he does not appear to be a piñata. When he had his personality reversed and happily gobbled up all of Fergy's candy, he was scanned on the way to the Cannoñata and found to have no candy. Nor do any of his ruffians appear to be piñatas; an episode shows that they resided on the island before the arrival of Pester and were partially responsible for the failure of his Sours experiment. His catchphrase is "I have no regrets", and he always says it when his plans backfire and he ends up losing. He and the Ruffians are the only non-pinatas from the games to have made it to the show, though to be noted Leafos makes a split second cameo in the theme song right when the announcer states "Welcome to Pinata Island" as the screen is panning over a field.

===Recurring characters===
* Beverly Badgesicle: Hudson's biggest, very obsessive fan.
* Cecil Cocoadile: Cecil is the only piñata on the island who thinks Chortles' jokes are funny, causing him to burst into tears laughing. In the piñata world, cocoadile tears make excellent [[fertilizer]], so while laughing and crying at his bad jokes, he is also helping Chortles with his garden.
* Chortles Chippopotamus: (voiced by [[Sean Schemmel]]) Chortles has a horrible sense of humor, but fantastic gardening skills. Only Cecil Cocoadile thinks his jokes are funny, and Chortles uses Cecil's tears to help his garden grow.
* Dr. Quincy Quackberry: A doctor and [[psychiatrist]] with a [[Groucho Marx]]-like personality. He wears glasses and a tie, and he customarily tells poor jokes.
* The Great Bonboon (or just "The Bonboon"): A creature who pretends to be an all-knowing guru to steal candy from gullible piñatas like Professor Pester. He is usually meditating, but when no one is present, he talks to his friend Sid on the phone in his normal voice. Paulie is the only pinata who sees through his ruse. 
* King Roario: (voiced by Dan Green) The King of Pinata Island.
* Mabel Moozipan: She owns a well-kept vegetable garden and despises trespassers. She is friends with Florence Fizzlybear.
* Pecky Pudgeon: (voiced by Eric Stuart) Pecky takes photos for the local newspaper of Piñata Island, the Pinata Yada Yada. He loves gossiping about everyone and will go to great lengths to bring in a juicy scoop for the paper. (He makes a cameo in the game taking a photo of Gretchen when she first appears)
* Pierre Parrybo: (voiced by [[Pete Zarustica]]) Pierre organizes various activities on Piñata Island. He's also the DJ for a call-in radio show.
* Ruffians: Professor Pester's bumbling henchmen who usually ruin his plans, since they don't comprehend orders well. They waddle from side to side in their walk, and they love to prank one another. According to Pester, three are boys and one is a girl.
* Petunia Pretztail: (voiced by Sieko Shih) A kung-fu warrior who is friends with Florence Fizzlybear, Francine Fudgehog, and especially Haily Hostachio, and teaches Fergy and Paulie how to find their own "fu"
* Prewitt Profitamole: (voiced by [[Mike MacRae]]) A brilliant animal who seems to be the only mechanic on the island and he is a wonder at inventing. He also has a love for soaps, and watches them avidly.
* Shirley Shellybean: Shirly is optimistic and always is ready to start a new adventure.
* Simone Cinnamonkey: (voiced by Rebecca Soler) Hudson's brisk and resourceful agent. He speaks very quickly, rapidly counting off Hudson's schedule. Sometimes, he seems to want his pay more than Hudson's fame, but he is occasionally shown to care for him in both stern and encouraging ways.
