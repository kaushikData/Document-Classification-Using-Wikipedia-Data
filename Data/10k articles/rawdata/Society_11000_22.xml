{{Scandals in Turkey}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}
The '''2013 corruption scandal in [[Turkey]]''' refers to a criminal investigation that involves several key people in the [[Cabinet Erdoğan III|Turkish government]]. All of the 52 people detained on 17 December were connected in various ways with the ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP). Prosecutors accused 14 people{{snd}} including [[Suleyman Aslan]], the director of state-owned [[Halkbank]], [[Iran]]ian businessman [[Reza Zarrab]], and several family members of cabinet ministers{{snd}} of [[bribery]], [[corruption]], [[fraud]], [[money laundering]] and [[gold]] [[smuggling]].&lt;ref name="Turkey's Mother of All Corruption Scandals"&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/06/why-turkeys-mother-of-all-corruption-scandals-refuses-to-go-away/ Why Turkey’s Mother of All Corruption Scandals Refuses to Go Away] - ForeignPolicy.com &lt;/ref&gt; 

At the heart of the scandal was an alleged "gas for gold" scheme with [[Iran]] involving Aslan, who had US$4.5 million in cash stored in shoeboxes in his home, and Zarrab, who was involved in about US$9.6 billion of gold trading in 2012. Both men were arrested.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/recap-of-corruption-scandal-in-turkey-2013-12 |title=Recap Of Corruption Scandal In Turkey |publisher=Business Insider |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme worked after officials of the Turkish government found a loophole in U.S. sanctions against Iran that allowed them to get Iranian oil and gas. The Turks exported some US$13 billion of gold to Iran directly, or through the [[UAE]], between March 2012 and July 2013. In return, the Turks received Iranian natural gas and oil. The transaction was carried out through Turkish state-owned bank, Halkbank. In January 2013, the [[Obama administration]] decided to close this loophole but instead of immediately charging Halkbank, the U.S. government allowed its gold trading activities to continue until July 2013, because Turkey was an important U.S. ally regarding U.S. policy in the [[Syrian Civil War]], and the U.S. had been working on a [[Iran nuclear deal framework|nuclear deal with Iran]].&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"/&gt; 

Then-Prime Minister Erdoğan (now [[President of Turkey]]) was out on a foreign tour of Pakistan when the scandal broke, which analysts believe changed the response of the AKP or influenced those with the tapes to leak them at a time when Erdoğan was touring a key ally ([[Pakistan]]) abroad.&lt;ref name=fireworks&gt;{{cite news |author=Özgür Altuncu |title=Başbakan Erdoğan Pakistan'da havai fişeklerle karşılandı |language=tr |trans-title=Prime Minister Erdoğan was greeted in Pakistan with fireworks |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/25423583.asp |date=23 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police investigation and allegations==
On 17 December 2013, the Financial Crime Unit of the Istanbul Security Directorate detained 47 people, including officials from TOKİ (Housing Development Administration of Turkey), the [[Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning (Turkey)|Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning]], and the [[Fatih|District Municipality of Fatih]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sozcu.com.tr/2013/genel/buyuk-rusvet-ve-yolsuzluk-operasyonunda-gozaltina-alinanlarin-isimleri-425968/ |title=Büyük rüşvet operasyonunda gözaltına alınanların işlemleri sürüyor |language=tr |trans-title=Great bribery operation continues operations in detainees |newspaper=[[Sözcü]] |date=18 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barış Güler]], [[Kaan Çağlayan]] and [[Oğuz Bayraktar]], who are sons of the Turkish ministers, [[Muammer Güler]] ([[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Minister of the Interior]]), [[Zafer Çağlayan]] (Minister of Economy), and [[Erdoğan Bayraktar]] ([[Ministry of Environment and City Planning (Turkey)|Minister of Environment and Urban Planning]]) were implicated, as well as Mustafa Demir, the mayor of the district municipality of Fatih; the real estate businessman [[Ali Ağaoğlu]]; Süleyman Aslan, the general manager of [[Halk Bankası|Halkbank]] and the [[Iran]]ian businessman [[Reza Zarrab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/25378685.asp |title=İstanbul'da yolsuzluk ve rüşvet operasyonu |language=tr |trans-title=Corruption and bribery operation in Istanbul |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was considered as the key suspect in the investigation, who was reportedly involved in a money laundering scheme particularly regarding his transfer of gold and money to Iran via Turkey’s government-controlled Halkbank as part of a strategy to bypass United States-led sanctions on Iran.&lt;ref name="Turkey's Mother of All Corruption Scandals"/&gt; Demir was detained on accusations of approving the construction license for a hotel near the route of the recently inaugurated [[Marmaray]] railway, despite warnings from Japanese engineers that the construction could put the tunnel at risk of collapsing. Demir was investigated for ordering the ministry report to be shelved in exchange for bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-pm-erdogan-says-those-who-target-him-through-graft-probe-will-not-succeed.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=60154&amp;NewsCatID=338|title=Turkish PM Erdoğan says those who target him through graft probe will not succeed - POLITICS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moreover, [[Egemen Bağış]], the Minister of European Union Affairs, is cited in newspaper articles as a potential suspect of bribery related to [[Reza Zarrab]] who has business affiliations with [[Babak Zanjani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/uc_bakana_rusvet_suclamasi-1166735 | title=Üç bakana rüşvet suçlaması | language=tr | trans-title=Three facing charges of bribery | date=18 December 2013 | newspaper=[[Radikal]] | accessdate=18 December 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219021159/http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/uc_bakana_rusvet_suclamasi-1166735 | archive-date=19 December 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/yolsuzluk-ve-rusvet-sorusturmasinda-egemen-bagis-goruntuleri-de-cikti/246398 | title=Yolsuzluk ve rüşvet soruşturmasında Egemen Bağış görüntüleri de çıktı! |language=tr |trans-title=Corruption and bribery investigation Egemen Bagis also output images! | date=19 December 2013 | publisher=T24 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Thomas Erdbrink | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/world/middleeast/to-this-tycoon-iran-sanctions-are-like-gold.html?_r=0| title=To This Tycoon, Iran Sanctions Were Like Gold| date=5 October 2013 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of corruption claims along with 3 other ministers, Bağış was the only one out of the four charged ministers who had not resigned on 25 December 2013. Prime Minister Erdoğan announced a major cabinet reshuffle, removing Bağış from his post as the Minister for European Union through his publicly unannounced official resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/main.aspx?home=http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2013/12/20131227.htm&amp;main=http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2013/12/20131227.htm |title=BAKANLARIN İSTİFASI VE ATANMASINA DAİR İŞLEM |date=25 December 2013 |agency=T.C.

The police confiscated some US$17.5 million as money used in bribery during the investigation; US$4.5 million was found at Süleyman Aslan's residence and US$750,000 at Barış Güler's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 December 2013 |url=http://www.aktifhaber.com/operasyonda-ele-gecirilen-para-miktari-905081h.htm |title=Operasyonda Ele Geçirilen Para Miktari |language=tr |trans-title=The amount of money seized in operation |publisher=Aktif Haber |accessdate=7 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606215900/http://www.aktifhaber.com/operasyonda-ele-gecirilen-para-miktari-905081h.htm |archive-date=6 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors accused 14 people including Barış Güler, Kaan Çağlayan, Süleyman Aslan and Reza Zarrab of bribery, corruption, fraud, [[money laundering]] and [[smuggling]] gold. On 21 December, the court ordered the arrest of these 14 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/25412674.asp |date=21 December 2013 |title=2 Bakan oğlu ile Reza Zarrab tutuklandı |language=tr |trans-title=Reza was arrested with two Ministers son Zarraba |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 91 people were detained in the investigation; 26 of them were arrested by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/21119/Operasyonda_toplam_tutuklu_sayisi_ve_isimler.html |title=Operasyonda toplam tutuklu sayısı ve isimler |language=tr |trans-title=The total number of prisoners and the operation names |date=21 December 2013 |newspaper=[[Cumhuriyet]] |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second wave===
Several newspapers reported that a new investigation was expected on 26 December, possibly involving then-Prime Minister (now [[President of Turkey]]) Erdoğan's sons, [[Bilal Erdoğan]] and [[Ahmet Burak Erdoğan|Burak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/devlet-ve-siyaset/erdogan-oglunu-koruyor-sorusturma-savcidan-alindi-haberi-84919 |title=Erdoğan oğlunu koruyor: Soruşturma savcıdan alındı! |language=tr |trans-title=Erdoğan remains sons were taken from prosecutors investigating! |date=26 December 2013 |newspaper=[[SoL (newspaper)|SoL]] |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as certain [[Al-Qaeda]] affiliates from [[Saudi Arabia]] such as Sheikh Yaseen Al Qadi and Osama Khoutub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-335038-report-al-qaeda-suspects-flee-after-turkish-govt-blocks-raid.html |title=Report: Al Qaeda suspects flee after Turkish gov't blocks raid |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |date=26 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108013004/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-335038-report-al-qaeda-suspects-flee-after-turkish-govt-blocks-raid.html |archive-date=8 November 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The police officers in Istanbul Security Directorate, newly appointed by the government just a few days previously, refused to carry out their orders, and the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions did not approve this new operation. The man behind this second investigation, Prosecutor [[Muammer Akkaş]], was dismissed on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://haber.gazetevatan.com/2-dalga-emniyete-takildi/595535/1/gundem |title=Savcı operasyondan alındı |language=tr |trans-title='Received from the Attorney-operation' |newspaper=[[Vatan]] |date=26 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akkaş said he was prevented from performing his duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-335036-prosecutor-removed-from-new-graft-probe-amid-concerns-of-cover-up.html |title=Prosecutor removed from new graft probe amid concerns of cover-up |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |date=26 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108012858/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-335036-prosecutor-removed-from-new-graft-probe-amid-concerns-of-cover-up.html |archive-date=8 November 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second wave of arrests was planned, and a list was [[News leak|leaked]] to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/devlet-ve-siyaset/iste-ikinci-dalgadaki-gozalti-listesi-haberi-84969 |title=İşte ikinci dalgadaki gözaltı listesi! |language=tr |trans-title=Here is the list of detainees in the second wave! |newspaper=[[SoL (newspaper)|SoL]] |date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At midnight on 7 January, a government decree was published removing 350 police officers from their positions, including the chiefs of the units dealing with financial crimes, smuggling and organised crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25637710 |title=Turkish corruption probe row deepens |publisher=BBC News |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fethullah Gülen]] described the decree as a purge of civil servants, while then-[[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Prime Minister Erdoğan]] (now [[President of Turkey]]) described the corruption investigation as a "judicial coup" by those jealous of his success, backed by foriengers, namely a "dirty plot" of the [[Gülen movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/07/turkish-police-removed-posts-corruption |title=Hundreds of Turkish police removed from posts |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 January 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110144248/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/07/turkish-police-removed-posts-corruption |archivedate=10 January 2014 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Government reaction==
Since the beginning of the investigation, the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party (AKP)]] government has started a purge in the police force; sacking dozens of police chiefs, most notably [[Hüseyin Çapkın]], the Chief of Police in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/istanbul_emniyetinde_25_mudurun_yeri_degisti-1167417|title=İstanbul Emniyeti'nde 25 müdürün yeri değişti|language=tr |trans-title=Positions of the 25 police managers has changed in ıstanbul|newspaper=[[Radikal]] |date=22 December 2013|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of the Interior and the [[Ministry of Justice (Turkey)|Ministry of Justice]] also changed their regulations, forcing security forces to inform their seniors of their actions at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/25412900.asp |title=Adli Kolluk Yönetmeliği'nde değişiklik yapıldı |language=tr |trans-title=Changes were made to the Judicial Police Regulation |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=21 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This received criticism from the [[Turkish Bars Association|Union of Turkish Bar Associations]], who are taking the case to the [[Turkish Council of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Zeynep Gürcanli |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/25426050.asp |title=Adli Kolluk Yönetmeliği'ne iptal davası |language=tr |trans-title=Regulation of Judicial Police action for annulment |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=23 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkish Council of State]] overturned the change of these regulations on 27 December, much to the disappointment of Prime Minister Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/25453285.asp |title=Danıştay Adli Kolluk Yönetmeliği'ni durdurdu |language=tr |trans-title=Judicial Police stopped by the State Council Regulations |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=28 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various opposition sources accused the government of trying to influence the judiciary system and covering up the corruption. Among them was the [[Nationalist Movement Party]] MP [[Oktay Vural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_mhpli-vural-hukumet-operasyonun-ustunu-ortup-delilleri-karartmaya-calisiyor_2185211.html |title=MHP'li Vural: Hükümet, operasyonun üstünü örtüp delilleri karartmaya çalışıyor |language=tr |trans-title=MHP Vural: The government is trying to evidence the top of the wrap operation blackout |agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |newspaper=[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]] |date=18 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108013733/http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_mhpli-vural-hukumet-operasyonun-ustunu-ortup-delilleri-karartmaya-calisiyor_2185211.html |archive-date=8 November 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A heated controversy erupted after the release on [[YouTube]] of audio recordings in which Erdoğan was reportedly heard telling his son, Bilal, to urgently get rid of tens of millions of dollars. Erdoğan has claimed the recordings were a montage but the experts begged to differ.&lt;ref name="Turkey's Mother of All Corruption Scandals"/&gt;

In late December, ''[[Hurriyet]]'' and ''[[Yeni Safak]]'' papers published comments by Erdoğan stating he believes he is the ultimate target of a corruption and bribery probe of his allies. The Turkish Prime Minister told journalists that anyone attempting to enmesh him in the scandal would be "left empty handed." Erdoğan reshuffled his Cabinet on 25 Dec, replacing 10 ministers hours after three ministers, whose sons were detained in relation to the probe, resigned. One of those ministers called on Erdoğan to also step down. The ministers’ sons were questioned over the scandal focusing on alleged illicit money transfers to Iran and bribery for construction projects. Two of them were later arrested on bribery charges.&lt;ref name="intimated.com"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |title=Turkish PM Says He Is Target of Graft Probe |url=http://intimated.com/turkish-pm-says-he-is-target-of-graft-probe/ |publisher=Intimated |date=26 December 2013 |accessdate=26 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227111258/http://intimated.com/turkish-pm-says-he-is-target-of-graft-probe/ |archivedate=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hüseyin Çelik]], who is serving as government spokesman, the four ministers who are involved in the investigation offered their resignation to the Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Erdoğan]] on 22 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aksam.com.tr/siyaset/huseyin-celik-4-bakan-istifasini-sundu-sahidim/haber-270751 |title=Hüseyin Çelik: 4 Bakan istifasını sundu, şahidim |language=tr |trans-title=Hüseyin Celik: 4 offered the resignation of Ministers, I swear |newspaper=[[Akşam]] |date=21 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan blamed the investigation on an international [[List of political conspiracies|conspiracy]] and vowed revenge on the [[Gülen movement|Islamic community]] of the preacher [[Fethullah Gülen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dokuzeylulgazetesi.com/haber/basbakan_ininize_girecegiz_didik_didik_edecegiz-4496.html |title=Başbakan: İninize Gireceğiz Didik Didik Edeceğiz |language=tr |trans-title=Prime Minister: We'll enter your Lair We Will Die |publisher=Dokuzeylulgazetesi.com |date=22 December 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been an antagonism between Erdoğan and Gülen for some time: [[Hakan Şükür]], who is often regarded as a disciple of Gülen, had resigned his post in Justice and Development Party on 16 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.trthaber.com/haber/gundem/hakan-sukur-istifa-etti-112463.html |title=Hakan Şükür istifa etti |language=tr |trans-title=Hakan Şükür resigns |date=16 December 2013 |publisher=TRT Haber |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials accused Gulen and his followers of treason and started referring to them as "terrorists."&lt;ref name="Turkey's Mother of All Corruption Scandals"/&gt; 

Erdoğan defended [[Halkbank]] chief executive [[Süleyman Aslan]], describing him as "honest person". Aslan was charged with taking bribes by the prosecutors while the police are said to reportedly have found US$4.5 million in cash stored in shoe boxes in Aslan’s home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-pm-erdogan-says-those-who-target-him-through-graft-probe-will-not-succeed.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=60154&amp;NewsCatID=338 |title=Turkish PM Erdoğan says those who target him through graft probe will not succeed |website=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date=2013-12-26 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Aslan was arrested the bank's stock went down 32% for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-gas-for-gold-deal-with-iran-2013-12 |title=Turkey Gas For Gold Deal With Iran |publisher=Business Insider |date=2013-12-27 |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan also threatened [[Francis J.

{{Politics of Thailand}}
The '''2013–2014 Thai political crisis''' was a period of political instability in [[Thailand]]. Anti-government protests took place between November 2013 and May 2014, organised by the [[People's Democratic Reform Committee]] (PDRC), a political pressure group led by former [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] [[House of Representatives (Thailand)|parliamentary representative]] ([[Member of parliament|MP]]) [[Suthep Thaugsuban]].&lt;ref name="suthep_people's_revolt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Suthep declares 'people's revolt'|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/382361/suthep-declares-people-revolt|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests eventually resulted in the removal of incumbent Prime Minister [[Yingluck Shinawatra]], a [[2014 Thai coup d'état|coup d'état]], and the establishment of the [[National Council for Peace and Order|military junta]].

The primary aim of the protests was the removal of former prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s [[Thaksinocracy|influence]] on Thai politics and the creation of an unelected "people's council" to oversee reforms of the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai protest leader explains demand for 'people's council'|url=http://www.china.org.cn/world/2013-12/04/content_30797670.htm|accessdate=31 May 2014|newspaper=China.org.cn|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters viewed Thaksin as corrupt and damaging to Thailand's democracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Jeffrey Young|title=Turmoil in Thailand - Corruption and a Political Struggle|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/turmoil-in-thailand-corruption-and-a-political-struggle/1857954.html|accessdate=30 May 2014|work=Voice of America|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Aidan|title=Thaksin corruption claims stoke Thai protest outrage|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Thaksin-corruption-claims-stoke-Thai-protest-outra-30224822.html|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he enjoyed strong support in many areas of Thailand, particularly the poorer [[Northern Thailand|north]] and [[Isan|northeast]], due to his reforming social programs and economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stout|first=David|title=Popular But Ruthless|url=http://world.time.com/2013/11/07/thailands-color-war-why-red-hates-yellow/slide/thaksin-shinawatra/|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=Time|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political parties allied to Thaksin had won a majority in every election since 2001.

The protests were first triggered by a proposed blanket amnesty bill that would have pardoned several politicians from various charges since 2004, including Thaksin, Suthep Thaugsuban, and [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]]. Opposition from across the political spectrum, including the pro-government [[Red Shirts (Thailand)|Red Shirt movement]], caused the bill to be rejected unanimously by the [[Senate of Thailand]].&lt;ref name="guardian-protest"/&gt; Anti-government protests continued however, with demonstrators occupying government offices, blocking major road intersections and holding mass rallies in [[Bangkok]] to call for the resignation of Yingluck Shinawatra, the sister of Thaksin, and her [[Pheu Thai Party|Pheu Thai]] government. On 8 December 2013, all 153 opposition Democrat Party [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] resigned and Yingluck dissolved the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], calling a snap [[Thai general election, 2014|general election]] for 2 February.&lt;ref name="parliament_dissolved"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai prime minister dissolves parliament|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2013/12/thai-pm-says-she-will-dissolve-parliament-201312913831169537.html|accessdate=15 December 2013|work=Al Jazeera|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting was disrupted in areas of Bangkok and [[southern Thailand]] by PDRC protesters blocking entry to polling stations, leading to an annulment of the result by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref name = "bbc20140321"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26677772 | title = Thai court rules general election invalid | work= BBC | date = 21 March 2014 | accessdate = 21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic violence, including shootings, bomb attempts and grenades thrown at protesters led to 28 deaths and over 800 injuries during the course of the protests.&lt;ref name="fatalities_16_may" /&gt; On 21 January, Yingluck's government declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding areas, to little effect.

==Background==
The government of Yingluck came to power in the [[Thai general election, 2011|2011 elections]], in which her Pheu Thai Party won an outright majority. Yingluck is a sister of former prime minister Thaksin, and the Pheu Thai Party is closely aligned with him. Thaksin, who was ousted in a [[2006 Thai coup d'état|2006 coup d'état]], lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a 2008 corruption conviction and still commands popular support across much of the country, especially among rural Thais and the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai Senate rejects amnesty bill as opposition mounts|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/World/2013/11/12/Thai-Senate-rejects-amnesty-bill-as-opposition-mounts.aspx/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Star Online|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/almost-year-after-putsch-thailand-military-clings-power|title = Thai-style democracy|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = In: D+C, Vol.42.2015:5|last = Dombrowski|first = Katja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shinawatra family is especially revered in the rural northeast due to the economic and social gains from [[Thaksinomics]]: between 2001 and 2011, [[Isan]]'s GDP per capita more than doubled to US$1,475, while, over the same period, GDP in the Bangkok area soared from US$7,900 to nearly US$13,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai northeast vows poll payback to Shinawatra clan|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/thai-northeast-vows-poll/975082.html|accessdate=8 February 2014|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=31 January 2014|author=Aidan Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several amnesty proposals and amendments to the constitution had been debated by the House of Representatives during Yingluck's premiership. Most of these were popularly perceived as benefiting Thaksin, and were opposed by the Democrat Party. In August 2013, the Pheu Thai-majority House approved a first reading of a draft amnesty bill.&lt;ref name="Bangprapa 2013-08-09"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mongkol Bangprapa |author2=Manop Thip Osod |author3=Aekarach Sattaburuth| title=Amnesty bill cruises first reading|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/363733/amnesty-bill-cruises-first-reading|accessdate=24 November 2013|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street protests leading up to the parliamentary session were held by an anti-Thaksin group calling itself the "People's Democratic Force to Overthrow Thaksinism" (PEFOT), as well as by the Democrat Party, but these failed to gain momentum.&lt;ref name="Pongsudhirak 2013-08-09"&gt;{{cite news |author=Thitinan Pongsudhirak|title=Street rallies yield to parliamentary process|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/363747/street-rallies-yield-to-parliamentary-process|accessdate=24 November 2013|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amnesty bill was handed over to a 35-member scrutinising committee, after which it would be returned to the House for second and third readings.

The committee passed a revised draft of the bill on 18 October 2013.&lt;ref name="Bangprapa 2013-10-18"&gt;{{cite news |author=Mongkol Bangprapa |title=Amnesty bill revision slammed|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/375261/panel-passes-tweaked-amnesty-bill|accessdate=24 November 2013|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, which in its original form was aimed to absolve civilian protesters, excluding protest and government leaders and the military, was drastically expanded into a "blanket amnesty", covering the period from 2004 to 2013. This would have included the corruption charges laid against Thaksin during the 2006 coup, as well as the murder charges against Abhisit and Suthep over their conduct of the [[2010 Thai political protests|2010 mass protests]] in support of Thaksin.

The bill was passed by the Pheu Thai Party–dominated House of Representatives on 1 November 2013 at around 04:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell |first=Charlie |url=http://world.time.com/2013/11/01/thailands-amnesty-bill-unites-political-foes-against-government/ |title=Thailand's Amnesty Bill Unites Political Foes Against Government |work=Time|date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final draft of the bill would have pardoned protesters involved in various incidents of political unrest since 2004, dismissed Thaksin's corruption convictions, and annulled murder charges against Abhisit and Suthep.&lt;ref name="politician amnesty murder"&gt;{{cite news|title=Insight: How Thaksin's meddling sparked a new Thai crisis for PM sister|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/31/us-thailand-amnesty-insight-idUSBREA0U00620140131|accessdate=2 May 2014|agency=Reuters|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Thai PM Abhisit and Former Deputy Charged With Murder|work=Time|url=http://world.time.com/2013/10/29/ex-thai-pm-abhisit-and-former-deputy-charged-with-murder/|accessdate=16 January 2014|date=29 October 2013}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill sparked opposition from both the Democrat Party and the pro-government Red Shirt movement.&lt;ref name="guardian-protest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand: anti-Thaksin protesters set new targets after amnesty bill defeat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/12/thailand-anti-thaksin-protesters-amnesty-bill-defeat|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism was levelled at the government for passing the vote in the unusual pre-dawn session to prevent opposition.&lt;ref name="senators_discuss_bill" /&gt; Thaksin's opponents protested against absolving Thaksin of his convictions. Thaksin supporters criticised the bill for absolving those responsible for the crackdown on the 2010 protests. On 4 November 2013, several protests took place in Bangkok, as well as in several provincial cities. Several universities and organisations issued statements condemning the bill. However, an independent poll conducted between 11–13 November reported that the majority of surveyed Thai people wanted the protests to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poll: Most want an end to protests|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/379620/people-fed-up-with-political-protests-suan-dusit-poll-reveals|accessdate=12 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with strong opposition, Yingluck issued a statement, urging the Senate to contemplate the bill with the interests of the people in mind. (Procedurally, the House could not recall the bill after voting; the decision lay with the Senate.) Pheu Thai Party leaders also promised not to revive the bill, or any other amnesty bills, if it was rejected by the Senate. The Senate subsequently voted on the bill on 11 November 2013, unanimously rejecting it.&lt;ref name="Bangprapa 2013-11-12"&gt;{{cite news|author=Mongkol Bangprapa |title=Senators shoot down blanket amnesty bill|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/379319/senators-reject-amnesty-bill|accessdate=24 November 2013|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25127436 |title=Thailand protests day four: Momentum builds in Bangkok |work=BBC News |date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[International Court of Justice]] confirmed Cambodia's sovereignty over [[Cambodian–Thai border dispute|disputed territory]] near the [[Preah Vihear Temple]], prompting fears of further political tension from analysts, although the border remained calm.

Despite the amnesty bill being dropped, protests in Bangkok continued. Suthep and eight other Democrat members of parliament resigned from their positions to lead demonstrations, calling for the general populace to strike and undertake civil disobedience.&lt;ref name="Post 2013-11-12"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/379322|title=Suthep resigns to head up civil disobedience |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=12 November 2013|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests gradually shifted towards an anti-government agenda, criticising Yingluck and her government for being proxies for Thaksin and being an [[elective dictatorship]]. Several groups protested, including Suthep's Civil Movement for Democracy, the Green Politics group, the Network of Students and People for Reform of Thailand (NSPRT), PEFOT, the Dhamma Army, and the State Enterprises Workers' Relations Confederation.&lt;ref name="suthep_people's_revolt" /&gt; Whistle blowing became a symbol of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nopparat Chaichalearmmongkol|title=Whistle Blowers Call Time Out on Amnesty Bill|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2013/11/07/whistle-blowers-call-time-out-on-amnesty-bill/|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Note that the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD), or "Yellow Shirts", which led protests in 2006 and 2008 had since largely declined in popularity and influence.

=== Constitutional amendment ===
[[File:2013.15-18 Constitutional Court Decision.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The first and last pages of the Constitutional Court's decision with the signatures of the judges]]
{{wikisource|Constitutional Court Decision No. 15–18/2556}}

On 20 November 2013, the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] invalidated a government-proposed amendment to the [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|2007 constitution]],&lt;ref name="ips-critics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Politics-Thailand: New Constitution Regressive Say Critics|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2007/04/politics-thailand-new-constitution-regressive-say-critics/|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=IPS News|date=23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atimes-constitution"&gt;{{cite news|last=Corben|first=Ron|title=Draft constitution faces uphill battle in Thailand|url=http://atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/ID25Ae01.html|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=Asia Times Online|date=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have restored elements of the [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, Buddhist Era 2540 (1997)|1997 "People's" constitution]]. The major alteration would have been the restoration of a fully elected Senate.&lt;ref name=court_rejects_amendments /&gt;

The court found that both the proceedings of the amendment and the contents of the new version were unconstitutional. The court ruled that the final draft voted on by the National Assembly was not the same as the one originally considered, and the new draft was brought to the sessions without an introductory motion. The court also decided that the time limit for amending the draft (which left only one day for the filing of amendments) was unlawful, and many MPs were found to have voted on behalf of absent MPs. With regard to the contents, the court said the amendment would have allowed the relatives of the representatives to become senators, weakening the ability of the Senate to scrutinise the House of Representatives. The 1997 constitution did not prohibit relatives of representatives becoming senators and resulted in the National Assembly gaining the infamous nickname "Assembly of Husbands and Wives" (สภาผัวเมีย). The court also held that the conversion of the Senate into a fully elected chamber would destroy the [[Bicameralism|bicameral system]].&lt;ref name = "gazette"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Thai Court Rules Against Constitution Amendment | work = The Wall Street Journal | date = 20 November 2013 | accessdate = 31 January 2014 | author = Warangkana Chomchuen | url = https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303653004579209584204486364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Constitutional Court says charter amendments unconstitutional | work = The Nation | date = 20 November 2013 | accessdate = 31 January 2014 | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Constitutional-Court-says-charter-amendments-uncon-30220104.html#sthash.kGJomifp.dpuf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its decision, the court stated:&lt;ref name = "gazette"&gt;{{cite journal | script-title=th:คำวินิจฉัยศาลรัฐธรรมนูญที่ 15–18/2556 |trans-title=Constitutional Court Decision No. 15–18/2556 | language = Thai | format = PDF | journal = [[Royal Thai Government Gazette|Government Gazette]] | issue = 5 A | volume = 131 | pages = 1–132 | url = http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2557/A/005/1.PDF | publisher = Cabinet Secretariat | location = Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The constitutional amendment pursuant to the petitions is a return to the former defects which are perilous and likely to bring an end to the faith and harmony of the majority of the Thai people. It is an attempt to draw the Nation back into the canal, as it would bring the Senate back to the state of being an assembly of relatives, assembly of family members and assembly of husbands and wives. In consequence, the Senate would lose its status and vigour as the source of wisdom for the House of Representatives, but would merely be an echo of the people from the same group.

On 25 November 2013, anti-government protesters from the People's Democratic Reform Committee led by Suthep began marched to several government offices and forced their way inside the [[Ministry of Finance (Thailand)|Ministry of Finance]], the Budget Bureau, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Public Relations Department, forcing their closure without police intervention, due to government fears that this could result in a repeat 2006 military coup. Yingluck invoked the [[Internal Security Act (Thailand)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA) in all districts of Bangkok and [[Nonthaburi Province]], and the [[Bang Phli District|Bang Phli]] and [[Lat Lum Kaeo District|Lat Lum Kaeo]] Districts of [[Samut Prakan Province|Samut Prakan]] and [[Pathum Thani Province|Pathum Thani]] Provinces respectively.&lt;ref name = "protesters_storm_ministries"&gt;{{cite news|title=Protesters storm key ministries|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/381680/protesters-storm-key-ministries|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This was in addition to the central districts of Bangkok, where the ISA had been in effect since the previous month.) However, no direct confrontations between the protesters and security authorities occurred. The protesters continued on 27 November by rallying outside another ten ministry offices, cutting off electricity and forcing the evacuation of the [[Department of Special Investigation]]'s headquarters, and staging a sit-in at the [[Chaeng Watthana Government Complex]].

Two persons, one of them a police officer, were killed.&lt;ref name="Abc" /&gt; Protesters armed themselves with sling shots and wore gas masks to fight with police, and around 200 people were injured overall. Due to the escalation in violence, the election commission released a statement in which it urged the government to consider postponing the elections. Deputy Prime Minister Pongthep Thepkanchana responded to the statement on behalf of the government, "February 2, 2014, was set as the election date in the royal decree dissolving Parliament, and there is nothing within the constitution or the law that gives the government the authority to change this date." He explained further that the government remained open to discussions with protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai election body urges delay in polls amid clash|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/2013/12/26/rocks-tear-gas-fly-thai-protests-heat/qcDLeOTJRVvXnYoVGB85pJ/singlepage.html|accessdate=26 December 2013|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=26 December 2013|author=Chris Brummitt|author2=Papitchaya Boonngok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We don't want to overstep the bounds of our authority. We don't want to use force. We try to use peaceful means, talks and meetings to solve the problem."

As part of the speech, Suthep informed the public that the PDRC emptied its bank account before it was frozen at the order of the Department of Special Investigation (DSI), thereby allowing for the compensation of anyone who incurred damage as a result of the protests. Suthep stated that the relatives of the police officer murdered  in the clash on 26 December would be given one million [[Thai baht|baht]] and that this sum would apply to any other deaths. Owners of damaged vehicles and motorcycles would also receive financial aid.&lt;ref name="New" /&gt;

On 2 January 2014, Suthep made a speech at the Rajadamnoen boxing stadium. In this speech he explained the plan for the protest action on 13 January, in which he said that he does not "...want Thailand to become a failed state." According to Suthep, in addition to the closure of major intersections—Pathumwan, Suan Lumpini Park, Asoke, Lardprao and Ratchaprasong—all government offices would be disconnected from electricity and water, and government vehicles would be unable to use emergency lanes (left open for ambulances, people needing medical attention and public buses) on those roads that were occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protest leader Suthep details January 13 strategy|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Protest-leader-Suthep-details-January-13-strategy-30223398.html|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a press conference held on the same day, pro-government leader Jatuporn Promphan launched a new campaign to defend Bangkok against the protesters, whom he called "the elite's network". Jatuporn explained that pro-government forces will "fight under peaceful principles" and that further announcements would be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red shirts vow to keep 'Bangkok open'|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Red-shirts-vow-to-keep-Bangkok-open-30223326.html|access-date=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 2014, the head of the Center for the Administration of Peace and Order (CAPO), Surapong Tovichakchaikul, announced on live television that anyone who joined the protest movement would be in violation of the Thai Criminal Code. Surapong described Operation Occupy Bangkok as a serious threat to the stability of the nation and revealed that the government will enact a "capital protection" plan, involving the simultaneous use of combined forces, to cope with the shutdown. The involvement of the military was not mentioned in the telecast, but Surapong assured viewers that the government's plan complied with international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CAPO to use combined forces against capital shutdown|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/capo-use-combined-forces-capital-shutdown/|access-date=6 January 2014|work=Thai PBS|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the Democracy Monument on the evening of 4 January, Suthep announced that all of Yingluck's assets would be seized following the defeat of the "Thaksin regime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suthep threatens to seize Yingluck's assets|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/suthep-threatens-seize-yinglucks-assets%E2%80%8F/|access-date=7 January 2014|work=Thai PBS|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2014, Suthep led thousands of protesters through western Bangkok in a pre-shutdown march. According to PDRC spokesman [[Akanat Promphan]], two further pre-shutdown marches were scheduled for 7 and 9 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shutdown is illegal, govt warns|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Shutdown-is-illegal-govt-warns-30223505.html|access-date=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck stated on her Facebook page that an election is the best way for the political conflict to be resolved, "If you don't want the government to return to power, you have to fight us in the election."&lt;ref name="Vote"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote against me if you want me out: caretaker PM|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Vote-against-me-if-you-want-me-out-caretaker-PM-30223548.html|access-date=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clash between supporters from both political factions also occurred on 5 January in Thailand's northern city of Chiang Mai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red shirts harass PDRC protesters in Chiang Mai|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/red-shirts-harass-pdrc-protesters-chiang-mai/|access-date=6 January 2014|work=Thai PBS|date=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2014, Yingluck's secretary general, Suranand Vejjajiva, informed the media that the government might implement an emergency decree in the event of violence during protest actions. To date, the military had maintained its neutrality and the secretary general explained that the government continued to respect this stance. In a second press conference, Caretaker Information and Communications Technology Minister, Anudith Nakornthap, spoke specifically of the possibility of violence, "The government is concerned for the safety of the people. If the demonstration is peaceful and lawful, it can go ahead. But several earlier rallies saw a number of groups violate the law—including the rights of others—by stirring up violence. The government would therefore like to implore those intent on using violence to think again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decree still an option: govt|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Decree-still-an-option-govt-30223563.html|access-date=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on 6 January, Yingluck confirmed that an emergency decree was a last resort. She remained at her family home to monitor the political situation while police officers guarded her residence. Yingluck also explained that the Internal Security Act (ISA) will be used by the caretaker government to handle the mass protest.&lt;ref name="Vote" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM: Emergency decree last resort|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/388145/yingluck-visits-security-police-guarding-suvarnabhumi-airport|access-date=7 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, [[Credit Suisse]] analysts, in a document titled "Thailand Market Strategy", stated: "Our worst-case scenario envisions a multi-year continuation of the events of the past eight years—frequent changes of government, raucous street protests and ever-present tensions—but no serious escalation of violence." In relation to the Thai financial situation, analysts Dan Fineman and Siriporn Sothikul further explained: "For the broader market, a rebound is unlikely until investors are comfortable that the situation will not deteriorate further. We do not believe that we are yet at that point.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand's Seemingly Intractable Political Woes|url=http://www.thefinancialist.com/thailands-seemingly-intractable-political-woes/|work=The Financialist|publisher=Credit Suisse|access-date=19 January 2014|author=Jens Erik Gould|author2=jongjet303|date=15 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202101344/http://www.thefinancialist.com/thailands-seemingly-intractable-political-woes/#|archive-date=2 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on the same day, a Red Shirt conference was held in [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]] to discuss the political crisis, including campaigns in response to a possible military coup. Over 5,000 coordinators and activists under the leadership of the United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) heard speeches by UDD chairwoman Thida Thawornseth, who spoke of preparations in the event that the military took power from the Yingluck government. Conference participants also discussed the response of the UDD to Operation Occupy Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redshirts Meet To Discuss Anti-Coup Campaign|url=http://www.khaosod.co.th/en/view_newsonline.php?newsid=TVRNNE9UQTRNekl4TWc9PQ==|work=Khaosod English|access-date=8 January 2014|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 January 2014, Yingluck expressed concern about the possibility of third-party involvement on 13 January, explaining that the CAPO will be monitoring the situation from the National Police Bureau office. Yingluck further explained, "violence is sometimes the work of a third party which is a concern...The answer to a resolution for the country does not rest with me.

Students from three universities demonstrated against the anti-government movement. Students of [[Kasetsart University]], [[Silpakorn University]], and [[Srinakharinwirot University]] lit "candles for peace" at their Bangkok campuses as part of their political action. At Kasetsart University, 1,000 citizens and students were cited:

At 02:30 on 13 January 2014, the Democrat Party headquarters was struck by bullets fired from a Toyota [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]. No injuries resulted. While the party had not yet joined the shutdown protest, it announced that it would join in boycotting the 2 February election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bullets sprayed at Democrat HQ|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/bangkok-shutdown/389293/gunshot-at-democrart-part-hq|accessdate=19 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 14 January 2014, another attack was made against the Democrat Party. The attackers attempted to bomb the home of Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva. The attack failed and an [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD) team discovered a US-manufactured [[M26 grenade|M26]] hand grenade pin. EOD team members inferred the hurling of a hand grenade onto the roof of the room where Abhisit's father normally stayed. The [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] assisted police investigators in their review through the provision of surveillance tapes.&lt;ref name="bomb_organised"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abhisit says bomb attack was well organized|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/abhisit-says-bomb-attack-well-organized/|accessdate=19 January 2014|work=Thai PBS|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three men and a woman with four grenades, a gun, and ammunition were arrested at a Sukhumvit Road checkpoint on the same evening.&lt;ref name="Pak"&gt;{{cite news|title=Clashes could intensify|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Clashes-could-intensify-30224597.html|accessdate=19 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=18 January 2014|author=Pakorn Puengnetr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political situation became more complicated, with the National Anti-Corruption Commission investigating allegations that Yingluck was criminally negligent in her handling of a surplus rice deal with China. The commission had already implicated Yingluck's former commerce minister and more than a dozen other officials. Were the commission to deliver a guilty verdict, Yingluck would be impeached and forced to stand down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grenade Explosion During Bangkok Protests Leaves Dozens Injured|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/bankok-protest-explosion_n_4616600.html|accessdate=19 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014|author=THANYARAT DOKSONE|author2=TODD PITMAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January 2014, PDRC security guards reported that two or three explosions were heard at Chaeng Wattana Road, Lumphini Park, Lard Prao intersection, and Suan Pakkad Palace. It was also reported that shots were fired from a black Honda Accord sedan with no injuries. The explosion and gunshots forced activities on the stage of the PDRC to halt temporarily. A hand grenade was also thrown at the Bangkok governor's home but no injury was sustained.&lt;ref name="more_bombings"&gt;{{cite news|title=More bombings and gunfire rock anti-government protests|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/bombings-gunfire-rock-anti-government-protests/|accessdate=19 January 2014|work=Thai PBS|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, another grenade attack near the Lotus Charoenphol shopping mall injured thirty-eight protesters and killed one during a procession led by Suthep. PDRC security officers report that the grenade was launched from a partially demolished three-storey building. At 20:00 that evening, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's Erawan Emergency Medical Services Centre reported that thirty-eight casualties had been received.

That afternoon, another bombing attack occurred in which 28 people were injured at the Victory Monument anti-government protest rally site. According to Thaworn Senneam, a former Democrat MP at the rally who believed that he was the target of the bomb, an unidentified man threw an explosive device near a press centre tent behind the rally stage and fled at 13:30. Dr Suphan Srithamma, Director-General of the Health Department, revealed on the day after the incident that four people had been killed and 238 injured in the anti-government protests thus far.&lt;ref name="another_daylight_blast"&gt;{{cite news|title=Another daylight blast wounds 28 ralliers|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/390373/another-daylight-blast-wounds-28-ralliers|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January 2014, the armed forces remained in neutral. The army's Supreme Commander, General Thanasak Patimaprakorn, urged a peaceful outcome with the interests of the Thai nation of the utmost importance and that any further discussions should be undertaken with an independent mediator present. The general explained, "Both the government and the protesters may lose but the nation will gain.

Niran Pitakwatchara, commissioner of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), stated on 19 January that the Yingluck administration needed to exercise caution in its interactions with PDRC leaders, as arrests may inflame the situation. Niran explained that, as the government would be held responsible for the loss of lives and injuries during the protest actions, government representatives and agents needed to be [[wikt:circumspect|circumspect]] in all of their dealings with the protesters to reduce tension. The commissioner stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What must be urgently done is to reduce the stance of wanting to arrest PDRC leaders because if such a strong stance continues, the problem would reach a dead end. What's more, do not think of the protesters as the enemy of the government and speed up clarifications and dialogue in a bid to reduce violence.&lt;ref name="Two" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 20 January 2014, National Security Council chief Paradorn Pattantabutr informed the Reuters news agency: "We're prepared to use the emergency decree...Everyone involved including the police, the military and the government is considering this option very seriously but has not yet come to an agreement", further explaining, "if their [anti-government protesters] tactics change and they close banks or government offices permanently then the chance for unrest increases and we will have to invoke this law."&lt;ref name="Amy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai government considers state of emergency after weekend violence|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/20/us-thailand-protest-idUSBREA0J09Y20140120|access-date=20 January 2014|agency=Reuters|date=20 January 2014|author=Amy Sawitta Lefevre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, 3 February 2014, PDRC protesters allowed the re-opening of Lat Phrao and Democracy Monument areas to traffic after protesters dismantled their rally stages at the two locations and moved to strengthen their occupation in and around [[Lumphini Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lat Phrao and Victory Monument open|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/393019/lat-phrao-and-victory-monument-reopen-to-cars|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State of emergency===
[[File:2014-02-01 Silom protest site.jpg|thumb|Anti-government protesters gather at the intersection of [[Si Lom]] and Rama 4 Roads the day before the scheduled elections]]

On 21 January 2014, a 60-day state of emergency was declared, providing the government with the authority to invoke curfews, censor the media, disperse gatherings, use military force to "secure order", detain suspects without charge, ban political gatherings of more than five persons and declare parts of the country inaccessible.&lt;ref name="Amy" /&gt; According to Foreign Minister Surapong Tovichakchaikul, protesters had triggered the decision by blocking government offices and banks, and obstructing government officials from being able to conduct their business and lead their lives in a secure fashion.&lt;ref name="Fuller"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai Leaders Declare State of Emergency in Bangkok|url=http://nytimes.com/2014/01/22/world/asia/thailand.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0&amp;referrer=|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=21 January 2014|author=Thomas Fuller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2014, Kwanchai Praipana, a leading figure of a pro-government faction, was shot in [[Udon Thani Province]]. Police concluded that the attack was politically motivated and used [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit television (CCTV)]] footage as part of the investigation and reported the involvement of a "bronze pickup truck". Prior to the incident in Udon Thani, three grenade attacks killed one person and resulted in several injuries, but led to no arrests. Following news of the shooting, Suthep remained adamant regarding Operation Occupy Bangkok, stating "We will keep fighting until we win". He threatened to shut down Thailand's air traffic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Leader of Pro-Government Faction Is Shot in Thailand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/world/asia/thailand.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 January 2014|author=Thomas Fuller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, the ''New York Times'' published an article containing interviews with a number of former and current EC members. EC member Somchai Srisutthiyakorn expressed a belief that the elections needed to be held at a suitable date to ensure that the "election benefits society". Somachai said, "I am afraid that if the election goes ahead, there will be violence and it may lead to a coup”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speaking Out Against Vote's Date, a Thai Citizen (and Election Panel Member)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/world/asia/thailand-election.html?_r=1|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 January 2014|author=Thomas Fuller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government had started impeachment proceedings against Somchai during the week of 13 January. The commissioner was accused of "dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise any of his duties". According to the news article the charges were primarily symbolic, as the duration of the trial would be protracted, lasting many months, with the verdict to be announced well after the elections.

On 24 January 2014, the Thai Constitutional Court declared that the postponement of 2 February election date was the prerogative of its members. At the time of the decision, the original amnesty bill proposal that triggered the first round of protests in late-2013 was no longer up for consideration. A nationwide [[Bangkok University]] poll of 1,018 voters revealed that four out of five Thais would cast a ballot on 2 February and more than two million voters had registered for the advance polls, according to an EC statement released on 24 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand Thai Elections Could be Postponed, in Fresh Blow for Yingluck|url=http://world.time.com/2014/01/24/thai-elections-could-be-postponed-in-fresh-blow-for-yingluck/|accessdate=26 January 2014|work=Time|date=24 January 2014|author=Charlie Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2014, caretaker Labour Minister Chalerm Yoobamrung, (also the CMPO director), publicly announced the impending arrest of Suthep on the charge of leading an insurrection. Chalerm warned that if any loss of life occurred during the arrest, the police should not be blamed. A joint meeting involving the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) and the CMPO held on the same day announced that arrest warrants for 58 protest leaders had been processed. Under the conditions of the emergency decree, those who were arrested could be detained for 30 days before further legal action. DSI Director-General Tarit Pengdith informed the media that negotiations would commence between the CMPO and PDRC leaders to regain government control over occupied state agency offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suthep will be arrested soon, should surrender to avoid violence: Chalerm|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Suthep-will-be-arrested-soon-should-surrender-to-a-30225179.html|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, Suthin Taratin, a Thai protest leader, was speaking on top of a truck as part of a rally at a polling station where advanced voting was to take place.

On 27 January 2014, the caretaker Labour Minister (who was also the Director of the CMPO), Chalerm Yoobamrung, announced that protesters hindering access to government buildings would be arrested if they did not leave their positions within 72 hours. Chalerm stated that he will take full responsibility for the process and clarified that only those protesters at government buildings would be affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chalerm tells protesters to leave govt offices in 72 hours or face arrests|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Chalerm-tells-protesters-to-leave-govt-offices-in--30225289.html|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, Yingluck met with the EC to discuss the possibility of postponing the election due to the latter's fear of election day violence. Following a three-hour meeting at the Army Club, caretaker Deputy Prime Minister Pongthep Thepkanchana informed the media that the polling date remained unchanged. Election commissioner Somchai Srisuthiyakorn stated that the EC would organise the 2 February vote to the best of its ability, including the enactment of measures to prevent violence and the staging of a second round of elections to accommodate voters hindered during the inaugural voting stage. Labor Minister Chalerm Yubamrung, recently appointed as the head of the government's crisis response agency, explained that 10,000 police officers would be mobilised to ensure the safety of voters during the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10,000 police officers mobilized for Sunday election|url=http://bangkok.coconuts.co/2014/01/29/10000-police-officers-mobilized-sunday-election|work=Coconuts Bangkok|accessdate=29 January 2014|date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting at the Army Club, violence broke out when a PDRC protester was shot in the abdomen. After the shooting, protesters attacked the suspected gunman who turned out to be a police officer. Police claimed that the undercover policeman only fired in self-defence after being attacked by PDRC protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Man-shot-outside-the-Army-Club;-gunman-caught-30225471.html|title=Protester shot outside Army Club; policeman caught|date=29 January 2014|work=The Nation|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2014, further protests were held as part of the anti-election campaign. Protest leader Suthep led protesters through a section of the capital's commercial area, encouraging others to join election day actions to prevent voting. The police announced that a further 190,000 officers would be deployed throughout the nation, with an emphasis on Bangkok and Thailand's ten southern provinces.&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai Protesters Warming Up to Disrupt Poll|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303743604579351943256606068?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303743604579351943256606068.html|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=30 January 2014|author=Warangkana Chomchuen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 31 January, Chalerm was managing affairs at the civil court in Bangkok in response to the PDRC's bid for a court ruling to revoke the emergency decree. A petition was submitted to the court by PDRC core leader Thaworn Senneam and a decision was expected in the afternoon. Chalerm stated that the caretaker government's handling of the election situation would remain the same despite the PDRC submission. However, a new CMPO director would need to be appointed if the civil court sided with the PDRC petition. Chalerm stated, "I plead the premier to allow me to continue the job as I’m ready to work." Chalerm threatened to arrest Suthep following the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army, police on full alert for Sunday's election|url=http://news.asiainterlaw.com/?p=10310|work=Asia Inter Law|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=31 January 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140201062344/http://news.asiainterlaw.com/?p=10310|archive-date=1 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thaksin's hometown of [[San Kamphaeng District|San Kamphaeng]], a reporter for the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' spoke with pro-government supporters who stated that they were "willing to sacrifice" their lives in support of the ruling Puea Thai Party. Supporters said that they were prepared for Yingluck to relocate the capital to Chiang Mai, with Supon Fumuljaroen, vice-chairman of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) in [[Chiang Mai Province]], stating, "The majority of red-shirts really like the idea of a separate state. If they stage a coup, we can live without Bangkok." Pichit Tamoon, Chiang Mai general secretary for the UDD, said: "We have police forces on our side and together with the northeast we have the backing of 37 [out of 77] provinces. Yingluck will win." Tamoon also responded to claims that the UDD was stockpiling weapons: "We have no arms but we have the police force on our side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red-shirts 'ready to resist' Thai army coup, set up capital in Chiang Mai|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1416916/red-shirts-ready-resist-thai-army-coup-set-capital-chiang-mai|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=31 January 2014|author=Tom Fawthrop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suthep explained on the evening of 31 January that a confrontation and violence was not his intention. Suthep declared that polling places would be able to function normally. However, sources also stated that Suthep believed that the election date will be nullified because of various legal problems that would emerge afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suthep says protesters will not blockade polling units on February 2|url=http://news.asiainterlaw.com/?p=10306|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=Asian Inter Law News|date=31 January 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140201062235/http://news.asiainterlaw.com/?p=10306|archive-date=1 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 2014 election===
{{main|Thai general election, 2014}}
Despite an announcement by the PDRC that they would not hinder the election process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PDRC 'will not block' early voting|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/bangkok-shutdown/391371/pdrc-will-not-block-early-voting|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; advance voting did not take place in 87 constituencies, mostly in Bangkok and the south of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poll demo no setback, EC says|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/391613/poll-demo-no-setback-ec-says|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disruptions occurred in 10 of Thailand's 76 provinces. Protesters attempted to disrupt advance voting for the scheduled elections, with most gathering in Bangkok. According to EC Secretary-General Puchong Nutrawong, advance voting in the north and northeast had been accomplished with the exception of [[Surin Province]]. Of a total of 2.16 million people registered for advance voting nationwide, 916,210 of them in Bangkok, around 440,000 people were prevented from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EC cancels many polling units|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/391549/ec-cancels-many-polling-units|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="violence_blights_advance_voting" &gt;{{cite news|title=Violence blights advance Thai voting| url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/01/27/violence-blights-advance-thai-voting|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=SBS News|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Curb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai protest leader killed during rallies to curb early elections|url=http://rt.com/news/thailand-opposition-leader-killed-210/|accessdate=26 January 2014|work=RT|date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunai Phasuk, a [[Human Rights Watch]] senior researcher said,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Violence breaks out as Thailand protesters attempt to block polling stations ahead of general election|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/01/26/thailand-protesters-attempt-to-block-polling-stations-ahead-general-election/|accessdate=27 January 2014|work=Fox News Channel|date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a sad day for democracy when the right to vote[...]is assaulted by a political movement that claims to be striving for reform and people's empowerment. Everything that happened today shows they are striving for the opposite.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In total, 48.7 million Thai citizens were eligible to vote for 500 seats in the lower house of parliament that represented 375 constituencies. In the polling booths, voters chose both one candidate and a single political party, while in the 22 constituencies that consisted of only a single candidate, more than 20 percent of the eligible votes must be received to achieve success.&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt;

The smooth completion of 2 February election did not resolve Thailand's problematic political situation, as issues of remained: first, due to protester blockades, 28 constituencies across eight provinces—Chumphon, Surat Thani, Songkhla, Phuket, Phatthalung, Trang, Krabi, and Nakhon Si Thammarat—failed to register candidates.&lt;ref name="Poll" /&gt; Second, the constitution required at least 475 filled seats, or 95 percent of the total number of seats, and disruptions caused by protesters meant that this target could not be reached. The EC, which believed that the final result would  fall three seats short, explained that it would be necessary to hold by-elections over several months in problematic constituencies until all 500 members of the parliament's lower house were selected. In the 2011 elections, a 75 percent voter turnout rate was registered.&lt;ref name="Wall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Feb 2 election facts and figures|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/392338/thailand-election-in-figures|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawful distribution of ballots has been hindered by anti-government protesters. Although Lieutenant General Amnart confirmed that police would ensure the safety of those responsible for delivering the ballots, as of 1 January ballot papers stuck at post offices in Chumphon, Nakhon Si Thammarat's Thung Song District, and Songkhla's Hat Yai District were unable to reach southern polling stations.&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite news|title=Army boosts support for CMPO, cites intensification of violence|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/392276/army-boosts-support-for-cmpo-cites-intensification-of-violence|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EC concerns mount over ballot-paper blockades|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/392606/ec-concerns-mount-over-ballot-paper-blockades|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, the Thai army announced is support of the CMPO operation to protect the election. Deputy army spokesman Winthai Suvari provided details of the deployment of military personnel in areas of particular concern and a joint operation with the CMPO to ensure the safety of state officials and others. The army's other key responsibilities involved providing medical aid in areas close to protest sites, as well as traffic co-ordination duties. Assistant national police chief Amnart Unartngarm stated that its 200,000 police officers, plus 1,450 rapid-deployment units, would guard 93,535 polling stations in 76 provinces plus Bangkok.&lt;ref name="Army" /&gt;

On 31 January 2014, the EC realised that 44,000 more election officials would be needed on polling day, including 4,000 people to oversee voting booths in the Thai capital. An EC commissioner explained to the media that a total of 93,305 polling stations were being set up nationwide, but staff shortages were worst in the southern provinces, where 90 percent of polling stations were insufficiently staffed. In addition to the staffing problems, ballots for 14 southern provinces remained undelivered at central post offices in the provinces of Chumphon, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Songkhla. The EC stated that the election should proceed legitimately in more than 66 provinces, with a second opportunity offered on 2 March for those constituencies that were unable to vote. An army spokesman stated that soldiers would protect all polling stations, but explained that force would not be employed to end conflict between voters and anti-government protesters.&lt;ref name="Poll"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shortage of 44,000 election officials threatens to derail polls|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/392543/shortage-of-44000-election-officials-threatens-to-derail-polls|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 31 January, the EC consulted with a legal team to discuss the issue of the 28 constituencies in the southern provinces where candidate registration did not occur in late-December due to protests. The consultation was in anticipation of the possibility that opponents of the election might file lawsuits to invalidate the election based on the constitutional condition that voting must occur nationwide on a single day. EC chairman Supachai Somcharoen stated that the EC and its legal advisers would carefully examine the constitution to handle the matter, but also explained, "There are several factors that could invalidate the poll. But the EC has no authority to decide. It is the Constitution Court that has the authority to rule on the matter if petitions are lodged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EC faces legal hurdles over poll|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/392595/ec-faces-legal-hurdles-over-poll|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the election date, violence erupted again in Bangkok after PDRC demonstrators blocked the delivery of ballot boxes from the Lak Si District office in northern Bangkok.

As a consequence of the violence, the EC suspended Sunday voting in the [[Lak Si District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EC suspends voting in Lak Si district following clash|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/EC-suspends-voting-in-Lak-Si-district-following-cl-30225797.html|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=1 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203142614/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/EC-suspends-voting-in-Lak-Si-district-following-cl-30225797.html|archive-date=3 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting was also cancelled in the provinces of Krabi, Chumphon, Trang, Phangnga, Phatthalung, Phuket, Ranong, Songkhla, and Surat Thani due to a shortage of ballots.&lt;ref name="indo"&gt;{{cite news|title=46.79 percent turnout in Thailand election|url=https://news.yahoo.com/46-79-percent-turnout-thailand-election-115606989.html|accessdate=6 February 2014|work=Yahoo!

According to the EC, the final turnout for 2 February elections—counted from 68 provinces and excluding the nine provinces where voting was cancelled—was 47.72 percent, or 20,530,359 voters (voting was closed prior to the 15:00 cut-off time in some areas of these provinces). The highest participation rate was in Chiang Mai, where 827,808 voters, or 75.05 percent, participated from a total 1,103,069 eligible voters. Of the total ballots cast in Chiang Mai, 530,427, or 64.08 percent, were valid; 129,983, or 15.7 percent, were invalid; and 167,398, or 20.22 per cent, were no-vote ballots. For Bangkok metropolis, a total of 1,133,296 voters, or 25.94 percent, from a total of 4,369,120 eligible voters, cast their votes: 775,821, or 68.46 percent, were valid; 90,923, or 8.02 percent, were invalid; and 266,552, or 23.52 per cent, were no-vote ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EC now says official voter turnout is 47.72%|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/ec-now-says-official-voter-turnout-47-72/|accessdate=7 February 2014|work=Thai PBS|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EC announced that as many as 20.1 million out of 43.024 million eligible voters voted in 68 provinces where voting was not disrupted by protests, with 71.38 percent of those ballots valid, 12.05 percent invalid and 16.57 percent "no-vote". The EC vowed to discuss the 28 constituencies where candidates were prevented from registering prior to the polls and stated that it would consult with legal experts before arriving at a decision.&lt;ref name=indo /&gt;

=== Arrest warrants for protest leaders ===
Warrants for arrest were approved by the Thai Criminal Court on 5 February 2014 for protest leaders, who insisted that the decision would not affect their campaign even though the Court found sufficient evidence that the leaders had violated the emergency decree imposed in Bangkok, Nonthaburi, and parts of Pathum Thani and Samut Prakan Provinces. According to the warrants, the police could arrest the 19 persons and detain them at Region 1 Border Patrol Police Headquarters at Khlong 5 in Pathum Thani's Thanyaburi District for no more than seven days. The warrants were valid for one year. The court was to be notified of any arrest within 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Trans"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arrest warrants for PDRC leaders, CMPO to suspend transactions|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/393365/arrest-warrants-for-pdrc-leaders-cmpo-to-suspend-transactions|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DSI director-general Tarit Pengdith said that the CMPO had sent a team to negotiate with PDRC leaders for the opening of the Interior Ministry. The CMPO would then arrest the PDRC leaders if co-operation was not achieved by 15:00 on 5 February. As of 6 February, the PDRC leaders remained free.&lt;ref name="Trans" /&gt; On 6 February, Suthep attempted to postpone his indictment on charges of premeditated and attempted murder for ordering, alongside former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation (CRES) to take action against UDD members in 2010, resulting in more than 90 deaths. The PDRC protest leader had been ordered to report to the prosecution office by 13 February 2014.&lt;ref name="Trans" /&gt; CMPO head Chalerm informed the media on 6 February that he planned to disguise himself with a moustache, sun glasses, and a hat to arrest Suthep.  Chalerm explained that Suthep's hideout was at the Dusit Thani Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chalerm says he will disguise himself to arrest Suthep|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/chalerm-says-will-disguise-arrest-suthep/|accessdate=7 February 2014|work=Thai PBS|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 February, Chalerm warned protesters who were at the Interior Ministry that if they did not leave within four days, 1,000 police officers and defence volunteers would redress the situation. The leading protester at the ministry, Khomsan Thongsri, responded with a commitment to allow workers to carry out their business while the demonstrators remained present at the site. Furthermore, as part of a case that was filed by PDRC co-leader Thaworn Senneam regarding the validity of the emergency decree, the Civil Court provided a 10 February 2014 deadline for the submission of statements by Yingluck, Chalerm, and police chief Adul Saengsingkaew. A ruling was expected on 12 February 2014.&lt;ref name="Rice" /&gt; Additionally, National Security Council (NSC) Secretary Lieutenant General Paradon Patanatabutr informed the media that 12 teams were formed to enforce the arrest warrants for the 19 PDRC core leaders. He expressed confidence regarding the successful finalisation of the arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CMPO assembles 12 teams to apprehend PDRC core leaders|url=http://thainews.prd.go.th/centerweb/newsen/NewsDetail?NT01_NewsID=WNPOL5702070010001|accessdate=8 February 2014|work=National News Bureau of Thailand|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thai Criminal Court rejected the DSI's submission to obtain warrants for the arrest of 13 PDRC leaders—Somkiat Pongpaiboon, Somsak Kosaisuk, Jitrapat Kridakorn, Sakonthi Pattiyakul, Sombat Thamrongthanyawong, Seri Wongmontha, Thanom Onketphol, Luang Pu Buddha Issara or Suvit Thongprasert, Sawit Kaewwan, Komsan Thongsiri, Suchart Srisang, Dr Rawi Matchamadol and Nopporn Muangthaen—on 24 February 2014. A PDRC lawyer explained that the court dismissed the DSI's request because the facts surrounding the PDRC protests had changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Warrants for 13 PDRC leaders rejected|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/396708/court-rules-emergency-decree-not-grounds-for-arrest|accessdate=24 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compensatory voting ===
On 7 February 2014, a six-hour EC meeting was convened and EC member Somchai explained afterwards that if elections were to be held in the 28 constituencies in which candidates were not able to register for polls, a written royal decree from the government would be necessary. The meeting unanimously decided to seek such a decree. The EC believed that it could hold new elections in the five provinces of Rayong, Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat and Petchaburi without difficulty. However, Somchai stated: "We are not quite sure if new elections could be successfully held in Prachuap Khiri Khan and Satun which have 222 and 300 polling stations, respectively", but added that the EC would reassess the situation again on 11 February 2014. EC Secretary-General Puchong Nutrawong said the EC had scheduled candidacy registration for 4–8 March, 23 March for the advance election, and 30 March for the Senate election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Election Commission proposes royal decree to declare new polls in 8 provinces|url=http://www.mcot.net/site/content?id=52f5a921be047050ac8b462f#.UvXvPkKSzwN|accessdate=8 February 2014|work=MCOT|date=8 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918054826/http://www.mcot.net/site/content?id=52f5a921be047050ac8b462f#.UvXvPkKSzwN|archive-date=18 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New election dates were announced by the EC on 12 February 2014 to create voting opportunities for those citizens who were unable to vote during the February elections. Advance voting was to be held on 20 April, while 27 April was the date for constituencies where elections could not take place on 2 February. Somchai, appointed the Election Commissioner, stated that the 27 April date applied to 28 constituencies in the south, and several in Bangkok. The PDRC disapproved of the new election dates.&lt;ref name="April"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand to hold more voting in April|url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/Thailand-to-hold-more-voting-in-April-57017.html|accessdate=12 February 2014|newspaper=Asia News Network|date=12 February 2014|author=Nirmal Ghosh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Wall Street Journal'' on 13 February 2014, the number of protesters dwindled since December 2013, from 150,000 to around 5,000 people. In his briefing with the media, Chalerm proposed that, following the next round of elections, the government should carry out changes within 18 months to allow for a new election process. Chalerm's statements followed a post by Yingluck on her Facebook page that indicated an openness to the involvement of a third-party broker to help resolve the political conflict.&lt;ref name="Wall" /&gt;

=== Democrat Party's unsuccessful request for election invalidation ===
On 4 February 2014, the Democrat Party forwarded a request to the Constitutional Court for the invalidation of the election, as well as the dissolution of the Puea Thai Party and the [[disfranchisement]] of its executives. As part of their request, the Democrats identified the election as an attempt by the government to acquire administrative power by unconstitutional means, in accordance with section 68 of the constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:ปชป. ยื่นศาล รธน. ร้องวินิจฉัยเลือกตั้งโมฆะแล้ว |trans-title=Dems have requested charter court to invalidate election | language = Thai | publisher = Manager | date = 4 February 2014 | accessdate = 4 February 2014 | url = http://www.manager.co.th/Politics/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9570000013761}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Thai opposition to challenge poll in court as protest numbers dwindle | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-04/an-us-warns-against-thailand-coup/5237308 | publisher = Australia News Network | date = 4 February 2014 | accessdate = 4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same section the Democrats had successfully invoked to request the [[#Constitutional amendment|invalidation of the constitutional amendment]] in November 2013. Section 68 prohibits an attempt to undermine the "democratic regime of government with the King as Head of State", or to acquire administrative power by constitutional means, and empowers the Constitutional Court to stop such an attempt, to dissolve any political party guilty of it and to disfranchise the executives of the dissolved party for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand 2007 |author=Council of State of Thailand |publisher=Asian Legal Information Institute |year=2007 |accessdate=4 February 2014 |url=http://www.asianlii.org/th/legis/const/2007/1.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515162053/http://www.asianlii.org/th/legis/const/2007/1.html |archivedate=15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Puea Thai Party filed a counter-request in response to the Democrat Party on 5 February, seeking the dissolution and disfranchisement of the latter's executives on the grounds of section 68.

In an interview with the Bloomberg media company on 7 February 2014, Abhisit stated that he did not vote, explaining: "We are not saying no to elections, we are saying free and fair elections, and we have to build the circumstances to make sure that happens." The former prime minister further explained that he does not support all of the positions that the PDRC takes, but he does "understand the anger and frustration of people over corruption that is taking place, and the anger at intimidation of political opponents which has been going on for I don't know how many years now."&lt;ref name="Has"&gt;{{cite news|title='It's time for reform.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
They had that mandate, they ran the country for two years and then they betrayed the mandate, betrayed the trust of the people by trying to push through the amnesty bill, which they said they campaigned on during the election, but did not. And that led to mass protests. They dissolved the House and announced a caretaker government. The caretakers cannot pursue policy, so if the people are demanding somebody they can trust to oversee the election after some initial reforms take place, why can't the government make some sacrifices to ensure the country moves forward?&lt;ref name="Has" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Retaking of public space ===
Operation Valentine was enacted on 14 February 2014, a traditional Buddhist holiday in Thailand,{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} as police attempted to reclaim public space from the Students and People Network for Thailand's Reform protest group. Police first assembled at the Royal Plaza before moving onto the Misakawan Intersection to begin the operation. Tents were removed from Rachadamnoen Road on the Makkhawan Bridge, but the protesters had already relocated by the time the police arrived, so no violence occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police launch 'Operation Valentine' to clear Rajdamnoen rally site|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Police-launch-Operation-Valentine-to-clear-Rajdamn-30226841.html|accessdate=14 February 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot police also cleared a protest site that had been established at a major intersection near Government House and faced no resistance from protesters. Chalerm Yubamrung, chief of the government's special security operations, explained to the media that the operation is an indication of the caretaker government's response to the protest movement. Chalerm explained: "We urge the protesters to go home. If they don't listen, we will have to take further action. We can't let this happen. Our country can't function like this." Police refrained from taking action after a group of demonstrators returned to an intact protest site near Government House. About 1,000 protesters then gathered outside Bangkok police headquarters following the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai Riot Police Clear Protest Sites in Bangkok|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304703804579381760600852996|accessdate=14 February 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=14 February 2014|author=Warangkana Chomchueng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 14 February, Suthep said in a speech that he refused to engage in a discussion with Yingluck, regardless of the presence of a neutral third party, citing previous experience that undermined his confidence in the caretaker prime minister's ability to think for herself. "I am not that crazy to talk with a puppet with someone [Thaksin] pulling the strings from behind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suthep spurns talks with government|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/suthep-spurns-talks-government/|accessdate=15 February 2014|work=Thai PBS|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 18 February, nine police companies succeeded in retaking the Energy Ministry site and arrested more than 140 protesters after the protest group refused to leave the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stout|first=David|title=At Least Five Killed As Thai Police Swoop on Bangkok Protesters|url=http://world.time.com/2014/02/18/thai-police-officer-protester-killed-in-bangkok-skirmishes//|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Time|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police confront protesters at Govt House|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/395662/police-clear-protesters-from-ptt-head-office-at-energy-ministry|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the police continued to reclaim five protest sites, the situation deteriorated into violence at the Phan Fah Bridge protest site on Ratchadamnoen Klang Avenue.

The situation worsened when a growing numbers of protesters obstructed the officers. Police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. As the police moved forward, they were attacked by bombs and gunshots. Police responded with live ammunition, then retreated.&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Six"/&gt; A BBC video clip clearly showed a grenade was thrown at police lines from the group of protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blast clips spark accusations, confusion|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/396382/blast-clips-spark-accusations-confusion.|accessdate=27 March 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 19 February 2014, five deaths were registered—one police officer and four civilians—and at least 64 people were injured from the Phan Fah Bridge conflict.&lt;ref name="Five" /&gt; A BBC report, published on 18 February, stated that the government announced its intent to reclaim all occupied sites by the end of 23 February 2014.&lt;ref name="Head"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand police and protesters clash fatally in Bangkok|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26224510|accessdate=18 February 2014|work=BBC News|date=18 February 2014|author=Jonathan Head}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southeast Asian Regional Office for the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) denounced the protest violence in an official press statement that was released on 21 February 2014:

&lt;blockquote&gt;OHCHR calls on anti and pro-government sides to disassociate themselves from armed groups, and refrain from any form of violence. OHCHR calls on leaders of both sides and security forces to ensure the safety of those genuinely engaging in peaceful demonstrations, and to make sure that all sides strictly comply with the law. OHCHR further calls upon the authorities to carry out a prompt, full and impartial investigation to establish the facts and to ensure accountability for this and other similar violence incidents that have occurred over the past months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Human Rights Office Highly Concerned by Violence at Protest Sites| url=http://bangkok.ohchr.org/files/ROB%20Press%20statement%20210214.pdf|work=OHCHR Press Statement|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=22 February 2014|format=PDF|date=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further violence, deaths, and injuries occurred on the 22 and 23 February 2014 at two separate PDRC protest sites in Bangkok and the town of [[Trat]], about 300&amp;nbsp;km (186&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of the Thai capital. In Bangkok, a rally on 23 February occurred outside a large shopping mall on [[Ratchadamri Road]] and it was reported that the explosion of a [[40mm grenade]] caused the death of three people, two children and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/23/world/asia/thailand-protests/ |title=Thailand protests targeted; 4 dead, dozens wounded |work=CNN |accessdate=25 March 2014 |date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A male tuk-tuk driver was arrested following the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2 killed, 22 injured at Ratchaprasong|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/396589/2-killed-22-injured-at-ratchaprasong|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Closure of rally sites ===
On the evening of 28 February, Suthep announced the closure of the rally sites at Prathum Wan, Ratchaprasong, Silom, and Asoke on 2 March 2014, and apologised to those people inconvenienced by the Bangkok occupation. The PDRC relocated to Lumphini Park, marking the end of the "Bangkok Shutdown", where the PDRC rally stage was established. Chaeng Watthana is the only other remaining rally stage, overseen by a senior monk who said: "I will not dismantle or move it [the stage] anywhere" following Suthep's announcement. According to Suthep, from 3 March onwards, boycotts and disruption of the Shinawatra family's business interests will be the primary focus of the anti-government protest movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangkok Shutdown shut down|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/397560/bangkok-shutdown-shut-down|accessdate=4 March 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new leader of the pro-government Red Shirt movement was appointed on 15 March 2014 to replace Tida Tawornseth, at a rally of 10,000 supporters in [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province|Ayutthaya]], north of Bangkok. Former MP Jatuporn Prompan, who remained involved with legal proceedings that date back to the 2010 political crisis, assumed the leadership position and spoke with the [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] news agency on the following day. The new leader declared that a "big fight" is required in the future, but any Red Shirt action will be "peaceful". Jatuporn referenced the failed anti-government actions in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and stated that the Suthep-led movement "cannot achieve success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFP: New Thai Red Shirt leader warns of battle ahead|url=http://bangkok.coconuts.co/2014/03/17/afp-new-thai-red-shirt-leader-warns-battle-ahead|work=Coconuts Bangkok|accessdate=17 March 2014|date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 2014, the president of the Thai Farmers body informed the media that farmers from numerous provinces will convene at the Ministry of Commerce to implore the government to stand down. President Ravi Roongreung explained that the government's inefficient handling of farming issues was the primary reason for the protest action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farmers gather and prepare to oust government| url=http://thaifinancialpost.com/2014/03/20/farmers-gather-and-prepare-to-oust-government/|accessdate=22 March 2014|newspaper=Thai Financial Post|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ombudsman]] also sought to have the general election of 2 February 2014 invalidated following advice from [[Thammasat University]] journalism law lecturer Kittipong Kamolthammawong. The ombudsman's authority concerns constitutionality of law, rather than election-related matters. In light of the limitation of his authority, the ombudsman then filed a request on 6 March 2014 for the Constitutional Court to decide if the royal decree, whereby the House of Representatives was dissolved, was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:ผู้ตรวจการแผ่นดินชงคำร้อง "กิตติพงศ์" อาจารย์นิติ มธ. ให้ศาล รธน. วินิจฉัยเลือกตั้ง 2 ก.พ. โมฆะ |trans-title=Ombudsmen forwarded TU law lecturer Kittipong's a request for 2 Feb election invalidation to charter court | work= Bangkok Biz News | date = 6 March 2014 | accessdate = 23 March 2014 | language = Thai | url = http://www.bangkokbiznews.com/home/detail/politics/politics/20140306/567146/ผู้ตรวจฯชงคำร้องอาจารย์มธ.ให้ศาลรธน.ชี้โมฆะ.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "uncon"&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:สับคำวินิจฉัย ตลก.

On 21 March 2014, the Constitutional Court, by six votes to three, ruled that the royal decree was contrary to the constitution—insofar as it affected the election—when the general election, scheduled for 2 February 2014, could not be completed on that day throughout Thailand. The constitution stipulates that only a royal decree can dissolve the House of Representatives and it must also order a general election to be held on the same day nationwide, within 45 days of the dissolution. According to the court, at the point that the royal decree was deemed unconstitutional, the election also became unconstitutional as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:มติศาล รธน. 6 ต่อ 3 ชี้การเลือกตั้ง 2 ก.พ. เป็นโมฆะ |trans-title=Charter court, by six votes to three, invalidated 2 Feb election | url = http://www.manager.co.th/Politics/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9570000032081 | work = Manager | date = 21 March 2014 | accessdate = 21 March 2014 | language = Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Court voids Feb 2 general election | url = http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/401024/court-voids-feb-2-general-election | work = Bangkok Post | date = 21 March 2014 | accessdate = 21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "limbo"&gt;{{cite news | title = Thailand in limbo after election annulled; economy suffering | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/21/uk-thailand-protest-idUKBREA2K05420140321 | agency = Reuters | author = Amy Sawitta Lefevre | date = 21 March 2014 | accessdate = 21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitutional Court decision received heavy criticism from academic sectors and the Pheu Thai Party.

=== Continued protests and violence ===
Cases of intimidation, violence and criminal activities, committed by PDRC guards and supporters, continued. Police arrested in Surat Thani, Suthep's hometown, a man who confessed to being paid by the PDRC to shoot at pro-government Red Shirt protesters the day before the election at Lak Si, leading to seven people injured and one man paralysed.

Pro-government demonstrators from the People's Radio for Democracy Group (PRDG), a faction of the UDD, rallied at the National Anti-Corruption Commission office on 24 March 2014. Four members of the PRDG proceeded to assault a Buddhist monk named Phra Prat, who received minor injuries. According to Phra Prat, he saw protesters assaulting another man, so he complained to the protesters. One of the PRDG attackers claimed that Phra Prat was not a real monk and was going to attack her with his cane. She also blamed the monk for scolding them in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/401695/monk-beating-red-shirts-surrender |title=Monk-beating red shirts surrender|work=Bangkok Post |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2014, a group of anti-government protesters from the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) were led by Suthep on a march around Bangkok streets, from Lumpini Park to the Royal Plaza and parliament. The march eventually returned to Lumpini Park to affirm its stance that reforms must be carried out before a general election is undertaken.&lt;ref name=suthep29march2014/&gt; While 53 political parties called for a fresh election to be held within 45–60 days, the Democrat Party echoed Suthep's position: the ruling Pheu Thai Party would use the power it won in a fresh election to pass illegitimate laws. The party did not elaborate on its planned involvement in the next election.&lt;ref name=suthep29march2014&gt;{{cite news|title=Suthep: Parliament won't open until reform starts|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/402406/pdrc-leaves-no-doubt-about-stand|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=53 parties want quick vote as Yingluck vows to stay on|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/402261/quick-decision-sought-on-poll|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the PDRC rally at Lumpini Park on 5 April 2014, Suthep outlined his strategies in the campaign to remove Yingluck from her role as caretaker. He called on all PDRC local networks to gather lists of their members throughout Thailand and "wait for the day of battle", further explaining that he would lead "a prolonged fight" that will last "for at least 15 days". The outcome of two events were presented as critical to the course of Suthep's future actions: the NACC's ruling on Yingluck and the verdict by the Constitutional Court on whether Yinluck violated the 2007 Constitution. In the event of a guilty finding by the NACC, Suthep asked his supporters to await further instructions. However, if the Constitutional Court ruled against Yinluck, Suthep called for an immediate mass mobilisation so that he could assume the role of "sovereign body" to enact a new charter, akin to the military dictators of the 1960s. Suthep stated as a reassurance: "[I] will be able to order anyone to be executed by firing squad, but I will only freeze assets". If he assumed a ruling position, Suthep stated that he planned to appoint a prime minister and cabinet members at his discretion, followed by a request for approval from Thailand's king, so that he might appoint a National Legislative Assembly and "People's Council"—two unelected legislative bodies—to engage in national "reforms". Suthep expressed a commitment to return power to the Thai people following the implementation of the reforms, but spoke of further street-based protests if his appointed government failed to implement the reforms dictated by the PDRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suthep To Seek Royal Approval For His 'People Coup'|url=http://en.khaosod.co.th/detail.php?newsid=1396776917&amp;section=11|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=Khaosod English|date=6 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211923/http://en.khaosod.co.th/detail.php?newsid=1396776917&amp;section=11|archive-date=8 April 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 2014 a soldier was removing a barrier placed near the anti-government protest site on Chaeng Watthana when protest guards opened fire at him. The attack ended after the guards viewed his military identification card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rally guards hurt top soldier|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/406693/rally-guards-hurt-top-soldier|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Request for removal of Yingluck from office ===
Over two years prior, on 30 September 2011, the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Thailand)|Office of the Prime Minister]] (OPM) transferred Thawin Pliansri from the office of Secretary General of the National Security Council (NSC) to the office of Prime Minister Advisor. Police General Wichian Photphosri, then Commissioner General of the [[Royal Thai Police]] (RTP), was appointed as the NSC Secretary General instead, and Police General Priewpan Damapong, elder brother of Thaksin's former wife [[Potjaman Shinawatra]], was appointed as the new RTP Commissioner General. Thawin  requested an administrative court to revoke the transfer. The Supreme Administrative Court delivered a final judgment on 7 March 2014 that the transfer was legal, but was unreasonable because it did not appear that Thawin had carried out his duties ineffectively or failed to abide by the policy of the government. The court ordered the OPM to transfer Thawin back to his former office within 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:ศาลปกครองสูงสุดสั่งคืนตำแหน่งเลขาธิการ สมช. แก่ถวิล เปลี่ยนศรี ใน 45 วัน |trans-title=Supreme Admin Court ordered Thawin to be appointed back to NSC Secretary General office within 45 days | url = http://www.manager.co.th/politics/viewnews.aspx?NewsID=9570000026403 | date = 7 March 2014 | accessdate = 6 May 2014 | language = Thai | work = Manager }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OPM announced the transfer on 28 April 2014, retroactive to 30 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| script-title=th:ประกาศสำนักนายกรัฐมนตรี เรื่อง การยกเลิกมติคณะรัฐมนตรีและเพิกถอนประกาศสำนักนายกรัฐมนตรี (นายถวิล เปลี่ยนศรี) |trans-title=Announcement of the Office of the Prime Minister on cancellation of cabinet resolution and revocation of announcement of Office of Prime Minister (Thawin Pliansri) | journal = Government Gazette | date = 28 April 2014 | accessdate = 6 May 2014 | url = http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2557/E/070/39.PDF | language = Thai | format = PDF | publisher = Cabinet Secretary | location = Bangkok | issue = Volume 131, Special Part 30 D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed Senator Paiboon Nititawan then requested the Constitutional Court to remove Yingluck from office, citing that the transfer of Thawin was the exercise of power to interfere with governmental affairs in favour of Yingluck's family or the Pheu Thai Party. The constitution prohibits a representative, senator or minister from, for his or her own sake or for the sake of his or her political party, interfering with regular government affairs, including the transfer, appointment, promotion, demotion, or removal of governmental officers.&lt;ref name = "thawintransfer"&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:ศาล รธน. รับคำร้องปูย้ายถวิลผิด ม. 268 |trans-title=Charter court accept to decide if Thawin's transfer breaches section 268 | url = http://www.thairath.co.th/content/414175 | work= Thairath | language = Thai | date = 3 April 2014 | accessdate = 6 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The transfer was not interference, but the usual exercise of authority which she is legally empowered to exercise.
# The transfer was not done for the purpose of allowing Priewpan to become the new RTP Commissioner General. The candidates to the office were not selected by her.
# Even though Priewpan is the elder brother of Potjaman, Potjaman and Thaksin had already divorced.
# She cannot be removed from office any longer because she had already vacated it when the House of Representatives was dissolved. The constitution prescribes that the council of ministers vacates office upon dissolution of the House of Representatives, but it shall continue to function until a new council is formed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Since] Police General Priewpan is the maternal [great] uncle of the grandchildren of the Respondent, he could be deemed a relative of the Respondent. It is therefore reasonable to believe that the acts of the Respondent were not for the sake of the Nation and its people, but were done with a concealed or hidden intention to favour the Respondent herself or her partisans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Post Yingluck's removal ===
PDRC leader Suthep launched his "final battle" with media intimidation. On 9 May at 09:09, protesters marched to the buildings of Channels 3, 5, 7, 9 and NBT, where they stayed overnight to make sure the stations did not deviate from PDRC-approved coverage. According to Suthep, these media agencies are "mouthpieces" of the government and must be convinced to refrain from broadcasting any more pro-government "propaganda". They must not report the news on behalf of the tyrants any longer, because it distorts the truth, adding that he intended to ask for co-operation from these stations to broadcast his speech once "victory" is achieved.

The Thai Journalists Association, the Thai Broadcast Journalists Association, and human rights groups condemned the PDRC move. The intimidation campaign occurred previously during the Bangkok Shutdown campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PCAD’s 'Final Battle' Kicks-Off With Media Intimidation|url=http://en.khaosod.co.th/detail.php?newsid=1399630966&amp;section=11|accessdate=10 May 2014|newspaper=Khaosod English|date=9 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512220702/http://en.khaosod.co.th/detail.php?newsid=1399630966&amp;section=11|archive-date=12 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/PDRC-launches-all-out-battle-with-six-processions--30233248.html |title=PDRC launches 'all-out battle' with six processions of protesters |work=The Nation|date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Groups slam PDRC media 'bullying'|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/409024/groups-slam-pdrc-media-bullying|accessdate=10 May 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Media groups decry PDRC threats| url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/408952/stop-bullying-media-pdrc-told|accessdate=10 May 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, those led by Luang Phu Buddha Issara went to CMPO headquarters, where violence erupted between protesters and police. Protesters dismantled barricades and demanded that CMPO send out a representative to talk to them within five minutes. When the five minutes had passed, the protesters broke in, causing police to fire tear gas and water cannons at them. The protesters withdrew. The violence resulted in four protesters injured, included the leader himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/pdrc-protests/409069/luang-pu-buddha-issara-falls-sick-after-police-fired-tear-gas |title=Luang Pu Buddha Issara falls sick after police fired tear gas |work=Bangkok Post |date= |accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, after negotiations with Col Sombat Thanyawan, deputy commander of the Cavalry Centre who supervised security at Government House, Suthep and the PDRC were granted permission to enter the Santi Maitree building. The Santi Maitree is the building at Government House where the cabinet ministers' offices are located. The building was to be used as an office and meeting place for the PDRC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/pdrc-protests/409110/government-house-new-pdrc-base&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDD staged a rally at Aksa Road on 10 May to show support for the recently removed Yingluck and other cabinet members. "I plead with the president of the Supreme Court, which is one of the three pillars of democracy, to reconsider thoroughly the demands by Mr Suthep and the subsequent proposal made by the not-yet-validly nominated Senate speaker to hold a meeting and appoint a new prime minister," said Jatuporn Prompan, leader of the UDD. The Red Shirt leader  warned that any attempt by the Supreme Court and the Senate to discuss "unlawful" demands for an interim government could steer Thailand toward a civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/pdrc-protests/409107/reds-renew-civil-war-warning|title=Reds renew civil war warning|work=Bangkok Post|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|2014 Thai coup d'état}}

On 20 May 2014, the [[Royal Thai Army]] intervened by declaring martial law nationwide and establishing a military command to resolve the situation.&lt;ref name = "martiallaw"&gt;{{cite web | script-title=th:ผบ.ทบ. ลงนามประกาศกฎอัยการศึกทั่วประเทศ มีผลวันนี้ 03.00 น.|trans-title=RTA commander declares martial law nationwide, effective from today, 03:00 hrs | url = http://www.manager.co.th/Politics/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9570000055656 | date = 20 May 2014 | accessdate = 20 May 2014 | language = Thai | work= Manager }}&lt;/ref&gt; The caretaker government stated that the army never sought its opinion on the martial law declaration.

On the evening of 22 May 2014, the army formally staged a coup against the caretaker government and formed a junta called [[National Peace and Order Maintaining Council]] (NPOMC) to govern the country.&lt;ref name = "npomc"/&gt; On 21 August 2014 army chief General [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]] was appointed prime minister by a legislature he had handpicked.&lt;ref name="PrayuthPM"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coup leader General Prayuth is Thailand's new PM|url=http://www.southeastasiapost.com/index.php/sid/224972447|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=22 August 2014|work=Southeast Asia Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rice-pledge scheme crisis==
Concurrent to the 2013–2014 political crisis in Thailand, the rice-pledge scheme has been a significant issue for the caretaker government. Following the dissolution of parliament on 9 December 2013, Yingluck and her Cabinet neglected to approve a renewed budget for the rice pledge. As of 31 January 2014, the caretaker government had not only defaulted on the payments that are owed to the nation's rice farmers as part of the scheme, but caretaker Finance Minister Kittiratt Na Ranong does not have access to the [[Thai baht|Bt]]130 billion that is required to resolve the situation. In its reduced "caretaker" capacity, the Finance Ministry is constitutionally barred from borrowing money that would create obligations for the next government.&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rice-pledge catastrophe could be final straw for Thailand|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/Rice-pledge-catastrophe-could-be-final-straw-for-T-30225605.html|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=31 January 2014|author=Thanong Khanthong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sum of Bt130 billion has been owed to the nation's rice farmers since October 2013 and, as of 31 January 2014, more than 200 farmers have sought the help of the Lawyers' Council with representation in a class action against the government. While the rice farmers of Thailand are the lowest class in the Thai social hierarchy, they are also traditionally a key component of the Pheu Thai Party's political base. As of 31 January 2014, rice farmers, predominantly from the North and Central regions, have blocked highways to protest against the government and have also stated that they may travel to Bangkok to join the anti-government protest. Many farmers are bankrupt as a result of the outstanding payments and at least three farmers under the scheme have committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Rice" /&gt;

The Thai Ministry of Commerce announced on 4 February 2014 that China cancelled a contract to purchase more than a million tonnes of rice due to a continuing investigation of the Anti-Corruption Commission into a rice purchase policy administered by Yingluck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China cancels Thailand rice deal amid probe|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26028335|accessdate=6 February 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesting farmers announced that they would intensify their protest on 6 February 2014 by blocking all of Thailand's major roads, even though many farmers from the north of the country could not afford to participate. The protesting rice farmers—1.4 million farmers in total have been affected—are seeking compensation from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Co-operatives (BAAC), as they believe that the bank can recoup the payment from the government at a later time; however, the BAAC has stated that it relies upon the government for funds. Additionally, a number of farmers from the Central provinces might travel to Bangkok and demand payment in front of the Commerce Ministry on 6 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farmers to block all main roads across country tomorrow|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Farmers-to-block-all-main-roads-across-country-tom-30226075.html|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suthep announced to supporters in Silom on 6 February that one potential solution to the rice farmers predicament is to sell the government's 8 million-tonne stock of pledged rice; however, PDRC-organized protesters would need to forcibly enter secured warehouses to retrieve the rice. One of the PDRC core leaders stated that Suthep would embark on a public walk on 7 February to collect donations for the rice farmers.&lt;ref name="Rice" /&gt; According to Rangsan Srivorasart, Permanent Secretary for Finance, on 7 February, a confidential plan involving Thailand's banks will ensure that the rice farmers will be paid through a Bt130 billion loan. Rangsan stated that several options existed to obtain the necessary funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Finance Ministry assures farmers overdue payments will be made|url=http://www.mcot.net/site/content?id=52f48747be04705ca38b457f#.UvXvHUKSzwN|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=MCOT|date=7 February 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement to the media on 11 February, Yingluck stated that the government possessed the financial means to pay all outstanding debts to the nation's rice farmers and was adamant that the payments will be honoured at the stipulated prices.&lt;ref name="April" /&gt; However, a ''Bangkok Post'' report, published on 12 February 2014, states that the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) is expected to bring formal charges against Yingluck following the collation of evidence to substantiate a case regarding the rice scheme. NACC deputy secretary-general Witthaya Akhompitak
said on 11 February that the NACC expects to press charges against the caretaker Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="NACC"&gt;{{cite news|title=NACC to charge PM over rice|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/394534/|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witthaya explained that if the NACC panel accumulates enough evidence, Yingluck, who is also chairwoman of the National Rice Policy Committee, would be in violation of Section 157 of the Criminal Code for dereliction of duty and, if charged, will be permitted to present her case to the panel—the panel will then decide if the indictment of Yingluck is justified. The case dates back to mid-January 2014 and, if the case is taken to court, Yingluck would be required to step down from all official roles. Meanwhile, caretaker Commerce Minister Niwatthamrong Bunsongphaisan stated that a cabinet meeting held on 11 February approved a central budget of Bt712 million to pay a total of 3,921 undocumented farmers under the rice scheme and the budget will be forwarded to the EC for endorsement between 11 and 14 February 2014.&lt;ref name="NACC" /&gt;

On the evening of 12 February, Thai Rice Association president Prasit Boonchoey warned that around 50,000 rice farmers to oust the caretaker government due to the outstanding payments. Prasit spoke on one of the PDRC protest stages, confirming that he had spoken with other farmer leaders from the western, lower northern, and upper central regions in regard to escalating the protest action. On the morning of 13 February, another group of farmers were escorted by lawyers from the Lawyers Association of Thailand to file legal charges against the caretaker government for fraudulent conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farmer leaders now vow to overthrow caretaker government|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/farmer-leaders-now-vow-overthrow-caretaker-government/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=Thai PBS|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of 14 February, farmer leader Dhaicharn Mata warned Yingluck that the consequences will be "unpredictable and uncontrollable" if the farmers demands are not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yingluck told of 'unpredictable and uncontrollable' consequence if farmers lose patience|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/yingluck-told-unpredictable-uncontrollable-consequence-farmers-lose-patience/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=Thai PBS|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice farmers used a truck to overcome razor wire barricades at one of Yingluck's temporary offices in the Chaeng Wattana area. The caretaker prime minister refused to meet with the farmers, but government officials identified the dissolution of parliament in December 2013 as the cause of the payment delay. Caretaker Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong informed the media that Bt2 billion had already been paid and a further Bt3.39 billion is owed to the farmers. He said the government will pay the remainder of the debt through the state-owned agricultural bank: "Considering the (bank's) capacity in handling daily payments, it is expected that all payments will be made within six to eight weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai farmers surround PM's office, demand rice payments|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/17/thai-farmers-putpressureonpmoverricepayments.html|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 February 2014, Yingluck delivered a speech to respond to the desperation of the rice farmers and detailed how the issue will be resolved. Yingluck also explained that the anti-government protest movement has acted as an obstacle to the successful continuation of the scheme, which she claimed had been functional during its first two years of existence prior to the 2013–2014 political crisis.&lt;ref name="Game"&gt;{{cite news|title=PM: Farmers hostage to political game|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/395681/yingluck-announces-loan-extensions-for-rice-farmers|accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yinluck affirmed that, regardless of the obstacles, she would "persist in fighting for the farmers"; however, the caretaker prime minister called upon the co-operation of Thailand's banks, whereby loans would be granted to the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) for the payment of rice farmers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With a solid guarantee under the law, there are no reasons for the banks and their unions to fear that their money would be used in the wrong way. The government is responsible for every baht. Moreover, the country's financial institutions are very strong with high liquidity. They can comfortably provide loans to help farmers without taking too much risk.&lt;ref name="Game" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yingluck further stated that the BAAC will extend the debt repayment time by six months due to the hardships endured by the farmers, in addition to increasing the loan limit for the upcoming crop season. The speech was telecast nationwide by the Television Pool of Thailand.&lt;ref name="Game" /&gt;

However, also on 18 February, the National Anti-Corruption Commission released a statement charging Yingluck with improperly handling the government's rice subsidy scheme. The Commission states that the scheme involved the government's purchase of farmers' crops for prices up to 50 per cent higher than global prices over a two-year period. The caretaker prime minister received a summons to face the Commission's charges on 27 February 2014, and her impeachment and removal from official duties is one potential outcome.&lt;ref name="Head" /&gt;

EC member Somchai Srisutthiyakorn announced on 4 March 2014 that the caretaker government received the approval of the EC to pay the rice farmers who joined the rice-pledging scheme with Bt20 billion from the nation's central fund. The money will be dispensed as a loan to the government, which will use the revenue from rice sales to repay the amount by 31 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EC allows govt to use Bt20bn from central budget to pay farmers|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/EC-allows-govt-to-use-Bt20bn-from-central-fund-to--30228323.html|accessdate=4 March 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by monk Phra Buddha Issara, a group of farmers dumped rice at the Government Lottery Office (GLO) on 22 March 2014, leading to the closure of the office for the day. The monk demanded that the GLO use lottery sale funds to purchase 100 tonnes of rice from farmers and stated that the Office needs to pay the farmers at least THB12,000 for each tonne of rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farmers dump rice at Govt Lottery Office|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Farmers-dump-rice-at-Govt-Lottery-Office-30229821.html|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GLO pays up after farmers unload rice on its doorstep|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/401097/glo-pays-up-after-farmers-unload-rice-on-its-doorstep|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Government protesters clash with red shirts|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/402463/anti-government-protesters-clash-with-red-shirts|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of tourism, Thailand's Association of Domestic Travel reported a decrease of US$125 million worth of tourist revenue around Christmas and New Year compared to the same period in 2012.

The Bank of Thailand reported on the second day of the anti-government Operation, 14 January 2013, that 135 different bank branches had been affected. It said 36 branches announced full day closure, including three Bangkok Bank branches, 17 Krungthai branches and five Siam Commercial branches, while 99 others closed ahead of regular business hours, including 72 Thai Military branches and 10 CIMB branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangkok Shutdown affects 135 banks|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/bangkok-shutdown-affects-135-banks/|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=Thai PBS|date=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data compiled by Thailand's Financial Ministry, [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and the Stock Exchange of Thailand, foreign investors have withdrawn US$3 billion (nearly THB100 billion) from Thai stocks since protests began on 31 October 2013. Analysts are commenting on the benefits being reaped by Thailand's neighbouring countries and the Thai Stock Exchange has traced approximately THB6.3 billion that has moved to Indonesian shares.&lt;ref name="Stock"&gt;{{cite news|title=Investors shifting to neighbours|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/392077/thailand-s-unrest-prompts-investor-shift-to-neighbours|accessdate=29 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=29 January 2014|author=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand's political pain is neighbors' economic gain|url=http://bangkok.coconuts.co/2014/01/29/thailands-political-pain-neighbors-economic-gain|work=Coconuts Bangkok|accessdate=29 January 2014|date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2014, Tourism and Sports Minister Somsak Phurisisak stated that the total number of visitors to Thailand will drop to one million in January 2014, half of the usual tourist population for the month. A representative from Barclay's, a UK multinational banking and financial services company, reiterated the repetitive history of the protest movement and further explained: "It's not the first time this has happened. What's damaging is perceptions, investment and tourism. It's all reversible at the moment, but as time goes by some of it will become permanent."&lt;ref name="Stock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pain" /&gt;

On 27 January 2014, the Erawan Center, an emergency medical service unit of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), announced that 10 deaths had occurred during the anti-government protests, while 571 injuries had been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-government protest death toll now rises to 10 deaths, 571 injured|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/anti-government-protest-death-toll-now-rises-10-deaths-571-injured/|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Thai PBS|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in tension has been identified in the lead-up to 2 February elections.&lt;ref name="Curb" /&gt;

According to a 12 February media report, Bangkok businesses were hopeful for a resolution to the political unrest, as the financial impact had become more problematic. CentralWorld, one of Southeast Asia's largest shopping plazas, reported that customer traffic was down 20 per cent from 2013, Japanese department store operator Isetan's Bangkok location had been closing an hour earlier, the Ratchaprasong district's accommodation venues experienced a 60 per cent decline in patronage, and only 5,000 tourists were frequenting popular foreign backpacker destination Khaosan Road on a daily basis, representing a 50 per cent drop. On the same date, the central Bank of Thailand downgraded its GDP growth projection for 2014 from 4 per cent to 3 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai tourism, retailers paying the price for drawn-out unrest|url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Thai-tourism-retailers-paying-the-price-for-drawn-out-unrest|accessdate=12 February 2014|newspaper=Nikkei Asian Review|date=12 February 2014|author=Tamaki Kyozuka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An economic data report published on 17 February stated that GDP increased 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2013, the country's lowest level of growth since the first quarter of 2012. The data also showed that the nation's currency has weakened by 4 per cent since the commencement of the protests. Bank of Thailand spokeswoman Roong Mallikamas stated that the monetary policy as of 17 February is sufficient to accommodate the nation's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baht drops most in six weeks|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/395665/thailand-s-baht-drops-most-in-six-weeks-as-protests-harm-growth|accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2014, Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a Thai academic based at [[Chulalongkorn University]]'s Institute of Security and International Studies in Bangkok, assessed the 2014 political crisis for the East Asia Forum, a joint initiative of the [[East Asian Bureau of Economic Research]] (EABER) and the South Asian Bureau of Economic Research (SABER). Thitinan writes that "Yingluck’s days are numbered" and foresees two potential outcomes for Thailand: "If it is a government that includes both sides of the divide, Thailand may be able to navigate a way out. But if it is a partisan anti-Thaksin interim government, more tumult and turmoil can be expected." The academic expresses his support for a democratic process, as he concludes with the statement, "Thais must realise that the starting point for any democracy is the will of the majority and that autocratic rule in Thailand ultimately cannot last."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No luck for Yingluck as Thai elections nullified|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2014/04/13/no-luck-for-yingluck-as-thai-elections-nullified/|work=East Asia Forum|publisher=East Asian Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=14 April 2014|author=Thitinan Pongsudhirak|date=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The private Thai [[think tank]] Kasikorn Research Center (KResearch) reported in mid-April 2014 that Thailand is at risk of entering into a recessionary period due to the ongoing political turmoil in the nation. The Center presented data that indicated an absence of growth in Thai exports during the first quarter of 2014, similar to the final quarter of 2013, while a minus growth of 1.8 percent continued beyond this period. The think tank predicted about 1.8 percent growth for Thailand's economy over 2014; however, Bangkok Bank executive vice-president Kobsak Pootrakool estimated an annual growth of around 2 to 3 percent, as well as an expansion of 5 to 7 percent in exports as a result of a recovering global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai economy on brink of recession|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/thai-economy-blink-recession/|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=Thai PBS|date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Agaria''' are a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in India.&lt;ref name="People_of_India_Gujarat"&gt;''People of India: Gujarat,'' Volume XXII Part One, edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 35 to 38 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The Agaria (Aagariya)  derive their name from the city of [[Agra]] in [[North India]]. According to their traditions, they were substantial landowners and came to the attention of the local Muslim governor, who demanded women from the community. The Agaria refused and were imprisoned by the governor. But Firsad, a grandson of the famous [[Sufi]] saint [[Moinuddin Chishti]], helped the community escape, and as a gratitude converted to Islam. The community may be Muslim converts from the Hindu [[Agri (caste)|Agri]] [[caste]]. They are concentrated in the [[taluqa]]s of [[Bhuj]], [[Matra]], [[Mandvi]][Dhrub] [Mundra] and [[Rajkot]].&lt;ref name="People_of_India_Gujarat"/&gt;

== Present circumstances ==
The Agaria speak [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], with many members of the community also speaking [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. They are an [[endogamous]] community and consist of a number of clans, the main ones being the Lulatar, uthamana, Bayotmona, Gadyatar, Agiotar, Makatar, Admotor, Pilatar, Buburia, Dadoria, and Taravia. All these clans are of equal status, and intermarry. The Agaria are one of the few [[Gujarati Muslim]] communities that practice clan [[exogamy]]. They are [[Sunni]] Muslims but practice many folk beliefs.&lt;ref name="People_of_India_Gujarat"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12206">'''Age of consent law in Canada''' refers to cultural and legal discussions in Canada regarding the [[age of consent]], which was raised from 14 to 16 in May 2008 as part of the [[Tackling Violent Crime Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941 | work=CBC News | title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years | date=May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to all forms of sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/clp/faq.html | work=Department of Justice | title=Age of Consent to Sexual Activity | date=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, the Canadian government proposed a bill to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16, while creating a close-in-age exemption for sex between 14–15 year olds and partners less than 5 years older, and keeping an existing close-in-age clause for sex between 12–13 year olds and partners less than 2 years older.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/clp/faq.html&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative also maintains a temporary exception for already existing marriages of 14 and 15 year olds, but forbids new marriages like these in the future.&lt;ref name="ctv.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060623/age_consent_faq_060623/20060623/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701073406/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060623/age_consent_faq_060623/20060623/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-07-01 |website=CTV.ca |title=Age of Consent FAQ |author=CTV.ca News Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous 1890 law==
In 1890, the age of consent was raised from 12 to 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Information and Research Service|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/prb993-e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle against Internet predators==
Former [[Toronto]] police officer Paul Gillespie said the bill would give police "more tools" in the battle against Internet predators.&lt;ref name="ctv.ca"/&gt; The intention of the bill is to target "[[sexual predators]]" and pimps. Other groups that supported the increase in the age of consent were the National Council of Women of Canada (NCWC), the Canada Family Action Coalition (CFAC), Canadian Crime Victim Foundation (CCVF), Beyond Borders Inc. and Canadians Addressing Sexual Exploitation (CASE).

==Case of Dale Eric Beckham==
One of the motivators for the reform of these laws in [[Canada]] was the case of Dale Eric Beckham. In March 2005, Beckham, then 31 years old, travelled from his home in [[Woodlands, Texas]] to [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] to meet with a 14-year-old boy he had met over the internet. The boy's parents, after observing him sneaking away in the middle of the night into a taxi, alerted the police who tracked the cab to a downtown hotel. Police found Beckham and the boy unclothed in a hotel room, where they were engaged in sexual activity; it was later determined that the two had also engaged in sexual intercourse the previous night. Police also discovered hundreds of pornographic images of children on a laptop computer that Beckham had brought with him from [[Texas]]. Beckham was arrested and held without bail. In Beckham's home state of [[Texas]], the age of consent is 17 and violators can face prison terms of up to 10–20 years. In Canada, sexual activity with children as young as 14 (until May 2008) was legal as long as it was consensual and the adult is not in a position of authority or dependency. The boy, who reportedly suffered from [[social anxiety disorder]] and had shown signs of being suicidal, insisted during interviews with the police that the sex with Beckham was consensual. Consequently, the only crime Beckham could be prosecuted for in Canada was a relatively minor offense of possession of [[child pornography]]. In November 2005, Beckham pleaded guilty and was sentenced to the time already served. He was then ordered deported back to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khou.com/news/local/stories/khou060710_mh_woodlandsporn.45226c47.html Woodlands man admits he seduced teen online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202184401/http://www.khou.com/news/local/stories/khou060710_mh_woodlandsporn.45226c47.html |date=February 2, 2009 }}, KHOU.com, July 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAO1/&gt;&lt;ref name=HCN2&gt;[http://www.hcnonline.com/articles/2007/11/14/import/20071114-archive97.txt Man gets 17 years in child porn case] by Jamie Nash, Houston Community Newspapers, November 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCWEB1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/3075649.html Woodlands man accused of luring boy online] By Renee C.

After being notified of his arrest in Canada, [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)]] agents searched Beckham's home in [[Woodlands, Texas]] where they discovered a massive quantity of [[child pornography]] on his computer, with some depicting children less than 12 years old engaged in sexual acts with adults. After returning to the United States, Beckham was immediately arrested and held without bond. In July 2007, Beckham pleaded guilty to a federal charge of transporting child pornography to Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252A- United States Code: Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 110, § 2252A(a)(1)], available online at Cornell University Law School.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Under the plea agreement, the prosecution agreed to dismiss a second charge of possession of child pornography involving the sexual exploitation of minors. The prosecution also agreed not to prosecute Beckham for charges relating to the 
online enticement of a minor and travel in interstate and foreign commerce for illicit sex. (see: [http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/txsdce/4:2008cv03426/622884/5/ ''United States of America'' v. ''Dale Eric Beckham''], Page 5.)&lt;/ref&gt; although his lawyer argued (unsuccessfully) that Beckham's behaviour was the result of [[diminished capacity]]. In November 2007, Beckham was sentenced to 17 years in prison, to be followed by lifetime supervision.&lt;ref name=USAO1&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/txs/releases/November%202007/071108Beckham.htm The Woodlands Man Sentenced to Prison for Child Pornography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202125623/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/txs/releases/November%202007/071108Beckham.htm |date=February 2, 2009 }}, United States Attorney's Office (USAO) – Southern District of Texas, November 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HCN2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/txsdce/4:2008cv03426/622884/5/ ''United States of America'' v.

This case raised concerns that child molesters, not just in Canada but also from abroad, were taking advantage of Canada's low age of consent to sexually exploit vulnerable children while escaping criminal prosecution.&lt;ref name=CBCWEB1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122080318/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/03/08/internet-luring-050308.html Web luring case raises age-of-consent issue], Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), March 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
===[[LGBT rights]] activists===
These activists also criticized the bill, because it does not address the issue of equality, maintaining the present Canadian age of consent for anal sex outside of marriage at 18. Hillary Cook, spokeswoman for gay rights group [[Egale Canada]] believes the bill is "''an attempt to score partisan points''".&lt;ref name=MixedR/&gt;

===Attorney General suit===
In March 2009 a lawsuit was brought against the [[Attorney General of Canada]] alleging the Age of Sexual Consent increase was a direct violation of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] within the [[Constitution of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Violators: No Human Rights for You (Canada)  |url=http://theviolators.webs.com |first=Octaevius |last=Altair |date=2011}} Standing on behalf of public interest was denied and the matter remains unresolved through the Canadian Courts.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
====[[Canadian AIDS Society]]====
The Canadian AIDS Society has stated that "increasing the age of consent could result in young people being more secretive about their sexual practices and not seeking out the information they need. This will place youth at an increased risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cdnaids.ca/ageofconsentjuly2006 |title=Age of Consent (July 2006)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2013-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017153506/http://www.cdnaids.ca/ageofconsentjuly2006 |archive-date=2013-10-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Canadian Children's Rights Council]]====
They referenced an article in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' which highlighted the opinions of Martha Mackinnon (Justice for Children and Youth, executive director) who had expressed concern this would decrease the pursuit of condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/new-sexual-consent-law-may-confuse-teens/article581151/ |author=Tralee Pearce |date=2 May 2008 |title=New sexual consent law may confuse teens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Canadian Federation for Sexual Health]]====
This proposal has received criticism from different organizations and individuals. [[Andrea Cohen]] of the [[pro-choice]] Canadian Federation for Sexual Health 
(formerly [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]]) said the organization believes the legislation does nothing to keep youth from harm. She talked on [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]]'s "[[Mike Duffy]] Live" where she stated: "''What it will do is infringe upon the rights of youth in terms of their ability to make decisions on their own sexuality''".&lt;ref name=MixedR&gt;{{cite news

[[Peter Dudding]], Executive Director of the Child Welfare League of Canada, criticized the bill's effect of removing judicial discretion in cases involving 14- and 15-year-olds: "When we deal with arbitrary cut-offs, we lose the flexibility to apply the law in a much more specific and individualized kind of way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleans.ca/canada/national/article.jsp?content=20060701_130213_130213 |title=Sixteen and ready for sex? |website=Macleans.ca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320051656/http://www.macleans.ca/canada/national/article.jsp?content=20060701_130213_130213 |archive-date=20 March 2012 |first=Dafna |last=Izenberg |date=4 July 2006 |quote=Raising the age of consent tries to make young teens off-limits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Location of [[Asia]].]]
'''Asian cuisine''' includes several major regional [[cuisine]]s: [[#East Asian cuisine|East Asian]], [[#Southeast Asian cuisine|Southeast Asian]], [[#South Asian cuisine|South Asian]], [[#Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]], and [[#Western Asian cuisine (Middle East)|Middle Eastern/Western Asian]]. A cuisine is a characteristic style of [[cooking]] practices and traditions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cuisine "Cuisine."] [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Thefreedictionary.com]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; usually associated with a specific [[culture]]. Asia, being the largest and most populous [[continent]], is home to many cultures, many of which have their own characteristic cuisine.

Ingredients common to many cultures in the East and Southeast regions of the continent include rice, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chilies, dried onions, soy, and tofu. [[Stir frying]], steaming, and [[deep frying]] are common cooking methods.

While rice is common to most Asian cuisines, different varieties are popular in the various regions. [[Basmati rice]] is popular in the subcontinent, [[Jasmine rice]] is often found across the southeast, while long-grain rice is popular in China and short-grain in Japan and Korea.&lt;ref name=quaker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricearoni.com/rar_flavorsOfTheWorld/asian/ |title=The flavors of Asia |publisher=[[Quaker Oats Company]] |accessdate=2008-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604051405/http://www.ricearoni.com/rar_flavorsOfTheWorld/asian/ |archivedate=June 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Curry]] is a common dish in southern,  
southeastern Asia and Japan and also found to some extent in other East Asian cuisines. Curry dishes with origins in India and other northern South Asian countries usually have a [[yogurt]] base while those in southern India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia generally use coconut milk as their foundation.&lt;ref name=kraft&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kraft.com.au/CookingSchool/CookingBasics/AsianCuisine/CuisineAreasOfAsia/ |title=Cuisine Areas Of Asia |author= |publisher=[[Kraft Foods|Kraft Foods (Australia)]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-12-20 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== East Asian cuisine ==
[[File:East Asia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Location of [[East Asia]]. In some definitions, it also includes [[Vietnam]].]]
{{Main|East Asian cuisine}}

East Asian cuisine includes [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongolian]], and [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese]] food. Considering this is the most populated region of the world, it has many regional cuisines (especially China). Examples of staple foods include [[rice]], [[noodles]], [[mung bean]]s, [[soy bean]]s, [[seafood]] (Japan has the highest per capita consumption of seafood), [[mutton]] (Mongolia), [[bok choy]] (Chinese cabbage), and [[tea]].    
{{Clear}}

== Southeast Asian cuisine ==
[[File:Southeast Asia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Location of [[Southeast Asia]].]]
{{Main|Southeast Asian cuisine}}

Southeast Asian cuisine includes a strong emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with a strong aromatic component that features such flavors as citrus and herbs such as [[Kaffir lime|lime]], [[coriander]]/[[cilantro]] and [[basil]]. Ingredients in the region contrast with the ones in the Eastern Asian cuisines, substituting [[fish sauce]]s for soy sauce and the inclusion of ingredients such as [[galangal]], [[tamarind]] and [[lemongrass]]. Cooking methods include a balance of [[stir-frying]], boiling and steaming.
{{Clear}}

== South Asian cuisine ==
[[File:South Asia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Location of [[South Asia]].]]
{{Main|South Asian cuisine}}

South Asian cuisine includes the [[cuisine]]s from the [[Indian subcontinent]].  Foods in this area of the world are flavoured with various types of chili, black pepper, cloves, and other strong herbs and spices along with the flavoured butter and [[ghee]]. Turmeric and cumin are often used to make curries.

Common meats include lamb, goat, fish and chicken. [[Beef]] is less common than in [[Western world|Western]] cuisines because cattle have a special place in [[Hinduism]]. Prohibitions against beef extend to the meat of cows, and [[yak]]s to some extent.  [[Pork]] is considered a [[Taboo food and drink|taboo food item]] by all Muslims and is avoided by some Hindus.

== Central Asian cuisine ==
[[File:Central Asia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Location of [[Central Asia]]. In some definitions, it also includes [[Afghanistan]].]]
{{Main|Central Asian cuisine}}
Most Central Asian nations have similar cuisines to each other as well as their neighbors, taking many features of the neighboring cuisines of Western and Eastern Asia, particularly [[Mongolia]].  A dish known as "plov", or "osh", for example, is a widespread variation of [[pilaf]]. However, many of the same countries use [[horse meat]] and [[mutton]] as the most common meats, similar to [[beef]]. This is owing to [[Mongolian cuisine]].  In [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]], cuisine has evolved to meet the needs of a nomad lifestyle.

[[Kumis]] is a widespread drink among [[Turkic peoples]], especially in Central Asia.

Central Asia is also noted for being the birthplace of [[yogurt]].  Like kumis, it is widespread among Turkic peoples.

== Western Asian (Middle East) cuisine ==
[[File:Western Asia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Location of [[Western Asia]].]]
{{Main|Middle Eastern cuisine}}

West Asian cuisine is the cuisine of the Middle East, minus Egypt.

Middle Eastern cuisine is the [[cuisine]] of the various countries and peoples of the [[Middle East]]. The cuisine of the region is diverse while having a degree of homogeneity.&lt;ref name="globalgourmet"&gt;[http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/mideast/mestback.html "The Middle East: Background."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526000000/http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/mideast/mestback.html |date=2017-05-26 }}, [http://www.globalgourmet.com Globalgourmet.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980126050915/http://www.globalgourmet.com/ |date=1998-01-26 }}. Accessed January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commonly used ingredients include [[olive]]s and [[olive oil]], [[pita]]s, [[honey]], [[sesame]] seeds, [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s,&lt;ref name="globalgourmet"/&gt; [[sumac]], [[chickpea]]s, [[mentha|mint]] and [[parsley]]. Some popular dishes include [[kibbeh]] and [[shawarma]].

Cereals constitute the basis of the Middle Eastern diet, both historically and today. [[Wheat]] and [[rice]] are the major and preferred sources of staple foods. [[Barley]] is also widely used in the region and [[maize]] has become common in some areas as well. Bread is a universal staple, eaten in one form or another by all classes and groups practically at every meal.

Butter and clarified butter (also known as [[samna]]) are, traditionally, the preferred medium of cooking. Olive oil is prevalent in the Mediterranean coastal areas. Christians use it during Lent, when meat and dairy products are excluded, and Jews use it in place of animal fats such as butter to avoid mixing meat and dairy products.

Lamb and mutton have always been the favored meats of the Middle East. Pork is prohibited in both Islam and Judaism, and as such is rarely eaten in the region. Prominent among the meat preparations are grilled meats, or [[kebab]]s. Meat and vegetable stews, served with rice, bulgur, or bread, are another form of meat preparation in the region.

Vegetables and pulses are the predominant staple of the great majority of the people in the Middle East. They are boiled, stewed, grilled, stuffed, and cooked with meat and with rice. Among the green leaf vegetables, many varieties of cabbage, spinach, and chard are widely used. Root and bulb vegetables, such as onions and garlic, as well as carrots, turnips, and beets are equally common.

== North Asian cuisine==
[[File:North Asia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Location of [[Northern Asia]].]]

North Asian cuisine is often synonymous with [[Russian cuisine]], due to all of Northern Asia being a part of the Russian Federation.  However, some cultures or areas of Siberia have in-depth cuisine, such as the [[Yakuts]] (or Sakha) and [[Yamal cuisine]].  [[Buryats]] also have their own cuisine, although it is very similar to that of the related [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongolians]].

[[Pelmeni]], originally a [[Great Perm|Permic]] or [[Yugra|Ugric]] dish, has entered into mainstream Russian cuisine as a well-known dish, but it can still be considered part of the Yamal cuisine for its area of origin.  Some speculate them to be a simplified version of the Chinese [[wonton]].  In [[Siberia]], pelmeni are frozen outdoors to preserve the meat inside through the long winter.  In [[Yamal Peninsula|Yamal]], other types of drying and preservation are common.  Key ingredients in most northern Siberian cuisine include fish and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|cowberries]], sometimes known as lingonberries in Europe and North America.  Yakuts, like many other [[Turkic peoples|Turkic-speaking peoples]], traditionally enjoy [[kumis]] as a common drink.

'''Belgian Canadians''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Canadiens belges'') are [[Canadians|Canadian citizen]]s of Belgian ancestry or [[Belgium]]-born people who reside in Canada. According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]] there were 176,615 Canadians who claimed full or partial Belgian ancestry.&lt;ref name="Belgian Canadians"/&gt;

== History ==
Belgians{{what|date=April 2017}} first arrived in the 1660s. A trickle of artisans came to New France before the 1750s. In the mid-19th century there were enough arrivals to open part-time consulates in Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax. After 1859 the main attraction was free farm land. After 1867 the national government gave immigrants from Belgium a preferred status, and encouraged emigration to the Francophone Catholic communities of Quebec and Manitoba. Édouard Simaeys became a part-time paid Canadian agent in Belgium to publicize opportunities in Canada and facilitate immigration. The steamship companies prepared their own brochures and offered package deals to farm families.  By 1898 there was a full-time Canadian office in Antwerp which provided pamphlets, lectures and specific travel advice. By 1906 some 2000 Belgians a year were arriving, most with skills in agriculture. A third wave of immigration took place after 1945, with urban areas the destination.  The 1961 census counted 61,000 Canadians of Belgian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Magocsi, ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples'' (1999) pp 257-69&lt;/ref&gt;  

Belgian immigration to [[western Canada]] in the late 19th and early 20th century attracted the attention of the Belgian government. It enacted laws and regulations to protect the emigrants and guarantee adequate travel conditions.  Provision was made to assist emigrants who decided to return to Belgium.  Starting in the 1860s consular officials made on-site visits to inspect conditions in Canada, which eagerly welcomed the new arrivals. The Catholic church was likewise welcoming, and a number of priests emigrated. The [[Walloons|Walloon]] immigrants discovered they could continue to speak French in Canada, while the [[Flemish]] quickly learned English.  The Belgians formed no national organizations but they were active in local affairs. Some settled in towns such as [[Saint Boniface, Manitoba]], but most became farmers who specialized in dairy farming, sugar beets and market gardening.  After 1920 there was a move to western Alberta, with an economy based on ranching, horse breeding, and sugar beets.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius J. Jaenen, ''Promoters, Planters, and Pioneers: The Course and Context of Belgian Settlement in Western Canada'' (University of Calgary Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, Belgian émigrés from Canada and elsewhere in the Americas were formed into the 2nd Fusilier Battalion of the [[Free Belgian Forces]], which was based in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Nigel|title=Foreign Volunteers of the Allied Forces, 1939–45|year=1991|publisher=Osprey|location=London|isbn=978-1-85532-136-6|pages=15–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may have been minor settlement of '''Chinese people in Kenya''' as early as the 15th century; however, modern migration from the People's Republic of China to [[Kenya]] only dates to the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Onjala"&gt;{{citation|title=A Scoping Study on China–Africa Economic Relations: The Case of Kenya|first=Joseph|last=Onjala|publisher=African Economic Research Consortium|publication-place=Nairobi|date=March 2008|accessdate=30 March 2009|url=http://www.aercafrica.org/documents/china_africa_relations/Kenya.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are estimated to be anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 Chinese people in the country.&lt;ref name="Fackler"&gt;{{citation|periodical=China Daily|last=Fackler|first=Ted|title=Chinese Expatriates in Kenya|date=4 July 2007|accessdate=29 March 2009|url=http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news_msg.php?titleid=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
===Zheng He's fleet===
Early Chinese mariners had a variety of contacts with Kenya. Archaeologists have found Chinese porcelains made during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) in Kenyan villages; however, these were believed to have been brought over by [[Zheng He]] during [[Ming treasure voyages|his 15th century ocean voyages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=People's Daily|date=3 November 2006|accessdate=30 March 2009|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200611/03/eng20061103_317869.html|title=Children of the master voyager?}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Lamu Island]] off the Kenyan coast, local [[oral tradition]] maintains that 20 shipwrecked Chinese sailors, possibly part of Zheng's fleet, washed up on shore there hundreds of years ago. Given permission to settle by local tribes after having killed a dangerous python, they [[Religious_conversion#Conversion_to_Islam|converted]] to [[Islam]] and married local women. Now, they are believed to have just six descendants left there; in 2002, DNA tests conducted on one of the women confirmed that she was of Chinese descent. Her daughter, Mwamaka Sharifu, later received a PRC government scholarship to study [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM) in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=China Daily|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-07/11/content_459090.htm|date=11 July 2005|accessdate=30 March 2009|title=Is this young Kenyan Chinese descendant?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=30 March 2009|title=Revisiting the history of the high seas|last=York|first=Geoffrey|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050718%2FCHINA18%2FTPInternational%2FAsia&amp;ord=51366453&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true|periodical=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theworld.org/2010/05/digging-for-chinese-culture-in-kenya/|title=Digging for Chinese culture in Kenya|author=THE WORLD|newspaper=PRI's The World|date= 27 May 2010 |page=|accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Pate Island]], Frank Viviano described in a July 2005 ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' article how ceramic fragments had been found around Lamu which the administrative officer of the local Swahili history museum claimed were of Chinese origin, specifically from [[Zheng He]]'s voyage to east Africa. The eyes of the Pate people resembled Chinese and Famao and Wei were some of the names among them which were speculated to be of Chinese origin. Their ancestors were said to be from indigenous women who intermarried with Chinese Ming sailors when they were shipwrecked. Two places on Pate were called "Old [[Shanga, Pate Island|Shanga]]", and "New Shanga", which the Chinese sailors had named. A local guide who claimed descent from the Chinese showed Frank a graveyard made out of coral on the island, indicating that they were the graves of the Chinese sailors, which the author described as "virtually identical" to Chinese Ming dynasty tombs, complete with "half-moon domes" and "terraced entries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/asia/china/zheng-he-text/6|title=China's Great Armada, Admiral Zheng He|author=Frank Viviano|newspaper=NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC|date=July 2005|page=6|accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern migration===
The modern wave of Chinese migration to Kenya dates back to the late 20th century. As recently as 1996, there were few Chinese in Kenya, and the capital [[Nairobi]] had only one [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]], but by 2007, the city boasted an estimated forty Chinese restaurants, largely opened by expatriates from [[mainland China]].&lt;ref name="Fackler"/&gt; Most have settled in the area around the Chinese embassy, which is located near the [[State House (Kenya)|State House]] and the Defence Headquarters, in a relatively high-security part of the city.&lt;ref name="Onjala"/&gt; There are also some Chinese in the coastal city of [[Mombasa]]. Restaurants and TCM clinics are two popular lines of business for Chinese in the city.&lt;ref name="Beech"/&gt; Chinese in various parts of the country also run import/export businesses, with products as varied as computers, glassware, and automobile parts for import, and shark fins for export.&lt;ref name="Beech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Onjala"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SinaNews"&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2009-02-11/173015146449s.shtml|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=30 March 2009|periodical=Sina News|title=肯尼亚知名华商徐晖：翱翔非洲大地的九头鸟/Xu Hui, a famous Chinese businessman in Kenya: A "Nine-Headed Bird" soaring over Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent Chinese migrants cite Kenya's relative stability and high rate of growth as factors in choosing it as their destination. However, many of them consisted of middle-aged people, as younger migrants preferred destinations in Europe or the United States.&lt;ref name="Xinhua20061107"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Xinhua News|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2006-11/07/content_5299894.htm|date=7 November 2006|accessdate=30 March 2009|title=华商淘金肯尼亚：不光是生意，还有中国人的脸面/Chinese merchants "panning for gold" in Kenya: Not just business, but also "face" for Chinese people}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, estimates published in popular media from 2006 through 2008 place the number of Chinese in Kenya at anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="Fackler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xinhua20061107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShandongNews"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sdnews.com.cn/news/2008/4/23/537242.html|periodical=Shandong News|date=23 April 2008|accessdate=30 March 2009|title=中国工程师肯尼亚遭劫杀 参赞已奔赴事发地/Chinese engineer killed in attack in Kenya|last=Song|first=Xianxia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and media==
Kenya has one Chinese community school, the Kenya-China School (肯尼亚中国学校), founded in March 2006. It has 20 teachers, among whom five teach Chinese, and 200 students, including 20 at the kindergarten level, 50 in the primary school division, and 130 technical students. The student body is just 25% Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=非洲肯尼亚中国学校/Africa: Kenya-China School|url=http://www.hwjyw.com/info/organizations/Africa/schools/200803/t20080304_13403.shtml|title=Overseas Chinese Language and Culture Education Online|publisher=Chinese Language Educational Fund|publication-place=Beijing|year=2008|accessdate=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Confucius Institute]] has also opened a branch at the [[University of Nairobi]], its first on the African continent.&lt;ref name="Fackler"/&gt; A second Institute now exists at [[Kenyatta University]] on the outskirts of Nairobi.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

[[China Radio International]] and [[China Central Television]] are rebroadcast for a few hours a day by the [[Kenya Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Fackler"/&gt;

==Integration and community==
Some local Kenyan merchants complain that Chinese expatriates selling imported goods are taking jobs from them.&lt;ref name="Fackler"/&gt; They accuse Chinese traders of "taking photographs of their goods to copy the designs", and claim "they have unfair advantages such as cheap labour in China local government support".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38580|title=Creating Designs for Chinese Traders to Copy|last=Omungo|first=Rosalia|date=18 July 2007|accessdate=29 March 2009|periodical=Inter-Press Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese people have also opened apparel factories in Kenya's [[export processing zone]]s, but there have been protests against poor working conditions there, according to Western media. Many Chinese businesspeople, especially those in the textiles industry, try to avoid directly dealing with locals as a result of this opprobrium, instead employing Kenyan human resources managers and accountants.&lt;ref name="Onjala"/&gt; The Kenyan government are taking a variety of steps to attempt to address the trade imbalance between the two countries, including encouraging Chinese traders to invest in local production facilities.&lt;ref name="BDAfrica"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8564&amp;Itemid=5813|periodical=Business Daily Africa|date=3 July 2008|accessdate=30 March 2009|title=Kenya steps up bid to woo Chinese investors|last=Omondi|first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese people are respected by most Kenyan locals for the infrastructure that Chinese companies have built in Kenya, such as the [[Thika Road]].&lt;ref name="Beech"/&gt; However, Chinese engineers working in remote parts of the country on such infrastructure projects stand out significantly from locals, and often face the danger of local violences.&lt;ref name="ShandongNews"/&gt;

===Chinatowns===
There are several Chinatowns in the capital city of [[Nairobi]].  Most of them are low profile as some complaints that the Chinese establishments were "Catering only to the Chinese community", according to Western media.

'''David''' "'''Doc'''" '''Searls''' (born July 29, 1947), is an American journalist, columnist, and a widely read [[weblog|blog]]ger. He is a co-author of ''[[The Cluetrain Manifesto]]'', author of ''[[The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge]]'', Editor-in-Chief of ''[[Linux Journal]]'', a fellow at the Center for Information Technology &amp; Society (CITS) at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and an alumnus fellow (2006–2010) of the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at [[Harvard University]].

==Overview==

A longtime advocate for [[open-source software]], Searls has been involved with the ''Linux Journal'' since it began publishing in 1994. He became a Contributing Editor in 1996, Senior Editor since 1999, and Editor-in-Chief in 2018. His column "Linux for Suits" ran until 2007, and was followed by "EOF" inside each issue's back cover. His work with ''Linux Journal'', and as an advocate of [[free software]] and [[Open-source model|open source]], earned him a [[Google-O'Reilly Open Source Award]] for Best Communicator in 2005. His byline has also appeared in many other publications, including ''[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]]'', ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''[[PC Magazine]]'', ''The Standard'', ''The Sun Magazine'', ''[[Upside (magazine)|Upside]]'', ''[[Release 1.0]]'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.

In early 1999 Searls joined [[Christopher Locke]], [[David Weinberger]] and Rick Levine in writing ''[[The Cluetrain Manifesto]]'', an iconoclastic website that was followed in January 2000 by the book with the same title. The book became a business bestseller and was published in nine languages. A 10th Anniversary edition came out in June 2009. Among Searls' contributions to the Manifesto was its first thesis, "Markets are conversations" – which is also the title of the ''Cluetrain'' chapter he co-wrote with David Weinberger. Weinberger and Searls co-wrote "[http://www.worldofends.com/ World of Ends: What the Internet Is and How to Stop Mistaking It for Something Else]".

Searls has also been a well-known blogger since October 1999, when he started blogging with help from his friend [[Dave Winer]]. In an Online Journalism Review article, [[J.D. Lasica]] calls Searls "one of the deep thinkers in the blog movement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/lasica/1019165278.php Weblogs: A New Source of News], by J.D. Lasica, 2002-04-18, Online Journalism Review&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The World is Flat]]'', [[Thomas L. Friedman]] calls Searls "one of the most respected technology writers in America."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/reader/0312425074?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sib_books_pg&amp;qid=1246474727&amp;query=doc%20searls#reader The World is Flat], by Thomas L. Friedman&lt;/ref&gt;

Searls' two academic fellowships both began in 2006. At the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] he leads ProjectVRM, which guides independent software development communities working on [[Vendor Relationship Management]] (VRM). The purpose of VRM is to equip individuals with tools that provide both independence from vendor "lock-in" and better means for engaging with vendors. VRM tools and methods also help individuals engage with government and other non-commercial organizations. At the [[Center for Information Technology &amp; Society|Center for Information Technology and Society]] (CITS) at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], Searls is studying both the nature of infrastructure and of the Internet as a form of infrastructure.

In April 2012, his book ''[[The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge]]'' was published. Searls coined the term in an article for ''[[Linux Journal]]''. He wrote: "The Intention Economy grows around buyers, not sellers. It leverages the simple fact that buyers are the first source of money, and that they come ready-made. You don't need advertising to make them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Doc | last=Searls | coauthors= | title=The Intention Economy | date=March 8, 2006 | publisher= | url =http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000035 | work =Linux Journal | pages = | accessdate = September 28, 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The nickname "Doc" is what Searls calls a "fossil remnant" of "Doctor Dave," his humorous persona at WDBS (now [[WXDU]]) radio at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2009/02/04/getting-rained-out-in-a-brainstorm/ Getting rained out in a brainstorm], February 4, 2009, Doc Searls Weblog&lt;/ref&gt; Following his work in radio, Searls co-founded Hodskins Simone &amp; Searls (HS&amp;S), which grew to become one of the top high-tech advertising agencies in [[North Carolina]], and then in [[Silicon Valley]]. Searls' consultancy, The Searls Group, was spun out of HS&amp;S in the early 1990s. He is a frequent speaker at business and industry events, under the auspices of The Searls Group.

Searls is a 1969 graduate of [[Guilford College]]. While Searls' permanent home is in Santa Barbara, he and his family currently live most of the year near his work at Harvard.

{{Commons category|Photographs by Doc Searls}}
Searls' journalism career began in 1971, when he worked as an editor and photographer for ''Wayne Today'' in New Jersey. In recent years his photographic work consists of pushing as many shots as possible into the public domain, through permissive [[Creative Commons]] licensing for a batch of photos on [[Flickr]] that now total more than 41,000 on his own site alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/ Doc Searls Flickr photos], Flickr&lt;/ref&gt; (He also posts on three other sites: two for the Berkman Center and one for ''Linux Journal''.) A large percentage of those are shot out the windows of commercial aircraft. There are about 300 of his photos that now appear in Wikimedia Commons (none of which he put there).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimedia Commons |url= http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;profile=default&amp;search=doc+searls&amp;fulltext=Search|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these also illustrate articles in Wikipedia as well.

His photos have also appeared in many books, magazines and other media, including NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. There Searls' ice crystal photos served as key elements for the network's coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157613918962531/ Doc Searls Ice Crystal Photos], Flickr&lt;/ref&gt; (Searls ran in the credits as a member of the design team.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157623323934755/ Doc Searls Photos used by NBC], Flickr&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup''' or '''Eight Immortals Indulged in Wine''' ({{zh|c=飲中八仙|p=yǐnzhōng bāxiān}}) were a group of [[Tang Dynasty]] scholars who are known for their love of [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|alcoholic beverages]]. They are not deified and ''[[Xian (Daoist)|xiān]]'' ("immortal; transcendent; fairy") is metaphorical. The term is used in a poem by [[Du Fu]], as well as in the [[biography]] of [[Li Bai]] in the [[New Book of Tang]].

They appeared in Du's poem in the following order:

* [[He Zhizhang]] (賀知章 Hè Zhīzhāng)
* [[Li Jin (Tang Dynasty)|Li Jin]] (李璡 Lǐ Jìn)
* [[Li Shizhi]] (李適之 Lǐ Shìzhi)

'''Exoticism''' (from 'exotic') is a trend in European art and design, whereby artists became fascinated with ideas and styles from distant regions, and drew inspiration from them. This often involved surrounding foreign cultures with mystique and fantasy which owed more to European culture than to the exotic cultures themselves: this process of glamorisation and stereotyping is called 'exoticization'.

==History of exoticism==

First stimulated by Eastern trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, interest in non-western (particularly "Oriental", i.e. Middle Eastern or Asian) art by Europeans became more and more popular following [[European colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oshinsky|first=Sara J.|title=Exoticism in the Decorative Arts|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/exot/hd_exot.htm|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influences of Exoticism can be seen through numerous genres of this period, notably in music, painting, and decorative art. In music, exoticism is a genre in which the rhythms, melodies, or instrumentation are designed to evoke the atmosphere of far-off lands or ancient times (e.g. [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' and ''Tzigane for Violin and Orchestra'',  [[Claude Debussy|Debussy's]] ''Syrinx for Flute Solo'' or [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov's]] ''[[Capriccio espagnol]]''). Like orientalist subjects in 19th-century painting, exoticism in the decorative arts and interior decoration was associated with fantasies of opulence.

Exoticism, by one definition, is "the charm of the unfamiliar". Scholar [[Alden Jones]] defines exoticism in art and literature as the representation of one culture for consumption by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article08060708.aspx|title=This Is Not a Cruise|author=Alden Jones|date=August 6, 2007|publisher=The Smart Set}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Segalen's important "Essay on Exoticism" reveals Exoticism as born of the age of imperialism, possessing both aesthetic and ontological value, while using it to uncover a significant cultural "otherness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segalen|first=Victor|title=Essay on Exoticism: An Aesthetics of Diversity|year=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important and archetypical exoticist is the artist and writer [[Paul Gauguin]], whose visual representations of [[Tahiti]]an people and landscapes were targeted at a French audience. While exoticism is closely linked to [[Orientalism]], it is not a movement necessarily associated with a particular time period or culture. Exoticism may take the form of [[primitivism]], [[ethnocentrism]], or humanism.

Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. The revival of ancient Greek and Roman art left behind the Academy’s emphasis on naturalism, and incorporated a new found idealism not seen since the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbert|first=Robert|title=Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society|journal=Art Journal|year=1990|volume=49|issue=1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As classicism progressed, Ingres identified a newfound idealism and exoticism in his work. The Grand Odalisque, finished in 1814, was created to arouse the male view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Karen|title=The Spectatorship of the Affiche Illustrée and the Modern City of Paris, 1880-1900|journal=Journal of Design History|year=2012|volume=25|issue=1|page=24|doi=10.1093/jdh/epr044}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion of the exotic figure furthers Ingres’ use of symmetry and line by enabling the eye to cohesively move across the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth-Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Ingres’ intention was to make the woman beautiful in his work, his model was a courtesan, which arouse debate.

Édouard Manet’s [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]], finished in 1863, was based on Titian’s Venus of Urbino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olympia was a popular play about a courtesan called Olympia. This subject was extremely controversial for an artist to portray a woman like this because of traditional vision of the Academy.  Manet was being very different from the accepted academic style by outlining and flattening space that created a distortion of classical elements. Olympia is provocative in her nudity that implies she is naked, not nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is looking out in a very confrontational way, and setting the viewer as a man coming to the prostitute, although Olympia’s hand suggests she is not ready to engage with the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The African servant calls on racism and slavery in France, because showing someone of color participating in French life was unheard of, furthering the work's exotic nature.

'''Finnish Sign Language''' (''suomalainen viittomakieli'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) is the [[sign language]] most commonly used in [[Finland]]. There are 5000 ''(estimate)'' Finnish [[deaf]] who have Finnish Sign Language as a mother tongue. Linguistically Finnish Sign Language is closest to [[Swedish Sign Language]], from which it began to separate as an independent language in the middle of the 19th century.

Finnish legislation [[recognition of sign languages#Finland|recognized Finnish Sign Language]] as one of Finland's domestic languages in 1995 when it was included in the renewed [[Constitution of Finland|constitution]]. Finland then became the third country in the world to recognize a sign language as a natural language and the right to use it as a mother tongue.

Courses in "sign language" have been taught in Finland since the 1960s. At that time, instruction taught signs but followed Finnish word order (see [[Manually Coded Language]]). Later, as research on sign languages in general and Finnish Sign Language in particular determined that sign languages tend to have a very different grammar from oral languages, the teaching of Finnish Sign Language and [[Signed Finnish]] diverged.

The Irish calendar is the [[Julian calendar]] as it was in use in [[Ireland]], but also incorporating Irish cultural festivals and views of the division of the seasons, presumably inherited from earlier [[Celtic calendar]] traditions.

For example, the pre-Christian Celtic year began on 1 November, although in common with the rest of the Western world, it now begins on 1 January.&lt;ref&gt;See Nora Chadwick, The Celts (1970) p.181&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2015}}&lt;!--what does "pre-Christian Celtic" have to do with the article topic--&gt;

*Winter ("Geimhreadh") - November, December, January (''[[Samhain]], Nollaig, Eanáir'')
*Spring ("Earrach") - February, March, April (''Feabhra, Márta, Aibreán'')
*Summer ("Samhradh") - May, June, July (''[[Beltane|Bealtaine]], Meitheamh, Iúil'')
*Autumn ("Fómhar" ''Harvest'') - August, September, October (''[[Lughnasadh|Lúnasa]], Meán Fómhair, Deireadh Fómhair'')

In English-language Julian calendars, the months are based on names from [[Classical mythology]], such as the name "February" which derives from the Roman purification rite, [[Februa]]. In the Irish calendar, the names of the months in the [[Irish language]] refer to  [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic religion and mythology]], and generally predate the [[History of Ireland (400–800)#Early Christian history|arrival of Christianity]].  The words for May (''[[Beltane|Bealtaine]]''), August (''[[Lughnasadh|Lúnasa]]'') and November (''[[Samhain]]''), are the names of Gaelic [[Celtic polytheism|religious festivals]]. In addition, the names for September (''Meán Fómhair'') and October (''Deireadh Fómhair'') translate directly as "middle of harvest" and "end of harvest".  Christianity has also left its mark on the Irish months: the name for December (''Nollaig'') derives from Latin ''natalicia'' (birthday), referring to the birth of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Wiktionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical texts{{which|date=January 2015}} suggest that, during Ireland's [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic era]], the day began and ended at [[sunset]].&lt;ref name="Koch 330"&gt;Koch, John T. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia''. ABC-CLIO (2006).

}}The '''Guna''', known as '''Kuna''' prior to an orthographic reform in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://m.prensa.com/impresa/opinion/Guna-kuna-cuna-James-Howe_0_3874112623.html | title = Lenguaje – ¿Guna, kuna o cuna?: James Howe | trans-title = Language – Guna, kuna or cuna?: James Howe | author = | language = Spanish | date = 22 February 2014 | work = [[La Prensa (Panama City)|La Prensa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and historically as '''Cuna''', are an indigenous people of [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]]. The Congreso General de la Nación Gunadule since 2010 promotes the spelling '''Guna'''.  In the [[Kuna language]], they call themselves ''Dule'' or ''Tule'', meaning "people", and the name of the language in Kuna is ''Dulegaya'', literally "people-mouth".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Erice | first = Jesus | title = Diccionario de la Lengua Kuna | publisher = Impresora La Nacion (INAC) | year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Guna live in three politically autonomous ''[[comarca]]s'' or reservations in [[Panama]], and in a few small [[village]]s in [[Colombia]]. There are also communities of Kuna people in [[Panama City]], [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], and other cities. The most Gunas live on small islands off the coast of the ''comarca'' of [[Kuna Yala]] known as the [[San Blas Islands]]. The other two Guna ''comarcas'' in Panama are [[Kuna de Madugandí]] and [[Kuna de Wargandí]]. They are Guna speaking people who once occupied the central region of what is now Panama and the neighboring San Blas Islands and still survive in marginal areas.

==Political and social organization==
In Guna Yala, each community has its own political organization, led by a saila (pronounced "sigh-lah"). The saila is traditionally both the political and religious leader of the community; he memorizes songs which relate the sacred history of the people, and in turn transmits them to the people. Decisions are made in meetings held in the Onmaked Nega, or Ibeorgun Nega (Congress House or Casa de Congreso), a structure which likewise serves both political and spiritual purposes. It is in the Onmaked Nega that the saila sings the history, legends and laws of the Guna, as well as administering the day-to-day political and social affairs. The saila is usually accompanied by one or more voceros who function as interpreters and counselors for the saila. Because the songs and oral history of the Guna are in a higher linguistic register with specialized vocabulary, the saila's recitation will frequently be followed by an explanation and interpretation from one of the voceros in informal Guna language.

Traditionally, Guna families are [[matrilinear]], with the groom moving to become part of the bride's family. The groom takes the last name of the bride as well.

Today there are forty-nine communities in [[Kuna Yala]]. The region as a whole is governed by the Guna General Congress, which is led by three Saila Dummagan ("Great Sailas").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congresogeneralkuna.org/Nuestras_autoridades.htm| deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218065701/http://www.congresogeneralkuna.org/Nuestras_autoridades.htm | archive-date = 18 February 2007 | title = Nuestras Autoridades de Kuna Yala | trans-title = Our Authorities of Kuna Yala | website = Comarca Kuna Yala / Congreso Generales Kunas | date = 12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flag==
[[File:Flag of Kuna Yala.svg|thumb|left|The flag of the Kuna Yala community.]]
The [[Guna Swastika flag]] was adopted after the 1925 rebellion against Panamanian suppression. Horizontal stripes have a proportion of 1:2:1 and the central [[swastika]] is an ancestral symbol called Naa Ukuryaa. According to one explanation, it symbolizes the four sides of the world or the origin from which peoples of the world emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paseandoteporelperuyelmundo.blogspot.hr/2013_05_05_archive.html|work=paseandote por el peru...y el mundo| title = Segunda parte de mi Viaje a Panamá:El Mundo de los Gunas; Capítulo I , Historia y Organización Política – El Mundo de los Gunas – Historia y Organización Política, Parte 1 | trans-title = Second part of my Trip to Panama: The World of the Gunas; Chapter I, History and Political Organization – The World of the Gunas – History and Political Organization, Part 1 | language = Spanish | date = May 10, 2013 |accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the flag of Guna Yala island today, the flag is used for the province of San Blas and also as the Kuna ethnic flag. The central stripe, meaning peace and purity, is white on the official flag of the reservation, officially adopted by Guna National Congress, while yellow stripe is used on the ethnic flag (it was introduced on the flag at about 1940). In 1942 the flag was modified with a red ring encompassing the center of the swastika because of [[Nazi]] associations; the ring was later abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/flags/pa-nat.html|title=Panama - Native Peoples| date = 22 May 2014 | website= Flags Of The World | publisher = CRW Flags Inc. |accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The Guna are famous for their bright ''[[Mola (art form)|molas]],'' a colorful textile art form made with the techniques of [[appliqué]] and reverse appliqué.  Mola panels are used to make the blouses of the Kuna women's [[national dress]], which is worn daily by many Guna women.  ''Mola'' means "clothing" in the Kuna language.  The Guna word for a ''mola'' blouse is ''Tulemola,'' (or "dulemola") "Kuna people's clothing."

==Economy==
[[File:KunaWomanSellingMolas.jpg|thumb|left|A Guna woman selling molas in [[Panama City]].]]
[[File:Dugout in San Blas Islands.jpg|thumb|A Guna man, fishing in a hand-built dugout canoe.]]
The economy of [[Kuna Yala]] is based on agriculture, fishing and the manufacture of clothing with a long tradition of international trade.  Plantains, coconuts, and fish form the core of the Guna diet, supplemented with imported foods, a few domestic animals, and wild game. [[Coconut]]s, called ''ogob'' [IPA: okˑɔβ] in the Kuna language, and lobsters ''skungit'' (skuŋkˑit) are the most important export products. Migrant labor and the sale of ''[[Mola (art form)|molas]]'' provide other sources of income.

The Guna have a long deep rooted history of mercantilism and a longstanding tradition of selling goods through family owned venues. Most imported goods originate from [[Colombia]]n, Mexican or Chinese ships and are sold in small retail stores owned by Guna people. The Guna traditionally excise no tax when trading goods and place strong emphasis on economic success. This tradition of trade and self-determination has been credited by many as a chief reason why the Guna have been able to successfully function independently compared to other indigenous groups.

Guna communities in Panama City are typically made up of migrant laborers and small business owners, although many Kuna also migrate to Panama City to sell fish and agricultural products produced by their respective communities. The sale of Mola and other forms of Guna art has become a large part of the Guna peoples economy in recent years and mola vendors can be found in most cities in Panama where they are marketed to both foreigners and Hispano Panamanians. Tourism is now an important part of the economy in the [[Carti region]], and abandoned goods from the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]] provide occasional windfalls.

==History==
[[File:Cabañas Guna Yala.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary traditional Guna houses in the Guna Yala built on stilts over shallow coastal marshes]]

The Gunas were living in what is now Northern Colombia and the Darién Province of Panama at the time of the Spanish invasion, and only later began to move westward towards what is now Guna Yala due to a conflict with the Spanish and other indigenous groups. Centuries before the conquest, the Gunas arrived in South America as part of a [[Chibchan]] migration moving east from Central America.  At the time of the Spanish invasion, they were living in the region of Uraba and near the borders of what are now [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and [[Caldas Department|Caldas]]. [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] explored the coast of Colombia in 1500 and 1501. They spent the most time in the [[Gulf of Urabá]], where they made contact with the Gunas.

In far Eastern Guna Yala, the community of New Caledonia is near the site where Scottish explorers tried, unsuccessfully, to establish a [[Darien scheme|colony in the "New World"]]. The bankruptcy of the expedition has been cited as one of the motivations of the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Acts of Union]].

There is a wide consensus regarding the migrations of Gunas from Colombia and the Darien towards what is now Guna Yala. These migrations were caused partly by wars with the [[Catio people]], but some sources contend that they were mostly due to bad treatment by the Spanish invaders. The Guna themselves attribute their migration to Guna Yala to conflicts with the aboriginal peoples, and their migration to the islands to the excessive mosquito populations on the mainland.

During the first decades of the twentieth century, the Panamanian government attempted to suppress many of the traditional customs. This was bitterly resisted, culminating in a short-lived yet successful revolt in 1925 known as the [[Kuna Yala#History|Dule Revolution]] (or "people revolution") – led by Iguaibilikinya Nele Kantule of Ustupu and supported by American adventurer and part-time diplomat [[Richard Marsh (diplomat)|Richard Marsh]]&lt;ref name=Howe1998&gt;{{cite book | first = James | last = Howe | title = A people who would not kneel: Panama, the United States, and the San Blas Kuna | series = Smithsonian Series in Ethnographic Inquiry | publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-1-56098-890-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and a treaty in which the Panamanians agreed to give the Guna some degree of cultural autonomy.&lt;ref name=Howe1998 /&gt;

==Language==
[[File:Panama-Kuna 0605a.jpg|thumb|The Guna have been staunchly resistant to Hispanic assimilation, largely retaining their dress and language in migrant communities throughout Panama.]]
The [[Kuna language]] is a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal American]] language of the [[Chibchan]] family spoken by 50,000 to 70,000 people. Dulegaya is the primary language of daily life in the ''comarcas,'' and the majority of Guna children speak the language. Although it is relatively viable, Guna is considered an endangered language.

Spanish is also widely used, especially in education and written documents.  

==Health==
The Guna have been shown to have a low average blood pressure (B.P., 110/70&amp;nbsp;mm Hg), and, do not experience the age-related increase in blood pressure that is common in Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hollenberg | first1 = Norman K. | last2 = Martinez | first2 = Gregorio | last3 = McCullough | first3 = Marji | last4 = Meinking | first4 = Terri | last5 = Passan | first5 = Diane | last6 = Preston | first6 = Mack | last7 = Rivera | first7 = Alicio | last8 = Taplin | first8 = David | last9 = Vicaria-Clement | first9 = Maureen | title = Aging, Acculturation, Salt Intake, and Hypertension in the Kuna of Panama | journal = Hypertension | year = 1997 | volume = 29 | pages = 171-176 | url = http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/hypertensionaha/29/1/171.full.pdf | pmid = 9039098 | doi = 10.1161/01.HYP.29.1.171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Death rates from cardiovascular disease (C.V.D.) and cancer – the #1 and #2 causes of death in the U.S. – are low in the Guna.  Between 2000 and 2004 on the mainland of Panama, for every 100,000 residents, 119 died from C.V.D. and 74 died from cancer; in contrast, per 100,000 Guna, these death rates were 8 for C.V.D. and 4 for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bayard | first1 = V | last2 = Chamorro | first2 = F | last3 = Motta | first3 = J | last4 = Hollenberg | first4 = NK | title = Does flavanol intake influence mortality from nitric oxide-dependent processes?

[[File:Howard League for Penal Reform Canterbury logo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Howard League for Penal Reform Canterbury logo.]]
The '''[http://www.howardleague.org.nz/ Howard League for Penal Reform Canterbury]''' is an organisation based in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, that lobbies for [[prison reform]] and works in Canterbury prisons. It is based on the British [[Howard League for Penal Reform]].

The Howard League was formed by Blanche Baughan and two others in 1924, to fight for a fair and justice penal system.  She noted, in a dictated piece written in the 1950s:

''The New Zealand Howard League for Penal Reform was started in 1924 in Christchurch by three people all convinced of the need.  One soon resigned, but the others carried on and got information from the Howard League in England.
''
''We began to hold meetings and to be well scoffed at, and badly reported in the newspapers – the name Howard being interpreted as that of E.J. Howard, M.P., a prominent Labourite. By 1928, however, we had managed to get groups interested in other centres and emphasised the fact that the League was for penal reform, and that we were not an ‘aftercare society’, though the Prisons Board wanted us to be. We affiliated ourselves to the English League and began at last to get sensible notices from the Press.''

''Teething troubles quickly began and how our baby League managed to weather them I hardly know; but we had a few faithful members and survived a war, a slump, hostility from the authorities, contempt from some of the public and complete indifference from most of it.  We went on writing letters to the Press, taught it how to spell the strange words “psychology” and “psychiatry” and gradually convinced people that we were not a set of sentimental softies, but were seriously asking for less mass treatment, more individual attention to prisoners and altogether a more scientific approach to crime and criminals. We also convinced our Courts that compared with figures obtained from England they were too freely sending to Borstal and prison, instead of making proper use of the newer methods of probation of which New Zealand was still very shy. Prison libraries were much improved through our activities, prison concerts and lectures more freely allowed in conjunction with the WEA.  We urged the establishment and training of women police, proper understanding and care of the mentally crippled (which we had not yet got) in spite of the 1928 Mental Hospitals Amendment Act, and perhaps most important of all, kept on discovering bit by bit and exposing the pretences and shame that covered much of our real penal system and lulled our people into believing that it was really efficient.''

''The League has certainly in these ways gradually educated New Zealand towards accepting the much better policy introduced in the last few years by our present Controller General of Prisons and Under Secretary of Justice.''

''We have always, of course, advocated the abolition of Capital Punishment and it was the League that initiated the success agitation against the hanging of the three Nuie Islanders recently convicted.''

''We have never been very numerous, but we can claim at least to have been faithful to maintaining the continuity of our aims" (cited from upcoming book on NZ Howard League.''

The League was active in Christchurch from 1924 to 1974, and over the years a number of people were prominent in the organisation.  One involved from the start until his death was Charles (C.R.N.) Mackie, also known for his pacifist work (see citation in [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]], that does not mention Mackie's key role in the early years of the Howard League). Later, [[Lincoln Efford]] was among the leading lights of the organisation.

The Howard League in Canterbury fronted many attempts to improve the penal system in New Zealand.  The anti-flogging, anti-capital punishment stance also included a push towards 'scientific' methods of prison reform, including a rehabilitative approach, psychological assessments of prisoners and humane treatment. After the war, all Howard League branches were involved with ex-conscientious objectors in advertising the conditions in NZ prisons.

Once the hardline Controller of Prisons, [[Berkeley Dallard]], retired in 1951, the prison system began a long process of reform. The Howard League got more voice, and by the 1960s the Canterbury Branch had largely run out of steam, as so many of its proposals were introduced.  However, almost as soon as it folded, things started deteriorating again, and the Auckland Branch remained the lone voice for many years.

The Canterbury branch was relaunched by Kathie Dunstall MNZM in February 1998 to work on reform of the [[prison|penal system]] and especially to fight against the huge increase in prison numbers.  Fact sheets on the prison system and regular newsletters were sent out to a large national mailing list of around 500 names.  The Canterbury Branch has, more recently, assisted in setting up new branches in Wellington and Dunedin.  As the title 'New Zealand Howard League for Penal Reform' has been taken over by an Auckland group, the new branches have reformed as the National Coalition of Howard Leagues (inc).

The '''Igala''' are an ethnic group of Nigeria. Their homeland, the former [[Igala Kingdom]], is an approximately triangular area of about 14,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the angle formed by the [[Benue River|Benue]] and [[Niger (river)|Niger]] rivers. The area was formerly the Igala Division of [[Kabba]] province, and is now part of [[Kogi State]]. The capital is [[Idah]].{{r|fid|ob}}

==History==

{{Why|&lt;ref&gt;Angulu (1981) An Igbo Civilization: Nri Kingdom and Hegemony Hardcover – 1 Apr 1981 by M.Angulu Onwuejeogwu
&lt;/ref&gt;|date=October 2018}}
The first "Ata", the title given to the ruler of the kingdom, was Ebule- Jonu, a woman; she was succeeded by her brother Agana- Poje, the father of Idoko. Idoko would later succeed him as Ata, and had two children Atiyele and Ayegba om'Idoko (Ayegba son of Idoko), Atiyele the first son of Idoko migrated eastward of the kingdom to establish Ankpa kingdom while Ayegba the second son of Idoko succeeded his father as Ata'Gala. He led a war against the Jukun, which resulted in victory. Idakwo Micheal was appointed as the new Ata in December 2012.[1]

The ata-ship of Igala rotated among four branches of the royal clan. [[Igala Kingdom]] was founded by Abutu- Eje in the 7th century. The kingdom was ruled by nine high officials called the Igala Mela who are custodians of the sacred Earth shrine.

Igala colonisation of northern [[Igbo people|Igbo]] states (1450-18th century)

The Igala mega state attained the height of its fame during the mid-17th century. The rise of the Igala mega state disrupted and contributed to the shift of the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]] from the Bight of Benin to the [[Bight of Biafra]] and the decline of the [[Benin]] Empire between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Idah-Benin war (1515-1516) was a war of mutual independence. The Igala state reached its political and commercial supremacy afterwards, when it became a leading exporter of choral beads, horses, medicine, skills and of course, slaves to the coastal region. Its growing power, nevertheless, changed the dynamics of the earlier complex relationships with several northern [[Igbo people|Igbo]] communities. Joseph Hawkins in 1797 already captured the relentless raiding of the extreme northern [[Igboland]] by the Igalas. In his “A History of a Voyage to the Coast of Africa” he noted the growing conflicts between the 'Ebo Country' and 'Galla'. By the late 17th century, the Igalas conquered and held socio-economic, political and religious control of the indigenous northern Igbo mini-states. From [[Opi (archaeological site)]], [[Nsukka]], Nsugbe, several Igbo communities on the [[Anambra River]], the lower Niger, through Okpanam to Asaba the Igala held sway. Trading out post with Onitsha and the Ijo middlemen were fully established. The mythical Omeppa, Inenyi Ogugu set up garrison at [[Opi (archaeological site)]] and several Igala warlords played their part in the buildup of the Igala colonial take over of these northern [[Igbo people|Igbo]] states. But no other individual played a greater role in shaping Igala-Igbo colonisation during the 18th century than Onoja Oboni, the legendary Igala warrior and slave trader. Onoja Oboni’s personality and heritage has been shrouded in mythical imagery over time. Ranging from being the Son of Eri, the grandson of Aganapoje to being a descendant of one of the Idah royal families; the priestly sub-clan of Obajeadaka in Okete-ochai-attah. The key areas of consensus are; he was a master strategist, slave raider and trader, conqueror, coloniser and imperialist. Added to these were his diplomacy, expansionist traits and the acculturation of conquered territories. He built himself a walled city in Ogurugu and recent archaeological findings of the remnant of the ruins of his fort on the grounds of the [[University of Nigeria Nsukka]] confirm this. The Igala soldiers built forts and fortifications that stretched from Ete down to [[Opi (archaeological site)]] and then to Anambra. Oboni’s rise to power affected the history of the North-western Nsukka and the Igbo communities on the [[Anambra River]] and the Lower Niger during the Igala commercial and socio-cultural ascendancy and domination. This was the reinforcing of the golden age of Igala imperial expansion. In this way, Igala mega state took control and allegiance were paid. Until the decline of Igala power, the Ezes of [[Enugu-Ezike]], Akpugo, Nkpologu, Ibagwa Ani and Opi continued to receive their titles from Idah; investiture, installation and confirmation of their office was only by the royal blessing of Attah Igala in Idah. The [[Eze]] were only validated when they returned home with Igala choral beads ‘aka’, staff of office believed to be imbued with protective charms to ensure longevity and security of the Eze as well as prestige animal (horse) to bolster up their ego. There were also periodic royal visits to the Attah Igala to pay tributes and as well intended to strengthen diplomatic ties and inter-group relations, renew allegiance, and assured insurance from slave raids. In terms of indigenous technologies, the Igala soldiers built factories (forges) for manufacturing Dane-guns, ironworks, carving, introduced arrowheads with tip-poison from sting ray; cloth knitting, terracing of [[Nsukka]] hillsides and brought in a well developed political and social hierarchies. At this time Igala empire had become a cultural exchange hub for other emerging states; the influence was felt as far north as the Nok civilisation and down east to [[Igbo-Ukwu]] civilisation. Till date many of the Igala-Nsukka borderland remain bilingual. On the religious level, the Igala installed their own priests- the Attama- as the custodian of the dangerous [[Alusi]], shrine, took control as mediators between the spirit and the Igbo communities, presided over divinations and fashioned ‘Ikenga’, ‘Okwute’ (ritual staffs) that combined both Igala and Igbo religious elements. The Attama thus became the major agents of Igala socio-cultural control. Several efforts to keep the Attama lineage Igala failed, eventually the priestly office has been greatly igbonized, even though the nominal Igala identification is still predominant. Many of the northern Igbo state settlements have lineages with Igala names, cultural practices with marked Igala modification and adaptations. The use of Igala circular basket in contrast to the Igbo rectangular types persists till this day. By the turn of the 19th century, the Igala empire was too large for any reliable and robust central control. Internal decay and implosion set in. The Fulani jihadists started contracting the Igala imperial power, conquered territories in the north switched tributes, forced or/and seceded from the Igala empire. The Bassa war added more pressure to the war-weary empire. The abolition of slave trade brought in untold economic recession. In 1914 the British burnt down Ibagwa and Obukpa as a punitive measure. By the 1920s, Igala empire was a spent force and a limping shadow, the British easily took over control of both Nsukka and the Igala territories.[2]

A large body of research indicates that [[intelligence]] measures such as [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) varies between [[individual]]s and between certain groups, and that they correlate with socially important outcomes such as educational [[Achievement test|achievement]], [[employment]], [[crime]], [[poverty]] and [[socioeconomic status]].

In the [[United States]], certain [[public policy|public policies]] and [[law]]s regarding employment, military service, education and crime incorporate IQ or similar measurements. Internationally, certain public policies, such as improving nutrition and prohibiting [[neurotoxic]] toxins, have as one of their goals raising or preventing a decline in intelligence.

In the early 20th century, [[eugenics]] legislation was passed in many US states which allowed, or encouraged, [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]] of "[[feeble-minded]]" individuals.

In the 1927 case ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'', Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] closed the 8-1 majority opinion upholding the sterilization of [[Carrie Buck]], who along with her mother and daughter was labeled "feeble-minded", with the infamous phrase, "Three generations of imbeciles are enough."

[[Eugenics]] fell out of favor in the middle part of the century and is now widely denounced, though memories of the period continue to influence [[public policy]].

=== Education ===
[[Cognitive test]] scores predict educational performance better than they predict any other outcome, and cognitive testing is pervasive in academics. Central policy issues concern the proper role of testing in assessing educational quality and in college admission; efforts to characterize and close the educational [[achievement gap]] between racial and socioeconomic groups in the US; and the importance of cognitive ability differences in educational [[affirmative action]].

The existence of educational achievement gaps between racial and socioeconomic groups is broadly accepted; the source and stability of the gaps{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} remain areas of active research and debate. The [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001 (NCLB) is aimed explicitly at reducing achievement gaps by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.ed.gov/nclb/accountability/achieve/achievement_aa.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Federally defined formulas in NCLB call for elimination of all achievement disparity by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/chi-0211130369nov13,0,6024748.story | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Topic Galleries – chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the source of the gap, most educators agree that it must be addressed. They often advocate equitable funding for education.&lt;ref name="kirwaninstitute.org"&gt;[http://www.kirwaninstitute.org/publications/presentations/2006_09_23%20Battle%20Creek%20Education.ppt Achieving Equitable Education in Calhoun County]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326993es4001_5 Educational Studies: A Jrnl of the American Educ. Studies Assoc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] interpreted state and federal statutes to require that IQ Tests not be used in a manner that was determinative of tracking students into classes designed for the mentally retarded. ''[[Larry P. v. Riles]]'', 793 F.2d 969 (9th Cir. 1984). The court specifically found that the tests involved were designed and standardized based on an all-white population, and had not undergone a legislatively mandated validation process. In addition, the court ruled that predictive validity for a general population is not sufficient, since the rights of an individual student were at issue, and emphasized that had the tests not been treated as controlling but instead used as part of a thorough and individualized assessment by a school psychologist a different result would have been obtained. In September 1982, the judge in the ''Larry P.'' case, Federal District Judge Robert F. Peckham, relented in part in response to a lawsuit brought by black parents who wanted their children tested. The parents' [[Lawyer|attorney]], Mark Bredemeier, said his clients viewed the modern [[special education]] offered by [[California]] schools today as helpful to children with learning disabilities, not a dead-end track, as parents contended in the original 1979 ''Larry P.'' case.

A major area of controversy regarding the [[NCLB]] Act is whether achievement gaps are the result of "the soft bigotry of low expectations"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; or reflect real cognitive ability differences between groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Gottfredson|Gottfredson, L. S.]] (2005). "Implications of cognitive differences for schooling within diverse societies". In C. L. Frisby &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), ''Comprehensive Handbook of Multicultural School Psychology''. New York: Wiley (2005), {{ISBN|0-471-26615-9}}. [http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2004cognitivedifferences&amp;schooling.pdf pre-print PDF] [http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2005cognitivediversity.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Act includes warnings and funding consequences for schools which do not meet performance goals, whether disparate student performance is due primarily to environment (which is perceived to be under substantial school and teacher control) or to genetics (which is perceived to be far less malleable) has become a crucial issue.

[[Gifted education]] and [[special education]] programs aim to provide tailored instruction to students with especially high or low ability. Research in both civilian and [[military]] training has demonstrated that [[Intelligence (trait)|bright]] individuals learn 2-5 times faster than their less able peers.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfredson, L. S. (2006). Social consequences of group differences in cognitive ability (Consequencias sociais das diferencas de grupo em habilidade cognitiva). In C. E. Flores-Mendoza &amp; R. Colom (Eds.), Introducau a psicologia das diferencas individuais (pp. 433-456). Porto Alegre, Brazil: ArtMed Publishers. [http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2004socialconsequences.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===
One summary of the relationship between employment policy and [[IQ testing]] is provided by Murphy (2002):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cognitive ability tests represent the best single predictor of job performance, but also represent the predictor most likely to have substantial adverse impact on employment opportunities for members of several racial and ethnic minority groups. Debates over the use of these tests in selection often involve trade-offs between two criteria that are valued by decision makers&amp;nbsp;– that is, efficiency and equity. Findings and methods from decision research can help us frame these trade-offs, but in most cases they cannot be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, K.M., Can Conflicting Perspectives on the Role of ''g'' in Personnel Selection Be Resolved? ''Human Performance,'' 15(1&amp;2):173-186 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the late twentieth century, on the basis of studies showing widely varying [[validity (psychometric)|validities]] for personnel selection techniques, the theory of "situational specificity" held sway. This principle holds that each organization, work setting and job is unique, requiring unique employee characteristics or skills, and that selection on any general ability yields little benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, E.A., ed., ''The Blackwell Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior'', Blackwell Publishers (2000), {{ISBN|0-631-21505-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the development of statistical techniques such as [[meta-analysis]] allowed large samples to be assembled from smaller studies, revealing that apparent validity variations reflected statistical artifacts.  Re-analysis, and subsequent studies, have established that general mental ability (IQ) predicts job performance across all jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, J.E. and Hunter, R.F. (1984).  Validity and utility of alternate predictors of job performance. ''Psychological Bulletin,'' 96(1):72-98.&lt;/ref&gt;  The validity of IQ varies most notably with job complexity: IQ matters little for simple jobs such as packing, and a great deal in complex jobs such as medicine.

These findings have major significance. For example, racial groups differ in average performance on mental ability tests: East Asians on average score higher than Whites, who on average score higher than Blacks (see [[Race and intelligence]] for a more thorough discussion). Race-blind hiring on the basis of cognitive test score, among the best predictors of job performance, tends to lead to under-representation of some racial groups in favor of others, a [[phenomenon]] called "adverse impact" or "disparate impact" in employment law. (In contrast, "disparate treatment" refers to deliberate [[discrimination]].)

In 1971, in the case ''[[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]]''[http://finduslaw.com/griggs_v_duke_power_co_1971_401_us_424_91_s_ct_849],&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=401&amp;invol=424 FindLaw for Legal Professionals&amp;nbsp;– Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Supreme Court]] handed down a seminal ruling which framed US public policy on adverse impact. ''Griggs'' concerned a company which had rejected a large number of Black applicants who either lacked a high-school education or performed poorly on a paper-and-pencil cognitive test. Referring to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] [http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21], the Court wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. The [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] is business necessity.  If an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] generally prohibits employment practices that are unfair or discriminatory. One provision of Title VII, codified at 42 USC 2000e-2(h), specifically provides that it is not an "[[employment discrimination|unlawful employment practice]] for an employer to give and to act upon the results of any professionally developed ability test provided that such test, its administration or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin." This statute was interpreted by the Supreme Court in ''[[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]]'', 401 US 424 (1971).  In ''Griggs'', the Court ruled that the reliance solely on a general IQ test that was not found to be specifically relevant to the job at issue was a discriminatory practice where it had a "disparate impact" on hiring.  The Court gave considerable weight in its ruling to an [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] regulation interpreting Section 2002e-2(h)'s reference to a "professionally developed ability test" to mean "a test which fairly measures the knowledge or skills required by the particular job or class of jobs which the applicant seeks, or which fairly affords the employer a chance to measure the applicant's ability to perform a particular job or class of jobs." In other words, the use of any particular test would need to be shown to be relevant to the particular job or class of jobs at issue.

In 1989, the US Supreme Court decision in ''[[Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=490&amp;invol=642 FindLaw for Legal Professionals&amp;nbsp;– Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; reduced the defendant's burden of proving business necessity to a burden of producing evidence of business justification. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] overturned that portion of the ''Wards Cove'' decision.

These decisions added a legal dimension to trade-offs between "efficiency and equity" referenced by Murphy. Though cognitive testing is generally inexpensive, reliable and valid, US employers risk expensive legal action if such testing produces disparate impact.  In practice, companies have responded with a variety of strategies, from abandonment of cognitive testing to maintenance of racial hiring quotas. The latter derives from enforcement of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'s "four-fifths rule", which states that any group selection rate that is less than four-fifths (80%) of the highest rate will be regarded by Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniformguidelines.com/uniformguidelines.html#18 Uniform Employee Selection Guidelines Questions and Answers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to formulate a test with reliability and validity equal to cognitive testing, but that does not produce disparate impact, have generally failed.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfredson, L. S. (2005).

=== Military service ===
All US military recruits take the Armed Forces Qualification Test, an intelligence test that strongly measures the [[general intelligence factor]].  A recruit's cognitive test scores in part determine the professions available to him or her.

Problems in training low-IQ military recruits during [[World War II]] led the [[US Congress]] to ban [[enlistment]] from the lowest 10% (below IQ 80) of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfredson, L. S. (1998). The [[general intelligence factor]]. ''Scientific American Presents,'' 9(4):24-29. [http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1998generalintelligencefactor.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because people with IQs below 80 (the 10th percentile, [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] "Category V") are difficult to train, federal law bars their induction into the military. As of 2005, only 4 percent of the recruits were allowed to score as low as in the 16th to 30th percentile, a grouping known as "Category IV" on the U.S. Armed Forces' mental-aptitude exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Crime ===
In its 2002 ruling on the case ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', the [[US Supreme Court]] outlawed the execution of mentally retarded criminals on the grounds that it constituted cruel and unusual [[punishment]], which is prohibited by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|8th Amendment]]. The designation of mental retardation (or [[Developmental Disability|developmental disability]]) typically requires a measured IQ below 70 or 75.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has utilized IQ test results during the [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] phase of some criminal proceedings. The Supreme Court case of ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', decided June 20, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html
|title=Daryl Renard Atkins, Petitioner v. Virginia
|accessdate=August 6, 2006
|date=June 20, 2002
|author=
|publisher=
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
held that executions of [[mentally challenged]] criminals are "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]s" prohibited by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. In ''Atkins'' the court stated that

:"...[I]t appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard to the mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided ''Penry''. The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it."

In overturning the Virginia Supreme Court's holding, the ''Atkins'' opinion stated that petitioner's IQ result of 59 was a factor making the imposition of capital punishment a violation of his eighth amendment rights. In the opinion's notes the court provided some of the facts relied upon when reaching their decision{{quote|At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: "Atkins' full scale IQ is 59. Compared to the population at large, that means less than one percentile.... Mental retardation is a relatively rare thing. It's about one percent of the population." App. 274. According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins' IQ score "would automatically qualify for Social Security disability income." Id., at 280. Dr. Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capital defendants that he had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individual who met the criteria for mental retardation. Id., at 310. He testified that, in his opinion, Atkins' limited intellect had been a consistent feature throughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an "aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score." Id., at 308.}}

Individuals with IQs below 70 have been essentially exempted from the death penalty in the U.S. since 2002, even though this cannot be definitely confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social security ===
The [[Social Security Administration]] also uses IQ results when deciding [[Social Security Disability Insurance|disability]] claims.  In certain cases, IQ results alone are used (in those cases where the result shows a "full scale IQ of 59 or less") and in other cases IQ results are used along with other factors (for a "full scale IQ of 60 through 70") when deciding whether a claimant qualifies for Social Security Disability benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/12.00-MentalDisorders-Adult.htm

== Race issues ==
{{Main|Heritability of IQ#Between-group heritability}}
Public policy implications of IQ and race research are one of the greatest sources of controversy surrounding [[race and intelligence]] research. Regardless of the source of the IQ gap, most educators agree that it must be addressed; they often advocate more equitable funding for education.&lt;ref name="kirwaninstitute.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326993es4001_5 Educational Studies: A Journal of the American Educational Studies Association]&lt;/ref&gt; An [[achievement gap]] refers to the observed disparity in the performance of groups of students, primarily in those defined by race or [[ethnicity]], in educational measures such as standardized test scores, [[grade point average]], [[Dropping out|dropout]] rates and course enrollment and completion rates.

Some proponents of a genetic interpretation of the IQ gap, such as Rushton and Jensen (2005a) and Gottfredson (2005b), have sometimes argued that their interpretation does not in itself demand any particular policy response: while a conservative commentator&lt;ref&gt;For example, the policy recommendations of ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' were denounced by many.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Herrnstein and Murray (1994) wrote: "We can imagine no recommendation for using the government to manipulate fertility that does not have dangers. But this highlights the problem: The United States already has policies that inadvertently social-engineer who has babies, and it is encouraging the wrong women. ''If the United States did as much to encourage high-IQ women to have babies as it now does to encourage low-IQ women, it would rightly be described as engaging in aggressive manipulation of fertility.'' The technically precise description of America's fertility policy is that it subsidizes births among poor women, who are also disproportionately at the low end of the intelligence distribution. We urge generally that these policies, represented by the extensive network of cash and services for low-income women who have babies, be ended. (p. 548)"

Two year later the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|1996 U.S. welfare reform]] substantially cut these programs. In a discussion of the future political outcomes of an intellectually stratified society, they stated that they: "fear that a new kind of conservatism is becoming the dominant ideology of the affluent&amp;nbsp;– not in the social tradition of an [[Edmund Burke]] or in the economic tradition of an [[Adam Smith]] but ’conservatism’ along Latin American lines, where to be conservative has often meant doing whatever is necessary to preserve the mansions on the hills from the menace of the slums below. (p. 518) "Moreover, they fear that an increasing welfare will create a "custodial state": "a high-tech and more lavish version of the [[Indian reservation]] of some substantial minority of the nation’s population. They also predict increasing totalitarianism: It is difficult to imagine the United States preserving its heritage of individualism, equal rights before the law, free people running their own lives, once it is accepted that a significant part of the population must be made permanent wards of the states. (p. 526)"&lt;/ref&gt; may feel the results justify, for example, reductions in [[affirmative action]], a [[Liberalism|liberal]] commentator may argue from a [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] point of view (that genetic advantages are undeserved and unjust) for substantial affirmative action.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfredson 2005b&lt;/ref&gt; Since all races have representatives at all levels of the IQ curve, this means any policy based on low IQ affects members of all races.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In the book ''[[Practical Ethics]]'', philosopher [[Peter Singer]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Let us suppose that the genetic hypothesis turns out to be correct... I believe that the implications of this supposition are less drastic than they are often supposed to be...
First, the genetic hypothesis does not imply that we should reduce our efforts to overcome other causes of inequality between people... Perhaps we should put special efforts into helping those who start from a position of disadvantage, so that we end with a more egalitarian result.
Second, the fact that the average IQ of one racial group is a few points higher than that of another does not allow anyone to say that all members of the higher IQ group have higher IQs... The point is that these figures are averages and say nothing about individuals...
The third reason... is simply that, as we saw earlier, the principle of equality is not based on any actual equality that all people share. I have argued that the only defensible basis for the principle of equality is equal consideration of interests... Equal status does not depend on intelligence. Racists who maintain the contrary are in peril of being forced to kneel before the next genius they encounter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Differences in health care, nutrition, regulation of environmental toxins, and geographic distribution of diseases and control strategies between the developing world and developed nations have all been subjects of policies or policy recommendations (see [[Impact of health on intelligence|Health and intelligence]]).

Crawford's daughter Christina, in the biography ''[[Mommie Dearest]]'' ([[1978 in literature|1978]]), states "1904" twice:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Publicly, her birth date was reported as March 23, 1908, but Grandmother told me that she was actually born in 1904."&lt;ref name="Dearest"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christina Crawford|title=Mommie Dearest|year=1979|publisher=Berkley|isbn=978-0-425-04444-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"My mother was born Lucille LeSueur in San Antonio, Texas, in 1904, although when she came to Hollywood, she lied about her age and changed the year to 1908."&lt;ref name="Dearest"/&gt;{{rp|66}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} – May 10, 1977) was an American actress who began her career as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting as a chorus girl on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], Crawford signed a motion picture contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1925. 

In the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled, and later outlasted, that of MGM colleagues [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Greta Garbo]]. Crawford often played hard-working young women who find romance and success. These characters and stories were well received by [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era audiences, and were popular with women. Crawford became one of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]'s most prominent movie stars, and one of the highest-paid women in the United States, but her films began losing money, and, by the end of the 1930s, she was labeled "[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]". However, her career gradually improved in the early 1940s, and she made a major comeback in 1945 by starring in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She would go on to receive Best Actress nominations for ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) and ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952). Crawford continued to act in film and television throughout the 1950s and 1960s; she achieved box office success with the highly successful [[horror film]] ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?]]'' (1962), in which she starred alongside [[Bette Davis]], her long-time rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/fx-feud-joan-crawford-bette-davis-oscars|title=Fact-Checking Feud: Joan Crawford and Bette Davis's 1963 Oscar Showdown|last=Miller|first=Julie|work=HWD|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Crawford became involved with the [[PepsiCo|Pepsi-Cola Company]] through her marriage to company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [[Alfred Steele]]. After his death in 1959, Crawford was elected to fill his vacancy on the board of directors, serving until she was forcibly retired in 1973. After the release of the British horror film ''[[Trog]]'' in 1970, Crawford retired from the screen. Following a public appearance in 1974, after which unflattering photographs were published,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Crawford withdrew from public life, and became increasingly reclusive until her death in 1977.&lt;ref name="Spoto2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Spoto|title=Possessed: The Life of Joan Crawford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouUt6jGDAhgC|date=3 February 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-8811-2|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford married four times. Her first three marriages ended in divorce; the last ended with the death of husband Alfred Steele. She adopted five children, one of whom was reclaimed by his birth mother. Crawford's relationships with her two elder children, [[Christina Crawford|Christina]] and Christopher, were acrimonious. Crawford disinherited the two, and, after Crawford's death, Christina wrote a well-known "tell-all" memoir, ''[[Mommie Dearest]]'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Day|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film|title=I'll never forgive Mommie: Joan Crawford's daughter gives first interview in 10 years|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born Lucille Fay LeSueur, of [[English people|English]], [[French Huguenot]], [[Swedes|Swedish]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry, in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], she was the third and youngest child of [[Tennessee]]-born Thomas E. LeSueur (January 2, 1868 – January 1, 1938, who died on the day before his 70th birthday), a [[laundry]] laborer, and [[Texas]]-born Anna Bell Johnson (later Mrs. Anna Cassin), whose year of birth is given as November 29, 1884, although, based on census records, she may have been older. She apparently was still under 20 when her first two children were born. She died on August 15, 1958.&lt;ref name="Bret2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bret|title=Joan Crawford: Hollywood Martyr|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cf2gT2bRG8C&amp;pg=PA1|year=2009|publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7867-3236-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford's elder siblings were sister Daisy LeSueur, who died before Lucille's birth, and brother [[Hal LeSueur]].&lt;ref name="QuirkSchoell2013c"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence J.

Crawford's father abandoned the family a few months before her birth, re-appearing in 1930 in [[Abilene, Texas]], reportedly working as a construction laborer.&lt;ref name="QuirkSchoell2013c"/&gt; Following LeSueur's departure from the family home, Crawford's mother married Henry J. Cassin. The marriage is listed in the census as Crawford's mother's first marriage.&lt;ref name="spoto"/&gt; Crawford lived with her mother, stepfather, and siblings in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]. There, Cassin, a minor impresario, ran the Ramsey Opera House; he managed to book diverse and noted performers such as [[Anna Pavlova]] and [[Eva Tanguay]]. At that time, Crawford was reportedly unaware that Cassin, whom she called "daddy", was not her biological father until her brother Hal told her the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Newquist, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Cassin allegedly began sexually abusing her when she was eleven years old, and the abuse continued until she was sent to St. Agnes Academy, a Catholic girls' school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Caitlin Gallagher|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/joan-crawfords-story-about-having-sex-with-her-stepfather-on-feud-raises-serious-concerns-44813|title=Joan Crawford's Story About Having Sex With Her Stepfather On 'Feud' Raises Serious Concerns|newspaper=[[The Bustle]]|accessdate=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford preferred the nickname "Billie" as a child, and enjoyed watching [[vaudeville]] acts perform on the stage of her stepfather's theatre. Her family's instability negatively affected Crawford, and her schooling never formally progressed beyond primary education.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Denby, David, "Escape Artist, The Case for Joan Crawford", ''The New Yorker'', January 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in childhood, Crawford's ambition was to be a dancer. One day, however, in an attempt to escape piano lessons so she could play with friends, she leapt from the front porch of her home and cut her foot severely on a broken milk bottle.&lt;ref name="Knowles20093"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Knowles|title=The Wicked Waltz and Other Scandalous Dances: Outrage at Couple Dancing in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAzP__xv7CkC&amp;pg=PA233|year=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5360-3|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, she underwent three surgeries to repair the damage. She was unable to attend elementary school, or continue with dancing lessons, for 18 months.&lt;ref name="Knowles20093"/&gt;

While still residing in Lawton, Crawford's stepfather was accused of embezzlement. Although he was acquitted in court, he was blacklisted in Lawton, and the family moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], around 1916.&lt;ref name="spoto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spoto|first=Donald|title=Possessed – the Life of Joan Crawford|year=2010|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-185600-6|pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their relocation, Cassin, a Catholic, placed Crawford at St. Agnes Academy in Kansas City. When her mother and stepfather separated, she remained at St. Agnes as a work student, where she spent far more time working, primarily cooking and cleaning, than studying.&lt;ref name="QuirkSchoell2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence J. Quirk|author2=William Schoell|title=Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skmnEUj3C84C&amp;pg=PA3|year=2013|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-4411-6|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later attended Rockingham Academy, also as a working student.&lt;ref name="QuirkSchoell2013"/&gt; While attending there, she began dating, and had her first serious relationship with a trumpet player named Ray Sterling. Sterling reportedly inspired her to begin challenging herself academically.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
[[File:Joancrawford1crop.jpg|alt=Upper body studio shot of a young Crawford in a sleeveless dress, with accented eye make-up, coiffed hair. She is staring into the camera.|upright|thumb|Joan Crawford in 1928]]
Under the name Lucille LeSueur, Crawford began dancing in the choruses of traveling revues, and was spotted dancing in [[Detroit]] by producer [[Jacob J. Shubert]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Shubert put her in the chorus line for his 1924 show, ''Innocent Eyes'', at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] in New York City. While appearing in ''Innocent Eyes'', Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were allegedly married in 1924, and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford.&lt;ref name=considine12&gt;Considine, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford wanted additional work, and approached [[Loews Theaters]] publicist [[Nils Granlund]]. Granlund secured a position for her with singer [[Harry Richman]]'s act and arranged for her to do a screen test which he sent to producer [[Harry Rapf]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="Granlund"&gt;Granlund, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Rapf notified Granlund on December 24, 1924, that [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) had offered Crawford a contract at $75 a week. Granlund immediately wired LeSueur, who had returned to her mother's home in Kansas City, with the news; she borrowed $400 for travel expenses.&lt;ref name="movie contract"&gt;Granlund, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Credited as Lucille LeSueur, her first film was ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' in 1925, as the [[body double]] for MGM's most popular female star, [[Norma Shearer]]. She also appeared in ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' and ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (both 1925), starring comedian [[ZaSu Pitts]]. This was soon followed by equally small and [[Billing (filmmaking)|unbilled]] roles in two other 1925 successes - ''[[The Only Thing]]'' and ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Spoto|title=Possessed: The Life of Joan Crawford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouUt6jGDAhgC|date=3 February 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-8811-2|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MGM publicity head [[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith]] recognized her ability to become a major star, but felt her name sounded fake; he told studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]] that her last name, LeSueur, reminded him of a sewer. Smith organized a contest called "Name the Star" in ''Movie Weekly'' to allow readers to select her new stage name. The initial choice was "Joan Arden", but, after another actress was found to have prior claim to that name, the alternate surname "Crawford" became the choice. Crawford later said that she wanted her first name to be pronounced "Jo-Anne", and that she hated the name Crawford because it sounded like "craw fish", but also admitted she "liked the security" that went with the name.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, quoted in Newquist, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-promotion, and early successes===
Growing increasingly frustrated over the size and quality of the parts she was given, Crawford embarked on a campaign of self-promotion. As MGM screenwriter [[Frederica Sagor Maas]] recalled, "No one decided to make Joan Crawford a star. Joan Crawford became a star because Joan Crawford decided to become a star."&lt;ref&gt;Maas, quoted in LaSalle, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; She began attending dances in the afternoons and evenings at hotels around Hollywood, where she often won dance competitions with her performances of the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] and the [[Black Bottom (dance)|Black Bottom]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Crawford-Gilbert-1928.JPG|thumb|upright|With [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] in the film ''[[Four Walls (film)|Four Walls]]'' (1928)]]
Her strategy worked, and MGM cast her in the film where she first made an impression on audiences, [[Edmund Goulding]]'s ''[[Sally, Irene and Mary]]'' (1925). From the beginning of her career, Crawford considered [[Norma Shearer]] - the studio's most-popular actress - her professional nemesis. Shearer was married to MGM Head of Production [[Irving Thalberg]]; hence, she had the first choice of scripts, and had more control than other stars in what films she would and would not make. Crawford was quoted to have said: "How can I compete with Norma? She sleeps with the boss!"&lt;ref name="Donnelley2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Donnelley|title=Fade to Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qAhtNiAl3YsC&amp;pg=PA632|year=2003|publisher=Omnibus|isbn=978-0-7119-9512-3|page=632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Crawford was named one of the [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]], along with [[Mary Astor]], [[Dolores del Río]], [[Janet Gaynor]], and [[Fay Wray]], among others. That same year, she starred in ''[[Paris (1926 film)|Paris]]'', co-starring [[Charles Ray (actor)|Charles Ray]]. Within a few years, she became the romantic female lead to many of MGM's top male stars, including [[Ramón Novarro]], [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[William Haines]], and [[Tim McCoy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Crawford appeared in ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]'' (1927), starring [[Lon Chaney|Lon Chaney, Sr.]], who played a carnival knife thrower with no arms. Crawford played his skimpily-clad young carnival assistant whom he hopes to marry. She stated that she learned more about acting from watching Chaney work than from anyone else in her career. "It was then", she said, "I became aware for the first time of the difference between standing in front of a camera, and acting." Also in 1927, she appeared alongside her close friend, [[William Haines]], in ''[[Spring Fever (1927 film)|Spring Fever]]'', which was the first of three movies the duo made together.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, quoted in LaSalle, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, quoted in Skal, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Crawford starred opposite [[Ramón Novarro]] in ''[[Across to Singapore]]'', but it was her role as Diana Medford in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled [[Clara Bow]], the original It girl, then Hollywood's foremost [[flapper]]. A stream of hits followed ''Our Dancing Daughters'', including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.&lt;ref name="BeanNegra2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jennifer M. Bean|author2=Diane Negra|title=A Feminist Reader in Early Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhupLl59fI8C&amp;pg=PA235|date=21 November 2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-2999-9|pages=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] wrote of Crawford:&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, quoted in Thomas, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|text=Joan Crawford is doubtless the best example of the flapper, the girl you see in smart night clubs, gowned to the apex of sophistication, toying iced glasses with a remote, faintly bitter expression, dancing deliciously, laughing a great deal, with wide, hurt eyes. Young things with a talent for living.}}
On June 3, 1929, Crawford married [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], at [[Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church]] (known as "The Actors' Chapel", owing to its proximity to Broadway theatres) in Manhattan, although neither was Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joan Crawford Weds in the East|work=Jefferson City MO Daily Capital News|date=June 4, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairbanks was the son of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and the stepson of [[Mary Pickford]], who were considered Hollywood royalty. Fairbanks, Sr., and Pickford were opposed to the marriage, and did not invite the couple to their home, [[Pickfair]], for eight months after the marriage.&lt;ref name="Bret2009"/&gt;

The relationship between Crawford and Fairbanks, Sr., eventually warmed; she called him "Uncle Doug", and he called her "Billie", her old childhood nickname. She and Pickford, however, continued to despise each other.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Following that first invitation, Crawford and Fairbanks, Jr., became more frequent guests. While the Fairbanks men played golf together, however, Crawford was either left with Pickford, who would retire to her quarters, or simply left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

To rid herself of her [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], Crawford tirelessly practiced diction and elocution. She said:&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, quoted in Thomas, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|text=If I were to speak lines, it would be a good idea, I thought, to read aloud to myself, listen carefully to my voice quality and enunciation, and try to learn in that manner. I would lock myself in my room and read newspapers, magazines and books aloud. At my elbow, I kept a dictionary. When I came to a word I did not know how to pronounce, I looked it up and repeated it correctly fifteen times.}}

===Transition to sound, and continued success===
[[File:Joan Crawford 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Crawford in 1932]]
After the release of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' in 1927&amp;mdash;the first feature-length film with some audible dialog&amp;mdash;[[Sound film|sound films, or talkies]], as they became nicknamed, were all the rage. The transition from silent to sound panicked many, if not all, involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents, or simply because of their refusal to make the transition to talkies.

Many studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last studio to switch over to sound. ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'' was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to make the transition from silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song "Got a Feeling for You" during the film's first act.

Crawford made a successful transition to talkies. Her first starring role in an all-talking feature-length film was in ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), co-starring [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]. Despite the success of the film at the box office, it received mixed reviews from critics, who noted that while Crawford seemed nervous at making the transition to sound, she had become one of the most popular actresses in the world.&lt;ref name="Roar72"&gt;{{citation|last1=Háy|first1=Peter|authorlink=Peter Háy (Canadian author, publisher and bookseller)|title=MGM: When the Lion Roars|year=1991|publisher=Turner Publishing, Inc.|location=Atlanta|isbn=1-878685-04-X|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' [[Montana Moon]]'' (1930), an uneasy mix of Western clichés and music, teamed her with [[John Mack Brown]] and [[Ricardo Cortez]]. Although the film had problems with censors, it was a major success at the time of its release. ''[[Our Blushing Brides]]'' (1930), co-starring Robert Montgomery and [[Anita Page]], was the final installment in the so-called ''Our Dancing Daughters'' franchise. Her next movie, ''[[Paid (1930 film)|Paid]]'' (1930), paired her with [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]], and was another success. During the early sound era, MGM began to place Crawford in more sophisticated roles, rather than continuing to promote her flapper-inspired persona of the silent era.&lt;ref&gt;Leese, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, MGM cast Crawford in five films. Three of them teamed her opposite the studio's biggest male star and "King of Hollywood", [[Clark Gable]]. ''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]'', released in February 1931, was the first pairing of Crawford and Gable. Their second movie together, ''[[Laughing Sinners]]'', released in May 1931, was directed by [[Harry Beaumont]], and also co-starred [[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]]. ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'', their third film together, released in October, was directed by [[Clarence Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quirk|first1=Lawrence J.|last2=Schoell|first2=William|title=Joan Crawford, The Essential Biography|date=2013|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-4411-6|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; These films were immensely popular with audiences, and were generally well received by critics, stapling Crawford's position as one of MGM's top female stars of the decade, along with [[Norma Shearer]], [[Greta Garbo]], and [[Jean Harlow]]. Her only other notable film of 1931, ''[[This Modern Age]]'', was released in August, and, despite unfavorable reviews, was a moderate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='This (So Called) Modern Age' at the Capitol, "The Screen"|author=Dickstein, Martin|work=Brooklyn (New York) Daily Eagle|page=22, columns 1–2|date=September 8, 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Joan Crawford Wallace Beery Grand Hotel.jpg|left|thumb|With [[Wallace Beery]] in ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932)]]
MGM next cast her in the film ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'', directed by [[Edmund Goulding]]. As the studio's first [[all-star]] production, Crawford co-starred opposite Greta Garbo, [[John Barrymore|John]] and [[Lionel Barrymore]], and [[Wallace Beery]], among others. Receiving third billing, she played the middle-class stenographer to Beery's controlling general director. Crawford later admitted to being nervous during the filming of the movie because she was working with "very big stars", and that she was disappointed that she had no scenes with the "divine Garbo". ''Grand Hotel'' was released in April 1932 to critical and commercial success. It was one of the highest-grossing movies of the year, and won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].&lt;ref name="Robbe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Robbe|title=Metamorphosis of Hollywood Filmmaking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unAuTJMcMiwC&amp;pg=PA45|date=June 2008|publisher=[[Lulu, Inc.

Crawford achieved continued success in ''[[Letty Lynton]]'' (1932). Soon after this movie's release, a plagiarism suit forced MGM's withdrawal and it's therefore considered the "lost" Crawford film. Designed by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], the gown with large ruffled sleeves which Crawford wore in the movie became a popular style that same year, and was even copied by [[Macy's]].&lt;ref name="Snodgrass2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Ellen Snodgrass|title=World Clothing and Fashion: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Social Influence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gO9nBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45167-9|pages=387–388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On loan to [[United Artists]], she played prostitute Sadie Thompson in ''[[Rain (1932 film)|Rain]]'' (1932), a film version of [[John Colton (screenwriter)|John Colton]]'s 1923 play. Actress [[Jeanne Eagels]] played the role on stage, and [[Gloria Swanson]] had originated the part on screen in the [[Sadie Thompson|1928 film version]]. Crawford's performance was panned, and the film was not a success.&lt;ref name="Marmorstein2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Marmorstein|title=A Ship Without A Sail: The Life of Lorenz Hart|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4asAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218|date=16 July 2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4165-9426-0|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the failure of ''[[Rain (1932 film)|Rain]]'', in 1932, the publishing of the first "Top Ten Money-Making Stars Poll" placed Crawford third in popularity at the box office, behind only [[Marie Dressler]] and [[Janet Gaynor]]. She remained on the list for the next several years, last appearing on it in 1936. In May 1933, Crawford divorced Fairbanks. Crawford cited "grievous mental cruelty", claiming Fairbanks had "a jealous and suspicious attitude" toward her friends, and that they had "loud arguments about the most trivial subjects" lasting "far into the night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time Magazine|date=March 8, 1933|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,745463,00.html|accessdate=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grand-Hotel-Beery-Crawford-cropped.jpg|thumb|With [[Wallace Beery]] in ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932)]]
Following her divorce, she was again teamed with Clark Gable, along with [[Franchot Tone]] and [[Fred Astaire]], in the hit ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), in which she received top billing. She next played the title role in ''[[Sadie McKee]]'' (1934), opposite Tone and [[Gene Raymond]]. She was paired with Gable for the fifth time in ''[[Chained (1934 film)|Chained]]'' (1934), and for the sixth time in ''[[Forsaking All Others]]'' (1934). Crawford's films of this era were some of the most-popular and highest-grossing films of the mid-1930s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1935, Crawford married Franchot Tone, a stage actor from New York who planned to use his film earnings to finance his theatre group. The couple built a small theatre at Crawford's Brentwood home, and put on productions of classic plays for select groups of friends.&lt;ref&gt;Considine, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Tone and Crawford had first appeared together in ''[[Today We Live]]'' (1933), but Crawford was hesitant about entering into another romance so soon after her split from Fairbanks.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and during their marriage, Crawford worked to promote Tone's Hollywood career, but Tone was ultimately not interested in being a movie star, and Crawford eventually wearied of the effort.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; After Tone reportedly began drinking and became physically abusive, she filed for divorce, which was granted in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Considine, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford and Tone much later rekindled their friendship, and Tone even proposed in 1964 that they remarry. When he died in 1968, Crawford arranged for him to be cremated and his ashes scattered at [[Muskoka Lakes]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford continued her reign as a popular movie actress well into the mid-1930s. ''[[No More Ladies]]'' (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head [[Louis B. Mayer]] to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama ''[[I Live My Life]]'' (1935), directed by [[W.S. Van Dyke]], and it was well received by critics.

She next starred in ''[[The Gorgeous Hussy]]'' (1936), opposite [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and Lionel Barrymore, as well as Tone. It was a critical and box office success, and became one of Crawford's biggest hits of the decade. ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), a romantic comedy directed by [[W.S. Van Dyke]], was her seventh film co-starring Clark Gable. It was, at the time of its release, called "a lot of happy nonsense" by critics, but a financial success nonetheless.

==="Box Office Poison"===
[[File:Joan Crawford in The Last of Mrs Cheyney trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Crawford as Mrs. Fay Cheyney for ''[[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937 film)|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney]]'' (1937)]]
Even though Crawford remained a respected MGM actress, and her films still earned profits, her popularity declined in the late 1930s. In 1937, Crawford was proclaimed the first "Queen of the Movies" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. She unexpectedly slipped from seventh to sixteenth place at the box office that year, and her public popularity also began to wane.&lt;ref name="Thomas, p. 113"&gt;Thomas, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Boleslawski]]'s comedy-drama ''[[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937 film)|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney]]'' (1937) teamed her opposite [[William Powell]] in their sole screen pairing. The film was also Crawford's last box-office success before the onset of her "Box Office Poison" period.

She co-starred opposite Franchot Tone for the seventh&amp;mdash;and final&amp;mdash;time in ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937). The film was generally unfavorably reviewed by the majority of critics. It also ran a financial loss, becoming one of MGM's biggest failures of the year. ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' did, as the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated, "restore Crawford to her throne as queen of the working girls". Most other reviews were positive, and the film managed to generate a minor profit, but it did not resurrect Crawford's popularity.&lt;ref name="Thomas, p. 113"/&gt;
[[File:Crawford+tone 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Joan Crawford and her second husband, actor [[Franchot Tone]], 1936]]
On May 3, 1938, Crawford&amp;mdash;along with Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, [[Luise Rainer]], John Barrymore, [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Dolores del Río]], and others&amp;mdash;was dubbed "[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]" in an open letter in the ''Independent Film Journal''. The list was submitted by Harry Brandt, president of the Independent Theatre Owners Association of America. Brandt stated that while these stars had "unquestioned" dramatic abilities, their high salaries did not reflect in their ticket sales, thus hurting the movie exhibitors involved. Crawford's follow-up movie, ''[[The Shining Hour]]'' (1938), co-starring [[Margaret Sullavan]] and [[Melvyn Douglas]], was well received by critics, but it was a box office flop.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

She made a comeback in 1939 with her role as home-wrecker Crystal Allen in ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'', opposite her professional nemesis, Norma Shearer. A year later, she played against type in the unglamorous role of Julie in ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), her eighth&amp;mdash;and final&amp;mdash;film with Clark Gable. She later starred as a facially disfigured blackmailer in ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' (1941), a remake of the Swedish film ''[[A Woman's Face (1938 film)|En kvinnas ansikte]]'' which had starred [[Ingrid Bergman]] in the lead role three years earlier. While the film was only a moderate box office success, Crawford's performance was hailed by many critics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Crawford adopted her first child, a daughter, in 1940. Because she was single, California law prevented her from adopting within the state; so, she arranged the adoption through an agency in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The child was temporarily called Joan, until Crawford changed her name to [[Christina Crawford|Christina]]. Crawford married actor [[Phillip Terry]] on July 21, 1942, after a six-month courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joan Crawford Weds Actor Phillip Terry|work=Lubbock (TX) Morning Avalanche|page=11|publisher=UP|date=July 22, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the couple adopted a son whom they named Christopher, but his birth mother reclaimed the child. The couple adopted another boy, whom they named Phillip Terry, Jr. After the marriage ended in 1946, Crawford changed that child's name to Christopher Crawford.

After eighteen years, Crawford's contract with MGM was terminated by mutual consent on June 29, 1943. In lieu of the last film remaining under her contract, MGM bought her out for $100,000.

===Move to Warner Bros.===
For $500,000, Crawford signed with [[Warner Bros.]] for a three-movie deal, and was placed on the payroll on July 1, 1943. Her first film for the studio was ''[[Hollywood Canteen (film)|Hollywood Canteen]]'' (1944), an all-star morale-booster film that teamed her with several other top movie stars at the time. Crawford said one of the main reasons she signed with Warner Bros. was because she wanted to play the character "Mattie" in a proposed 1944 film version of [[Edith Wharton]]'s novel ''[[Ethan Frome]]'' (1911).
[[File:Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Crawford in the trailer for ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945)]]
She wanted to play the title role in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945), but [[Bette Davis]] was the studio's first choice. However, Davis turned the role down. Director [[Michael Curtiz]] did not want Crawford to play the part, and he instead lobbied for the casting of [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Warner Bros. defied Curtiz, and cast Crawford in the film. Throughout the entire production of the movie, Curtiz criticized Crawford. He reportedly told [[Jack L. Warner]], "She comes over here with her high-hat airs and her goddamn shoulder pads... Why should I waste my time directing a has-been?"&lt;ref&gt;Curtiz, quoted in Thomas, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test; she agreed. After the test, Curtiz agreed to Crawford's casting. ''Mildred Pierce'' was a resounding critical and commercial success. It epitomized the lush visual style and the hard-boiled [[film noir]] sensibility that defined Warner Bros. movies of the late forties, earning Crawford the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Julie|title=The Academy Award That Joan Crawford Accepted in Bed Sells; Can You Guess for How Much?|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/09/joan-crawford-academy-award-auction|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=December 23, 2014|date=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Mildred Pierce'' revived Crawford's movie career. For several years, she starred in what were called "a series of first-rate [[melodrama]]s". Her next film was ''[[Humoresque (film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), co-starring [[John Garfield]], a romantic drama about a love affair between an older woman and a younger man. She starred alongside [[Van Heflin]] in ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947), for which she received a second Academy Award nomination, although she did not win. In ''[[Daisy Kenyon]]'' (1947), she appeared opposite [[Dana Andrews]] and [[Henry Fonda]], and in ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), her character has an ultimately deadly feud with a corrupt southern sheriff played by [[Sydney Greenstreet]]. She made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[It's a Great Feeling]]'' (1949), poking fun at her own screen image. In 1950, she starred in the film noir ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' and in the melodrama ''[[Harriet Craig]]''.

After the completion of ''[[This Woman Is Dangerous]]'' (1952), a film Crawford called her "worst", she asked to be released from her Warner Bros. contract. By this time, she felt Warners was losing interest in her, and she decided it was time to move on.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Later that same year, she received her third&amp;mdash;and final&amp;mdash;Academy Award nomination for ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' for [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. In 1953, she appeared in her final film for MGM, ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]''. The movie received favorable reviews, and moderate success at the box office.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In 1947, Crawford adopted two more children, whom she named Cindy and Cathy.

===Radio and television===
Crawford worked in the radio series ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' on January 8, 1939; ''Good News''; ''Baby'', broadcast March 2, 1940, on [[Arch Oboler]]'s ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]''; ''The Word'' on ''[[Everyman's Theater]]'' (1941); ''Chained'' on the ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', and [[Norman Corwin]]'s ''Document A/777'' (1948). She appeared in episodes of anthology television series in the 1950s, and, in 1959, made a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for ''The Joan Crawford Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1056952162|title=Encyclopedia of Unaired Television Pilots, 1945-2018|last=1948-|first=Terrace, Vincent,|isbn=9781476633497|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|oclc=1056952162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Steele and Pepsi-Cola Company===
Crawford married her fourth&amp;mdash;and final&amp;mdash;husband, [[Alfred Steele]], at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo Hotel]] in Las Vegas on May 10, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joan Crawford Is Wed in Las Vegas to Businessman|work=Moberly (MO) Monitor-Index and Democrat|page=8|agency=Associated Press|date=May 10, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford and Steele met at a party in 1950, when Steele was an executive at [[PepsiCo]]. They renewed their acquaintance at a New Year's Eve party in 1954. By that time, Steele had become President of [[PepsiCo|Pepsi-Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; He would later be named Chairman of the Board and CEO of Pepsi-Cola. Crawford traveled extensively on behalf of Pepsi following the marriage. She estimated that she traveled over 100,000 miles for the company.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Steele died of a heart attack in April 1959. Crawford was initially advised that her services were no longer required. After she told the story to [[Louella Parsons]], Pepsi reversed its position, and Crawford was elected to fill the vacant seat on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;Considine, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford received the sixth annual "Pally Award", which was in the shape of a bronze Pepsi bottle. It was awarded to the employee making the most significant contribution to company sales. In 1973, Crawford was forced to retire from the company at the behest of company executive [[Donald M. Kendall|Don Kendall]], whom Crawford had referred to for years as "Fang".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Joan Crawford: the essential biography|last=Quirk|first=Lawrence|author2=Schoell|year=2002|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=0-8131-2254-6|page=312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yQtRavDvtUC&amp;pg=RA3-PA246&amp;lpg=RA3-PA246&amp;q=fang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===

Mayer was my father, my father confessor, the best friend I ever had", Crawford was quoted as saying.&lt;ref name="Hay, 22"&gt;Hay, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After her Academy Award nominated performance in 1952's ''Sudden Fear'', Crawford continued to work steadily throughout the rest of the decade. After a ten-year absence, she returned to MGM to star in ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'' (1953), a musical drama centering on the life of a demanding stage star who falls in love with a blind pianist, played by [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]]. Although the film was highly publicized as Crawford's major comeback, it was ultimately a critical and financial failure, known today for its [[Camp (style)|camp]] appeal. In 1954, she starred in the cult [[camp (style)|camp]] [[Western (genre)|western film]] classic ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', co-starring [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Mercedes McCambridge]]. She also starred in ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) with [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]], and in ''[[Queen Bee (film)|Queen Bee]]'' (1955), alongside [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]]. The following year, she starred opposite a young [[Cliff Robertson]] in ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956), and filmed a leading role in ''[[The Story of Esther Costello]]'' (1957), co-starring [[Rossano Brazzi]]. Crawford, who had been left near-penniless following Alfred Steele's death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I'm Broke, Says Joan Crawford|work=Jefferson City (MO) Post-Tribune|page=1|agency=Associated Press|date=June 1, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepted a small role in ''[[The Best of Everything (1959 film)|The Best of Everything]]'' (1959). Although she was not the star of the film, she received positive reviews. Crawford would later name the role as being one of her personal favorites. By 1961 Joan Crawford was once again her own publicity machine with a new script, "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", sent by [[Robert Aldrich|Robert Aldrich.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/650442615|title=Bette and Joan : the divine feud|last=Shaun.|first=Considine,|date=2010|publisher=iUniverse.com, Inc|isbn=1450243274|edition=Authors Guild backinprint.com ed|location=Lincoln, NE|oclc=650442615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan Crawford in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane trailer.jpg|alt=Facial shot of a dishevelled Crawford on the telephone.|right|thumb|Crawford as [[Blanche Hudson]] in ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]
Crawford starred as Blanche Hudson, an elderly, disabled former [[A-list]] movie star who lives in fear of her psychotic sister [[Baby Jane Hudson|Jane]], in the highly successful psychological thriller ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962). Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested [[Bette Davis]] for the role of Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them. The director, [[Robert Aldrich]], fueling publicity rumors, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers, and commented, "It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly."&lt;ref&gt;Considine, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

After filming was completed, their public comments against each other propelled their animosity into a lifelong feud. The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within eleven days of its nationwide release reviving Davis and Crawford's careers. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford contacted each of the other Oscar nominees in the category ([[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Geraldine Page]], and [[Anne Bancroft]], all East Coast-based actresses), to let them know that if they could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed. Both Davis and Crawford were backstage, Crawford having presented best director, when the absent [[Anne Bancroft]] was announced as the winner, and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf. Davis claimed for the rest of her life that Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

That same year, Crawford starred as Lucy Harbin in [[William Castle]]'s horror mystery ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964). [[Robert Aldrich]] cast Crawford and Davis in ''[[Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte|Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964). After a purported campaign of [[harassment]] by Davis on location in [[Louisiana]], Crawford returned to Hollywood entering a hospital. After a prolonged absence, during which Crawford was accused of feigning illness, Aldrich was forced to replace her with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. Crawford devastated, said, "I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed ... I cried for nine hours."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford nursed grudges against Davis and Aldrich for the rest of her life, saying of Aldrich, "He is a man who loves evil, horrendous, vile things", to which Aldrich replied, "If the shoe fits, wear it, and I am very fond of Miss Crawford".&lt;ref&gt;Considine, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being replaced, brief footage of Crawford made it into the film, when she is seen sitting in a taxi in a wide shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K_40HXjkKw|title=The References: "Feud" Episode 7 + "Hush...

[[File:Joan Crawford Night Gallery 1969.JPG|left|thumb|alt=|Crawford in ''[[Night Gallery (film)|Night Gallery]]'' (1969)]]
In 1965, she played Amy Nelson in ''[[I Saw What You Did]]'', another William Castle vehicle. She starred as Monica Rivers in [[Herman Cohen]]'s horror thriller film ''[[Berserk!]]'' (1967). After the film's release, Crawford guest-starred as herself on ''[[The Lucy Show]]''. The episode, "Lucy and the Lost Star", first aired on February 26, 1968. Crawford struggled during rehearsals, and drank heavily on-set, leading series star [[Lucille Ball]] to suggest replacing her with [[Gloria Swanson]]. However, Crawford was letter-perfect the day of the show, which included dancing the Charleston, and received two standing ovations from the studio audience.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1968, Crawford's 29-year-old daughter, Christina (who was then acting in New York on the [[CBS]] soap opera ''[[The Secret Storm]]''), needed immediate medical attention for a ruptured ovarian tumor. Despite the fact that Christina's character was a 28-year-old, and Crawford was in her sixties, Crawford offered to play her role until Christina was well enough to return, to which producer [[Gloria Monty]] readily agreed.&lt;ref name="joan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Windeler|first=Robert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/23/archives/joan-crawford-takes-daughters-soap-opera-role.html|title=Joan Crawford Takes Daughter's Soap Opera Role|website=nytimes.com|date=1968-10-23|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crawford's appearance in the 1969 television film ''[[Night Gallery (film)|Night Gallery]]'' (which served as pilot to the series that followed) marked one of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s earliest directing jobs. Crawford made a cameo appearance as herself in the first episode of the [[situation comedy]] ''[[The Tim Conway Show (1970 TV series)|The Tim Conway Show]]'', which aired on January 30, 1970. She starred on the big screen one final time, playing Dr. Brockton in Herman Cohen's science fiction horror film ''[[Trog]]'' (1970), rounding out a career spanning 45 years and more than 80 motion pictures. Crawford made three more television appearances, including one as Stephanie White in a 1970 episode ("The Nightmare") of ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKOJL6lrHQI|title=Joan Crawford In "The Virginian" Part 1 of 8|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Joan Fairchild (her final performance) in a 1972 episode ("Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death") of ''[[The Sixth Sense (TV series)|The Sixth Sense]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIrPtI_uD_Q|title=Joan Crawford on The Sixth Sense|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
In 1970, Crawford was presented with the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] by [[John Wayne]] at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], which was telecast from the Coconut Grove at [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|The Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles. She also spoke at Stephens College, where she had been a student for two months in 1922.&lt;ref name="Considine2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaun Considine|title=Bette &amp; Joan: The Divine Feud|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhT-DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT347|date=25 January 2017|publisher=Graymalkin Media|isbn=978-1-63168-107-3|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford published her autobiography, ''A Portrait of Joan'', co-written with [[Jane Ardmore|Jane Kesner Ardmore]], in 1962 through [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]. Crawford's next book, ''My Way of Life'', was published in 1971 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. Those expecting a racy tell-all were disappointed, although Crawford's meticulous ways were revealed in her advice on grooming, wardrobe, exercise, and even food storage. Upon her death, there were found in her apartment photographs of [[John F. Kennedy]], for whom she had voted in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, Peter. ''Joan Crawford: The Enduring Star'' (Rizzoli Universe Promotional Books, March 8, 2011), pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1973, Crawford moved from apartment 22-G to a smaller apartment next door (22-H) at the Imperial House, 150 East 69th Street. Her last public appearance was made on September 23, 1974, at a book party cohosted with her old friend [[Rosalind Russell]] at New York's [[Rainbow Room]]. Russell was suffering from [[breast cancer]] and [[arthritis]] at the time. When Crawford saw the unflattering photos that appeared in the papers the next day, she said, "If that's how I look, then they won't see me anymore."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Considine, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford cancelled all public appearances, began declining interviews, and left her apartment less and less. Dental-related issues, including surgery which left her needing round-the-clock nursing care, plagued her from 1972 until mid-1975. While on [[antibiotics]] for this problem in October 1974, her drinking caused her to pass out, slip, and strike her face. Whether it was this incident or her return to religion, [[Christian Science]], she quit drinking in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Joan Crawford: The Last Years|author=Carl Johnnes|isbn=0-440-11536-1|publisher=Dell Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
On May 8, 1977, Crawford gave away her beloved [[Shih Tzu]], "Princess Lotus Blossom", being too weak to care for her.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford died two days later at her New York apartment of a [[myocardial infarction]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Joan Crawford Dies at Home; Joan Crawford, Screen Star, Dies in Manhattan Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0323.html|work=New York Times|date=May 11, 1977|accessdate=2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A funeral was held at [[Campbell Funeral Home]], New York, on May 13, 1977. In her will, which was signed on October 28, 1976, Crawford bequeathed to her two youngest children, Cindy and Cathy, $77,500 each from her $2 million estate.

She explicitly disinherited the two eldest, Christina and Christopher: "It is my intention to make no provision herein for my son, Christopher, or my daughter, Christina, for reasons which are well known to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joancrawfordbest.com/willtext.htm |title=Joan Crawford's Last Will and Testament}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of them challenged the will and received a $55,000 settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46617003|title=The Hollywood book of death : the bizarre, often sordid, passings of more than 125 American movie and TV idols|last=Robert.|first=Parish, James|date=2002|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=0809222272|location=Chicago|oclc=46617003}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also bequeathed nothing to her niece, Joan Lowe (1933–1999; born Joan Crawford LeSueur, the only child of her estranged brother, Hal). Crawford left money to her favorite charities: the USO of New York, the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Home]], the [[American Cancer Society]], the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]], the [[American Heart Association]], and the Wiltwyck School for Boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/03/crawford200803# "Daughter Dearest"], March 2008, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], she was a member of [[American Women's Voluntary Services]].&lt;ref name="The Essential Biography" /&gt;

A memorial service was held for Crawford at All Souls' Unitarian Church on Lexington Avenue in New York on May 16, 1977, and was attended by, among others, her old Hollywood friend [[Myrna Loy]]. Also attending were Joan's costars [[Geraldine Brooks (actress)|Geraldine Brooks]] and [[Cliff Robertson]] who gave eulogies while [[Pearl Bailey]] sang "He'll Understand." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46617003|title=The Hollywood book of death : the bizarre, often sordid, passings of more than 125 American movie and TV idols|last=Robert.|first=Parish, James|date=2002|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=0809222272|location=Chicago|oclc=46617003}}&lt;/ref&gt;Another memorial service, organized by [[George Cukor]], was held on June 24 in the [[Samuel Goldwyn Theater]] at the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. Crawford was [[cremated]], and her ashes were placed in a crypt with her fourth — and final — husband, Alfred Steele, in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]], [[Hartsdale, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Crawford has also attracted a [[gay icon|following in the gay community]]. In ''Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography'', author [[Lawrence J.

==''Mommie Dearest''==
{{main|Mommie Dearest}}
In November 1978, Christina Crawford published ''[[Mommie Dearest]]'', which contained allegations that her late adoptive mother was emotionally and physically abusive to Christina and her brother Christopher because she chose to be famous over raising her children. Many of Crawford's friends and co-workers, including [[Van Johnson]], [[Ann Blyth]], [[Myrna Loy]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Cesar Romero]], [[Gary Gray (actor)|Gary Gray]], [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.|Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] (Crawford's first husband), and Crawford's two other younger daughters, Cathy and Cindy, denounced the book, categorically denying any abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Considine, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; But others, including [[Betty Hutton]], [[Helen Hayes]],&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayes|first1=Helen|authorlink1=Helen Hayes|last2=Hatch|first2=Katherine|title=My Life in Three Acts|year=1990|publisher=Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich|isbn=0-15-163695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James MacArthur]] (Hayes' son),&lt;ref name="Redbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;[[Jean Strouse|Strouse, Jean]] (1978).

==In popular culture==
Pictures of Crawford were used in the album artwork of [[The Rolling Stones]] album ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.popsike.com/ROLLING-STONES-EXILE-ON-MAIN-STREET-1972-COC-UK-1st-Press-2LP-Excellent/192027513582.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The feud between Crawford and [[Bette Davis]] is depicted in Shaun Considine's 1989 book, ''[[Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud]]''. It was fueled by competition over film roles, Academy Awards, and [[Franchot Tone]], Davis' co-star in 1935's ''[[Dangerous (film)|Dangerous]]''.&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/02/26/why-bette-davis-and-joan-crawfords-feud-lasted-a-lifetime|title=Why Bette Davis and Joan Crawford's Feud Lasted a Lifetime|first=Robert |last=Rorke|work=[[The New York Post]]|accessdate=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crawford-Davis rivalry is the subject of the 2017 first season of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] [[anthology series|anthology]] television series ''[[Feud (TV series)|Feud]]'', subtitled ''Bette and Joan''.

'''Karelians''' ({{lang-krl|karjalaižet}}) are a [[Baltic Finns|Baltic-Finnic]] ethnic group who are native to the [[Northern Europe|Northern European]] [[historical region]] of [[Karelia]], which is today split between [[Finland]] and [[Russia]].

In Russia, Karelians mostly live in the [[Republic of Karelia]] where there are the designated ethnic group and in other adjacent north-western parts of the country. There are also significant Karelian enclaves in the [[Tver Oblast|Tver]] and [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]] [[oblast]]s, as some Karelians migrated to those areas after the [[Russo-Swedish War of 1656-1658]]. 

In Finland, Karelians traditionally live in the [[Regions of Finland|regions]] of [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] and [[North Karelia|Northern]] and [[South Karelia|Southern Karelia]]. The historic homeland of the Karelians is the [[Karelian Isthmus]], [[Ladoga Karelia]], Olonets Karelia in Russia and the regions of North and Southern Karelia and Savonia in Finland.

==History==
[[Image:National costume from Jääski in Karelia 1900.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Karelian woman wearing national costume]]
The first written mention of Karelia and Karelians occurs in Scandinavian sources. Several old Scandinavian sagas and chronicles refer to Karelia, sometimes as Karjalabotn,&lt;ref&gt;Sögubrot af nokkurum fornkonungum í Dana- ok Svíaveldi&lt;/ref&gt; Kirjalabotnar&lt;ref&gt;Hálfdanar saga Eysteinssonar&lt;/ref&gt; or Kirjaland,&lt;ref&gt;Saga Ólafs hins helga Haraldssonar&lt;/ref&gt; which means that Karelians and Karelia were known to the Vikings as early as the 7th century AD. 
Another mention of Karelians in Scandinavian sources is The Chronicle of Erik.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;The Chronicle of Duke Erik, Chapter 10-The founding of Stockholm&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the Chronicle mentions a Karelian raid to the then notable Swedish town of [[Sigtuna]] in 1187 and its subsequent pillage. This mention of Karelian raids on Sweden in the chronicle is given as the main reason to found [[Stockholm]], the current capital of [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The first mention of Karelians in ancient Russian chronicles dates to 1143 AD&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Chronicle of Novgorod, 1016–1471&lt;/ref&gt; when the Novgorod chronicle mentions that Karelians raided neighbouring [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] (Häme). Ancient Russian chronicles referred to ancient Karelians as Koryela. Until the end of the 13th century, Karelians enjoyed a period of relative independence and self-government. However, as Karelians came in contact with Novgorod some of them started to take part in the Novgorodian internal and external politics. Russian chronicles mention a joint raid of Novgorod and Karelians on Tavastia in 1191. In the 12th century, the Karelian relationship with Novgorod underwent significant changes, from partnership and alliance to gradual dominance by the latter.

In 1227, an attempt was made to convert Karelians to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;The Laurentian Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt; In 1253, Karelians aided Novgorod in its wars with [[Estonians]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1269 AD, the duke of Novgorod prepared a raid against Karelians, but he abandoned his plans as he was advised against it by his councilors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1278, Novgorod made war against Karelians and, according to the chronicle, put Karelian lands "to sword and fire", which significantly reduced Karelian military power.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While Novgorod unsuccessfully tried to subdue Karelians, Sweden achieved its goals over the neighbouring Finnish tribes. The Swedes raided Karelian lands, began to convert the local population to Roman Catholicism and attempted to ensure their complete dominance with the foundation of castles, in 1293 at Vyborg and in 1295 at Kexholm (Käkisalmi in Finnish, Koryela in Russian chronicles), on the sites of ancient Karelian settlements.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; However, Novgorod managed to repel the Swedish attack by capturing and burning down Kexholm Castle. After this, Sweden and Novgorod engaged in the long conflict for rule over the Karelians and their lands.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1314, Karelians rose up against efforts made to convert them to Christianity, according to the Novgorod chronicle. The first rebellion started against Russian Orthodoxy with Käkisalmi captured and the killing of all Christians there. Then the rebellion spread over all Karelian lands, which sufficiently weakened Novgorodian influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1323 AD, Karelians suffered a forceful sundering as Sweden and Novgorod divided Karelian lands and their inhabitants by signing a peace agreement. The agreement transferred governance of all western Karelian lands to Swedish sovereignty, while eastern Karelian lands fell under Novgorodian rule. This sundering started a long process of separation of Karelians into two different halves, with the main difference being religion, as western Karelians became first [[Roman Catholic]] and later [[Lutheran]], while eastern Karelians were converted to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Subsequent wars had Karelians fighting on both sides of the conflict and often against each other. Meanwhile Karelians on the Novgorodian and later Russian side of the border continued to settle northward towards the White Sea. By the late 14th century, Russian Karelians established control over White Karelia and came in conflict with the Norwegians on the peninsula of Kola.

As the struggle for power in the region continued over the next centuries the borderline between Sweden and Russia moved several times with most of the changes happening in Northern Karelia and Kainuu. However, in 1617, the history of Karelians underwent a significant change as Russia ceded to Sweden, along with other territories, the eastern part of the Karelian Isthmus, [[Ladoga Karelia]] and certain parts of Northern Karelia. This meant that the majority of Karelians were again living in one country, yet it did not bring peace to the Karelian people. As Sweden commenced the process of conversion of population of the ceded territories to Lutheran Protestantism, resistance appeared among Old-Believer Orthodox Karelians and neighbouring Orthodox [[Izhorians]].

By the mid 17th century, the tension between the Lutheran Swedish government and Orthodox Karelians led to yet another conflict between Sweden and Russia. From 1656 to 1658, Russian armed forces waged war on Karelian territories and tried to recapture them with the aid of some of the sympathizing local Orthodox population, but after two years of fighting both sides came to a stand-still.

Many of the Karelians who remained Orthodox by 1658 AD were unwilling to remain in Sweden and convert to Lutheranism, which triggered a mass migration of many Orthodox Karelians from these areas into other parts of Russia, some going to the region of [[Tver]] and forming the [[Tver Karelians]] minority, while others moved to the region of Valdai in the Novgorod region and yet others to White Karelia by the White Sea.

As some of the lands in the eastern Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia became partially depopulated Sweden decided to move settlers from [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] to those Karelian lands which resulted in a mixture of local Karelians with Savonians in some areas. However, as Savonians themselves are of Karelian origin, this migration mostly affected local Karelians religiously (as the majority of the population became Lutheran) and to some extent linguistically, but it did not bring major changes to the ethnic map of Karelia.

The next change happened in 1721 as Russia won the great northern war against Sweden (1700–21), which forced Sweden to cede the entire Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia to Russia, with its now mostly Lutheran population. Although there were attempts to convert the local population to Orthodoxy these did not meet with any success.

After Russia conquered the entire Finnish territories in yet another Russo-Swedish war in 1808–09, it was decided to join the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia to the newly formed [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] in 1812, which brought all western Karelians into the same state with Finns, while eastern Karelians remained under independent Russian administration. Although Karelians ended up in the same country the religious difference between eastern and western Karelians remained a dividing factor, which somewhat affected the linguistics but even until the beginning of the 20th century both groups could understand each other. Yet eastern Karelians managed to preserve traditions and folklore better than their western brothers.

As the Grand Duchy of Finland was formed, its inhabitants struggled to properly identify themselves ethnically, some being Finnish, some Swedish and some Karelian. As the Fennoman movement started and the new Finnish nation commenced its forming and shaping process, attempts were made to restore the lost Finnish identity. The process of "finnisation" of Finland started. As part of that process during the 19th century Finnish folklorists including [[Elias Lönnrot]] traveled to different parts of Eastern Karelia to gather folklore and epic poetry. The Orthodox Karelians in North Karelia and Russia were now seen as close brethren or even a sub-group of the Finns. The ideology of ''[[Karelianism]]'' inspired Finnish artists and researchers, who believed that the Orthodox Karelians had retained elements of an archaic, original Finnish culture which had disappeared from Finland. This led to numerous confusions with some claiming that western and eastern Karelians were different nations.

As Finland gained its independence in 1917 the process of "finnisation" continued, but now even eastern Karelians were viewed as part of the Finnish nation. From 1918 to 1922, Finland made several attempts to expand into Eastern Karelia with some support by local Karelians. Several thousands of eastern Karelians migrated to Finland by 1922 from different parts of Eastern Karelia.

After the Winter War, Finland had to cede the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia to the USSR. As the local Karelian population was unwilling to end up under Soviet rule, [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|over 400,000 people were evacuated]] across Finland's new border from the territories that were to be ceded. After the Continuation War (1941–1944), in which Finland temporarily held most of Eastern Karelia, several thousands of Karelians chose to migrate west as Finnish forces retreated.{{fact|date=October 2017}} The Karelians who migrated to Finland in the 20th century were initially Karelian speakers, but due to minor lingual differences and in order to assimilate into the local communities soon adopted the Finnish language after the war. Some of the evacuees later [[immigration|immigrated]], mainly to [[Sweden]], [[Australia]] and [[North America]].

Russian Karelians, living in the Republic of Karelia, are nowadays rapidly being absorbed into the Russian population. This process began several decades ago. For example, it has been estimated that even between the 1959 and 1970 Soviet censuses, nearly 30 percent of those who were enumerated as Karelian by self-identification in 1959 changed their self-identification to Russian 11 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, "Estimating Russification of Ethnic Identity among Non-Russians in the USSR," ''Demography'' 20 (November, 1983): 461–489.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{one source|section|date=March 2017}}
The [[Karelian language]] is closely related to the [[Finnish language]], and by some Finnish and Karelian linguists is viewed as a [[dialect]] of Finnish language. The biggest difference between the two languages is that while Finnish language borrowed many words from Swedish, the same happening with western Karelian dialects, eastern Karelian dialects borrowed many words from Russian, which leads to certain differences and difficulties in understanding one another. There are currently 7 different dialects of what can be classified as dialects of Karelian language: karelian proper, which is spoken in White Karelia in the Russian side of the border; livvi – a dialect spoken in Aunus (Olonets) Karelia. Lyydi – which is spoken in certain areas between Ladoga and Onega lakes.

Tver Karelian – the most archaic dialect spoken by descendants of Karelians that moved to mainland Russia after 1658, North and South Karelian dialects in Finland, which are often classified as dialects of Finnish language but the main difference being that they were developed and spoken by ethnic Karelians living on Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia; the same may be said stated about Savonian dialect, yet it has to be noted that it has originally been developed by Karelians who populated this area. As a significant effort was made in 19th century to develop a common Finnish language Savonian and North and South Karelian dialects are viewed as part of the Finnish language and other dialects are usually viewed as a distinct language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040602001752/http://www.kotus.fi/verkkojulkaisut/julk129/karjalat_kartta1.shtml ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
The majority of Russian Karelians are [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christian]]s. The majority of Finnish Karelians are [[Lutherans]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Demographics==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
[[Image:Karjalan mummot.jpg|thumb|300px|Old Karelian women in [[Sambatuksa]] (Sammatus), Russian Karelia.]]
Significant enclaves of Karelians exist in the [[Tver oblast]] of [[Russia]], [[population transfer|resettled]] after Russia's defeat in 1617 against [[Sweden]] — in order to escape the peril of forced [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Lutheranism]] in Swedish [[Karelia]]. The Russians also promised tax deductions if the Orthodox Karelians migrated there. [[Olonets|Olonets (Aunus)]] is the only city in Russia where the Karelians form a majority (60% of the population).

Karelians have been declining in numbers in modern times significantly due to a number of factors. These include low birthrates (characteristic of the region in general) and especially [[Russification]], due to the predominance of Russian language and culture.

In 1926, according to the census, Karelians only accounted for 37.4% of the population in the Soviet Karelian Republic (which at that time did not yet include territories that would later be taken from Finland and added, most of which had mostly Karelian inhabitants), or 0.1 million Karelians. Russians, meanwhile, numbered 153,967 in Karelia, or 57.2% of the population.

By 2002, there were only 65,651 Karelians in the Republic of Karelia (65.1% of the number in 1926, including the Karelian regions taken from Finland which were not counted in 1926), and Karelians made up only 9.2% of the population in their homeland. Russians, meanwhile, were 76.6% of the population in Karelia. This trend continues to this day, and may cause the disappearance of Karelians as a distinct group.

'''Remarks:''' Ranked by mean estimate which is in brackets. Irreligious includes agnostic, atheist, secular believer, and people having no formal religious adherence. It does not necessarily mean that members of this group don't belong to any religion. Some religions have harmonized with local cultures and can be seen as a cultural background rather than a formal religion. Additionally, the practice of officially associating a family or household with a religious institute while not formally practicing the affiliated religion is common in many countries. Thus, over half of this group is theistic and/or influenced by religious principles, but nonreligious/non-practicing and not true atheists or agnostics.&lt;ref name="adherents.com"/&gt; See ''[[Spiritual but not religious]]''.

===Taoists/Confucianists/Chinese traditional religionists===
As a spiritual practice, Taoism has made fewer inroads in the West than Buddhism and Hinduism. Despite the popularity of its great classics the I Ching and the Tao Te Ching, the specific practices of Taoism have not been promulgated in America with much success;&lt;ref&gt;Occhiogrosso, Peter. ''The Joy of Sects: A Spirited Guide to the World's Religious Traditions''. New York: Doubleday (1996); p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; these religions are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of bigger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. Nonetheless, Taoist ideas and symbols such as Taijitu have become popular throughout the world through Tai Chi Chuan, Qigong, and various martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/taoism/|title=BBC – Religion: Taoism|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikh homeland is the [[Punjab(India)|Punjab]] state, in India, where today Sikhs make up approximately 61% of the population. This is the only place where Sikhs are in the majority. Sikhs have emigrated to countries all over the world – especially to English-speaking and East Asian nations. In doing so they have retained, to an unusually high degree, their distinctive cultural and religious identity.
Sikhs are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of larger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. But they can be found in many international cities and have become an especially strong religious presence in the United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_sikh.html|title=Sikhs|website=Adherents.com|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lithuania]]n [[embassy]] in Poland notes that there are about 15,000 people in Poland of Lithuanian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lietuviai Lenkijoje|url=http://lietuva.pl/index-old.php?language=lt&amp;page=125|website=Embassy of the Republic of Lithuania|accessdate=February 27, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227123932/http://lietuva.pl/index-old.php?language=lt&amp;page=125|archivedate=February 27, 2016|language=Lithuanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lithuanians are an [[indigenous people]] of the territories of north-eastern [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]] in Poland, being the descendants of the various [[Balts|Baltic tribes]] of the region ([[Yotvingians]]), which merged into the Lithuanian ethnicity in the Middle Ages. Poland first{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} acquired its Lithuanian minority after the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, which transferred the administration of the [[Podlaskie Voivodeship (1513–1795)|historical Podlaskie Voivodeship]] from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] to the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Polish Crown]] (both entities then formed a larger, federated state, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]). During the next two centuries, the Lithuanian minority, faced with the dominant [[Polish culture]] in the region, was subject to  [[Polonization]]. After the [[partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the late 18th century, the Polish cultural pressure in the region was replaced by that of the [[Russian Empire]], until the end of the [[First World War]] resulted in the restoration of independent Polish and Lithuanian states.

== 20th century ==
[[File:LitewskiIIRP.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Distribution of Lithuanian speakers in the Second Polish Republic]]
During the [[Interwar period]] of the 20th century (1920–1939) [[Lithuanian-Polish relations]] were characterised by mutual enmity. Starting with the conflict over the city of [[Vilnius]], and the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]] shortly after the [[First World War]], both governments - in an era when nationalism was sweeping through Europe - treated their respective minorities harshly.&lt;ref name="Żołędowski114"&gt;Żołędowski, ''Białorusini i Litwini...'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Makowski244"&gt;Makowski, ''Litwini...'', pp.244-303&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuanian nationalists resented demands by Poles for greater cultural autonomy (similar to that granted to the Jewish minority), holding that most of Lithuania's Poles were really polonized Lithuanians who merely needed to be "re-Lithuanianized". Resentments were exacerbated when Lithuanian Poles expressed a desire to "re-unite" the country with Poland. As a result, the nationalizing Lithuanian state took measures to confiscate Polish owned land. It also restricted Polish religious services, schools, Polish publications, Polish voting rights. Poles were often referred to in the press in this period as the "lice of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/LithuaniaRN1.3.pdf |title=Lithuania|accessdate=2007-06-18 |last= Fearon |first=James D. |author2=Laitin, David D.  |year= 2006 |format=pdf |publisher= Stanford University |pages=4 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Poland annexed the town of [[Sejny]] and its surroundings back in 1919, repressions towards the local Lithuanian population started, including the [[Lithuanian language]] being banned in public, Lithuanian organizations (with 1300 members), schools (with approx. 300 pupils) and press being closed, as well as the confiscation of property and even burning of Lithuanian books.&lt;ref name=LKA&gt;{{cite book | last = Lesčius | first = Vytautas | authorlink = | title = Lietuvos kariuomenė nepriklausomybės kovose 1918-1920 | publisher = [[Vilnius University]], [[Generolo Jono Žemaičio Lietuvos karo akademija]] | year = 2004 | location = Vilnius | pages = 278 | isbn = 9955-423-23-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1920, after the staged mutiny of [[Lucjan Żeligowski]], Lithuanian cultural activities in Polish controlled territories were limited; newspapers were closed down and editors arrested.&lt;ref name="Čepėnas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Čepėnas |first=Pranas |authorlink=Pranas Čepėnas | title=Naujųjų laikų Lietuvos istorija |year=1986 |publisher=Dr. Griniaus fondas |location=Chicago |pages= 655, 656}}&lt;/ref&gt; One editor - [[Mykolas Biržiška]] - was accused of treason in 1922 and received the [[death penalty]]; only direct intervention by the [[League of Nations]] spared him this fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lituanus.org/1963/63_1_05.htm|title=Professor Mykolas Biržiška|publisher=[[Lituanus]]|accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of 32 Lithuanian and Belarusian cultural activists formally expelled from Vilnius on September 20, 1922 and given to the Lithuanian army.&lt;ref name="Čepėnas"/&gt; When 48 Polish schools were closed in Lithuania in 1927, [[Józef Piłsudski]] retaliated by closing many Lithuanian educational establishments in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Warwick Palmer.

Overlook Press. p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year 48 Lithuanian schools were closed and 11 Lithuanian activist were deported.&lt;ref name="Żołędowski114"/&gt; 
In 1931 there were about 80,000 Lithuanians in Poland, the majority of them (66,300) in [[Wilno Voivodeship (1923–1939)|Wilno Voivodeship]].&lt;ref name="Spis 1931"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Drugi Powszechny Spis Ludności z dnia 9 XII 1931 r. | journal=Statystyka Polski | volume=D | issue=34 | year=1939 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski's]] death in 1935, further Polonisation ensued as the government encouraged the [[Osadnik|settlement of Polish army veterans]] in disputed regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/LithuaniaRN1.3.pdf |title=Lithuania|accessdate=2007-06-18 |last= Fearon |first=James D. |author2=Laitin, David D.   |year= 2006 |format=pdf  |publisher= Stanford University |pages=4 |quote= From 1936 till 1939, 266 Lithuanian schools were closed in the whole territory of the former Vilnius Territory.

The [[Second World War]] put an end to the independent Polish and Lithuanian states. After the war, both former states fell under the [[sphere of influence]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. Poland [[Territorial changes of Poland after World War II|was shifted westwards]], thus giving up most of the disputed territories in the [[Second Polish Republic]], those territories were mostly incorporated into the [[Lithuanian SSR]], itself one of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union]]. At the same time, many Poles from the [[Kresy]] area were forcibly [[repatriation|repatriated]] west to the "[[Recovered Territories]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Poles In Lithuania From The Second Half Of 1944 Until 1946: Choosing Between Staying Or Emigrating To Poland (English Summary) |journal=[[Lietuvos istorijos metraštis]] |year=2004 |first=Vitalija |last=Stravinskienė |volume=2 |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.istorija.lt/lim/stravinskiene2004en2.html |accessdate=2007-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205013/http://www.istorija.lt/lim/stravinskiene2004en2.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Polish minority in Lithuania]] (or Lithuanian SSR) was also significantly downsized.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Under the eye of the Soviet Union, the various ethnic groups in the [[Eastern Bloc]] were to cooperate peacefully in the spirit of [[Proletarian internationalism]], and that policy,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} coupled with the population migrations limiting the size of both minorities in the respective regions, resulted in a lessening of tensions between Poles and Lithuanians. However, in the Sejny and [[Suwalki]] districts the prohibition against speaking Lithuanian in public lasted until 1950 (and in phone calls until 1990) and it was not until the 1950s that the teaching of Lithuanian was introduced as a subject in schools.&lt;ref name="Price2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Glanville Price|title=Encyclopedia of the languages of Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=29BAeKHwvuoC&amp;pg=PA305|accessdate=1 March 2011|date=28 April 2000|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-22039-8|pages=305–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Lithuanian minority in Poland is composed of 5,639 people according to the [[Poland|Polish]] [[census]] of 2002, with most of them (5,097) living in the [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]] ([[Suwałki Region]]), particularly in [[Gmina Puńsk]] where they form a majority (74.4% of population). According to the [[Lithuania]]n [[embassy]] there are about 15,000 people of Lithuanian ancestry in Poland.&lt;ref name="lt_embassy"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.lietuva.pl/index.php?language=pl&amp;page=178 Społeczność litewska w Polsce] (Lithuanian community in Poland) on the official site of Lithuanian embassy in Poland&lt;/ref&gt;  8,000 people declared Lithuanian identity in the Polish census of 2011 (including 5,000 who declared it as their only nationality, and 3,000 who declared it as the second one, after the Polish nationality).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/LUD_raport_z_wynikow_NSP2011.pdf 2011 Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221235509/http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/LUD_raport_z_wynikow_NSP2011.pdf |date=2012-12-21 }}. [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)]]. 2012. p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Lithuanian publications (over 80 books have been published, and there are several magazines, of which the largest is "Aušra" (= "Dawn"),[http://www.punskas.pl/pl/p1/ausra.htm] co-sponsored by [[Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs]]). Lithuanian organizations are involved in organizing cultural life of the minority (with libraries, choirs, theatres, etc.). There are also Lithuanian-language programmes on local [[Radio Białystok]] and [[Telewizja Białystok]].&lt;ref name="lt_embassy"/&gt;

There are Lithuanian-exclusive schools in Puńsk, both on primary and secondary level, schools with Lithuanian-language as a teaching language in Sejny, and schools with Lithuanian as a foreign language in the wider region are common.&lt;ref name="lt_embassy"/&gt; There are 17 Lithuanian schools, attended by over 700 students.&lt;ref name="lt_embassy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSWIA"/&gt; The most important of those schools is the [[liceum]] ([[Liceum 11.Marca w Puńsku]]); there are also three [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]s ([[Gimnazjum „Žiburys” w Sejnach]], [[II Gimnazjum w Sejnach]], [[I Gimnazjum w Sejnach]]).&lt;ref name="lt_embassy"/&gt;

There are several Lithuanian cultural organizations in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.punskas.pl/pl/p1/l-lietuviai/organizacje.htm Organizacje litewskie. Ich cele i warunki działania]. Aušra&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest one is the ''Stowarzyszenie Litwinów w Polsce'' (Association of Lithuanians in Poland), founded in 1992. Others include ''Wspólnota Litwinów w Polsce'' (Lithuanian Community in Poland, 1993), ''Stowarzyszenie Młodzieży Litewskiej w Polsce'' (Associations of Lithuanian Youth in Poland), ''Towarzystwo Kultury Etnicznej Litwinów'' (Association of Ethnic Culture of Lithuanians, 1997), ''Towarzystwo Nauczycieli Litewskich'' (Associations of Lithuanian Teachers). There are several buildings dedicated to Lithuanian minority, including the ''Lithuanian House'' and an ethnographic museum in [[Sejny]].&lt;ref name="lt_embassy"/&gt;  Various Lithuanian cultural activities include the Lithuanian Meeting (''Zlot'') in [[Pszczelnik]], and the Lithuanian Musical Festival ''Sąskrydis''.&lt;ref name="MSWIA"/&gt; In 2006 the Lithuanian minority received  1.344.912 [[zloty]]s (~$450,000) from Polish government in 2006 (22 out of 27 requests were approved).&lt;ref name="mswia"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.mswia.gov.pl/wai/pl/116/4101/ Protokół z IX posiedzenia Podzespołu ds.

"'''Loan-a Lisa'''" is the second episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} [[The Simpsons (season 22)|twenty-second season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 3, 2010.&lt;ref name="airdate"/&gt; In the episode, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] helps fund [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]]'s bicycle company with money [[Grampa Simpson]] gives her as part of his inheritance, but after Nelson meets [[Facebook]] founder Mark Zuckerberg and is convinced he can be successful by dropping out of school, Lisa tries to convince Nelson to stay in school. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] gets addicted to buying expensive items and returning them.

The episode was written by [[Valentina L. Garza]] and directed by [[Matthew Faughnan]], after [[Yeardley Smith]] suggested writing one centered around [[microfinancing]].&lt;ref name="emmytvlegends.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/yeardley-smith#|title=YEARDLEY SMITH|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It guest starred [[Mark Zuckerberg]], [[Chris Hansen]] and [[Muhammad Yunus]]. The episode received positive reviews from critics. According to the [[Nielsen Media Research]] receiving a 4.1/11 in the 18-49 demographic going up from the previous episode both in the demographic and in total viewers. 

==Plot==
Grampa decides to give his family their inheritance now, rather than make them wait until after his death. Each person's share turns out to be $50, and they decide to spend it at Costington's. Bart pays [[Gil Gunderson]] to walk up the down escalator, while [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] picks out a purse but mis-reads its $500 price tag as $50. Pressure from other shoppers leads her to charge it to her credit card; though she cannot afford it, Homer suggests that she use it until the store's return period is about to expire, then take it back. During dinner at a fancy restaurant, Marge tries her best to keep the purse clean, but Homer ruins it by dropping shrimp sauce on it. She is still able to return the purse despite this damage, and Homer begins buying expensive items on credit and returning them in time for a refund. Homer is eventually caught doing so on camera by [[Chris Hansen]] in a special entitled ''[[To Catch a Predator|To Catch a Credit Whore]]'', forcing Homer to flee in shame (but not before signing a contract authorizing use of his image for TV).

Meanwhile, Lisa decides to donate her $50 to charity, but an online introduction to [[microfinance]] and a video from [[Muhammad Yunus]] prompt her to use the money to support a local business instead. She gives Nelson Muntz a loan for his fledgling bicycle company, which rapidly begins to flourish. He decides to drop out of school in order to invest all his time in the business; Lisa is upset by the news, but [[Principal Skinner]] thinks it would pay nicely as a part-time job. At a meeting of [[entrepreneurs]], Lisa tries to persuade Nelson to stay in school, but she fails when she discovers that the attendees all left college (including [[Mark Zuckerberg]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Richard Branson]]), and that the janitor is the only person present who did not drop out. Grampa comforts her, saying that money cannot change people, and she accepts Nelson's decision to drop out. The business soon fails due to Nelson's unknowing use of defective materials to build his bicycles, such as water-soluble glue. After the experience, he concludes that returning to school would not be a bad thing and gives the original $50 to Skinner, who sees it as a huge improvement over the school's shoestring budget. Though Lisa has lost her money, Nelson makes it up to her by taking her skating, during which they knock down Zuckerberg and several other people.

'''Mainland Chinese''' or '''Mainlanders''' are [[Chinese people]] who live in a region considered a "mainland". It is frequently used in the context of areas ruled by the [[People's Republic of China]], referring to people from [[mainland China]] as opposed to other areas controlled by the state such as [[Hong Kong]] or [[Macau]]. The word is also often used by Taiwan people to distinguish the Chinese from Mainland China from themselves, if not calling the mainlanders and themselves as Chinese and Taiwanese directly respectively.

== Mainlanders in Taiwan ==
{{Main|Demographics of Taiwan}}
[[File:Yingjeou Ma.jpg|thumb|[[Ma Ying-jeou]], the former [[President of the Republic of China]] (Taiwan).]]

The word '''mainlander''' can refer to two different groups:
* ''1945 immigrants'' or ''Waishengren'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|外省人}}|p=wàishěngrén|l=extraprovincial person}}) are people who moved to [[Taiwan]] from mainland China after 1945 until the late 40s and early 50s. This group also includes all of their descendants born in Taiwan.
* ''Daluren'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|大陸人}}|p=dàlùrén|l=mainland people|labels=no}}) are residents of mainland China, especially citizens of the People's Republic of China (PRC) who live in mainland China.

In the context of demographics of Taiwan, the term '''mainlander''' when applied to a Taiwan resident most likely refers to ''daluren''.

=== Names ===
The translations of ''waishengren'' ({{zh|c=外省人|p=wàishěngrén|poj=gōa-séng-lâng}}) and '''''benshengren''''' ({{zh|c=本省人|p=běnshěngrén|poj=pún-séng-lâng|labels=no}}) into English poses some interesting difficulties. The usual English translation of ''waishengren'' is Mainlander, although many ''waishengren'' find this translation uncomfortable since it implies that ''waishengren'' are residents of mainland China, when they are all residents of Taiwan. ''Benshengren'', which literally translates to "this province's person" and is sometimes translated as "native Taiwanese", refers to the people native to Taiwan before the [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]] took over rule of Taiwan in 1945 and the mass exodus of mainlanders following the [[Chinese Civil War]], but this translation could be confused with the indigenous Austronesian people. Most academic literature uses the terms ''waishengren'' and ''benshengren'' directly. The terms rarely come up in the English-speaking media.

Many supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] object to the term "extra-provincial people", because it implies that Taiwan is a [[province of China]], and prefer the name {{ill|Taiwanese new immigrant|zh|臺灣新住民}}, ({{zh|新住民|labels=no}}; {{zh|poj=sin-chū-bîn}}). The latter phrase has not become popular in Taiwan and is extremely unpopular among ''waishengren'' themselves.

[[Chinese Civil War]] veterans especially are called "old taro" ({{zh|c=老芋仔|poj=lāu-ō·-á|labels=no}}) in [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], due to the similarity between the shape of mainland China and [[taro]] leaves), or ''waisheng laobing'' ({{zh|c=外省{{linktext|老兵}}|l=external-province veteran}}, in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. In government publications and the media, they are also called "honorable citizens" ({{zh|c=榮民|p=róngmín|poj=êng-bîn|labels=no}}).

Mainlanders make up about 10% of the population of Taiwan and are heavily concentrated in northern Taiwan especially in the [[Taipei]] area. Although no longer dominating the government, ''waishengren'' still make up a large fraction of bureaucrats and military officers.

=== Definition ===

{{See also|Ancestral home (China)}}

The formal definition of a mainlander is someone living in Taiwan whose "native province" is not Taiwan. Native province does not mean the province in which one is born, but rather the province where one's father's "[[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]]" is. Until 1996, identity cards and passports in Taiwan contained an entry for native province. The removal of native province from identity cards and replacement with place of birth was motivated in large part to reduce the mainlander/local distinction. This is especially true given that virtually all "mainlanders" born after 1949 were born in Taiwan, not in their "native provinces".

Because of the "native province" definition, someone who is born on Taiwan, but whose father's family roots are not in Taiwan, is generally considered a ''waishengren''. By contrast, someone who is not born in Taiwan, but whose native province is Taiwan (most notably [[Lien Chan]]) is generally not considered a ''waishengren''. Similarly, a child that is born to a Taiwanese businessman residing in the PRC would generally not be considered a ''waishengren''.

Furthermore, recent immigrants to Taiwan from Mainland China, mostly from marriages and undocumented migrants, are not considered ''waishengren'', but make up a separate social category. Although the numbers of these people are thought of as small and insignificant by most Taiwanese, it has been pointed out that recent immigrants from Mainland China and their children actually make up a larger population in Taiwan than [[Taiwanese aborigines]].

The distinctions get even fuzzier with mixed marriages and the fact that provincial identity sometimes does not correlate in obvious ways to characteristics such as political orientation or ability to speak [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]. For example, although Mainlanders are often stereotyped as supporting [[Chinese reunification]] and opposing [[Taiwan independence]], there are numerous examples where this formula does not hold. Similarly, it is common to find younger ''waishengren'' who speak fluent Taiwanese and younger ''benshengren'' who cannot speak it at all.

The number of the original ''waishengren'' generation who migrated to Taiwan sixty years ago has been dwindling as they age and die. Thus, the great majority of today's ''waishengren'' are their descendants born in Taiwan, and they do not speak the dialect of their "native province".

=== History ===

''Waishengren'' are descended from the people who followed [[Chiang Kai-shek]] to Taiwan after the [[Kuomintang]] lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. These people included Kuomintang officials, soldiers, merchants, bankers, executives, scientists, intellectuals, refugees, and anyone else who feared Communist rule. Until the 1970s, these people controlled the political systems of Taiwan; this, along with the looting and corruption that occurred under [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]]'s military government immediately following the Japanese surrender in 1945, generated resentment among ''benshengren'' and was one of the main causes of the [[Taiwan independence]] movement.

Starting in the 1970s, Chinese nationalist dominance of the government began to recede. This was due to a lack of a political or social theory that would justify continued Chinese nationalist dominance, [[meritocracy|meritocratic policies]] which allowed local Taiwanese to move up in the political establishment, and economic prosperity which allowed for social mobility for those outside of the political establishment.

Intermarriage and a new generation raised under the same environment has largely blurred the distinction between ''waishengren'' and ''benshengren''.

In the late 1990s, the concept of "the New Taiwanese" became popular both among supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] and [[Chinese reunification]] in order to advocate a more tolerant proposition that ''waishengren'', who sided with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] against the reluctant Japanese colony in Taiwan during [[World War II]], are no less Taiwanese than ''benshengren''. However it quickly became apparent that the notion of New Taiwanese meant different things to supporters of independence and unification. To supporters of independence, the concept of New Taiwanese implied that ''waishengren'' should assimilate into a Taiwanese identity which was separate from the Chinese one. By contrast, the supporters of [[Chinese reunification]] seemed to believe that all Taiwanese (not just ''waishengren'') should restore a previously marginalized Taiwanese identity without antagonizing a larger pan-Chinese identity.

As of the early 21st century, more and more ''waishengren'' see themselves as Taiwanese and as socially distinct from current residents of Mainland China. Unlike those belonging to groups such as the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] or [[Taiwanese aboriginal]]s, ''waishengren'' are not encouraged to find their root, and their relationship with anti-China organizations suffers further as a result. Most of them, especially those of the younger generation, make extensive efforts to establish themselves as Taiwanese, sometimes by manifesting good interest in [[Hoklo Taiwanese]] culture. At the same time, right-wing discourse alleging that pro-unification ''waishengren'' are a [[fifth column]] for the PRC agonizes those mainlanders who regard Taiwan as their new homeland.

Now, the term "mainlander" is used to describe a person, Chinese by race, born and raised in mainland China, thereby avoiding confusion with ''waishengren''.

[[Lien Chan]] has been sometimes denoted a ''waishengren'', often by his political opponents, although the general perception on Taiwan is that he is not. Although he was born in mainland China and his mother was of mainland ancestry, his father's ancestral home was in [[Tainan]], Taiwan.

=== Recent mainland immigration to Taiwan ===

Since the mid-1990s, there has been a small amount of mainland Chinese immigration into Taiwan. These immigrants are predominantly female and are often colloquially known as ''dàlù mèi'' (大陸妹), which means "mainland girls" (literally: mainland sister). These consist of two categories: female brides of businessmen who work in the mainland; and women who have married rural Taiwanese, mainly through a marriage broker. This population is distinct from ''waishengren''.

== "Mainlanders" in Hong Kong ==
{{See also|Hong Kong people#Mainland Chinese}}
[[File:Tung Chee Hwa (Feb 2011).jpg|thumb|[[Tung Chee Hwa]], former Chief Executive of [[Hong Kong]].]]

In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], "mainlander" (also "inlander"{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}{{dubious|date=February 2015}}) refers to residents of mainland China, or recent [[immigrant]]s from mainland China.

=== Names ===

Residents of [[mainland China]] are usually referred to as 大陸人 (jyutping: ''daai6 luk6 jan4'', literally "mainlanders"), 內地人 (jyutping: ''noi6 dei6 jan4'', literally "people from the inland"). Officials in China, as well as a few leftist institutions in Hong Kong, refer to themselves as 內地同胞 (jyutping: ''noi6 dei6 tung4 baau1'', literally "inland compatriot"). The second term is neutral, and the first term is commonly used by local Hong Kong Chinese{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} but also used by government issued statements to refer to people from mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2006/en/20_02.htm |title=Hong Kong 2006 - Population and Immigration |publisher=Yearbook.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainlanders are sometimes called 表叔 (jyutping: ''biu2 suk1'', literally "father's male cousin"), 表姐 (jyutping: ''biu2 ze2'', literally "female cousin"), and 阿燦 (jyutping: ''aa3 chaan3''), which were coined by various characters in [[Hong Kong movies|movie]]s and television series. These terms are considered derogatory and are politically incorrect. Recent immigrants are more politically correctly called 新移民 (jyutping: ''san1 ji4 man4'', literally "new immigrants"). 阿燦 is especially rude.

=== History ===

At the time when [[Hong Kong]] was [[colonisation|colonised]] by [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], the colony first covered only [[Hong Kong Island]], with a population of only around 6,000, most of whom were fishermen. Other than the indigenous population on [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Kowloon]] and [[New Territories]] who had lived in the area before the British arrived, most people in Hong Kong either immigrated from somewhere in mainland China, or were descendants of those immigrants.

The largest influx of population from the mainland was during the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (late 19th century) and the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1945–1949). The British colonial government maintained a touch-base policy until the early 1980s, allowing people from Mainland China to apply to be Hong Kong residents if they manage to arrive in the territory.

Some of these early immigrants, especially those who moved from [[Shanghai]] in the 1940s and early 1950s to escape the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] government, some came to dominate the business world in [[Hong Kong]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, Shanghai-born immigrants also occupied some of the prominent roles in the government, including former Chief Executive [[Tung Chee-hwa]] and former Chief Secretary [[Anson Chan]].

After decades of wars, internal conflicts and the [[Cultural Revolution]], there was a large gap in the level of development between Hong Kong and the mainland. Many new immigrants arriving in the late 1970s and early 1980s were thought to be less sophisticated, and preserved many habits from the rural way of living. A very popular TVB series in 1979, 網中人, "the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", starring Chow Yun Fat as a good-hearted and handsome Hong Kong university graduate, Carol "Dodo" Cheng as a rich and charismatic HK-and-UK-educated university graduate, and Liu Wai Hung (廖偉雄) as 阿燦 (jyutping: ''aa3 chaan3''), Chow's long-lost good-hearted but unsophisticated rural-bred mainland brother arriving in Hong Kong as a new immigrant.

Starting from the early 1990s many new immigrants to Hong Kong are the spouses of residents and their children. Many of them are not rich, and some have to rely on money from [[social security|Comprehensive Social Security Assistance]] to survive. Although only a few do so, new immigrants of this time were held in a negative view.

=== Education ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}

Since the Handover in 1997, academic exchanges between [[Hong Kong]] and [[Mainland China]] have become much more common. In 2004, a policy was passed that allowed mainland high school students to apply to Hong Kong universities. The Chinese government encouraged more Hong Kong students to study in mainland universities by offering scholarships.

=== Recent development ===

Since 1 July 1997, the day when Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, the immigration policies have changed. It is stated that "[a] person of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the HKSAR [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] to a parent who, at the time of birth of that person, was a Chinese citizen who is a permanent resident, is a permanent resident of the HKSAR and enjoys the right of abode in [[Hong Kong]]".

But in 1999, the Supreme Court of the HKSAR made a judgment that as long as the person is born in Hong Kong, they will be regarded as a permanent resident and will get the right of abode, even though their parents are not permanent residents of Hong Kong at the time they are born.&lt;ref name=Tang&gt;Tang&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a lot of Mainlanders have come to live in [[Hong Kong]]. Every day there is a quota of 150 immigrants.&lt;ref name=Tang&gt;Tang&lt;/ref&gt;
* A daily sub-quota of 60 is given to children of all ages who are eligible for the right of abode in Hong Kong.
* A sub-quota of 30 is for long-separated spouses.
* An unspecified sub-quota of 60 is for other OWP applicants allocated to the following persons:
** separated spouses irrespective of the length of separation;
** dependent children coming to Hong Kong to join their relatives;
** persons coming to Hong Kong to take care of their dependent parents;
** dependent elderly people coming to Hong Kong to join their relatives;
** those entering Hong Kong for the inheritance of property.

In 2003, the mainland authorities loosened control on mainland residents over visiting Hong Kong and Macau. Before this change, residents from mainland could only visit Hong Kong and Macau for sightseeing as part of tour groups. The [[Individual Visit Scheme]] allows mainland residents of selected cities to visit Hong Kong and Macau for sightseeing on their own. It has boosted tourism in the two [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]].

==== Quality Migrant Admission Scheme ====

On 28 June 2006, the HKSAR imposed the [[Quality Migrant Admission Scheme]]. It is a scheme which aims at attracting highly skilled or talented persons who are fresh immigrants not having the right to enter and remain in Hong Kong to settle in Hong Kong in order to enhance Hong Kong's economic competitiveness in the global market. Successful applicants are not required to secure an offer of local employment before their entry to Hong Kong for settlement. Many Mainland artists and former national sportsmen/sportswomen have applied for the right of abode via this way, such as [[Li Yundi]] and [[Lang Lang]].

===People===

'''''Manushi: A Journal about Women and Society''''' is an [[India]]n [[magazine]] devoted to [[feminism]] as well as to [[gender studies]] and [[activism]]. The magazine was founded in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Amrita Madhukalya|title=Of recipes and G-spots: On India's 'magazine era'|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-of-recipes-and-g-spots-on-india-s-magazine-era-2105879|accessdate=25 September 2016|work=dna|date=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Madhu Kishwar]] and [[Ruth Vanita]], two scholars based in [[New Delhi]]. It is currently published as a bi-monthly; a total of 157 issues have appeared by the end of the year 2006. ''Manushi'' is also a publishing house which prints not just works on the status of women in India but also novels and short stories with a less direct connection to gender issues.

''Manushi'' from the beginning has sought to publish articles about the full range of South Asian communities. It regularly includes articles about women's issues in [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]] as well as less frequent articles from around the world. The editors strive to cover people often relatively ignored in English-language media in South Asia. Activists are asked to contribute articles about peasants, workers and minorities, whether religious or ethnic. ''Manushi'' sponsors series of lectures and training seminars and also furnishes information to victimised women.

'''Marketing strategy''' is a long-term, forward-looking approach to planning with the fundamental goal of achieving a sustainable [[competitive advantage]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Michael ''The Strategic Marketing Plan Audit'' 2008. {{ISBN|1-902433-99-8}}. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic planning involves an analysis of the company's strategic initial situation prior to the formulation, evaluation and selection of [[market-oriented]] competitive position that contributes to the company's goals and marketing objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Homburg, Christian; Sabine Kuester, Harley Krohmer, ''Marketing Management: A Contemporary Perspective'' (1st ed.), London, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic marketing, as a distinct field of study emerged in the 1970s, and built on strategic management that preceded it&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Iterative lagged asymmetric responses in strategic management and long-range planning. Time &amp; Society, OnlineFirst, https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463X17752652 .&lt;/ref&gt;. Marketing strategy highlights the role of marketing as a link between the organisation and its customers. 

At its most basic level, strategic marketing addresses three deceptively simple questions: (1) Where are we now? (2) Where are we going? and (3) How are we going to get there? In attempting to answer these questions, strategic planners require sophisticated skills in both research and analysis&lt;ref&gt;Payne, A. and Frow, P., 2014. Developing superior value propositions: a strategic marketing imperative. Journal of Service Management, 25(2), pp.213-227.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Definitions of marketing strategy==

Scholars continue to debate the precise meaning of marketing strategy. Consequently, the literature offers many different definitions. On close examination, however, these definitions appear to centre around the notion that strategy refers to a broad statement of what is to be achieved.

Marketing Strategy is:

: "The marketing strategy lays out target markets and the value proposition that will be offered based on an analysis of the best market opportunities." (Philip Kotler &amp; Kevin Keller, Marketing Management, Pearson, 14th Edition)

: “An over-riding directional concept that sets out the planned path.”  (David Aaker and Michael K. Mills, ''Strategic Market Management,'' 2001, p. 11)

: "Essentially a formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be and what policies will be needed to carry out these goals." (Michael Porter, ''Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors ,'' NY, Free Press, 1980)

: "The pattern of major objectives, purposes and goals and essential policies and plans for achieving those goals, stated in such a way as to define what business the company is in or is to be in. (S. Jain, ''Marketing Planning and Strategy,'' 1993)

: "An explicit guide to future behaviour.” (Henry Mintzberg, “ Crafting Strategy,” ''Harvard Business Review,'' July–August, 1987 pp. 66–74)

:  Strategy is "reserved for actions aimed directly at altering the strengths of the enterprise relative to that of its competitors... Perfect strategies are not called for. What counts is... performance relative to competitors.” (Kenichi Ohmae, ''The Mind of the Strategist,'' 1982, p. 37)

: Strategy formulation is built on "the match between organisational resources and skills and environmental opportunities and risks it faces and the purposes it wishes to accomplish." (Dan Schendel and  Charles W. Hofer, ''Strategy Formulation: Analytical Concepts,'' South-Western, 1978, p. 11)

==Marketing management versus marketing strategy==

The distinction between “strategic” and “managerial” marketing is used to distinguish "two phases having different goals and based on different conceptual tools. Strategic marketing concerns the choice of policies  aiming at improving the competitive position of the firm, taking account of challenges and opportunities  proposed by the competitive environment. On the other hand, managerial marketing is focused on the implementation of specific targets."&lt;ref&gt;Volpato, G. and Stocchetti, A., "Old and new approaches to marketing: The quest of their epistemological roots," MPRA Paper No. 30841, 2009, &lt;Online: https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/30841&gt;, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing strategy is about "lofty visions translated into less lofty and practical goals [while marketing management] is where we start to get our hands dirty and make plans for things to happen."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Dann, S. and Dann, S., ''E-Marketing: Theory and Application'' London, Palgrave-McMillan, 2011, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing strategy is sometimes called ''higher order'' planning because it sets out the broad direction and provides guidance and structure for the marketing program.

==Brief history of strategic marketing==

Marketing scholars have suggested that strategic marketing arose in the late 1970s and its origins can be understood in terms of a distinct evolutionary path:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., ''Competitive Marketing Strategy: Dynamic Manoeuvring for Competitive Position,'' Melbourne, Nelson, 1997; West, D., Ford, J. and Ibrahim, E., ''Strategic Marketing: Creating Competitive Advantage,'' Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 50-56; Schaars, S.p., ''Marketing Strategy,'' The Free Press, 1998, [Chapter 4 - 'A Brief History of Marketing Strategy'], pp 18-29 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic marketing planning: An overview==
[[File:The strategic gap.jpg|thumb|The strategic gap]]
Marketing strategy involves mapping out the company's direction for the forthcoming planning period, whether that be three, five or ten years. It involves undertaking a 360° review of the firm and its operating environment with a view to identifying new business opportunities that the firm could potentially leverage for competitive advantage. Strategic planning may also reveal market threats that the firm may need to consider for long-term sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Frates, J. and Sharp, S., "Using Business Intelligence to Discover New Market Opportunities," ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management,'' Vol. 3, No. 1, 2005, pp. 16–28&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic planning makes no assumptions about the firm continuing to offer the same products to the same customers into the future. Instead, it is concerned with identifying the business opportunities that are likely to be successful and evaluates the firm's capacity to leverage such opportunities. It seeks to identify the ''strategic gap''; that is the difference between where a firm is currently situated (the ''strategic reality'' or ''inadvertent strategy'') and where it should be situated for sustainable, long-term growth (the ''strategic intent'' or ''deliberate strategy'').&lt;ref&gt;Kerzner, H., ''Strategic Planning for Project Management Using a Project Management Using a Project Management Maturity Model,'' Wiley, 2002,  pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic planning seeks to address three deceptively simple questions, specifically:&lt;ref&gt;West, D., Ford, J. and Ibrahim, E., ''Strategic Marketing: Creating Competitive Advantage,'' Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
: * Where are we now? (Situation analysis)
: * What business ''should'' we be in? (Vision and mission)
: * How should we get there? (Strategies, plans, goals and objectives)

A fourth question may be added to the list, namely 'How do we know when we got there?' Due to increasing need for accountability, many marketing organisations use a variety of [[Marketing performance measurement|marketing metrics]] to track strategic performance, allowing for corrective action to be taken as required. On the surface, strategic planning seeks to address three simple questions, however, the research and analysis involved in strategic planning is very sophisticated and requires a great deal of skill and judgement.

==Strategic analysis: tools and techniques==

Strategic analysis is designed to address the first strategic question, "Where are we now?" &lt;ref&gt;West, D., Ford, J. and Ibrahim, E., ''Strategic Marketing: Creating Competitive Advantage,'' Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[market research]] is less useful for strategic marketing because the analyst is not seeking insights about customer attitudes and preferences. Instead strategic analysts are seeking insights about the firm's operating environment with a view to identifying possible future scenarios, opportunities and threats. 

Strategic planning focuses on the three 3C’s, namely: Customer, Corporation and Competitors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toolshero.com/strategy/3c-model-ohmae/|title=3C model by Kenichi Ohmae|last=Vliet|first=Vincent van |date=February 17, 2015|publisher=toolshero.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed analysis of each factor is key to the success of strategy formulation. The 'competitors' element refers to an analysis of the strengths of the business relative to close rivals, and a consideration of competitive threats that might impinge on the business' ability to move in certain directions. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The 'customer' element refers to an analysis of any possible changes in customer preferences that potentially give rise to new business opportunities. The 'corporation' element refers to a detailed analysis of the company's internal capabilities and its readiness to leverage market-based opportunities or its vulnerability to external threats. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Mintzberg suggests that the top planners spend most of their time engaged in analysis and are concerned with industry or competitive analyses as well as internal studies, including the use of computer models to analyze trends in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, H., "The Fall and Rise of Strategic Planning," ''Harvard Business Review,'' January–February, 1994 Online: https://hbr.org/1994/01/the-fall-and-rise-of-strategic-planning&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic planners use a variety of research tools and analytical techniques, depending on the environment complexity and the firm's goals. Fleitcher and Bensoussan, for instance, have identified some 200 qualitative and quantitative analytical techniques regularly used by strategic analysts&lt;ref&gt;Fleitcher, C. and Bensoussan, B., ''Strategic and Competitive Analysis: Methods and Techniques for Analyzing Business Competition,'' Prentice Hall, NJ  Prentice Hall, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while a recent publication suggests that 72 techniques are essential.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Aghazadeh, H., "Business, Market, and Competitive Analysis (BMCA) Tools and Techniques," Chapter 5 in ''Principles of Marketology,'' Vol 1, Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137379320_6, pp. 187–247&lt;/ref&gt; No optimal technique can be identified as useful across all situations or problems. Determining which technique to use in any given situation rests with the skill of the analyst. The choice of tool depends on a variety of factors including: data availability; the nature of the marketing problem; the objective or purpose, the analyst’s skill level as well as other constraints such as time or  motivation. &lt;ref&gt;Farris, P., Bendle, N., Pfeifer, P. and Reibstein, D., ''Marketing Metrics: The Manager's Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance,'' [E-book edition], FT Press, 2015, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brief description of gap analysis===

Gap analysis is a type of higher order analysis that seeks to identify the difference between the organisation's current strategy and its desired strategy. This difference is sometimes known as the ''strategic gap.'' Mintzberg identifies two types of strategy namely ''deliberate strategy'' and ''inadvertent strategy.'' The deliberate strategy represents the firm's strategic intent or its desired path while the inadvertent strategy represents the path that the firm may have followed as it adjusted to environmental, competitive and market changes.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Mintzberg, ''The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning,'' Prentice-Hall, 1994, pp. 24-27&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars use the terms ''realized strategy'' versus ''intended'' strategy to refer to the same concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, O. C., Lucas Jr, G. H. and Luck, D. J., ''Marketing Strategy,'' South Western, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This type of analysis indicates whether an organisation has strayed from its desired path during the planning period. The presence of a large gap may indicate the organisation has become ''stuck in the middle''; a recipe for strategic mediocrity and potential failure.

===Brief description of Category/Brand Development Index===

The category/brand development index is a method used to assess the sales potential for a region or market and identify market segments that can be developed (i.e. high CDI and high BDI). In addition, it may be used to identify markets where the category or brand is under-performing and may signal underlying marketing problems such as poor distribution (i.e. high CDI and low BDI).

BDI and CDI are calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Scissors, J. and Baron, R., ''Advertising Media Planning,'' 6th ed, Mc Graw-Hill 2002, pp. 182–187&lt;/ref&gt;

:: BDI =  (Brand Sales (%) in Market A/ Population (%) in Market A) X 100
:: CDI = (Category Sales (%) in Market/ Population (%) in Market A) X 100

===Brief description of PEST analysis===
[[File:Pest-analysis.jpg|thumb|PEST analysis: variables that may be considered in the environmental scan]]
Strategic planning typically begins with a scan of the business environment, both internal and external, this includes understanding strategic constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Aaker, David ''Strategic Market Management'' 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-470-05623-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An understanding of the external operating environment, including political, economic, social and technological which includes demographic and cultural aspects, is necessary for the identification of business opportunities and threats.&lt;ref name="Aaker David" /&gt; This analysis is called [[PEST analysis|PEST]]; an acronym for '''P'''olitical, '''E'''conomic, '''S'''ocial and '''T'''echnological. A number of variants of the PEST analysis can be identified in literature, including: PESTLE analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental); STEEPLE (adds ethics); STEEPLED (adds demographics) and STEER (adds regulatory).&lt;ref&gt;Sammut-Bonnici, T. and Galea, F., "PEST Analysis" in ''Wiley Encyclopedia of Management,''John Wiley, 2015, p. 1 &lt;Online: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257303449_PEST_Analysis&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the PEST analysis is to identify opportunities and threats in the wider operating environment. Firms try to leverage opportunities while trying to buffer themselves against potential threats. Basically, the PEST analysis guides strategic decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference Online &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100319664&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main elements of the PEST analysis are:&lt;ref&gt;Sammut-Bonnici, T. and Galea, F., "PEST Analysis" in ''Wiley Encyclopedia of Management,''John Wiley, 2015, pp. 2–6 &lt;Online: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257303449_PEST_Analysis&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''P'''olitical: political interventions with the potential to disrupt or enhance trading conditions e.g. government statutes, policies, funding or subsidies, support for specific industries, trade agreements, tax rates and fiscal policy.
:* '''E'''conomic: economic factors with the potential to affect profitability and the prices that can be charged, such as, economic trends, inflation, exchange rates, seasonality and economic cycles, consumer confidence, consumer purchasing power and discretionary incomes.
:* '''S'''ocial: social factors that affect demand for products and services, consumer attitudes, tastes and preferences like demographics, social influencers, role models, shopping habits.
:* '''T'''echnological: Innovation, technological developments or breakthroughs that create opportunities for new products, improved production processes or new ways of transacting business e.g. new materials, new ingredients, new machinery, new packaging solutions, new software and new intermediaries.

When carrying out a PEST analysis, planners and analysts may consider the operating environment at three levels, namely ''the supranational''; ''the national'' and ''subnational'' or local level. As businesses become more globalized, they may need to pay greater attention to the supranational level.&lt;ref&gt;Sammut-Bonnici, T. and Galea, F., "PEST Analysis" in ''Wiley Encyclopedia of Management,''John Wiley, 2015, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brief description of SWOT analysis===

[[File:SWOT en.svg|thumb|A SWOT analysis, with its four elements in a 2×2 matrix.]]

In addition to the PEST analysis, firms carry out a Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats [[SWOT analysis|(SWOT) analysis]]. A SWOT analysis identifies:&lt;ref&gt;Fine, L. H., ''The SWOT Analysis: Using your Strength to Overcome Weaknesses, Using Opportunities to Overcome Threats,''Kickit LLC, 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* Strengths: distinctive capabilities, competencies, skills or assets that provide a business or project with an advantage over potential rivals; internal factors that are favourable to achieving company objectives 
:* Weaknesses: internal deficiencies that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to rivals; or deficiencies that prevent an entity from moving in a new direction or acting on opportunities. internal factors that are unfavourable to achieving company objectives
:* Opportunities: elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage；external factors of the organization including: new products, new markets, new demand, foreign market barriers, competitors' mistakes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Helms |first1=Marilyn |last2=Nixon |first2=Judy |title=Exploring SWOT analysis - where are we now?: A review of academic research from the last decade |journal=Journal of Strategy and Management |date=2010 |volume=3 |issue=3 |page=215 |pages=251 |doi=10.1108/17554251011064837}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Threats: elements in the environment that could erode the firm's market position; external factors that prevent or hinder an entity from moving in a desired direction or achieving its goals.

Typically the firm will attempt to leverage those opportunities that can be matched with internal strengths; that is to say the firm has a capability in any area where strengths are matched with external opportunities. It may need to build capability if it wishes to leverage opportunities in areas of weakness. An area of weakness that is matched with an external threat represents a vulnerability, and the firm may need to develop contingency plans.&lt;ref&gt;Piercy, N., ''Market-Led Strategic Change,'' Butterworth-Heinemann, 2009, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing the vision and mission==

The vision and mission address the second central question, 'Where are we going?' At the conclusion of the research and analysis stage, the firm will typically review its [[vision statement]], [[mission statement]] and, if necessary, devise a new vision and mission for the outlook period. At this stage, the firm will also devise a generic competitive strategy as the basis for maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage for the forthcoming planning period. 

A vision statement is a realistic, long term future scenario for the organisation. (Vision statements should not be confused with slogans or mottos.)&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, J. R., "Anatomy of a Vision Statement," ''Management Review,'' Vol. 87,  No. 2, 1998, pp. 22–26&lt;/ref&gt; A vision statement is designed to present a realistic long-term future scenario for the organisation. It is a "clearly articulated statement of the business scope." A strong vision statement typically includes the following:&lt;ref&gt;Aaker, D. and Mills, M. K., ''Strategic Market Management,'' Pacific-rim edition, Wiley, 2001, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Competitive scope
:* Market scope
:* Geographic scope
:* Vertical scope
Some scholars point out the market visioning is a skill or competency that encapsulates the planners' capacity "to link advanced technologies to market opportunities of the future, and to do so through a shared understanding of a given product market.&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. Reid and Ulrike de Brentani, “The Impact of Market Vision on Early Success with Leader Users” ANZMAC, 2006 www.anzmac.org&lt;/ref&gt;

A mission statement is  a clear and concise statement of the organisation’s reason for being and its scope of operations,&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. A., and David, F., "Corporate Mission Statements: The Bottom Line," ''The Academy of Management Executive,'' Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 109–116&lt;/ref&gt; while the generic strategy outlines how the company intends to achieve both its vision and mission.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell-Hunt, C., "What Have We Learned about Generic Competitive Strategy?" ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 21, 2000, pp. 127–154&lt;/ref&gt;

Mission statements should include detailed information and must be more than a simple ''motherhood statement''.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, E. M., "Developing, Implementing and Monitoring an Information Product Quality Strategy," ''Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Information Quality,'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A mission statement typically includes the following:&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. A., and David, F., "Corporate Mission Statements: The Bottom Line," ''The Academy of Management Executive,'' Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mission statement.png|thumb|This mission statement might be described as a "motherhood statement" because it lacks sufficient detail to be meaningful]]
:* Specification of target customers 
:* Identification of principal products or services offered
:* Specification of the geographic scope of operations
:* Identification of core technologies and/or core capabilities
:* An outline of the firm's commitment to long-term survival, growth and profitability
:* An outline of the key elements in the company's philosophy and core values
:* Identification of the company's desired public image

==Developing the generic competitive strategy==

The generic competitive strategy outlines the fundamental basis for obtaining a sustainable competitive advantage within a category. Firms can normally trace their competitive position to one of three factors:&lt;ref&gt;Rumelt, R. P., "The  Evaluation  of  Business  Strategy,"  in Quinn, James  Brian; Mintzberg, Henry; and Robert M. James (eds), ''The Strategy Process,'' Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Superior skills  (e.g. coordination of individual specialists, created through the interplay of investment in training and professional development, work and learning)   
:* Superior resources (e.g. patents, trade-mark protection, specialized  physical assets and  relationships with suppliers and distribution infrastructure.)    
:* Superior position (the products or services offered, the market segments served, and the extent to which the product-market can be isolated from direct competition.)

It is essential that the internal analysis provide a frank and open evaluation of the firm's superiority in terms of skills, resources or market position since this will provide the basis for competing over the forthcoming planning period. For this reason, some companies engage external consultants to provide an independent assessment of the firms capabilities and resources.

===Porter and the positioning school: approach to strategy formulation===
{{Further|Porter's generic strategies}}
[[File:Michael Porter's Three Generic Strategies.svg|thumb|Porter's Three Generic Strategies]]

In 1980, Michael Porter developed an approach to strategy formulation that proved to be extremely popular with both scholars and practitioners. The approach became known as the ''positioning school'' because of its emphasis on locating a defensible ''competitive position'' within an industry or sector. In this approach, strategy formulation consists of three key strands of thinking: analysis of the five forces to determine the sources of competitive advantage; the selection of one of three possible positions which leverage the advantage and the value chain to implement the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, G. and Snowdon, B., "Competitive Advantage Revisited: Michael Porter on Strategy and Competitiveness," ''Journal of Management Inquiry,'' Vol. 16 No. 3, 2007, pp.  256–273, DOI: 10.1177/1056492607306333&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, the strategic choices involve decisions about whether to compete for a share of the total market or for a specific target group (competitive scope) and whether to compete on costs or product differences (competitive advantage). This type of thinking leads to three generic strategies: &lt;ref&gt; Porter, Michael E., ''Competitive Strategy,'' Free Press, 1980; Porter, Michael E., ''Competitive Advantage, '' Free Press, 1985, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Cost leadership - the firm targets the mass market and attempts to be the lowest cost producer in the market 
:* Differentiation - the firm targets the mass market and tries to maintain unique points of product difference perceived as desirable by customers and for which they are prepared to pay premium prices
:* Focus - the firm does not compete head to head, but instead selects a narrow target market and focuses its efforts on satisfying the needs of that segment

According to Porter, these strategies are mutually exclusive and the firm must select one approach to the exclusion of all others.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Michael E., ''Competitive Advantage, '' Free Press, 1985, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Firms that try to be all things to all people can present a confused market position which ultimately leads to below average returns. Any ambiguity about the firm's approach is a recipe for "strategic mediocrity" and any firm that tries to pursue two approaches simultaneously is said to be "stuck in the middle" and destined for failure.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, R., ''Strategic Management: A Critical Introduction,'' [E-book edition], Oxon, Routledge, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;

Porter's approach was the dominant paradigm throughout the 1980s. However, the approach has attracted considerable criticism. One important criticism is that it is possible to identify successful companies that pursue a hybrid strategy - such as low cost position and a differentiated position simultaneously. Toyota is a classic example of this hybrid approach.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, G. and Snowdon, B., "Competitive Advantage Revisited: Michael Porter on Strategy and Competitiveness," ''Journal of Management Inquiry,'' Vol. 16 No. 3, 2007, p. 257, DOI: 10.1177/1056492607306333&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars point to the simplistic nature of the analysis and the overly prescriptive nature of the strategic choices which limits strategies to just three options. Yet others point to research showing that many practitioners find the approach to be overly theoretical and not applicable to their business.&lt;ref&gt;de Kare-Silver M.,  "The Inadequacies of Existing Strategy Models," Chapter 4 In: ''Strategy in Crisis,'' Palgrave Macmillan, London, 1997,DOI https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230378117_4, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource-based view (RBV) ===
{{Further|Resource-based view}}

During the 1990s, the ''resource-based view'' (also known as the ''resource-advantage theory'') of the firm became the dominant paradigm. It is an inter-disciplinary approach that represents a substantial shift in thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Fahy, J. and Smithee, "Strategic Marketing and the Resource Based View of the Firm," ''Academy of Marketing Science Review,'' Vol. 1999 No. 10, 1999, Online: http://www.amsreview.org/articles/fahy10-1999.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses attention on an organisation's internal resources as a means of organising processes and obtaining a competitive advantage. The resource-based view suggests that organisations must develop unique, firm-specific core competencies that will allow them to outperform competitors by doing things differently and in a superior manner.&lt;ref&gt;Prahalad,  C.  K. and Hamel,  G., "The Core Competence of the Corporation," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 68, No. 3, pp.  79–91&lt;/ref&gt;  

Barney stated that for resources to hold potential as sources of sustainable competitive advantage, they should be valuable, rare and imperfectly imitable.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage." ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 99–120&lt;/ref&gt; A key insight arising from the resource-based view is that not all resources are of equal importance nor possess the potential to become a source of sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Fahy, J. and Smithee, "Strategic Marketing and the Resource Based View of the Firm," ''Academy of Marketing Science Review,'' Vol. 1999 No. 10, 1999, Online: http://www.amsreview.org/articles/fahy10-1999.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The sustainability of any competitive advantage depends on the extent to which resources can be imitated or substituted.&lt;ref&gt;Lowson, R., "The Nature of Operations Strategy: Combining Strategic Decisions from an Operations and Market based Perspective," ''Management Decision,'' Vol. 41, No, 6, pp.  538–49&lt;/ref&gt; Barney and others point out that understanding the causal relationship between the sources of advantage and successful strategies can be very difficult in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage." ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 108–09; Barney uses the term "causally ambiguous" which he describes as a situation when "the link between the resources controlled by the firm and the firm's sustained competitive advantage is not understood or understood only very imperfectly." &lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a great deal of managerial effort must be invested in identifying, understanding and classifying core competencies. In addition, management must invest in organisational learning to develop and maintain key resources and competencies. 

Market Based Resources include:&lt;ref&gt;Day, G.S. and Wensley, R., “Assessing Advantage: A Framework for Diagnosing Competitive Superiority,” ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 52, April, 1988, pp.  1–26; Day, G. S., “The Capabilities of Market-Driven Organizations,” ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 58, October, 1994, pp. 37–52; Hooley, G. J., Greenley, G. E., Fahy, J. and Cadogan, J. W. “Market-focused Resources, Competitive Positioning and Firm Performance” ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 5–6, 2001, pp. 503–520&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Organisational culture e.g. market orientation, research orientation, culture of innovation, etc.
:* Assets e.g. brands, Mktg IS, databases, etc.
:* Capabilities (or competencies) e.g. market sensing, marketing research, relationships, know-how, tacit knowledge, etc

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organisations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter's prescriptive approach to strategy formulation.

Hooley et al., suggest the following classification of competitive positions:&lt;ref&gt;Hooley, G., Broderick, A. and Moller, K., "Competitive Positioning and the Resource-Based View of the Firm," ''Journal of Strategic Marketing,'' Vol. 6, 1998, pp. 97–115&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Price positioning
:* Quality positioning
:* Innovation positioning
:* Service positioning
:* Benefit positioning
:* Tailored positioning ([[Personalized marketing|one-to-one marketing]])

===Other approaches===

The choice of competitive strategy often depends on a variety of factors including: the firm's market position relative to rival firms,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, A. C., "Generating Marketing Strategy Priorities Based on  Relative Competitive Position," ''Journal of Consumer Marketing,'' Vol. 3 Issue: 4, pp. 49–56, https://doi.org/10.1108/eb008179&lt;/ref&gt; the stage of the product life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Swan, J. E. and Rink, D. E. "Fitting market strategy to varying product life cycles," ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 25, No. 1, 1982, pp. 72–76, https://doi.org/10.1016/0007-6813(82)90048-9&lt;/ref&gt; A well-established firm in a mature market will likely have a different strategy than a [[startup company|start-up]].


====Growth strategies====
Growth of a business is critical for business success. A firm may grow by developing the market or by developing new products. The [[Ansoff Matrix|Ansoff product and  market growth matrix]] illustrates the two broad dimensions for achieving growth. The Ansoff matrix identifies four specific growth strategies: [[market penetration]], [[New product development|product development]], [[market development]] and [[Diversification (marketing strategy)|diversification]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ansoffmatrix.com|title=Ansoff Matrix|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Ansoff Matrix.JPG|thumb|The Ansoff Product/market Growth Matrix]]

:''Market penetration'' involves selling existing products to existing consumers. This is a conservative, low risk approach since the product is already on the established market.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 
: ''Product development'' is the introduction of a new product to existing customers. This can include modifications to an already existing market which can create a product that has more appeal.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 
:''Market development'' involves the selling of existing products to new customers in order to identify and build a new clientele base. This can include new geographical markets, new distribution channels, and different pricing policies that bring the product price within the competence of new market segments. 
:''Diversification'' is the riskiest area for a business. This is where a new product is sold to a new market. &lt;ref&gt;Haq, F., Wong, H. and Jackson, J. (2008) [http://www.wbiconpro.com/Marketing/509-Haq,F%20%26%20Others.pdf Applying Ansoff’s growth strategy matrix to Consumer Segments and Typologies in Spiritual Tourism]. ''Eighth International Business Research Conference''&lt;/ref&gt; There are two type of Diversification; horizontal and vertical. 'Horizontal diversification'' focuses more on product(s) where the business is knowledgeable, whereas ''vertical diversification'' focuses more on the introduction of new product into new markets, where the business could have less knowledge of the new market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

; Horizontal integration
A horizontal integration strategy may be indicated in fast changing work environments as well as providing a broad knowledge base for the business and employees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/ojs/index.php/joscm/article/viewFile/9130/8430|author=Teixeira, R., Koufteros, X. A., Peng, X. D.|title=Organizational Structure, Integration, and Manufacturing Performance: a Conceptual Model and Propositions|journal=Journal of Operations and Supply Chain Management |volume=5 |issue=1|year=2012|pages=69–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; A benefit of horizontal diversification is that it is an open platform for a business to expand and build away from the already existing market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

High levels of horizontal integration lead to high levels of communication within the business. Another benefit of using this strategy is that it leads to a larger market for merged businesses, and it is easier to build good reputations for a business when using this strategy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs4122247000000002038.pdf|title=Firm Reputation and Horizontal Integration|last1=Obara|first1=Ichiro|last2=Cai|first2=H.|journal=The RAND Journal of Economics |volume=40|issue=2|pages=340–363|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A disadvantage of using a diversification strategy is that the benefits could take a while to start showing, which could lead the business to believe that the strategy in ineffective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another disadvantage or risk is, it has been shown that using the horizontal diversification method has become harmful for stock value, but using the vertical diversification had the best effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1057/9780230626317_11|chapter=The Impact of Vertical Integration and Horizontal Diversification on the Value of Energy Firms|title=The Econometrics of Energy Systems|pages=225|year=2007|last1=Pozzi|first1=Carlo|last2=Vassilopoulos|first2=Philippe|isbn=978-1-349-54149-2|url=http://www.wec-france.org/DocumentsPDF/RECHERCHE/40_RapportfinalPartie2(inenglish).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A disadvantage of using the horizontal integration strategy is that this limits and restricts the field of interest that the business.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.foswiki.org/pub/Sandbox/SimiWiki/Strategies_for_diversification.pdf |title=Strategies for Diversification |author=Ansoff, I. |journal=Harvard Business Review |volume=35 |issue=5 |year=1957 |pages=113–124 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413042229/http://www.foswiki.org/pub/Sandbox/SimiWiki/Strategies_for_diversification.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horizontal integration can affect a business's reputation, especially after a merge has happened between two or more businesses. There are three main benefits to a business's reputation after a merge. A larger business helps the reputation and increases the severity of the punishment. As well as the merge of information after a merge has happened, this increases the knowledge of the business and marketing area they are focused on. The last benefit is more opportunities for deviation to occur in merged businesses rather than independent businesses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

; Vertical integration

Vertical integration is when business is expanded through the vertical production line on one business. An example of a vertically integrated business could be Apple. Apple owns all their own software, hardware, designs and operating systems instead of relying on other businesses to supply these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://munin.uit.no/bitstream/handle/10037/2546/paper_3.pdf;jsessionid=EA9ACC5D1937248F507C45859394C53E?sequence=2|title=The Impact of Measurements and Industry|last=Isaksen|first=John R|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By having a highly vertically integrated business this creates different economies therefore creating a positive performance for the business.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Revival of Vertical Integration: Strategic Choice and Performance Influences |journal=Journal of Management and Strategy|last=Zhang|first=Dongli|date=2013|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.5430/jms.v4n1p1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical integration is seen as a business controlling the inputs of supplies and outputs of products as well as the distribution of the final product.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some benefits of using a Vertical integration strategy is that costs may be reduced because of the reducing transaction costs which include finding, selling, monitoring, contracting and negotiating with other firms. Also by decreasing outside businesses input it will increase the efficient use of inputs into the business. Another benefit of vertical integration is that it improves the exchange of information through the different stages of the production line.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some competitive advantages could include; avoiding foreclosures, improving the business marketing intelligence, and opens up opportunities to create different products for the market.&lt;ref&gt;Harrigan, K.R., "Formulating Vertical Integration Strategies," ''The Academy of Management Review,'' Vol. 9, No. 4, 1984 , pp. 638-652, DOI: 10.2307/258487, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/258487&lt;/ref&gt; Some disadvantages of using a Vertical Integration Strategy include the internal costs for the business and the need for overhead costs. Also if the business is not well organised and fully equipped and prepared the business will struggle using this strategy. There are also competitive disadvantages as well, which include; creates barriers for the business, and loses access to information from suppliers and distributors.&lt;ref&gt;Harrigan, K.R., "Formulating Vertical Integration Strategies," ''The Academy of Management Review,'' Vol. 9, No. 4, 1984 , pp. 638-652, DOI: 10.2307/258487, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/258487&lt;/ref&gt;

====Market position and strategy====
In terms of market position, firms may be classified as market leaders, market challengers, market followers or market nichers.&lt;ref&gt;While this classification is not the only way to think about competitors, it is very widely used. See for example: Aaker, D. and Mills, M. K., ''Strategic Market Management,'' Pacific Rim edition, Wiley, 2001; Dibb, D., Simkin, L., Pride, W. &amp; Ferrell, O. C., ''Marketing: Concepts and Strategies,'' Houghton, Boston, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Market position and strategic requirements.jpg|thumb|Market position and strategic implications]]

: ''Market leader'': The market leader dominates the market by objective measure of market share. Their overall posture is defensive because they have more to lose. Their objectives are to reinforce their prominent position through the use of PR to develop corporate image and to block competitors brand for brand, matching distribution through tactics such as the use of “fighting” brands, pre-emptive strikes, use of regulation to block competitors and even to spread rumours about competitors. Market leaders may adopt unconventional or unexpected approaches to building growth and their tactical responses are likely to include: product proliferation; diversification; multi-branding; erecting barriers to entry; vertical and horizontal integration and corporate acquisitions.

: ''Market challenger'': The market challenger holds the second highest market share in the category, following closely behind the dominant player. Their market posture is generally offensive because they have less to lose and more to gain by taking risks. They will compete head to head with the market leader in an effort to grow market share. Their overall strategy is to gain market share through product, packaging and service innovations; new market development and redefinition of the to broaden its scope and their position within it.

: ''Market follower'': Followers are generally content to play second fiddle. They rarely invest in R &amp; D and tend to wait for market leaders to develop innovative products and subsequently adopt a “me-too” approach. Their market posture is typically neutral. Their strategy is to maintain their market position by maintaining existing customers and capturing a fair share of any new segments. They tend to maintain profits by controlling costs.

: ''Market nicher'': The market nicher occupies a small niche in the market in order to avoid head to head competition. Their objective is to build strong ties with the customer base and develop strong loyalty with existing customers. Their market posture is generally neutral. Their strategy is to develop and build the segment and protect it from erosion. Tactically, nichers are likely to improve the product or service offering, leverage cross-selling opportunities, offer value for money and build relationships through superior after sales service, service quality and other related value adding activities.

As the speed of change in the marketing environment quickens, time horizons are becoming shorter. Nevertheless, most firms carry out strategic planning every 3- 5 years and treat the process as a means of checking whether the company is on track to achieve its vision and mission.&lt;ref name="Aaker David"&gt;Aaker, David ''Strategic Market Management'' 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-470-05623-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, strategies are both dynamic and interactive, partially planned and partially unplanned. Strategies are broad in their scope in order to enable a firm to react to unforeseen developments while trying to keep focused on a specific pathway. A key aspect of marketing strategy is to keep marketing consistent with a company's overarching [[mission statement]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Michael (2008 ) ''The Strategic Marketing Plan Audit''. p. 27. {{ISBN|1-902433-99-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategies often specify how to adjust the [[marketing mix]]; firms can use tools such as [[Marketing Mix Modeling]] to help them decide how to allocate scarce resources, as well as how to allocate funds across a portfolio of brands. In addition, firms can conduct analyses of performance, customer analysis, [[competitor analysis]], and [[target market]] analysis.

==== Entry strategies ====

{{See|Market entry strategy}}

Marketing strategies may differ depending on the unique situation of the individual business. According to Lieberman and Montgomery, every entrant into a market – whether it is new or not – is classified under a Market Pioneer, Close Follower or a Late follower&lt;ref name="First-Mover Advantages"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieberman|first1=M.|last2=Montgomery|first2=D.|title=First-Mover Advantages|journal=Strategic Management Journal|volume=9|date=1998|issue=9|pages=41–58|doi=10.1002/smj.4250090706|url=http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/marvin.lieberman/publications/FMA1-SMJ1988.pdf|jstor=3094199}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

=====Pioneers =====

Market pioneers are known to often open a new market to consumers based off a major innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farris, Paul W. |author2=Moore, Michael J. |title=The Profit Impact of Marketing Strategy Project: Retrospect and Prospects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fboPnwEACAAJ|date=4 November 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84053-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasise these product developments, and in a significant amount of cases, studies have shown that early entrants – or pioneers – into a market have serious market-share advantages above all those who enter later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalyanaram|first1=G.|last2=Gurumurthy|first2=R.|title=Market Entry Strategies: Pioneers versus Late Arrivals|journal=Strategy and Business|url=http://www.strategy-business.com/article/18881?gko=64116|date=1998|pages=74–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneers have the first-mover advantage, and in order to have this advantage, business’ must ensure they have at least one or more of three primary sources: Technological Leadership, Preemption of Assets or Buyer Switching Costs.&lt;ref name="First-Mover Advantages"/&gt; Technological Leadership means gaining an advantage through either Research and Development or the “learning curve”.&lt;ref name="First-Mover Advantages"/&gt; This lets a business use the research and development stage as a key point of selling due to primary research of a new or developed product. Preemption of Assets can help gain an advantage through acquiring scarce assets within a certain market, allowing the first-mover to be able to have control of existing assets rather than those that are created through new technology.&lt;ref name="First-Mover Advantages"/&gt; Thus allowing pre-existing information to be used and a lower risk when first entering a new market. By being a first entrant, it is easy to avoid higher switching costs compared to later entrants. For example, those who enter later would have to invest more expenditure in order to encourage customers away from early entrants.&lt;ref name="First-Mover Advantages"/&gt; However, while Market Pioneers may have the “highest probability of engaging in product development”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=W.|last2=Chiang|first2=J.|title=Product Development Strategies for Established Market Pioneers, Early Followers, and Late Entrants|doi=10.1002/smj.257|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=2002|volume=23|issue=9|pages=855–866}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lower switching costs, to have the first-mover advantage, it can be more expensive due to product innovation being more costly than product imitation. It has been found that while Pioneers in both consumer goods and industrial markets have gained “significant sales advantages”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boulding|first1=W.|last2=Christen|first2=M.|title=First-Mover Disadvantage|url=https://hbr.org/2001/10/first-mover-disadvantage|website=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; they incur larger disadvantages cost-wise.

=====Close followers =====

Being a Market Pioneer can, more often than not, attract entrepreneurs and/or investors depending on the benefits of the market. If there is an upside potential and the ability to have a stable market share, many businesses would start to follow in the footsteps of these pioneers. These are more commonly known as Close Followers. These entrants into the market can also be seen as challengers to the Market Pioneers and the Late Followers. This is because early followers are more than likely to invest a significant amount in Product Research and Development than later entrants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; By doing this, it allows businesses to find weaknesses in the products produced before, thus leading to improvements and expansion on the aforementioned product. Therefore, it could also lead to customer preference, which is essential in market success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fifield|first1=P.|title=Marketing Strategy|date=2008|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature of early followers and the research time being later than Market Pioneers, different development strategies are used as opposed to those who entered the market in the beginning,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and the same is applied to those who are Late Followers in the market. By having a different strategy, it allows the followers to create their own unique selling point and perhaps target a different audience in comparison to that of the Market Pioneers. Early following into a market can often be encouraged by an established business’ product that is “threatened or has industry-specific supporting assets”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=W.|last2=Fornell|first2=C.|last3=Sullivan|first3=M.|title=Are Market Pioneers Intrinsically Stronger Than Later Entrants?|doi=10.1002/smj.4250130804|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=1992|volume=13|issue=8|pages=609–624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Late Entrants =====

Those who follow after the Close Followers are known as the Late Entrants. While being a Late Entrant can seem very daunting, there are some perks to being a latecomer. For example, Late Entrants have the ability to learn from those who are already in the market or have previously entered.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Late Followers have the advantage of learning from their early competitors and improving the benefits or reducing the total costs. This allows them to create a strategy that could essentially mean gaining market share and most importantly, staying in the market. In addition to this, markets evolve, leading to consumers wanting improvements and advancements on products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haleblian|first1=J.|last2=Mcnamara|first2=G.|last3=Kolev|first3=K.|last4=Dykes|first4=B.|title=Exploring Firm Characteristics That Differentiate Leaders From Followers In Industry Merger Waves: A Competitive Dynamics Perspective|doi=10.1002/smj.1961|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=2012|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1037–1052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late Followers have the advantage of catching the shifts in customer needs and wants towards the products.&lt;ref name="First-Mover Advantages"/&gt; When bearing in mind customer preference, customer value has a significant influence. Customer value means taking into account the investment of customers as well as the brand or product.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christopher|first1=M.|title=From Brand Values to Customer Value|journal=Journal of Marketing Practice: Applied Marketing Science|volume=2|pages=55–66|doi=10.1108/EUM0000000000007|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is created through the “perceptions of benefits” and the “total cost of ownership”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; On the other hand, if the needs and wants of consumers have only slightly altered, Late Followers could have a cost advantage over early entrants due to the use of product imitation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, if a business is switching markets, this could take the cost advantage away due to the expense of changing markets for the business. Late Entry into a market does not necessarily mean there is a disadvantage when it comes to market share, it depends on how the marketing mix is adopted and the performance of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkie|first1=D.|last2=Johnson|first2=L.|last3=White|first3=L.|title=Overcoming late entry: the importance of entry position, inferences and market leadership|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2014.981567|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|date=2015|volume=31|issue=3–4|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the marketing mix is not used correctly – despite the entrant time – the business will gain little to no advantages, potentially missing out on a significant opportunity.

'''The differentiated strategy'''
{{Further|Marketing Mix Modeling}}
'''The customised target strategy'''
{{Further|Strategy dynamics}}

The requirements of individual customer markets are unique, and their purchases sufficient to make viable the design of a new marketing mix for each customer.

If a company adopts this type of market strategy, a separate marketing mix is to be designed for each customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=foundations of marketing|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific marketing mixes can be developed to appeal to most of the segments when market segmentation reveals several potential targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=foundations of marketing|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=128|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing marketing goals and objectives ==

Whereas the vision and mission provide the framework, the "goals define targets within the mission, which, when achieved, should move the organization toward the performance of that mission."&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, G. C., ''Designing Strategy,'' 1986, p. 5 &lt;/ref&gt; ''Goals'' are broad primary outcomes whereas, ''objectives'' are measurable steps taken to achieve a goal or strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Belicove, M. R., "Understanding Goals, Strategy, Objectives And Tactics In The Age Of Social," ''Forbes,'' 27 September, 2013, Online: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikalbelicove/2013/09/27/understanding-goals-strategies-objectives-and-tactics-in-the-age-of-social/#1e07d4a54c79&lt;/ref&gt; In strategic planning, it is important for managers to translate the overall strategy into goals and objectives. Goals are designed to inspire action and focus attention on specific desired outcomes. Objectives, on the other hand, are used to measure an organisation's performance on specific dimensions, thereby providing the organisation with feedback on how well it is achieving its goals and strategies. 

Managers typically establish objectives using the ''[[balanced scorecard]]'' approach. This means that objectives do not include desired financial outcomes exclusively, but also specify measures of performance  for customers (e.g. satisfaction, loyalty, repeat patronage), internal processes (e.g., employee satisfaction, productivity) and innovation and improvement activities.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, S. and Norton, D. P., "Putting the Balanced Scorecard to Work," in ''Focusing Your Organization on Strategy—with the Balanced Scorecard,'' [Harvard Business Review Collection], 2nd edition, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; 

After setting the goals marketing strategy or [[marketing plan]] should be developed. The marketing strategy plan provides an outline of the specific actions to be taken over time to achieve the objectives. Plans can be extended to cover many years, with sub-plans for each year.  Plans usually involve monitoring, to assess progress, and prepare for contingencies if problems arise. Simultaneous such as [[customer lifetime value]] models can be used to help marketers conduct "what-if" analyses to forecast what potential scenarios arising from possible actions, and to gauge how specific actions might affect such variables as the revenue-per-customer and the [[churn rate]].

==Strategy typologies==
Developing competitive strategy requires significant judgement and is based on a deep understanding of the firm's current situation, its past history and its operating environment. No heuristics have yet been developed to assist strategists choose the optimal strategic direction. Nevertheless some researchers and scholars have sought to classify broad groups of strategy approaches that might serve as broad frameworks for thinking about suitable choices.

===Raymond Miles' strategy categories===
In 2003, [[Raymond Miles]] proposed a detailed scheme using the categories:&lt;ref&gt;Miles, R. and Snow, C. C., ''Organizational Strategy, Structure, and Process,'' Stanford University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8047-4840-3}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prospectors: proactively seek to locate and exploit new market opportunities
* Analyzers: are very innovative in their product-market choices; tend to follow prospectors into new markets; often introduce new or improved product designs
* Defenders: are relatively cautious in their initiatives; seek to seal off a portion of the market which they can defend against competitive incursions; often market highest quality offerings and position as a quality leader
* Reactors: tend to vacillate in their responses to environmental changes and are generally the least profitable organisations

===Marketing warfare===

[[Marketing warfare strategies]] are competitor-centered strategies drawn from analogies with the field of military science. Warfare strategies were popular in the 1980s, but interest in this approach has waned in the new era of relationship marketing. An increased awareness of the distinctions between business and military cultures also raises questions about the extent to which this type of analogy is useful.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, D., "Marketing Warfare Strategies," in ''Wiley International Encyclopedia of Marketing, Vol 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its limitations, the typology of marketing warfare strategies is useful for predicting and understanding competitor responses.

In the 1980s, Kotler and Singh developed a typology of marketing warfare strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P. and Singh, E., "Marketing Warfare in the 1980s," in ''Marketing: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management,'' Vol 3, Michael John Baker (ed),Taylor and Francis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Frontal attack: where an aggressor goes head to head for the same market segments on an offer by offer, price by price basis; normally used by a market challenger against a more dominant player 
:* Flanking attack: attacking an organisation on its weakest front; used by market challengers
:* Bypass attack: bypassing the market leader by attacking smaller, more vulnerable target organisations in order to broaden the aggressor's resource base 
:* Encirclement attack: attacking a dominant player on all fronts
:* Guerilla warfare: sporadic, unexpected attacks using both conventional and unconventional means to attack a rival; normally practiced by smaller players against the market leader

==Relationship between the marketing strategy and the marketing mix==

The generic, competitive strategy provides overall structure and guidance for day-to-day operational planning and decision-making. The 4P’s (Price, Product, Place and Promotion), also known as the marketing mix or marketing program represent the tools that marketers can use in day-to-day operational planning. This marketing program enables marketers a means for turning the long-term vision into every day practice. By tweaking the elements of the marketing mix, marketers can  adjust the offer to meet different requirements for the current situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.5539/ijms.v1n1p2|title=A Review of Marketing Mix: 4P's or More|last=Goi|first=Chai Lee|date=2009|volume=1|issue=1|journal=International Journal of Marketing Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Nanpa'''|ナンパ}}, also [[romanization of Japanese|transliterated]] as '''nampa''', in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] is a type of [[flirting]] and [[seduction]] popular among [[Adolescence|teenagers]] and people in their twenties and thirties.

When Japanese women pursue men in a fashion similar to nanpa, it is called {{nihongo|'''gyakunan'''|ギャクナン}}.&lt;ref name="gyakunan"&gt;Botting, Geoff. [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20010408tc.html#1 "Japanese women on top."] ''[[The Japan Times]]'', April 8, 2001. Reprinted from ''Spa!'', April 4, 2001. Reviewed November 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Nanpa was a new word of the Meiji era with the opposite word [[Kouha]]. It was originally rendered in kanji as [[wikt:軟派|軟派]] (lit. "the soft school"). The meaning of nanpa was continually changing and different from what it means today. Initially, it referred to a political term with the meaning of "parties with soft opinion and proposition" or "people who are unable to claim a strong opinion" (1892), then it referred to "departments or reporters who are responsible for the articles of glossy things like social or literary in newspapers and magazines" (1901), eventually it meant "a faction of the youth who are enjoying pursuit of the opposite sex and fine clothing" (1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nihon Kokugo Daijiten 2nd edition|last = |first = |publisher = Shogakukan|year = 2001|isbn = 4095210109|location = Tokyo|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it means people interested more in fun and self-indulgence than in "hard" pursuits like politics, academia, or athletics. In contemporary Japanese culture, nanpa most often refers to "girl hunting" and there is a strong negative connotation associated with it.

The word for boyfriend hunting by women, gyakunan, derives from {{nihongo|gyaku|逆||lit. "reverse"}}, and the first part of the word nanpa.&lt;ref name="gyakunan" /&gt;

==Description==
Nanpa is seen most often in young men ranging from their late teens to mid-twenties. Groups of "nanpa boys" will gather around places with busy, predominantly female [[Pedestrian|foot traffic]] (bridges, subway stations, shopping malls, etc.) and approach women in search of a date. The nanpa groups generally wear high fashion with nice suits, expensive shoes, and extravagant hair styles. Because of their style of dress, nanpa boys are occasionally misinterpreted by [[Gaijin|foreigners]] as employees of [[Host and hostess clubs#Host clubs|host clubs]], who also roam such areas speaking with various women.{{citation needed|date = April 2018}}

Because of increasing number of nanpa participants and rising complaints, many Japanese regions are reacting more harshly to participants. For example, many youth hangouts such as arcades are posting "No Nanpa" signs, and police in highly populated Japanese cities have been enforcing these rules. This may be in reaction to a growing fear in young Japanese women of abduction or rape. The [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] district is particularly strict on nanpa boys in the wake of the abduction of four girls by a middle aged man in July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/16/world/tokyo-journal-a-flashy-teenage-trend-capital-and-its-dark-side.html|title=Tokyo Journal; A Flashy Teenage Trend Capital, and Its Dark Side|first=Norimitsu|last=Onishi|date=16 September 2003|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex nanpa==
Japan also has a [[homosexuality|same-sex]] nanpa culture, especially within the gay entertainment district of [[Shinjuku ni-chome]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5929">The '''National Commission for Justice and Peace''' (NCJP) was formed in 1985 by the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of Pakistan]]. It provides services in the field of human rights advocacy. It has seven regional offices in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan, Hyderabad and Quetta, Karachi and a head office in Lahore, which provide legal aid and human rights education. Under the legal aid program, the commission provides legal counselling and financial assistance. NCJP has dealt with about 800 cases during their first 22 years.

The first advocacy campaign was launched by NCJP against bonded labour in brick kiln factories in 1987. With other organizations joining in, this campaign achieved some success. A law on abolition of bonded labour was passed in 1992. The Commission now concentrates on bonded labour in the agricultural sector.

NCJP reacts to discriminatory laws and state policies. In 1988, the Commission filed an appeal in the Supreme Court of Pakistan against the system of Separate Electorates in the country.

In 1992 when the government tried to include religion on the National Identity Card, the civil society in Pakistan waged a countrywide campaign under the leadership of NCJP’s Chairperson Bishop [[John Joseph (bishop)|John Joseph]]. The campaign was successful and the government was forced to withdraw the decision.

The Commission’s work has been lauded as courageous being named as almost the only voice for the Hindu minority.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, David. Notes from the Fortune-telling Parrot: Islam and the struggle for Religious Pluralism in Pakistan. Equinox Publishing Co London, 2008. p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010 the Commission opened an office in Karachi – its eighth in the country. The event marked the silver jubilee of the Commission. Father Saleh Diego is the Commission’s regional coordinator.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/2010/03/19/church-opens-human-rights-office-in-southern-pakistan/  UCANews March 19, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

NCJP is a member organization of the [[Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development]] (FORUM-ASIA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forum-asia.org/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;catid=26&amp;Itemid=72&lt;/ref&gt;


==Blasphemy laws==
Since 1990 the Commission has defended cases of blasphemy against Muslims, Christians and Hindus, and has campaigned for abolition of the blasphemy laws.

Fr Emmanuel Y. Mani, National Director since 1995, spoke at a press conference sponsored by AsiaNews titled “Save Christians and Pakistan from the blasphemy laws”. He informed international public opinion about the institutional injustices against religious minorities, in particular against the Christian community in Pakistan.
The international community is putting pressure on the Pakistani government to stop discrimination and violence against religious minorities.

Blasphemy laws include Article 295, Sections B and C, and Article 298, Sections A, B and C, of the Pakistan Penal Code.  These laws were incorporated into the criminal justice system between 1980 and 1986 by then President of Pakistan Zia-ul-Haq, supposedly to ensure respect for the Prophet Mohammed, his Companions and the Quran. These laws are unique in the contemporary world because they allow dubious charges to be brought against people who have been subjected to extra judicial killings, arson and destruction of their property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Blasphemy-laws-and-religious-discrimination,-an-attack-on-Pakistan%E2%80%99s-future-16823.html Asianews 11/10/2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentalism==

In 2009 Peter Jacob, national secretary of NCJP, spoke out against the agreement between the local government and the Taliban, which allowed the introduction of sharia (Islamic) law,  in exchange for a ceasefire in the district of [[Malakand District|Malakand]], which includes the [[Swat valley]], in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]]. The agreement was signed yesterday by the government of the NWFP and the Taliban&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Justice-and-Peace:-sharia-in-Swat-valley-is-a-defeat-for-entire-country-14506.html AsiaNews.it 17 February 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Several civil society organisations have taken notice of religious hate speeches and school textbook content and urged the government to take the issue seriously.
According to a recent report by NCJP, the commission monitored four major national Urdu dailies from August to October 2005 and found extremely provocative news reports, statements and editorials against religious minorities including Christians, Hindus, Ahmadis and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C04%5C25%5Cstory_25-4-2006_pg7_26 Daily Times 25 April 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

NCJP has demanded that the government make provision for non-Muslim students to receive religious lessons in their own faith in lieu of courses on Islamic belief and practice. Archbishop [[Lawrence Saldanha]] of Lahore, the commission's chairman, and Peter Jacob, its executive secretary, expressed their concern in a press release.

==Recognition==
In November 2016, the Commission was awarded the 2016 [[Pax Christi]] International Peace Award for "the nonviolent struggle of the human rights community in Pakistan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/news/pakistani-church-groups-honored-with-international-peace-award/77540 UCANews November 4, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984''' ({{UnitedStatesCode|23|158}}) was passed by the [[United States Congress]] on July 17, 1984.&lt;ref name=lstldajl&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YFhWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=--4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1712%2C1053218 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=''(New York Times)'' |title=Law signed to lift drinking age |date=July 18, 1984 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rsdrail&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uYNfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zjAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3239%2C446332 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |agency=Associated Press |title=Reagan signs drinking age into law |date=July 18, 1984 |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=40164 |title=Ronald Reagan: 'Remarks on Signing a National Minimum Drinking Age Bill,' July 17, 1984 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a controversial bill that punished every state that allowed persons below 21 years to purchase and publicly possess [[alcoholic beverage]]s by reducing its annual federal highway apportionment by 10 percent. The law was later amended, lowering the penalty to 8 percent from fiscal year 2012 and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/map21/docs/title23usc.pdf Title 23 of the United States Code, Highways. (PDF file, see Section 158)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its name, this act did not outlaw the ''consumption'' of alcoholic beverages by those under 21 years of age, just its ''purchase''. However, [[Alabama]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Michigan]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Vermont]], and the [[District of Columbia]] extended the law into an outright ban. The minimum purchase and drinking ages is a state law, and most states still permit "underage" consumption of alcohol in some circumstances. In some states, no restriction on private consumption is made, while in other states, consumption is only allowed in specific locations, in the presence of consenting and supervising family members, as in the states of [[Colorado]], [[Maryland]], [[Montana]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], [[West Virginia]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]. The act also does not seek to criminalize alcohol consumption during religious occasions (e.g. [[Sacramental wine|communion wines]], [[Kiddush]]).

The act was expressly upheld as constitutional in 1987 by the United States Supreme Court in ''[[South Dakota v. Dole]]''.

==History==
Legislation concerning the legal minimum drinking age in the United States can be traced back to the days of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. In 1920, the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] declared it illegal to manufacture, transport, or sell intoxicating liquors.&lt;ref name="Toomey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toomey | first1 = Traci L. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = Toben F. | last3 = Lenk | first3 = Kathleen M. | year = 2009 | title = The age-21 minimum legal drinking age: a case study linking past and current debates | url = | journal = Addiction | volume = 104 | issue = 12| pages = 1958–965 | doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02742.x | pmid=19922564}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was repealed with the passing of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] in 1933, which was followed by the adoption of minimum legal drinking age policies in all states, with most states electing a minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) of 21.&lt;ref name="Toomey" /&gt; Between 1970 and 1975, 29 states lowered the MLDA from 21 to 18, 19, or 20. This was primarily due to the passing of the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]], which lowered the required voting age from 21 to 18.&lt;ref name="Toomey" /&gt;

During the 1960s, both [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the state legislatures came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum [[voting age]] from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the [[Vietnam War]], in which many young men who were ineligible to vote (or legally drink) were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the people sending them off to risk their lives. "Old enough to fight, old enough to vote," was a common slogan used by proponents of lowering the voting age. The slogan traced its roots to [[World War II]], when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] lowered the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]] age to 18. With the lowering of the voting age to 18, the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) was similarly lowered under the notion that by being able to vote (and for males, be subject to being involuntarily drafted into the enlisted ranks of the military), one should also be able to legally consume alcoholic beverages.

However, these changes were soon followed by studies showing an increase in motor vehicle fatalities attributable to the decreased MLDA. In response to these findings, many states raised the minimum legal drinking age to 19 (and sometimes to 20 or 21).&lt;ref name="Toomey" /&gt; In 1984, the National Minimum Legal Drinking Act, written by Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] (D-NJ) and influenced by [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD), required all states to enforce a minimum legal drinking age of 21 or else risk losing 10% of all federal highway construction funds.

As the MLDA was still left to the discretion of the state, the act did not violate the [[21st Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st amendment]] which reserved the right to regulate alcohol for all responsibilities not specifically appointed to the federal government to the states.&lt;ref name="Toomey" /&gt; However, as the act controlled the distribution of anywhere from $8 million to $99 million, depending on the size of the state, the act gave a strong incentive for states to change the drinking age to 21.&lt;ref name="Toomey" /&gt; By 1995, all 50 states, two permanently inhabited territories, and D.C. were in compliance, but Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (and Guam until 2010) remained at 18 despite them losing 10% of federal highway funding.

Professor of law Tim Jost noted that the [[Roberts Court]] ruling in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius|NFIB v. Sebelius]]'', though upholding ''[[South Dakota v. Dole]]'', had serious implications for future laws that incentivize state action.&lt;ref&gt;http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/07/drinking-age-supreme-court-health-care.php&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Court expressly distinguished ''South Dakota v. Dole'', the drinking age case, because only a small portion of highway funds were at risk.... There will certainly be future litigation when other federal programs are changed and all of the funding for the existing program is at risk, however.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Constitutional lawyer [[Adam Winkler]] disagrees saying&lt;ref&gt;http://legallyliterate.com/federal-law-21-minimum-drinking-age/&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The health care decision on Medicaid is likely to be limited to its facts.... Where a state's budget is truly dependent on federal dollars to survive, then conditional spending offers will be called into question. The health care decision doesn't purport to call into question any previous conditional spending law. And its not likely to have much impact because there's no clear majority opinion establishing new limits.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Conservative Party of New York]] opposed the passage of the law in 1984.  In 2001, according to the same article, [[New York State Assembly]] [[List of members of the New York State Assembly|member]] [[Félix Ortiz]] introduced a bill that would lower the drinking age back to 18. He cited unfairness and difficulty with enforcement as his motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Lovett, Kenneth. "LET KIDS START DRINKING AT 18: BROOKLYN POL". ''[[New York Post]]'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the [[National Youth Rights Association]] was founded, in part, to seek to lower the drinking age back to 18. In 2004, the president of Vermont's [[Middlebury College]], [[John McCardell, Jr.]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "the 21-year-old drinking age is bad social policy and terrible law" that has made the college drinking problem far worse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/13/opinion/13mccardell.html The New York Times &gt; Opinion &gt; Op-Ed Contributor: What Your College President Didn't Tell You&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Groups that oppose the 21 minimum include [[Choose Responsibility]], the [[Amethyst Initiative]], and [[Students for Sensible Drug Policy]].

[[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] supports the 21 law and has been the main opponent to lowering it back to 18. Several public and private universities in the country have also been a major supporter of the 21 law, plus various health organizations such as the [[American Medical Association]]. 

A key cluster of philosophical opposition to the minimum lies in the natural human need for education and experience; young adults do not receive the opportunity to educate themselves and drink responsibly before the age of 21.  A related line of thought emphasizes the importance of individual rights and freedoms.&lt;ref name="Toomey" /&gt;  Another cluster comes from [[pragmatism]], emphasizing the reality that young people are unlikely to stop drinking, and point to statistics on underage drinking as a reason to institute a lower drinking age, which would provide the opportunity to help "young people learn to make healthy and responsible choices".&lt;ref name="Toomey" /&gt;  [[Social environment]]al theories are also cited; making alcohol a [[forbidden fruit]] may encourage more dangerous drinking than would occur if the drinking age were lowered.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = Christopher | last2 = Dobkin | first2 = Carlos | year = 2011 | title = The Minimum Legal Drinking Age and Public Health | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 133–56 | doi=10.1257/jep.25.2.133 | pmid=21595328 | pmc=3182479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Engs"&gt;Ruth C. Engs Forbidden Fruit. Vermont Quarterly, Winter 1999:25 &amp; 47, 1999. [http://www.indiana.edu/~engs/articles/fruit.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  With a lower drinking age, young people would have access to "publicly moderated drinking environments", rather than "model their behavior after the excessive consumption typical of private student parties",&lt;ref name="Rasul"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rasul | first1 = Jawaid W. | last2 = Rommel | first2 = Robert G. | last3 = Jacquez | first3 = Geoffrey M. | last4 = Fitzpatrick | first4 = Ben G. | last5 = Ackleh | first5 = Azmy S. | last6 = Simonsen | first6 = Neal | last7 = Scribner | first7 = Richard A. | year = 2011 | title = Heavy Episodic Drinking on College Campuses: Does Changing the Legal Drinking Age Make a Difference? | url = | journal = Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 15–23 | doi=10.15288/jsad.2011.72.15| pmc = 3001676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the perception of excessive drinking on college campuses is often overstated.&lt;ref name="Rasul" /&gt;

When brewing magnate [[Pete Coors]] raised the drinking age as a campaign issue during the [[United States Senate election in Colorado, 2004|2004 U.S. Senate race]] in [[Colorado]], Republican leaders praised his stand on [[states' rights]] but distanced themselves from apparent [[conflict of interest|self-interest]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/jun/24/20040624-121757-9276r/?page=all&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6089481/ns/politics-tom_curry/t/pivotal-colo-race-focuses-teen-drinking/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application on college campuses==
College campuses across the nation continue to struggle with issues of underage drinking, despite the nationwide MLDA of 21. The [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) took special interest in this issue, and compiled a list of recommendations for colleges to implement in order to combat underage drinking on campus. However, few schools have actually implemented these recommendations, and according to a recent study, most of the intervention programs currently in place on college campuses have proven ineffective. Underage drinking is nearly impossible to prevent on college campuses because access to alcoholic beverages is extremely easy.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Toben F. | last2 = Toomey | first2 = Traci L. | last3 = Lenk | first3 = Kathleen M. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Darin J. | last5 = Winters | first5 = Ken C. | year = 2010 | title = Implementation of NIAAA College Drinking Task Force Recommendations: How Are Colleges Doing 6 Years Later? | url = | journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 34 | issue = 10| pages = 1687–1693 | doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01268.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is not the only factor that contributes to student drinking, liquor's contraband status seems to imbue it with mystique.  As a result, use and abuse of liquor is seen as sophisticated and is expected.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael Clay and Margaret D Smith. "Treat Students As Adults: Set The Drinking Age At 18, Not 21." 2009. ebscohost.com. Web. 6 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the colleges surveyed, 98% offered alcohol education programs to their students. Only 50% of surveyed colleges offered intervention programs, 33% coordinated efforts with the surrounding community to monitor illegal alcohol sales, 15% confirmed that surrounding establishments offered responsible beverage service training, and 7% restricted the number of alcohol outlets within the community. Special services for "problem drinkers" were available at 67% of the surveyed schools; 22% of the schools referred problem drinkers to off-campus resources, and 11% offered no intervention program whatsoever. 34% of the surveyed schools were located in communities which actively instituted compliance checks, but 60% of these checks occurred without university involvement. One fifth of surveyed schools were all together unaware of the NIAAA's recommendations.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

Many factors may explain colleges' failure to implement the NIAAA's recommendations to control underage drinking on campus: a lack of university funding, a lack of time, a perceived lack of authority or [[jurisdiction]] within the community, or even a lack of interest on the part of the university, many universities even see the program as a waste of resources. Whatever the reasons may be, a multitude of options are available should colleges choose to institute programs to decrease instances of underage drinking on campus. These options include, but are not limited to, alcohol education programs, [[social norms]] campaigns, substance-free housing, individual interventions, parental notification policies, disciplinary procedures for alcohol-related violations, and [[amnesty]] policies to protect the health and safety of students.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

==Effects==
{{Expand section|date=December 2015|small=no}}Several studies, including a 2011 review, were found to disprove the idea that raising the drinking age to 21 actually saved lives in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shsu.edu/~dpg006/politicaleconomy.pdf EVIDENCE AND EVALUATION: THE NATIONAL MINIMUM DRINKING AGE ACT OF 1984, Darren Grant, Sam Houston State University, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Males|first1=Mike|title=Should California Reconsider Its Legal Drinking Age?|url=http://www.cjhp.org/Volume6_2008/Issue2/Males.pdf|journal=Californian Journal of Health Promotion|date=2008|volume=6|number=2|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Miron|first1=J|last2=Tetelbaum|first2=E|title=Does the Minimum Legal Drinking Age Save Lives?|date=2009|

They also find that the 21 drinking age appears to have only a minor impact on teen drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Miron|first1=J|last2=Tetelbaum|first2=E|title=Does the Minimum Legal Drinking Age Save Lives?|date=2009|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4319664|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.2008.00179.x|volume=47|journal=Economic Inquiry|pages=317–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some evidence that traffic deaths were merely shifted from the 18-20 age group to the 21-24 age group rather than averted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youthrights.org/issues/drinking-age/frequently-asked-questions/ Frequently Asked Questions, National Youth Rights Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dee|first1=Thomas|last2=Evans|first2=William|journal=American Economic Review|volume=91|number=2|pages=91–96|title=Behavioral Policies and Teen Traffic Safety|date=2001|url=http://drinkingage.procon.org/sourcefiles/DeeBehavioralPoliciesAndTeenTrafficSafety.pdf|doi=10.1257/aer.91.2.91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Additionally, Canada, Australia, the UK, and several other nations saw similar or faster declines in traffic fatalities than the USA did since the early 1980s despite not raising their drinking ages to 21.&lt;ref&gt;https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/FewerYoungDrivers/iv__what_caused.htm#g.%20canadian Determine Why There Are Fewer

FINAL REPORT&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the magnitude of any public health and safety benefits of the 21 drinking age, at least relative to a legal drinking age of 18, remains unclear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2296">The '''Natural World Book Prize''' was an award organised by [[The Wildlife Trusts]], and presented to recognise environmental literature. Considered the premier environmental book prize in the UK, it was sometimes referred to as the 'green [[Booker Prize|Booker]]'. It was formerly known as the '''BP Natural World Book Prize''' (after its sponsor, [[BP]]), and in origin it was a merging of two previous awards, BP's '''Sir Peter Kent Book Prize''', and a competition run by ''The Natural World'', the magazine of the Wildlife Trusts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2200">In several [[Akan people|Akan]] nations of [[Ghana]], the '''Omanhene''' is the title of the supreme traditional ruler ('king') in a region or a larger town. The omanhene is the central figure and institution of the nation. He has no function in the Ghanaian state, but has an enormous effect on the people that constitute it.

The omanhene is a major land owner, and is the head of an essentially feudal system. He commits the land he theoretically holds in trust to [[Property caretaker|caretakers]].

Omanhenes are appointed by [[queen mother]]s that are often but not necessarily their birth mothers. Dynastic succession tends to follow a matrilinial pattern. The exception to this is found, though, in the case of the Omanhene of [[Elmina]].

Not all Akan nations have the Omanhene as the supreme ruler. The [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], for example, have as supreme ruler the person of the [[Asantehene]] ( or 'Emperor'), who is superior to the Omanhenes of [[Asanteman]].

'Hene' can be found in other titles of rulers in Ghanaian nations. For example, the chief of the Dagomba in the north of Ghana is known as the 'Dagombahene'.

'''Plushophilia''' (from "[[Stuffed toy|plushie]]" and "[[-phil-|-philia]]") is a [[paraphilia]] involving [[stuffed animals]]. Most plushophiles modify their [[plushies]] with a hole or holes reminiscent of those found in sex toys, to allow them to sexually interact with their plushies. Plushophiles are sometimes called ''plushies'', although this term (plushies) can also refer to non-sexual stuffed animal enthusiasts, and to stuffed animals in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Hill|first = Dave|title = Cuddle Time|newspaper = [[Salon.com]]|date = 2000-06-19|url =  http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/06/19/plushies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/04/news/cl-6207 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Once Seen as Taboos, Sexual Fetishes Are Gaining Acceptance | first=Kathleen | last=Kelleher | date=2001-06-04 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Furry fandom ==
Plushophilia is sometimes assumed to be a practice common within [[furry fandom]], due in part to a 2001 article by ''Vanity Fair'' that linked various members of the furry community with plushophilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Malisow |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2003-12-18/news/wild-kingdom/ |title=Wild Kingdom |publisher=Houston Press |date=2003-12-18 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2001/041201/cover.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830043412/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2001/041201/cover.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 30, 2002 |accessdate=November 15, 2009 |df= |title=Montreal's furries and furverts defend their unusual lifestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kates |first=Tasha |url=http://citypaper.net/articles/2004-07-08/cb2.shtml |title=Animal Magnetism |publisher=Citypaper.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713170850/http://citypaper.net/articles/2004-07-08/cb2.shtml |archivedate=2015-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pittsburgh_city"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1998 survey of 360 members of the furry community suggested less than one percent (that is, fewer than four people) attested to being plushophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visi.com/~phantos/furrysoc.html |title=The Darken Hollow - Thoughts - Furry Sociology |publisher=Visi.com |date=2002-08-01 |accessdate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015191107/http://www.visi.com/~phantos/furrysoc.html |archivedate=2006-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography and sexual activity involving [[anthropomorphism|animal anthropomorphism]] (including plushophilia and paraphilias involving [[fursuit]]s and [[cartoon animal]]s) is known in the furry fandom community as "[[Furry fandom#Sexual aspects|yiff]]" (and sexual acts as "yiffing").&lt;ref name="pittsburgh_city"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8355287.stm | work=BBC News | title=Who are the furries? | date=2009-11-13 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Being in another form ==
[[Anne Lawrence]] has proposed that sexual arousal that depends upon imagining one's self as plush or "representations of anthropomorphic animal characters in [[animated cartoon]]s" be termed '''autoplushophilia'''.&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;Lawrence, A. A. (2009). Erotic target location errors: An under appreciated paraphilic dimension. ''The Journal of Sex Research, 46,'' 194-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Paraphilic interests that involve being in another form have been referred to as [[erotic target location error]]s.

Russian culture grew from that of the [[East Slavs]], with their [[pagan]] beliefs and specific way of life in the wooded, steppe and forest-steppe areas of far Eastern Europe or Eurasia. Early [[Russians|Russian]] culture and people were much influenced by [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] tribes, by [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] tribes, by [[Tatars|Tatar]] people, by the [[nomadic]] tribes of the [[Pontic steppe|Eurasian Steppe]] mainly of [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]]-[[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranic origin]] and in the late [[1st millennium AD]] by the [[Varangians]] (supposedly [[Scandinavia]]n [[Vikings]]). Early Slavic tribes in European Russia were much shaped by the fusion of Nordic-European and Oriental-Asian cultures which formed Russian identity in the [[Volga River|Volga region]] and the state [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus]]'. [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] missionaries began arriving from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 9th century, and Kievan Rus' [[Christianization of the Kievan Rus'|converted to Orthodox Christianity]] in 988. This largely defined the Russian culture of the [[Millennium of Russia|next millennium]] as the synthesis of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Byzantine]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Curtis&gt;{{cite web|last=excerpted from Glenn E. Curtis (ed.)|title=Russia: A Country Study: Kievan Rus' and Mongol Periods|publisher=Washington, DC: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress|year=1998|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Kievan.html|accessdate=20 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230631/http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Kievan.html|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rus' was expressed in the self-assertion of its own Eurasian culture. After the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Russia remained the largest Orthodox nation in the world and claimed succession to the Byzantine legacy in the form of the [[Third Rome]] idea. At different points in its history, the country was also strongly influenced by the culture of Western Europe. Since the [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|reforms of Peter the Great]], for two centuries Russian culture largely developed in the general context of [[European culture]] rather than pursuing its own unique ways. The situation changed in the 20th century, when the [[Communism|Communist ideology]] became a major factor in the [[Soviet culture|culture of the Soviet Union]], where Russia, in the form of the [[Russian SFSR]], was the largest and leading part.

Nowadays, Russian cultural heritage is ranked seventh in the [[Nation Brands Index]], based on interviews of some 20,000 people mainly from [[Western countries]] and the Far East. Due to the relatively late involvement of Russia in modern globalization and international tourism, many aspects of Russian culture, like [[Russian jokes]] and Russian art, remain largely unknown to foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Up Russian|publisher=Aleksandr Strezev, Principia |url=http://www.classybro.com/2014/07/20-funny-experiences-growing-russian-america/|accessdate=4 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folklore===
{{main|Slavic mythology|Russian folklore}}

New Russian [[folklore]] takes its roots in the [[pagan]] beliefs of ancient [[Slavs]] which is nowadays still represented in the [[Russian folklore]]. Epic Russian [[bylina]]s are also  an important part of [[Slavic mythology]]. The oldest bylinas of [[Kiev]]an cycle were actually recorded mostly in the [[Northwestern Federal District|Russian North]], especially in [[Karelia]], where most of the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] national epic [[Kalevala]] was recorded as well. 
[[File:Ivanbilibin.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Buyan]]'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]

Many [[Russian fairy tale]]s and bylinas were adapted for [[Russian animation]]s, or for feature movies by famous directors like [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] (''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'', ''[[Sadko (film)|Sadko]]'') and [[Aleksandr Rou]] (''[[Morozko]]'', ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]''). Some Russian poets, including [[Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov|Pyotr Yershov]] and [[Leonid Filatov]], created a number of well-known poetical interpretations of classical Russian fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also created fully original fairy tale poems that became very popular.

Folklorists today consider the 1920s the [[Soviet Union]]'s golden age of folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards economy, could not be bothered with attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the [[Russian formalism|formalist]] and [[Finland|Finnish]] schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices.&lt;ref&gt;Felix J. Oinas, "Folklore and Politics in the Soviet Union," Slavic Review 32 (1973): 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions. Finnish scholars collected comparable tales from multiple locales and analyzed their similarities and differences, hoping to trace these epic stories’ migration paths.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oinas, "Folklore and Politics," 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power and put his [[first five-year plan]] into motion in 1928, the Soviet government began to criticize and censor folklore studies. Stalin and the Soviet regime repressed folklore, believing that it supported the old tsarist system and a capitalist economy. They saw it as a reminder of the backward Russian society that the [[Bolsheviks]] were working to surpass.&lt;ref&gt;Felix J. Oinas, "The Political Uses and Themes of Folklore in the Soviet Union," Journal of the Folklore Institute 12 (1975): 157.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep folklore studies in check and prevent "inappropriate" ideas from spreading amongst the masses, the government created the RAPP – the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]]. The RAPP specifically focused on censoring fairy tales and children's literature, believing that fantasies and "bourgeois nonsense" harmed the development of upstanding Soviet citizens. Fairy tales were removed from bookshelves and children were encouraged to read books focusing on nature and science.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Husband, "’Correcting Nature's Mistakes’: Transforming the Environment and Soviet Children's Literature, 1828–1941," Environmental History 11 (2006): 304.&lt;/ref&gt; RAPP eventually increased its levels of censorship and became the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] in 1932.

In order to continue researching and analyzing folklore, intellectuals needed to justify its worth to the Communist regime. Otherwise, collections of folklore, along with all other literature deemed useless for the purposes of Stalin's Five Year Plan, would be an unacceptable realm of study. In 1934, [[Maksim Gorky]] gave a speech to the Union of Soviet Writers arguing that folklore could, in fact, be consciously used to promote Communist values. Apart from expounding on the artistic value of folklore, he stressed that traditional legends and fairy tales showed ideal, community-oriented characters, which exemplified the model Soviet citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes Farrer, "The Soviet Folktale as an Ideological Strategy for Survival in International Business Relations," Studies in Soviet Thought 13 (1973): 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Folklore, with many of its conflicts based on the struggles of a labor-oriented lifestyle, was relevant to Communism as it could not have existed without the direct contribution of the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;Oinas, "Folklore and Politics," 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Gorky explained that folklore characters expressed high levels of optimism, and therefore could encourage readers to maintain a positive mindset, especially as their lives changed with the further development of Communism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Yuri Sokolov, the head of the folklore section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of the working people, and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Miller, "The Image of Stalin in Soviet Russian Folklore," Russian Review 39 (1980): 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found themselves on a journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished to instill in its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Schlauch]], "Folklore in the Soviet Union," Science and Society 8 (1944): 213.&lt;/ref&gt; He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.&lt;ref&gt;Schlauch, "Folklore in the Soviet Union," 215.&lt;/ref&gt;
Convinced by Gorky and Sokolov's arguments, the Soviet government and the Union of Soviet Writers began collecting and evaluating folklore from across the country. The Union handpicked and recorded particular stories that, in their eyes, sufficiently promoted the collectivist spirit and showed the Soviet regime's benefits and progress. It then proceeded to redistribute copies of approved stories throughout the population. Meanwhile, local folklore centers arose in all major cities.&lt;ref&gt;Oinas, "Political Uses and Themes," 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Responsible for advocating a sense of Soviet nationalism, these organizations ensured that the media published appropriate versions of Russian folktales in a systematic fashion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Ilya Repin - Sadko - Google Art Project levels adjustment 2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sadko]] in the Underwater Tsardom'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]
Apart from circulating government-approved fairy tales and byliny that already existed, during Stalin's rule authors parroting appropriate Soviet ideologies wrote Communist folktales and introduced them to the population. These contemporary folktales combined the structures and motifs of the old byliny with contemporary life in the Soviet Union. Called noviny, these new tales were considered the [[renaissance]] of the Russian epic.&lt;ref&gt;Oinas, "Political Uses and Themes," 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorists were called upon to teach modern folksingers the conventional style and structure of the traditional byliny. They also explained to the performers the appropriate types of Communist ideology that should be represented in the new stories and songs&lt;ref&gt;Oinas, "Political Uses and Themes," 161.&lt;/ref&gt; As the performers of the day were often poorly educated, they needed to obtain a thorough understanding of [[Marxist]] ideology before they could be expected to impart folktales to the public in a manner that suited the Soviet government. Besides undergoing extensive education, many folk performers traveled throughout the nation in order to gain insight into the lives of the working class, and thus communicate their stories more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, "Image of Stalin," 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to their crucial role in spreading Communist ideals throughout the Soviet Union, eventually some of these performers became highly valued members of Soviet society. A number of them, despite their illiteracy, were even elected as members of the Union of Soviet Writers.&lt;ref&gt;Oinas, "Political Uses and Themes," 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

These new Soviet fairy tales and folk songs primarily focused on the contrasts between a miserable life in old tsarist Russia and an improved one under Stalin's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Oinas, "Folklore and Politics," 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Their characters represented identities for which Soviet citizens should strive, exemplifying the traits of the "[[New Soviet Man]]."&lt;ref&gt;Farrer, "Ideological Strategy," 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The heroes of Soviet tales were meant to portray a transformed and improved version of the average citizen, giving the reader a clear goal for an ideal community-oriented self that the future he or she was meant to become. These new folktales replaced [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] with technology, and supernatural forces with Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;Schlauch, "Folklore in the Soviet Union," 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of receiving essential advice from a mythical being, the protagonist would be given advice from omniscient Stalin. If the character followed Stalin's divine advice, he could be assured success in all his endeavors and a complete transformation into the "New Soviet Man."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, "Image of Stalin," 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The villains of these contemporary fairy tales were the [[Whites]] and their leader Idolisce, "the most monstrous idol," who was the equivalent of the tsar. Descriptions of the Whites in noviny mirrored those of the [[Tartars]] in byliny.&lt;ref&gt;Oinas, "Political Uses and Themes," 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In these new stories, the Whites were incompetent, stagnant capitalists, while the Soviet citizens became invincible heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Husband, "Transforming the Environment," 305."&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Stalin died in March 1953, folklorists of the period quickly abandoned the new folktales. Written by individual authors and performers, noviny did not come from the oral traditions of the working class. Consequently, today they are considered pseudo-folklore, rather than genuine Soviet (or Russian) folklore.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Oinas, "Political Uses and Themes," 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Without any true connection to the masses, there was no reason noviny should be considered anything other than contemporary literature. Specialists decided that attempts to represent contemporary life through the structure and artistry of the ancient epics could not be considered genuine folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, "Image of Stalin," 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's name has been omitted from the few surviving pseudo-folktales of the period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Instead of considering folklore under Stalin a renaissance of the traditional Russian epic, today it is generally regarded as a period of restraint and falsehood.

===Literature===
{{Main|Russian literature|List of Russian-language poets|List of Russian-language writers}}

[[Russian literature]] is considered to be among the most influential and developed in the world, with some of the most famous literary works belonging to it.&lt;ref name="Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007"/&gt; Russia's literary history dates back to the 10th century; in the 18th century its development was boosted by the works of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]], and by the early 19th century a modern native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers of all time. This period and the [[Golden Age of Russian Poetry]] began with [[Alexander Pushkin]], considered to be the founder of modern Russian literature and often described as the ''"Russian Shakespeare" or the "Russian Goethe"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelly, C|title=Russian Literature: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions) (Paperback)|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|isbn=0-19-280144-9|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued in the 19th century with the poetry of [[Mikhail Lermontov]] and [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], dramas of [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], and the prose of [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]], [[Ivan Goncharov]], [[Aleksey Pisemsky]] and [[Nikolai Leskov]]. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in particular were titanic figures, to the point that many literary critics have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513793/Russian-literature|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=11 April 2008|title=Russian literature; Leo Tolstoy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Time Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943893,00.html?promoid=googlep|accessdate=10 April 2008|title=Freaking-Out with Fyodor|author=Otto Friedrich | date=6 September 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1880s Russian literature had begun to change. The age of the great novelists was over and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres of Russian literature for the next several decades, which later became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]]. Previously dominated by [[Realism (arts)|realism]], Russian literature came under strong influence of [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] in the years between 1893 and 1914. Leading writers of this age include [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Andrei Bely]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok|Aleksandr Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]], [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Osip Mandelstam]], [[Marina Tsvetaeva]], [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].

Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], Russian cultural life was left in chaos. Some prominent writers, like [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] left the country, while a new generation of talented writers joined together in different organizations with the aim of creating a new and distinctive [[working-class culture]] appropriate for the new state, the [[Soviet Union]]. Throughout the 1920s writers enjoyed broad tolerance. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with Joseph Stalin's policy of [[socialist realism]]. After his death the restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. The leading authors of the Soviet era included [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Yevgeny Zamiatin]], [[Isaac Babel]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Yury Olesha]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Michail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov|Mikhail Sholokhov]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].

The Soviet era was also the golden age of Russian [[science fiction]], that was initially inspired by western authors and enthusiastically developed with the success of [[Soviet space program]]. Authors like [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], [[Kir Bulychov]], [[Ivan Yefremov]], [[Alexander Belayev]] enjoyed mainstream popularity at the time.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Russian philosophy}}
Some Russian writers, like [[Tolstoy]] and [[Dostoyevsky]], are known also as philosophers, while many more authors are known primarily for their philosophical works. [[Russian philosophy]] blossomed since the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]].

In its further development, Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in [[creativity]], society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism|cosmos]] and religion were other primary subjects. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Vladimir Lossky]] and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. In the 20th century Russian philosophy became dominated by [[Marxism]].

===Humour===
{{Main|Russian humour|Russian jokes|Chastushka}}
Russia owes much of its wit to the great flexibility and richness of the Russian language, allowing for puns and unexpected associations. As with any other nation, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and silly [[word play]] to [[political satire]].

[[Russian jokes]], the most popular form of [[Russian humour]], are short fictional stories or dialogues with a [[punch line]]. Russian joke culture features a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots. Russians love jokes on topics found everywhere in the world, be it politics, spouse relations, or [[mother-in-law joke|mothers-in-law]].

[[Chastushka]], a type of traditional [[Russian poetry]], is a single [[quatrain]] in [[trochee|trochaic]] [[tetrameter]] with an "abab" or "abcb" [[rhyme scheme]]. Usually [[humor]]ous, [[satire|satirical]], or ironic in nature, chastushkas are often put to music as well, usually with [[balalaika]] or [[accordion]] accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and to a lesser degree, the type of humor these use) parallels [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]]. The name originates from the Russian word ''части́ть'', meaning "to speak fast."

==Visual arts==
Russian visual artworks are similar in style with the ones from other eastern Slavic countries, like [[Ukraine]] or [[Belarus]].

As early as the 12th and 13th centuries Russia had its national masters who were free of all foreign influence, i. e. that of the Greeks on the one hand, and on the other hand that of the Lombard master-masons called in b Andrei Georgievich to build the Uspensky (Assumption) Cathedral in the city of Vladimir. Russia's relations with the Greek world were hampered by the Mongol invasion, and it is to the isolation arising from this that we must attribute the originality of Slavo-Russian ornamentation, which has a character of its own, quite unlike the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] and its derivative, the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].

===Architecture===

[[File:Bus melnikov.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage]]]]
Russian architecture began with the woodcraft buildings of ancient [[Slavs]]. Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], for several centuries Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the [[Byzantine architecture]], until the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. Apart from fortifications ([[kremlin]]s), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were [[Orthodox church]]es, with their many domes, often gilded or brightly painted. [[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia. The 16th century saw the development of unique [[tent-like church]]es culminating in [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]]. By that time the [[onion dome]] design was also fully developed. In the 17th century, the "fiery style" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great reforms]] had made Russia much closer to Western culture, the change of the architectural styles in the country generally followed that of Western Europe.

The 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the splendid works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], the city of [[Saint Petersburg]] was transformed into an outdoor museum of [[Neoclassical architecture]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Byzantine and [[Russian Revival]] style (this corresponds to [[Gothic Revival]] in Western Europe). Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Fyodor Shekhtel]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Moisei Ginzburg]] and [[Victor Vesnin]]), and the [[Stalinist architecture|Stalin Empire style]] ([[Boris Iofan]]). After Stalin's death a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned the "excesses" of the former architectural styles, and in the late Soviet era the architecture of the country was dominated by plain [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created the large massives of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright architecture. After the end of the [[Soviet Union]] the situation improved. Many churches demolished in the Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in [[World War II]]. As for the original architecture, there is no more any common style in modern Russia, though [[International style (architecture)|International style]] has a great influence.

Some notable Russian buildings include:
*[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] | [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)]] | [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] | [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir]] | [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] | [[Cathedral of the Archangel]] | [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] | [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] | [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Kremlin]] |  [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] | [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] | [[Sukharev Tower]] | [[Menshikov Tower]] | [[Moscow Manege]] | [[Narva Triumphal Gate]] | [[Kolomenskoye]] | [[Peterhof Palace]] | [[Gatchina]] | [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] | [[Solovetsky Monastery]] | [[Kunstkamera]] | [[Russian Museum]] | [[Catherine Palace]] | [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] | [[Winter Palace]] | [[Simonov Monastery]] | [[Novodevichy Convent]] | [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] | [[Tatlin's Tower]] | [[Palace of the Soviets]] | [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)]] | [[All-Soviet Exhibition Centre]] | [[Ostankino Tower]] | [[Triumph-Palace]] | [[White House of Russia]]

===Handicraft===
{{further information|Matryoshka doll}}
{{see also|Russian lacquer art}}
[[File:Russian-Matroshka.jpg|thumb|right|[[Matryoshka doll]].]]
[[Matryoshka doll]] is a Russian nesting doll. A set of Matryoshka dolls consist of a wooden figure which can be pulled apart to reveal another figure of the same sort but somewhat smaller inside. It has in turn another somewhat smaller figure inside, and so on. The number of nested figures is usually six or more. The shape is mostly cylindrical, rounded at the top for the head and tapered towards the bottom, but little else. The dolls have no extremities, (except those that are painted). The true artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be extremely elaborate. The theme is usually peasant girls in traditional dress, but can be almost anything; for instance, fairy tales or Soviet leaders.

Other forms of Russian handicraft include [[khokhloma]], [[Dymkovo toy]], [[Gzhel (ceramics)|gzhel]], [[Zhostovo painting]], [[Filimonov toy]]s, [[Pysanka|pisanka]] and [[palekh miniature|palekh]].

===Icon painting===
{{main|Russian icons}}
{{See also|List of oldest Russian icons}}
[[File:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|left|thumb|Russian Icon; [[Rublev]]'s [[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|''Trinity'']]]]
Russian icons are typically paintings on wood, often small, though some in churches and monasteries may be as large as a table top. Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the ''krasny ugol'', the "red" or "beautiful" corner (see [[Icon Corner]]). There is a rich history and elaborate [[religious symbolism]] associated with icons. In Russian churches, the [[nave]] is typically separated from the [[sanctuary]] by an ''[[iconostasis]]'' (Russian ''ikonostás'') a wall of icons. Icon paintings in Russia attempted to help people with their prayers without idolizing the figure in the painting. The most comprehensive collection of Icon art is found at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name=icons&gt;[http://www.geographia.com/russia/rusart01.htm Russian Art and Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians—notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]—widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.

In the mid-seventeenth century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by [[Patriarch Nikon]] resulted in a split in the Russian Orthodox Church. The traditionalists, the persecuted "Old Ritualists" or "[[Old Believers]]", continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The [[Stroganov School|Stroganov movement]] and the icons from [[Nevyansk]] rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting.

===Lubok===
{{main|Lubok}}
A lubok (plural ''Lubki'', [[Cyrillic]]: {{lang-ru|лубо́к, лубо́чная картинка}}) is a Russian [[popular print]], characterized by simple [[graphics]] and [[narrative]]s derived from literature, religious stories and popular tales. Lubki prints were used as decoration in houses and inns. Early examples from the late 17th and early 18th centuries were [[woodcut]]s, then [[engraving]]s or [[etching]]s were typical, and from the mid-19th century [[lithography]]. They sometimes appeared in series, which might be regarded as predecessors of the modern [[comic strip]]. Cheap and simple books, similar to [[chapbook]]s,&lt;ref&gt; Lyons, Martyn. "Books: A Living History". Getty Publishing, 2011, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; which mostly consisted of pictures, are called '''lubok literature''' or ([[Cyrillic]]: {{lang-ru|лубочная литература}}). Both pictures and literature are commonly referred to simply as ''lubki''. The Russian word ''lubok'' derives from ''lub'' - a special type of board that pictures were printed on.

===Classical painting===
{{main|Russian visual arts|Russian Academy of Arts|Russian artists}}
The [[Russian Academy of Arts]] was created in 1757 with the aim of giving Russian artists an international role and status. Notable portrait painters from the Academy include [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Fyodor Rokotov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], and [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]].

In the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, famous academic artists focused on mythological and Biblical themes, like [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].

===Realist painting===
{{main|Peredvizhniki|Russian artists}}

[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin 009.jpg|thumb|''[[Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks]]'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]
[[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] came into dominance in the 19th century. The realists captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and [[birch]] clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Other artists focused on [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[Social realism|critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], with some artists making the circle of human suffering their main theme. Others focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history. The ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''wanderers'') group of artists broke with Russian Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from Academic restrictions. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]] and [[Ilya Repin]].

By the turn of the 20th century and on, many Russian artists developed their own unique styles, neither realist nor avante-garde. These include [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]]. Many works by the [[Peredvizhniki]] group of artists have been highly sought after by collectors in recent years. Russian art auctions during [[Russian Art Week]] in London have increased in demand and works have been sold for record breaking prices.

===Russian avant-garde===
{{Main|Russian avant-garde|List of Russian artists|Russian Futurism}}
[[File:Malevich.black-square.jpg|thumb|left|''Black Square'', 1915, by [[Kazimir Malevich]]]]
The [[Russian avant-garde]] is an umbrella term used to define the large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism|futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Pavel Filonov]] and [[Marc Chagall]]. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and 1932, at which point the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].

In the 20th century many Russian artists made their careers in Western Europe, forced to emigrate by the Revolution. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Naum Gabo]] and others spread their work, ideas, and the impact of Russian art globally.

===Soviet art===
{{Main|Soviet art|List of Russian artists}}

During the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The instrument for this was created just days before the October Revolution, known as Proletkult, an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Alexander Bogdanov]]. Initially, [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. Although Marxist in character, the Proletkult gained the disfavor of many party leaders, and by 1922 it had declined considerably. It was eventually disbanded by Stalin in 1932. ''De facto'' restrictions on what artists could paint were abandoned by the late 1980s.

However, in the late Soviet era many artists combined innovation with [[socialist realism]] including [[Ernst Neizvestny]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Mikhail Shemyakin]], [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]], [[Erik Bulatov]], and [[Vera Mukhina]]. They employed techniques as varied as [[primitivism]], [[hyperrealism]], [[grotesque]], and [[abstraction]]. Soviet artists produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] in the 1940s. After the [[Great Patriotic War]] Soviet sculptors made multiple monuments to the war dead, marked by a great restrained solemnity.

==Performance arts==

=== Russian folk music===
{{main|Russian traditional music}}
[[File:Balalaika.JPG|thumb|A [[Balalaika]]]]

Russians have distinctive traditions of [[Music of Russia#Folk music|folk music]]. Typical ethnic Russian musical instruments are [[gusli]], [[balalaika]], [[zhaleika]], balalaika contrabass, [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]] accordion, Gypsy guitar and [[garmoshka]]. Folk music had great influence on the Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, most prominent being [[Golden Ring (band)|Golden Ring]], [[Ural's Nation Choir]], [[Lyudmila Zykina]]. [[Ethnic Russian music|Russian folk songs]], as well as patriotic songs of the [[Music of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], constitute the bulk of repertoire of the world-renowned [[Alexandrov ensemble|Red Army choir]] and other popular Russian ensembles.

Russian folk dance ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Русский Народный Танец ) can generally be broken up into two main types of dances [[Khorovod]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Хоровод), a circular game type dance where the participants hold hands, sing, and the action generally happens in the middle of circle, and Plyaska ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Пляска or Плясовый), a circular dance for men and women that increases in diversity and tempo, according to Bob Renfield, considered to be the preeminent scholar on the topic. Other forms of Russian Folk Dance include Pereplyas ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Перепляс), an all-male competitive dance, Mass Dance ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Массовый пляс), an unpaired stage dance without restrictions on age or number of participants, Group Dance ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Групповая пляска) a type of mass dance employs simple round-dance passages, and improvisation, and types of Quadrilles ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Кадриль), originally a French dance brought to [[Russia]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitekid.ru/kultura_i_iskusstvo/russkie_narodnie_tantsi.html] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic Russian dances include [[khorovod]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Хоровод), [[barynya]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Барыня), [[kamarinskaya]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Камаринская), [[kazachok]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Казачок) and chechotka ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Чечётка) (a [[tap dance]] in [[bast shoe]]s and with a bayan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibelov.ru/english/concert.files/Russian%20chechotka%20in%20bast%20shoes.html Russian chechotka] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827015022/http://www.ibelov.ru/english/concert.files/Russian%20chechotka%20in%20bast%20shoes.html# |date=27 August 2011 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Troika (dance)|Troika]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Тройка) A dance with one man and two women, named after the traditional Russian carriage which is led by three horses.

===Classical music===
{{Main|Music of Russia|List of Russian composers}}
Music in 19th-century Russia was defined by the tension between classical composer [[Mikhail Glinka]] along with the other members of [[The Mighty Handful]], who embraced Russian national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions, and the [[Russian Musical Society]] led by composers [[Anton Rubinstein|Anton]] and [[Nikolai Grigoryevich Rubinstein|Nikolay Rubinstein]], which was musically conservative. The later Romantic tradition of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]], whose music has come to be known and loved for its distinctly Russian character as well as its rich harmonies and stirring melodies, was brought into the 20th century by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], one of the last great champions of the Romantic style of European classical music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norris, Gregory; ed. Stanley, Sadie|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition|publisher=MacMillian|year=1980|location=London|page=707|isbn=0-333-23111-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World-renowned composers of the 20th century included [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] and [[Georgy Sviridov]]. During most of the Soviet Era, music was highly scrutinized and kept within a conservative, accessible idiom in conformity with the policy of [[socialist realism]].

Soviet and Russian conservatories have turned out generations of world-renowned soloists. Among the best known are violinists [[David Oistrakh]] and [[Gidon Kremer]]; cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]; pianists [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Sviatoslav Richter]], and [[Emil Gilels]]; and vocalists [[Fyodor Shalyapin]], [[Galina Vishnevskaya]], [[Anna Netrebko]] and [[Dmitry Hvorostovsky]].&lt;ref name="Russia::Music"/&gt;

===Ballet===
{{main|Russian ballet|List of Russian ballet dancers}}
[[File:AP Cygne.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Anna Pavlova]]]]
The original purpose of the ballet in Russia was to entertain the imperial court. The first ballet company was the Imperial School of Ballet in St. Petersburg in the 1740s. The [[Ballets Russes]] was a ballet company founded in the 1909 by [[Sergey Diaghilev]], an enormously important figure in the Russian ballet scene. Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes' travels abroad profoundly influenced the development of dance worldwide.&lt;ref name="Garafola, L 1989 576"/&gt; The headquarters of his ballet company was located in Paris, France. A protégé of Diaghilev, [[George Balanchine]], founded the New York City Ballet Company in 1948.

During the early 20th century, Russian ballet dancers [[Anna Pavlova]] and [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] rose to fame. Soviet ballet preserved the perfected 19th century traditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cashin, K K|title=Alexander Pushkin's Influence on Russian Ballet&amp;nbsp;— Chapter Five: Pushkin, Soviet Ballet, and Afterward|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04072005-133328/unrestricted/12_kkc_chap5.pdf|accessdate=27 December 2007|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102150415/https://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04072005-133328/unrestricted/12_kkc_chap5.pdf|archivedate=2 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Soviet Union's choreography schools produced one internationally famous star after another, including [[Maya Plisetskaya]], [[Rudolf Nureyev]], and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]. The [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Ballet]] in Moscow and the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Mariinsky]] in Saint Petersburg remain famous throughout the world.&lt;ref name="A Tale of Two Operas"/&gt;

===Opera===
{{Main|Russian opera|List of Russian opera singers}}
The first known opera made in Russia was ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' by [[Mikhail Glinka]] in 1836. This was followed by several operas such as ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' in 1842. Russian opera was originally a combination of Russian folk music and [[Italian opera]]. After the [[October revolution]] many opera composers left Russia. Russia's most popular operas include ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'', ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'', ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]'', ''[[Prince Igor]]'', and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]''.

===Modern music===
{{main|Russian rock|Russian pop}}
[[File:Berkut flies.jpg|thumb|left|[[heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] band [[Aria (band)|Aria]] is one of the leading [[Russian rock]] performers.]]
Since the late Soviet times Russia has experienced another wave of [[Western culture|Western cultural]] influence, which led to the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. The most vivid example, perhaps, is the [[Russian rock]] music, which takes its roots both in the Western [[rock and roll]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and in traditions of the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|Russian bards]] of Soviet era, like [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Bulat Okudzhava]]. [[Saint-Petersburg]] (former [[Leningrad]]), [[Yekaterinburg]] (former Sverdlovsk) and [[Omsk]] became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include [[Mashina Vremeni]], [[Slot (band)|Slot]], [[DDT (band)|DDT]], [[Aquarium (group)|Aquarium]], [[Alisa (Russian band)|Alisa]], [[Kino (band)|Kino]], [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]], [[Aria (band)|Aria]], [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]], [[Splean]] and [[Korol i Shut]]. At the same time [[Russian pop]] music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as ''estrada'' into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like [[t.A.T.u.]] in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or [[Vitas]] in China.

===Cinema of Russia===
While in the industrialized nations of the West, motion pictures had first been accepted as a form of cheap recreation and leisure for the working class, Russian filmmaking came to prominence following the 1917 revolution when it explored editing as the primary mode of cinematic expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/394161/history-of-the-motion-picture|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=History of the motion picture: The Soviet Union|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian and later [[Soviet cinema]] was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following the 1917 revolution, resulting in world-renowned films such as ''[[The Battleship Potemkin|Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia::Motion pictures|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet-era filmmakers, most notably [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Andrei Tarkovsky]], would become some of the world's most innovative and influential directors.

[[File:Vgik.jpg|thumb|right|The world's oldest [[film school]], the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|Russian State Institute of Cinematography]] in Moscow.]]
Eisenstein was a student of filmmaker and theorist [[Lev Kuleshov]], who developed the groundbreaking [[Soviet montage theory]] of film editing at the world's first film school, the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|All-Union Institute of Cinematography]]. [[Dziga Vertov]], whose ''kino-glaz'' ("film-eye") theory—that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life—had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism. In 1932, Stalin made [[socialist realism]] the state policy; this somewhat limited creativity, however many Soviet films in this style were artistically successful, like ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'', and ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]''.&lt;ref name=film/&gt;

1960s and 1970s saw a greater variety of artistic styles in the Soviet cinema. [[Eldar Ryazanov]]'s and [[Leonid Gaidai]]'s comedies of that time were immensely popular, with many of the catch phrases still in use today. In 1961–1967 [[Sergey Bondarchuk]] directed an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[War and Peace (film series)|film adaptation]] of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s epic ''[[War and Peace]]'', which was the most expensive Soviet film made.&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Beumers. ''A History of Russian Cinema''. Berg Publishers (2009). {{ISBN|978-1-84520-215-6}}. p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, [[Vladimir Motyl]]'s ''[[White Sun of the Desert]]'' was released, a very popular film in a genre known as '[[ostern]]s'; the film is traditionally watched by [[Astronaut|cosmonauts]] before any trip into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/wrt/onsale08/russian08/whitesunofthedesert.html|publisher=Film Society of Lincoln Center|title=White Sun of the Desert / Beloe solntse pustyni|accessdate=18 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905102633/http://filmlinc.com/wrt/onsale08/russian08/whitesunofthedesert.html|archivedate=5 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1980s and 1990s were a period of crisis in Russian cinema and animation. Although Russian filmmakers became free to express themselves, state subsidies were drastically reduced, resulting in fewer films produced. The early years of the 21st century have brought increased viewership and subsequent prosperity to the industry on the back of the economy's rapid development, and production levels are already higher than in Britain and Germany.&lt;ref name=kino&gt;{{cite web|author=Dzieciolowski, Z|title=Kinoeye: Russia's reviving film industry|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-Film/russian_film_3726.jsp|accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's total box-office revenue in 2007 was $565&amp;nbsp;million, up 37% from the previous year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Entertainment &amp; Media Industry worth $27.9 bn by 2011|publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers|url=http://www.pwc.com/extweb/ncpressrelease.nsf/docid/B373F0C74AA25A7480257309003B9833|accessdate=27 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220504/http://www.pwc.com/extweb/ncpressrelease.nsf/docid/B373F0C74AA25A7480257309003B9833|archivedate=26 September 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by comparison, in 1996 revenues stood at $6&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name=kino/&gt; Russian cinema continues to receive international recognition. ''[[Russian Ark]]'' (2002) was the first feature film ever to be shot in a single take.

===Animation===
{{main|Russian animation}}
Russia also has a long and rich [[Russian animation|tradition of animation]], which started already in the late [[Russian Empire]] times. Most of Russia's cartoon production for cinema and television was created during Soviet times, when [[Soyuzmultfilm]] studio was the largest animation producer. Soviet animators developed a great and unmatched variety of pioneering techniques and [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] styles, with prominent directors including [[Ivan Ivanov-Vano]], [[Fyodor Khitruk]] and [[Aleksandr Tatarskiy]]. Soviet cartoons are still a source for many popular catch phrases, while such cartoon heroes as Russian-style [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], cute little [[Cheburashka]], Wolf and Hare from ''[[Nu, Pogodi!]]'' being iconic images in Russia and many surrounding countries. The traditions of Soviet animation were developed in the past decade by such directors as [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]] and studios like [[Melnitsa Animation Studio|Melnitsa]], along with [[Ivan Maximov]].

==Media and technology==

===Radio and TV===
{{see also|Telecommunications in Russia}}
Russia was among the first countries to [[Radio Day|introduce radio]] [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|and television]]. Due to the enormous size of the country Russia leads in [[List of countries by number of television broadcast stations|the number of TV broadcast stations]] and repeaters. There were few channels in the Soviet time, but in the past two decades many new state-run and private-owned [[List of Russian-language radio stations|radio stations]] and [[Television in Russia|TV channels]] appeared. In 2005 a state-run English language [[RT (TV network)|Russia Today TV]] started broadcasting, and its [[Arabic]] version [[Rusiya Al-Yaum]] was launched in 2007.

===Internet===
{{main|Internet in Russia}}
[[File:RUNET-2006 RUNET HYMN.JPG|thumb|[[Runet Prize]] ceremony]]
Originating from Russian [[:Category:Science and technology in Russia|scientific community]] and [[Communications in Russia|telecommunication industries]], a specific Russian culture of using the Internet has been established since the early 1990s. In the second half of the 1990s, the term ''[[Runet]]'' was coined to call the segment of Internet written or understood in the Russian language. Whereas the Internet "has no boundaries", "Russian Internet" (online communications in the [[Russian language]]) can not be localized solely to the users residing in the Russian Federation as it includes Russian-speaking people from all around the world. This segment includes millions of users in other [[Post-Soviet states|ex-USSR countries]], Israel and others abroad [[diaspora]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ruhr University Bochum|accessdate=25 January 2008|author1=Henrike Schmidt  |author2=Katy Teubener |lastauthoramp=yes |title="Our RuNet"? Cultural Identity and Media Usage|url=http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/russ-cyb/library/texts/en/control_shift/Schmidt_Teubener_Identity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of [[World Wide Web|the Web]], many social and cultural events found reflections within the Russian Internet society. Various [[Virtual community|online communities]] formed, and the most popular one grew out of the Russian-speaking users of the California-based blogging platform [[LiveJournal]] (which was completely bought out in December 2007 by Russian firm [[SUP Fabrik]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/01/06/ccrussia106.xml Russian oligarch invades the blogosphere] – Telegraph.co.uk, 06/01/2008&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008 a LiveJournal blog of the "3rd statesman" [[Sergey Mironov]] had appeared and he was shortly followed by the new President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] who opened a personal video blog which was later also expanded with a LiveJournal version.

As of late, there are scores of websites offering Russian language content including mass media, e-commerce, search engines and so on. Particularly notorious are the "Russian [[Hacker (computer security)|Hackers]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=25 January 2008|agency=Reuters  |title=Police say Russian hackers are increasing threat|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/internetprivacy/2004-07-28-russian-hackers_x.htm | first1=Oliver | last1=Bullough | date=28 July 2004 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian web design studios, software and web-hosting enterprises offer a variety of services, and the results form a sort of national digital culture. E-commerce giants such as [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] have their Russian branches. In September 2007, the national domain [[.ru]] passed the milestone of a million domain names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Press International|title=Millionth Russian domain name registered|accessdate=25 January 2008|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2007/09/18/millionth_russian_domain_name_registered_/8156/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 2000s, [[VKontakte]] social network became the most populated in the Runet.

===Science and innovation===

[[File:NSF picture of Yamal.gif|thumb|left|''[[Yamal (icebreaker)|Yamal]]'', one of Russia's [[nuclear icebreaker]]s ([http://englishrussia.com/?p=1838 Gallery]).]]
At the start of the 18th century the [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|reforms of Peter the Great]] (the founder of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]]) and the work of such champions as [[polymath]] [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (the founder of [[Moscow State University]]) gave a great boost for development of science, engineering and innovation in Russia. In the 19th and 20th centuries Russia produced a large number of great [[:Category:Russian scientists|scientists]] and [[List of Russian inventors|inventors]].

[[Nikolai Lobachevsky]], a ''[[Copernicus]] of [[Geometry]]'', developed the [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. [[Dmitry Mendeleev]] invented the [[Periodic table]], the main framework of the modern [[chemistry]]. [[Nikolay Benardos]] introduced the [[arc welding]], further developed by [[Nikolay Slavyanov]], [[Konstantin Khrenov]] and other Russian engineers. [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] invented the [[knapsack]] [[parachute]], while [[Evgeniy Chertovsky]] introduced the [[pressure suit]]. [[Pavel Yablochkov]] and [[Alexander Lodygin]] were great pioneers of [[electrical engineering]] and inventors of early [[electric lamp]]s.

[[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]] was among the [[invention of radio|inventors of radio]], while [[Nikolai Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]] were co-inventors of [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s. [[Igor Tamm]], [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Lev Artsimovich]] developed the idea of [[tokamak]] for controlled [[nuclear fusion]] and created its first prototype, which finally led to the modern [[ITER]] project. Many famous Russian scientists and inventors were [[émigrés]], like [[Igor Sikorsky]] and [[Vladimir Zworykin]], and many foreign ones worked in Russia for a long time, like [[Leonard Euler]] and [[Alfred Nobel]].
[[File:Soyuz tm-31 transported to launch pad.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soyuz TM-31]] moves to launch pad, about to carry the first resident crew to the [[International Space Station]].]]

The greatest Russian successes are in the field of [[space technology]] and [[space exploration]]. [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] was the father of theoretical astronautics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiaa.org/index.cfm |title=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics – Home Page |publisher=Aiaa.org |accessdate=2 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104012817/http://www.aiaa.org/index.cfm |archivedate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His works had inspired leading [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rocket engineers such as [[Sergei Korolev]], [[Valentin Glushko]] and many others that contributed to the success of the [[Soviet space program]] at early stages of the [[Space Race]] and beyond.

In 1957 the first Earth-orbiting artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', was launched; in 1961 on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April]] the first human trip into space was successfully made by [[Yury Gagarin]]; and many other Soviet and Russian [[Timeline of space exploration|space exploration records]] ensued, including the first [[spacewalk]] performed by [[Alexey Leonov]], the first space exploration [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] ''[[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod-1]]'' and the first [[space station]] ''[[Salyut program|Salyut 1]]''.

Other technologies, where Russia historically leads, include [[nuclear technology]], aircraft production and [[arms industry]]. The creation of the first [[nuclear power plant]] along with the first [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]] for [[submarine]]s and [[Nuclear marine propulsion|surface ships]] was directed by [[Igor Kurchatov]]. [[Nuclear Ship|NS]] ''[[Lenin (nuclear icebreaker)|Lenin]]'' was the world's first [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered surface ship]] as well as the first [[List of civilian nuclear ships|nuclear-powered civilian vessel]], and [[Nuclear Ship|NS]] ''[[Arktika (1972 nuclear icebreaker)|Arktika]]'' became the first surface ship to reach the [[North Pole]].

A number of prominent Soviet aerospace engineers, inspired by the theoretical works of [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]], supervised the creation of many dozens of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of ''KBs'' (''Construction Bureaus'') that now constitute the bulk of Russian [[United Aircraft Corporation]]. Famous Russian airplanes include the first [[supersonic]] passenger jet [[Tupolev Tu-144]] by [[Alexei Tupolev]], [[MiG]] [[fighter aircraft]] series by [[Artem Mikoyan]] and [[Mikhail Gurevich (aircraft designer)|Mikhail Gurevich]], and [[Sukhoi|Su]] series by [[Pavel Sukhoi]] and his followers. [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] is the world's [[List of most produced aircraft|most produced]] [[jet aircraft]] in history, while [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] is most produced [[supersonic aircraft]]. During [[World War II]] era [[Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1]] was introduced as the first [[rocket-powered aircraft|rocket-powered]] fighter aircraft, and [[Ilyushin Il-2]] bomber became the [[List of most produced aircraft|most produced military aircraft in history]]. [[Polikarpov Po-2]] ''[[Polikarpov Po-2|Kukuruznik]]'' is the world's most produced [[biplane]], and [[Mil Mi-8]] is the most produced [[helicopter]].

Famous Russian battle tanks include [[T-34]], the best tank design of World War II,&lt;ref&gt;George Parada (n.d.), "[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/t34.htm Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)]" at ''Achtung Panzer!'' website, retrieved on 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and further tanks of T-series, including [[T-54/55]], the most produced tank in history,&lt;ref&gt;Halberstadt, Hans Inside the Great Tanks The Crowood Press Ltd.

Ethnic [[Russians|Russian]] clothes include [[kaftan]], [[kosovorotka]] and [[ushanka]] for men, [[sarafan]] and [[kokoshnik]] for women, with [[bast shoe|lapti]] and [[valenki]] as common shoes.

The [[Cossack]]s of Southern Russia have a separate brand of culture within ethnic Russian, their clothes including [[Burka (Caucasus)|burka]] and [[Papakha|.papaha]], which they share with the peoples of the [[Northern Caucasus]].

===Cuisine===

[[File:Russian Celebration Zakuski.jpg|left|thumb|Zakuski are playing an important part in Russian food culture]]
[[Russian cuisine]] widely uses fish, poultry, [[mushrooms]], [[berries]], and [[honey]]. Crops of [[rye]], wheat, [[barley]], and [[millet]] provide the ingredients for a plethora of breads, [[pancake]]s, cereals, [[kvass]], beer, and [[vodka]]. Black bread is relatively more popular in Russia compared to the rest of the world. Soups, stews and filled dumplings are very characteristic for Russian cuisine. The most popular soups include [[shchi]], [[borsch]], [[ukha]], [[solyanka]] and [[okroshka]]. [[Smetana (dairy product)|Smetana]] (a heavy [[sour cream]]) is often added to soups and salads. Most popular dumplings are [[pirozhki]], [[pelmeni]], varenyky and Turkic [[Manti (food)|manti]]. One of the most popular are foods are [[blini]], which are like [[syrniki]] native types of Russian pancakes. Furthermore, [[Cutlet]]s (like [[Chicken Kiev]]) and [[shashlyk]] are popular meat dishes, the last one being of [[Tatar]] and [[Caucasus]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} origin respectively. Popular salads include [[Russian Salad]], [[vinaigrette]] and [[Dressed Herring]]. One of the main characteristics of Russian food culture are [[Zakuski]],  which define a Russian-laid table.

===Holidays===
{{main|Public holidays in Russia}}

[[File:Ded Moroz.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Ded Moroz]] (Russian [[Santa]]) at his residence in [[Veliky Ustyug]].]]
There are eight [[public holidays in Russia]]. The New Year is the first in calendar and in popularity. Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. Rozhdestvo (Orthodox Christmas) falls on 7 January, because [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar|Julian (old style) calendar]] and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Catholic ones. Another two major Christian holidays are [[Easter|Paskha]] (Easter) and [[Trinity Sunday|Troitsa]] ([[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]]), but there is no need to recognize them as public holidays since they are always celebrated on Sunday.

Further Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[International Workers' Day]] (1 May), now renamed ''Spring and Labor Day''; [[Victory Day (9 May)]]; [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Lithuania]]n occupation force from Moscow in 1612. The latter is a replacement for the old Soviet holiday celebrating [[October Revolution]] of 1917 (again, it was falling on November because of the difference of calendars). Fireworks and outdoor concerts are common features of all Russian public holidays.

[[File:Victory Day Parade 2008-14.jpg|thumb|left|180px|2008 [[Victory Day (9 May)]] parade on Moscow's [[Red Square]].]]
[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] is the second popular holiday in Russia, it commemorates the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]] and is widely celebrated throughout Russia. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of the Russian Federation]], is annually organized in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades are organized in all major Russian cities and the cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.

Other popular holidays, which are not public, include [[Old New Year]] (New Year according to [[Julian Calendar]] on 1 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (day of Russian students on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (an old pagan holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (a day of [[Yury Gagarin]]'s first ever human trip into space on 12 April), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pagan [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] holiday on 7 July) and [[The Tale of Peter and Fevronia|Peter and Fevronia Day]] (taking place on 8 July and being the Russian analogue of [[Valentine's Day]], which focuses, however, on the family love and fidelity). On different days in June there are major celebrations of the end of the school year, when graduates from schools and universities traditionally swim in the city fountains; the local varieties of these public events include [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] tradition in [[Saint Petersburg]].

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Russia}}
[[File:Moscow - Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]].]]
[[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and Judaism are Russia's traditional religions, deemed part of Russia's "historical heritage" in a law passed in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bell, I|title=Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{main|Sport in Russia}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1980 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Bear cub [[Misha]], the mascot, at the closing ceremony of [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow ({{YouTube|_2WewT1jBQQ|Watch}}).]] --&gt;
Russians have been successful at a number of sports and consistently finish in the top rankings at the Olympic Games and in other international competitions. Combining the [[All-time Olympic Games medal count|total medals]] of Soviet Union and Russia, the country is second among all nations by number of gold medals both at the Summer Olympics and at the Winter Olympics.

During the Soviet era, the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|national Olympic team]] placed first in the total number of medals won at 14 of its 18 appearances; with these performances, the USSR was the dominant Olympic power of its era. Since the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympic Games]], Soviet and later Russian athletes have always been in the top three for the number of gold medals collected at the Summer Olympics.

Soviet gymnasts, [[track-and-field]] athletes, [[weight lifter]]s, [[wrestler]]s, [[Boxing|boxer]]s, [[Fencing|fencer]]s, [[shooting|shooter]]s, [[Chess|chess players]], [[cross country skier]]s, [[biathlete]]s, [[speed skater]]s and [[figure skater]]s were consistently among the best in the world, along with Soviet basketball, [[Team handball|handball]], volleyball and [[ice hockey]] players. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian athletes have continued to dominate international competitions. The [[1980 Summer Olympic Games]] were held in Moscow while the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]] were hosted by Sochi.

[[File:Maria Sharapova Indian Wells 2006 2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Maria Sharapova]], the world's highest paid female athlete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/22/women-athletes-endorsements-biz-sports-cx_tvr_kb_0722athletes.html|accessdate=1 August 2008|author1=Tom Van Riper  |author2=Kurt Badenhausen |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Top-Earning Female Athletes|work=Forbes|date=22 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Soviet Union dominated the sport of gymnastics for many years, with such athletes as [[Larisa Latynina]], who, until 2012, held a record of most Olympic medals won per person and most gold Olympic medals won by a woman. Today, Russia is leading in [[rhythmic gymnastics]] with such stars as [[Alina Kabaeva]], [[Irina Tschaschina]] and [[Yevgeniya Kanayeva]].

Russian [[synchronized swimming]] is the best in the world, with almost all gold medals having been swept by Russians at Olympics and World Championships for more than a decade. [[Figure skating]] is another popular sport in Russia; in the 1960s, the Soviet Union rose to become a dominant power in figure skating, especially in [[pair skating]] and [[ice dancing]], and at every Winter Olympics from 1964 until 2006, a Soviet or Russian pair has won gold, often considered the longest winning streak in modern sports history. Since the end of the Soviet era, tennis has grown in popularity and Russia has produced a number of famous tennis players. [[Chess]] is also a widely popular pastime; from 1927, Soviet and Russian chess grandmasters have held the [[world chess championship|world championship]] almost continuously.

===Basketball===
As the Soviet Union, Russia was traditionally very strong in basketball, winning various Olympic tournaments, [[FIBA World Championship|World Championships]] and [[Eurobasket]]. As of 2009 they have various players in the [[NBA]], notably [[Utah Jazz]] forward [[Andrei Kirilenko (basketball)|Andrei Kirilenko]], and are considered as a worldwide basketball force. In 2007, Russia defeated world champions Spain to win [[Eurobasket 2007]]. Russian basketball clubs such as [[PBC CSKA Moscow]] (2006 and 2008 Euroleague Champions) have also had great success in European competitions such as the Euroleague and the [[ULEB Cup]].

===Ice hockey===
Although [[ice hockey]] was only introduced during the Soviet era, the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|national team]] soon dominated the sport internationally, winning gold at seven of the nine [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] and 19 of the 30 [[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]] they contested between 1954 and 1991. Russian players [[Valeri Kharlamov]], [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]], [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] and [[Vladislav Tretiak]] hold four of the six positions on the [[IIHF]] Team of the Century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship/news/news-singleview-world-championship/article/iihf-centennial-all-star-team.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=552&amp;cHash=3a26b76f60 IIHF Centennial All-Star Team]&lt;/ref&gt; As with some other sports, the Russian ice hockey programme suffered after the breakup of the Soviet Union, with Russia enduring a 15-year gold medal drought. At that time many prominent Russian players made their careers in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). In recent years Russia has reemerged as a hockey power, winning back to back gold medals in the [[2008 IIHF World Championships|2008]] and [[2009 IIHF World Championship|2009]] World Championships, and overtaking [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] as the [[2009 IIHF World Ranking|top ranked]] ice hockey team in the world, but then lost to Canada in the quarter-finals of the 2010 Olympics and 2010 World Junior Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship-oc09/home/news/news-singleview-world-championship-2009/article/pure-gold-russia-repeats.html?tx_ttnewsbackPid=2717&amp;cHash=f61f91921e|accessdate=11 May 2009|title=Pure gold: Russia repeats!|publisher=[[IIHF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) was founded in 2008 as a rival of the NHL.

===Bandy===
[[Bandy]], known in Russian as "hockey with a ball" and sometimes informally as "Russian hockey" (as opposed to "Canadian hockey", an informal name for ice hockey), is another traditionally popular ice sport, with national league games averaging around 3,500 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusbandy.ru/content.html?PageID=325|title=XV чемпионат России по хоккею с мячом сезон 2006/07 г.г.

[[Russia national bandy team|The Russian team]] is the reigning world champion since [[2014 Bandy World Championship|the 2014 tournament]], having defended the title in [[2015 Bandy World Championship|2015]].

===Football===
During the Soviet period, Russia was also a competitive [[Association football|footballing]] nation. Despite having legendary players such as goalkeeper of the century [[Lev Yashin]], the USSR never really managed to assert itself as one of the major forces of international football, although its teams won various championships (such as [[Euro 1960]]) and reached numerous finals (such as [[Euro 1988]]). Along with ice hockey and basketball, football is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. In recent years, Russian football, which downgraded in 1990-s, has experienced a revival. Russian clubs (such as [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[Zenit St Petersburg]], [[Lokomotiv Moscow]], and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]) are becoming increasingly successful on the European stage (CSKA and Zenit winning the [[UEFA Cup]] in 2005 and 2008 respectively). The [[Russian national football team]] reached the semi-finals of [[Euro 2008]], losing only to eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. The nation also hosted the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] as well as the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] at which the national team lost in the Quarterfinals 4-2 on penalty kicks to [[Croatia]], their best ever finish as an independent nation.

===Martial arts===
{{Main|Russian martial arts}}
Russia has an extensive history of martial arts. Some of its best-known forms include the [[Russian fist fighting|fistfight]], [[Sambo(martial art)|Sambo]], and [[Systema]] with its derivatives [[Ryabko's Systema]] and [[Retuinskih's System ROSS]]. Undefeated lightweight [[UFC]] champion [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]] is from [[Makhachkala]] and was called by President Vladimir Putin following his victory over [[Conor McGregor]]

==National symbols==
{{main|Cultural icons of Russia|Flag of Russia|Coat of arms of Russia|National anthem of Russia|Russian Bear|Mother Russia}}
[[File:RussianBear.JPG|left|180px|thumb|Russian football fans with a gigantic ''Go Russia!'' banner, featuring [[Russian Bear]] on the background of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]].]]

===State symbols===
State symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[Coat of arms of Moscow|St. George]] of Moscow in the [[Russian coat of arms]]; these symbols date from the time of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. The [[Russian flag]] appeared in the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and became widely used during the era of the [[Russian Empire]]. The current [[Russian national anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics (many Russians of older generations don't know the new lyrics and sing the old ones). The [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial]] [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has been officially introduced to replace them. The [[Hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on [[military equipment]] and [[war memorial]]s. The Soviet [[Red Banner]] is still honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.

===Unofficial symbols===
The [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, while the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are main Russia's architectural symbols. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of [[Russia at the Olympics|Russian national Olympic team]]. [[Saint Mary|Mary]], [[Saint Nicholas]], [[Saint Andrew]], [[Saint George]], [[Saint Alexander Nevsky]], [[Saint Sergius of Radonezh]], [[Saint Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's patron saints. [[Chamomile]] is a flower that Russians often associate with their [[Motherland]], while [[birch]] is a [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal often associated with Russia, though this image has Western origins and Russians themselves do not consider it as a special symbol. The native Russian national personification is "Родина мать" [[Mother Motherland]] (the statue of it located on the Mamay hill "Мамаев курган" in Volgograd /former Stalingrad/), called [[Mother Russia]] at the West.

==Tourism==
{{Main|Tourism in Russia}}
Tourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first inner tourism and then international tourism as well. Rich cultural heritage and great natural variety place Russia among the [[World Tourism rankings|most popular tourist destinations]] in the world. The country [[List of World Heritage Sites in Russia|contains 23 UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s, while many more are on UNESCO's tentative lists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/state=ru Tentative Lists]&lt;/ref&gt; Major tourist routes in Russia include a travel around the Golden Ring of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like [[Volga]], and long journeys on the famous [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. Diverse regions and ethnic cultures of Russia offer many different food and souvenirs, and show a great variety of traditions, like Russian [[banya (sauna)|banya]], Tatar [[Sabantuy]], or Siberian [[shamanist]] rituals.

===Cultural tourism===
[[File:PeterhofGrandCascade.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Grand Cascade in [[Peterhof Palace]], nicknamed ''Russian Versailles'', a popular tourist destination in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]
Most popular tourist destinations in Russia are Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]], the current and the former capitals of the country and great cultural centers, recognized as [[World Cities]]. Moscow and Saint Petersburg feature such world-renowned museums as [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares like [[Red Square]] and [[Palace Square]], and streets like [[Tverskaya Street|Tverskaya]] and [[Nevsky Prospect]]. Rich palaces and parks of extreme beauty are found in the former [[Template:Imperial palaces in Russia|imperial residences]] in suburbs of Moscow ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and Saint Petersburg ([[Petergof|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow contains a great variety of impressive Soviet-era buildings along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern scyscrapers]], while Saint Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, channels and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].

[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a unique mix of Christian [[Russians|Russian]] and Muslim [[Tatars|Tatar]] cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major Russian cities compete for this status, like [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]], all being major cultural centers with rich history and prominent architecture. [[Veliky Novgorod]], [[Pskov]] and the cities of Golden Ring ([[Vladimir (city)|Vladimir]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]] and others) have at best preserved the architecture and the spirit of ancient and medieval [[Rus (name)|Rus']], and also are among the main tourist destinations. Many [[List of castles in Russia|old fortifications]] (typically [[Kremlin]]s), [[List of Russian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church|churches]] are scattered throughout Russia, forming its unique cultural landscape both in big cities and in remote areas.

===Resorts and nature tourism===
[[File:Dombai 3760 Gornolyzhnie Trassy.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[ski resort]] at [[Dombay]], [[Western Caucasus]].]]
The warm subtropical [[Black Sea]] coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea [[resort]]s, like [[Sochi]], known for its beaches and wonderful nature. At the same time Sochi can boast a number of major [[ski resort]]s, like [[Krasnaya Polyana]]; the city is the host of [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain many other popular [[ski resort]]s, like [[Dombay, Karachay–Cherkess Republic|Dombay]] in [[Karachay–Cherkessia]].

The most famous natural tourist destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], named ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clean waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains.

Other popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its [[volcano]]es and [[geyser]]s, [[Karelia]] with its many lakes and [[granite]] rocks, [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] with its snowy mountains and [[Tyva]] with its wild steppes.

'''Saudi Australians''' refers to [[Australian]] nationals or citizens with origins in [[Saudi Arabia]] as well the general Saudi expatriate community in Australia. There are thousands of Saudis living in Australia; they can be found in all major urban centres including [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Brisbane]] and make up a substantial representation in the [[Arab Australian]] community. 

A significant number of Saudis are international students; each year, hundreds of Saudi students choose to study in Australian universities under the King Abdullah Scholarship Program. In 2010, their number was estimated at 10,000. Saudi students were seen in a wide range of fields including health, IT, business and accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/saudi_arabia/saudi_brief.html Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Saudi Arabia country brief], Government of Australia&lt;/ref&gt; The increase is almost eightfold since the past few years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/saudis-move-to-stem-uni-radicals/story-e6frg6tx-1111115655235 The Australian]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Selkup''' ({{lang-ru|сельку́пы}}), until the 1930s called [[Ostyak]]-[[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyeds]] (остя́ко-самое́ды), are a [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyedic ethnic group]] native to Northern [[Siberia]]. They live in the northern parts of [[Tomsk Oblast]], [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug]], and [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]].

== Outline ==
Selkups speak the [[Selkup language]], which belongs to the [[Samoyedic languages]] of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]].

The Selkups originated in the middle [[drainage basin|basin]] of the [[Ob River]], from interactions between the [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[Yeniseian]] population and [[Samoyedic peoples]] that came to the region from the [[Sayan Mountains]] during the early part of the [[first millennium]] CE.

In the 17th century, some of the Selkups relocated up north to live along the [[Taz River]] and [[Turukhan River]]. They were engaged mainly in [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and [[reindeer]] breeding. In the 18th century, Selkups participated in a massive [[baptism]] campaign. However, many returned to their ancient religious beliefs and customs.

According to the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Census]], there were 4,249 Selkups in Russia (4,300 in 1970).

There were 62&amp;nbsp;Selkups in [[Ukraine]], only one of whom is a native speaker of the Selkup language (Ukrainian Census 2001).

The '''sense of agency''' ('''SA'''), or '''sense of control''', is the [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[awareness]] of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own [[volition (psychology)|volition]]al actions in the world.&lt;ref name=JeannerodBBR03&gt;Jeannerod, M. (2003). The mechanism of self-recognition in human. Behavioural Brain Research, 142, 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's "[[sense of ownership]]" (SO), which is the [[pre-reflective awareness]] or [[implicit sense]] that one is the owner of an action, movement or thought. If someone else were to move your arm (while you remained passive) you would certainly have sensed that it were your arm that moved and thus a sense of ownership (SO) for that movement. However, you would not have felt that you were the author of the movement; you would not have a sense of agency (SA).&lt;ref name=GallagherTICS00&gt;Gallagher, S. (2000). Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4, 14–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally SA and SO are tightly integrated, such that while typing one has an enduring, embodied, and tacit sense that "my own fingers are doing the moving" (SO) ''and'' that "the typing movements are controlled (or volitionally directed) by me" (SA). In patients suffering from certain forms of pathological experience (i.e., [[schizophrenia]]) the integration of SA and SO may become disrupted in some manner. In this case, movements may be executed or thoughts made manifest, for which the schizophrenic patient has a sense of ownership, but not a sense of agency.{{citation needed lead|date=September 2014}}

Regarding SA for both motor movements and thoughts, further distinctions may be found in both first-order (immediate, pre-reflective) experience&lt;ref&gt;Tsakiris M, Schütz-Bosbach S, Gallagher S (2007) On agency and body-ownership: phenomenological and neurocognitive reflections. Conscious Cogn 16:645–660&lt;/ref&gt; and higher-order (reflective or introspective) consciousness.&lt;ref name=StephensGraham00&gt;Stephens, G. L., &amp; Graham, G. (2000). ''When self-consciousness breaks: Alien voices and inserted thoughts''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} For example, while typing I have a sense of control and thus SA for the ongoing action of typing; this is an example of SA in first-order experience which is immediate and prior to any explicit intellectual reflection upon the typing actions ''themselves''. In this case, I am not focusing on the typing movements ''per se'' but rather, I am involved with the task at hand.  If I'm subsequently asked if I just performed the action of typing, I can correctly attribute agency to myself. This is an example of a higher-order, reflective, conscious "attribution" of agency, which is a derivative notion stemming from the immediate, ''pre''-reflective "sense" of agency.

==Definition==
The concept of [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] implies an active organism, one who desires, makes plans, and carries out actions.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. (1990). Intention, consciousness, desires and development. Psychological Inquiry, 1, 278–283.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of agency plays a pivotal role in cognitive development, including the first stage of self-awareness (or pre-theoretical experience of one's own mentality), which scaffolds [[theory of mind]] capacities.&lt;ref name=Rochat99&gt;Rochat, P. (1999). Early Social Cognition: Understanding Others in the First Months of Life. Mahawah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} Indeed, the ability to recognize oneself as the agent of a behavior is the way the self builds as an entity independent from the external world.&lt;ref name=JeannerodBBR03/&gt; The sense of agency and its scientific study has important implications in [[social cognition]], [[moral reasoning]], and [[psychopathology]]. The conceptual distinction between SA and SO was defined by philosopher and phenomenologist [[Shaun Gallagher]].&lt;ref name=GallagherTICS00/&gt; Using a different terminology, essentially the same distinction has been made by John Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John (1999): "Schizophrenia, the Space of Reasons, and Thinking as a Motor Process." Monist 82 (4), 609–625.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lynn Stephens and George Graham.&lt;ref name=StephensGraham00/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}

==Neuroscience==
A number of experiments in normal individuals has been undertaken in order to determine the functional anatomy of the sense of agency. These experiments have consistently documented the role of the posterior [[parietal cortex]] as a critical link within the simulation network for self-recognition. Primary sources have reported that activation of the right inferior parietal lobe/temporoparietal junction correlates with the subjective sense of ownership in action execution,&lt;ref&gt;Farrer, C., Franck, N., Georgieff, N., Frith, C. D., Decety, J., &amp; Jeannerod, M. (2003). Modulating the experience of agency: a positron emission tomography study. NeuroImage 18, 324–333.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, P., &amp; Decety, J. (2001). Effect of subjective perspective taking during simulation of action: A PET investigation of agency. Nature Neuroscience 4, 546–550.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}and that posterior parietal lesions, especially on the right side, impair the ability of recognizing one's own body parts and self-attributing one's own movements.&lt;ref&gt;Daprati, E., et al. (2000). Recognition of self produced movement in a case of severe neglect. Neurocase, 6, 477–486{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

Accumulating evidence from [[functional neuroimaging]] studies, as well as lesion studies in neurological patients indicates that the right inferior [[parietal cortex]], at the junction with the posterior temporal cortex (TPJ, temporoparietal junction), plays a critical role in the distinction between self-produced actions and actions perceived in others.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, P.L., &amp; Decety, J. (2004). Motor cognition: A new paradigm to study self other interactions. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 14, 259–263.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions of this region can produce a variety of disorders associated with body knowledge and self-awareness such as [[anosognosia]], [[asomatognosia]], or [[somatoparaphrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlucchi, G., &amp; Aglioti, S. (1997). The body in the brain: neural bases of corporeal awareness. Trends in Neurosciences, 20, 560–564.&lt;/ref&gt;  A primary source has reported that electrical stimulation of the TPJ can elicit out-of-body experiences (i.e., the experience of dissociation of self from the body).&lt;ref&gt;Blanke, O., &amp; Arzy, S. (2005). The out-of-body experience: Disturbed self-processing at the temporo-parietal junction. Neuroscientist, 11, 16–24.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

The investigation of the neural correlates of reciprocal [[imitation]] is extremely important because it provides an ecological paradigm (a situation close to everyday life) to address the issue of the sense of agency.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Sommerville, J.A. (2003). Shared representations between self and others: A social cognitive neuroscience view. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7, 527–533.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that reciprocal imitation plays a constitutive role in the early development of an implicit sense of self as a social agent.&lt;ref name=Rochat99/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}

A primary source has reported a [[functional neuroimaging]] experiment, where participants were scanned while they imitated an experimenter performing constructions with small objects and while the experimenter, while performing such a manipulation, imitated the participants. Across both conditions, the participants' sense of ownership (the sense that it is I who am experiencing the movement or thought) as well as the visual and [[somatosensory]] inputs were similar or coincided. What differed between imitating and being imitated was the agent who initiated the action. The primary source reports that several key regions were involved in the two conditions of reciprocal imitation compared to a control condition (in which subjects acted differently from the experimenter), namely in the superior temporal sulcus, the temporoparietal cortex (TPJ), and the medial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., Chaminade, T., Grèzes, J. and Meltzoff, A.N. (2002). A PET exploration of the neural mechanisms involved in reciprocal imitation. Neuroimage 15, 265–272.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

Another approach to understanding the neuroscientific underpinnings of the sense of agency is to examine clinical conditions in which purposeful limb movement occurs ''without'' an associated sense of agency.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The most clear clinical demonstration of this situation is [[alien hand syndrome]]. In this condition, associated with specific forms of brain damage, the affected individual loses the sense of agency without losing a sense of ownership of the affected body part.

==Agency and psychopathology==
[[Marc Jeannerod]] proposed that the process of self-recognition operates covertly and effortlessly. It depends upon a set of mechanisms involving the processing of specific neural signals, from sensory as well as from central origin. Researchers have used experimental situations, in both healthy participants and schizophrenic patients, where these signals can be dissociated from each other and where self-recognition becomes ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Jeannerod, M. (2008). The sense of agency and its disturbances in schizophrenia: a reappraisal. Experimental Brain Research{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}} These situations reveal that there are two levels of self-recognition, an automatic level for action identification, and a conscious level for the sense of agency, which both rely on the same principle of congruence of the action-related signals.

Investigation of the sense of agency is important to explain positive symptoms of [[schizophrenia]], like thought insertion and delusions of control.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The core of the problem met by these patients is a disturbance of their sense of agency: the first rank symptoms, which represent one of the major features of the disease, are nothing but a loss of the ability to attribute their own thoughts, internal speech, covert or overt actions to themselves.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Nonattributed or misattributed thoughts and actions then become a material for delusional interpretation and delirium.&lt;ref&gt;Farrer, C., Franck, N., Frith, C.D., Decety, J., Damato, T., &amp; Jeannerod, M. (2004). Neural correlates of action attribution in schizophrenia. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging, 131, 31–44.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}} One primary source reports that the feeling of alien control (i.e., delusions of control) during a movement task in schizophrenic patients is associated with an increased metabolic activity in the right inferior parietal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, S.A., et al. (1997). A PET study of voluntary movement in schizophrenic patients experiencing passivity phenomena. Brain, 120, 1997–2011.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

==Other aspects of agency==
While the conception of human agency is often confined to its exercise by individuals, [[Albert Bandura]] has argued that individuals often do not have direct control over social conditions or institutional practices that affect their lives; in these circumstances, well-being and security are sought through exercise of proxy agency.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1997). Self-efficacy: The exercise of control. New York: Freeman.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} For instance, individuals in such circumstances may attempt to persuade others who have expertise, influence, or power to act on their behalf to achieve the outcomes they desire.

Sense of agency has been argued as a prerequisite for human [[morality|moral responsibility]] insofar as self agency underlies the expectation that individuals can be held responsible for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see Kahn, P.H. (1992). Obligatory and discretionary moral judgments. Child Development, 63, 416–430.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

'''Sexual orientation discrimination''' (also often referred to as '''sexualism''') is discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[sexual behaviour]].

== Sexual bias ==
Sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination against a person or group on the basis of their sexual orientation or sexual behavior. Sexual orientation discrimination often comes up in the context of employment actions.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, John, "[https://eeolawblog.com/2017/08/28/sexual-orientation-discrimination-the-current-state-of-the-law/ Sexual Orientation Discrimination in the Current State of the Law (2017)]"&lt;/ref&gt; It usually refers to a predisposition towards [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] people, which is biased against [[lesbian]], [[gay]], and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] people, among others. It can, however, also be against heterosexual people. A related term is ''sexual prejudice'', a negative attitude toward someone because of her or his sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Matlin, Margaret W., Ph.D., "The Psychology of Women", (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This bias is not the same as [[homophobia]], but rather is the discrimination towards or against certain sexual orientations. [[Heterosexism]] suggests that the basis for this bias is not found in the individual per se but rather has a broader cultural or biological basis that results in attitudes weighted in favour of heterosexuality over other sexual orientations. Heterosexism is one form of [[structural violence]].

An earlier definition of this term is: Sexual orientation discrimination is a belief or argument that one sexual orientation or sexual behaviour is inherently superior to some or all others. Usually it comes in the form of [[heterosexuality]] being considered the only [[nature|natural]], [[normality (behavior)|normal]], or [[moral]] mode of sexual behavior, and is also used to refer to the effects of that instinct. The word ''heterosexism'' has also been proposed to mean essentially the same thing as this form of sexual orientation discrimination.&lt;!--In The Dictionary of Psychology [1] ''heterosexism'' is defined as 
"An argument that male-female sexuality is the only correct, natural, proper, or moral mode of sexual activity. [Also proposed as] ''heterosexualism''. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corsini, Raymond J., ''The Dictionary of Psychology'' (2001), {{ISBN|1-58391-328-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word has been suggested as an alternative to [[homophobia]],&lt;ref&gt;Herek, Gregory M., Ph.D., "Beyond 'Homophobia': Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century."   Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy (April, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; in part because it uses a parallel structure to [[sexism]] or [[racism]]. The intent of heterosexism is the examination of the cultural bias against non-heterosexuals rather than individual bias, which is the focus of homophobia, as well as the adverse effects of normative heterosexuality on heterosexual identifying people.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, S. (2006) Gender, sexuality and heterosexuality: the complexity (and limits) of heteronormativity. Feminist Theory, 7 ( 1). pp. 105-121. ISSN 1464-7001&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[queer theory]], heterosexism is closely related to [[heteronormativity]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The '''Singapore Recreation Club''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''SRC'''; {{zh|s=新加坡康乐俱乐部}}) is one of [[Singapore]]'s oldest [[social club]]s with a strong [[sport]]ing tradition, located on [[Connaught Drive]] at the north end of the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] in the heart of [[Singapore]]'s [[Civic District, Singapore|Civic District]].

==History==
The Singapore Recreation Club was founded on 23 June 1883 by a group of thirty [[eurasian (mixed ancestry)|eurasian]] men and was officially established on 1 July 1883. At that time, the club was housed in a building on [[Waterloo Street, Singapore|Waterloo Street]].

In 1884, a club pavilion was erected on the site of the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]]. Two years later, the club adopted navy blue and red as its corporate colours: navy blue for [[sport]]smanship and red for the brotherhood of man in [[sport]]s.

By 1904, with increasing membership, construction of a clubhouse commenced, with the foundation stone laid by club president [[Edwin Tessensohn]]. The clubhouse was formally opened on 2 September 1905, the governor of [[Singapore]], [[Sir John Anderson]]. The addition of two wings was completed in 1931 and declared open by club president [[Dr Noel Clarke]].

At the Annual General Meeting in 1948, member [[P F de Souza]] proposed that the club should be open to non-eurasians, and this proposal, though not immediately accepted, gained more support over the years. In 1955, ordinary membership was opened to people of all communities. A year later, in 1956, women were admitted as members for the first time.

At a meeting on 11 February 1963, club president [[Sir George Oehlers]] proposed to open full membership to people of all communities in [[Singapore]]. This was agreed by a majority of members. As such the vision that SRC "will be an inter-racial club in [[Singapore]]" was fulfilled.

A new, $65 million clubhouse was opened on 28 June 1997, by [[Dr Tony Tan]], then deputy prime minister of Singapore and minister of defence.

The new clubhouse was the idea of former president [[Jack Wellington]]. In 1993, the committee led a drive to raise the money to build the clubhouse. The funds were raised though the decision to make membership transferable. 

The club stands at the north end of the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] as part of the historical [[Civic District, Singapore|Civic District]], which is also part of [[Singapore Grand Prix]] route.

==Objectives of the Club==
The objectives of the Club remain: to promote all forms of sports, recreation and social activities through an active calendar of events, as well as to participate in activities of national sports association and the Singapore National Olympic Council. The commitment to sporting excellence is enshrined in the Club's Constitution and prevails to the present day.

==Membership and activities==
SRC today has over 5,500 principal members. Sports played by SRC include [[billiards]] and [[snooker]], [[bowling]], [[cricket]], [[field hockey]], [[golf]], [[Football (soccer)|soccer]], [[softball]] and [[tennis]]. Social activities and games include [[Balut (game)|balut]], [[Contract bridge|bridge]], [[chess]], [[dancesport]], [[line dancing]] and [[Toastmasters]].

The rate was about 16 babies per 1,000 women aged 15–19 years between 2011 and 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 3301.0 -  Births, Australia, 2012|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/3301.0~2012~Main+Features~Fertility+rates?OpenDocument|website = www.abs.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this had fallen to 11.9 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 in 2015, the lowest figure on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats%5Cabs@.nsf/0/8668A9A0D4B0156CCA25792F0016186A?Opendocument |title=3301.0 - Births, Australia, 2015 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Australian Bureau of Statistics |publisher=Australian Government |access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terminations can be performed up until the 12-week mark.

== Birth-rate ==
In 2015, the [[birth rate]] among teenage women in [[Australia]] was 11.9 births per 1,000 women&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats%5Cabs@.nsf/0/8668A9A0D4B0156CCA25792F0016186A?Opendocument&lt;/ref&gt;. The rate has fallen from 55.5 births per 1,000 women in 1971, probably due to ease of access to effective [[contraception]], rather than any decrease in [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teenage pregnancy - Better Health Channel|url = http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/teenage_pregnancy|accessdate = 2015-08-31|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923184909/http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/teenage_pregnancy|archivedate = 2015-09-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] found that the median age to have a baby in Australia between 2003 and 2013 was 30.8 for mothers, and 32.3 for fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 3301.0 -  Births, Australia, 2013|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3301.0|website = www.abs.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aboriginal Australians ==
In Australia, young [[Aboriginal Australians|Indigenous]] women are more likely to become pregnant while in their teens than non-Indigenous young women. Many factors contribute to this gap, such as unemployment, poverty and educational outcomes. However, there is still very little understanding as to the attitudes of young Indigenous Australian women themselves in regards to pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a national Indigenous fertility rate of 69 per 1000, which is four times the national rate for all teenage women in Australia. The preliminary census estimated that the Indigenous population of Australia, is around 2.5% of the total Australian population which shows how radical these rates are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4704.0 -  The Health and Welfare of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, 2008|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/BBDF098961DB8AD1CA2574390014B136?opendocument|website = www.abs.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings provide clear indication towards the issues of Indigenous Australians, and the lack of support they are provided in relation to contraceptive education and access to health information. Indigenous Australians have a high rate of health illiteracy, which has also played a major role in the high fertility rates as stated above.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Births and pregnancy outcome « Overview of Australian Indigenous health status 2014 « Health facts « Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet|url = http://www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au/health-facts/overviews/births-and-pregnancy-outcome|website = www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically speaking, Indigenous Australians have always had higher rates of living in rural and remote areas, which has been found to indirectly influence the rate of teenage pregnancy within this population.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Indigenous settlements of Australia .|last = Memmott, Moran|first = Phill, Matthew|date = 2001|journal = ed. Australia: state of the environment|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Region, along with many other factors, have all contributed to the high teenage fertility rate among Aboriginal Australians. To lower this, the Australian Government has created programs that aim to increase health literacy, increase access to health care and provide better education in relation to contraception and sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ards.com.au/365_docs/attachments/protarea/Heal-1f013599.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Youth Facts and Stats found the number of Indigenous young people aged 12–24 years was estimated to be 116,000, approximately 3% of the total number of young people nationwide, indicating the Indigenous to be a more youthful society. Along with this, Indigenous mothers are more likely to give birth at younger ages than non-Indigenous mothers. The average age of Indigenous mothers who gave birth in 2013 was 25 years, compared with an average age of 31 years for all Australian mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2003.

== By region ==
In Australia, pregnancy and childbirth in teenage women are associated with obstetric and social risks, and there is evidence indicating that the birth rate among teenagers in rural and remote areas of Australia is not in decline. Although the number of births to teenage mothers in Australia has fallen in recent years, there is a strong suggestion that such a trend has not been found for teenagers living in remote and economically disadvantaged areas. This finding raises special concern, as there is clear evidence of an "urban-rural" divide for young women giving birth in Australia. This manifests as an increase in the odds for adverse outcomes, such as [[stillbirth]] for women delivering their babies in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title =onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/10.1111/j.1479-828X.2006.00597.x/abstract|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/10.1111/j.1479-828X.2006.00597.x/abstract|doi = 10.1111/j.1479-828x.2006.00597.x | volume=46|journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|pages=305–310|via=The University of Notre Dame Australia||registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Larson stated that "the higher fertility is the result of an economic growth that has sidelined young regional women, and to a lesser extent young men, who do not have the range of educational and employment opportunities to lead them into pathways other than early parenting".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Investigating an increase in teenage pregnancies in regional Australia {{!}} Croakey|url = http://blogs.crikey.com.au/croakey/2013/01/24/investigating-an-increase-in-teenage-pregnancies-in-regional-australia/?wpmp_switcher=mobile|website = blogs.crikey.com.au|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement can be backed  up through various research and epidemiology indicating a direct trend between rural and remote areas, and rates of teenage pregnancy. Other issues come with living in rural areas in Australia including; high rates of teenage smokers and excessive drinkers, as well as lack of employment and in-adequate education. These risks have been linked to increased [[Caesarean section|caesarean]] and [[abortion]] rates among mothers living in [[Rural area|rural]] and remote areas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} 
Although the above research concludes that there are extremely high teenage pregnancy rates in rural and remote areas, the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] found that the distribution of births in Australia are lowest in remote areas. These statistics can be viewed in the table below.

== Effects ==
Teenage mothers have been closely associated with long term health risks, including mental and physical health. Along with these health risks, teenage mothers in Australia commonly experience lack of identity, social issues, low income and poor educational backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Dynamics of Welfare Participation among Women Who Experienced Teenage Motherhood in Australia*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4932.2010.00685.x/abstract|journal = Economic Record|date = 2011-06-01|issn = 1475-4932|pages = 235–251|volume = 87|issue = 277|doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4932.2010.00685.x|first = Sung-Hee|last = Jeon|first2 = Guyonne|last2 = Kalb|first3 = Ha|last3 = Vu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This often leads to their child(ren) experiencing the same issues throughout life, and may lead to other serious complications.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Termination of pregnancy: associations with partner violence and other factors in a national cohort of young Australian women|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1753-6405.2007.00031.x/abstract|journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|date = 2007-04-01|issn = 1753-6405|pages = 135–142|volume = 31|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1753-6405.2007.00031.x|first = Angela J.|last = Taft|first2 = Lyndsey F.|last2 = Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study found teenage mothers were more likely to:
* drop out of school
* have no or low qualifications
* be unemployed or low paid
* live in poor housing conditions
* suffer from depression, which may result in suicide
* live on welfare

Although this does not apply to all teenage mothers, one or more of the above apply to the majority. It has also been indicated that children of teenage mothers are more likely to:

* live in poverty
* grow up without a father
* become a victim of neglect or abuse
*  do less well at school
*  become involved in crime
* abuse drugs and alcohol
*  eventually become a teenage parent and begin the cycle all over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unicef.org/malaysia/Teenage_Pregnancies_-_Overview.pdf|title = Teenage Pregnancies|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above effects of teenage pregnancy in Australia have been closely researched, and statistics have found that the majority of this population are more likely to fall into one or more of the above categories. In terms of general health, the proportion of teenage mothers who report poor or fair health is nearly twice as high than other mothers. Teenagers have also been associated with high dependence on welfare agencies such as [[Centrelink]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Birth is also much more complicated; their babies have a higher rate of suffering problems such as [[preterm birth]], low birth weight and congenital abnormalities.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Teenage pregnancy and childbirth is an important adolescent health issue in Australia due to long-term negative psychosocial outcomes for both mother and child and its association with detrimental physical consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eprints.utas.edu.au/3875/1/3875.pdf|title = Teenage Pregnancy - an adolescent health issue in Australia|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
While not all teenage pregnancies are unplanned and unintentional, unplanned pregnancies may be associated with the following issues:

* Family situations with regular conflict
* Family violence or sexual abuse during childhood
* Unstable housing arrangements
* Living in out-of-home care
* Poor school performance and attendance
* Low socioeconomic background
* Family history of pregnancies at a young age
* Low level of maternal education
* Low self-esteem
* Undisclosed same-sex attraction
* Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status
* Living in rural and remote areas
* Having a mental health diagnosis&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Persistent high rates in English-speaking countries have been attributed to their ambivalent attitude and hence behaviour towards contraception, sex education and mass communication about sexuality, their welfare provision for unmarried mothers and their social inequalities.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Studies have indicated that girls who report first sexual intercourse during their early teen years have higher rates of teenage pregnancy than girls who delay their sexual activity until they are older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Age at First Sexual Intercourse and Teenage Pregnancy in Australian Female Twins|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S183242740000801X|journal = Twin Research and Human Genetics|date = 2007-06-01|issn = 1839-2628|pages = 440–449|volume = 10|issue = 03|doi = 10.1375/twin.10.3.440|first = Mary|last = Waldron|first2 = Andrew C.|last2 = Heath|first3 = Eric|last3 = Turkheimer|first4 = Robert|last4 = Emery|first5 = Kathleen K.|last5 = Bucholz|first6 = Pamela A. F.|last6 = Madden|first7 = Nicholas G.|last7 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further study found a strong association between high rates of pregnancy and partner violence. This same study also indicated high rates of miscarriages and terminations in relation to the same issue of partner violence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; There have been other studies that have indicated association between partner violence and preterm birth, which further indicates that violence in partnerships plays a great role in issues relating to teenage pregnancy, specifically in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Medical Journal of Australia|last = Skinner, Hickey|first = Simon, Michael|date = 2003|journal = Current priorities for adolescent sexual and reproductive health in Australia.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of all ages who are experiencing violence and abuse can be subject to coercive sex and unprotected intercourse, leading to a higher rate of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies, however this rate is much higher in teenagers.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pregnancy and protection: Perceptions, attitudes and experiences of Australian female adolescents|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1871519208001066|journal = Women and Birth|date = 2009-01-01|volume = 22|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.wombi.2008.12.001|first = S. Rachel|last = Skinner|first2 = Jennifer|last2 = Smith|first3 = Jennifer|last3 = Fenwick|first4 = Jacqueline|last4 = Hendriks|first5 = Sue|last5 = Fyfe|first6 = Garth|last6 = Kendall|pages=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the majority of Australian women are aware of contraception and the reasons behind the use of these mechanisms, many use it either inconsistently or not at all. Motivation has been indicated to influence peoples attitudes towards contraception, and this has been found to fluctuate in different contexts, such as romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Given this information, the notion of contraceptive use being the behavioural link between reproductive outcomes and pregnancy attitudes, some advocates have argued that sexual health policy makers and clinicians must remove themselves from the assumption that teenagers are motivated to avoid pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Controversies ==
Opinions on teenage pregnancy worldwide often reflect prejudice of one kind or another, and in Australia it is the negative kind. These opinions are sometimes polarised however there is usually no conflict in relation to the strategies of trying to avoid unwanted pregnancies in adolescents. Both arguments towards teenage pregnancy, positive and negative, usually support the practise of healthy sexual activity and encourage young women to grow in knowledge and social skills.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Despite a [[Demographics of Australia|demographic]] shift that has seen the average age of women giving birth in Australia increase to over 30 years, roughly 5% of deliveries still occur to teenagers. This provides great [[controversy]] as many people argue against putting more money and time into reducing teenage pregnancies, as the rate isn't "high enough". The argument against this however, is that the rate can decrease even more with better education and increased access to health services, and that teenage health should be a major priority in Australia.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sex education and unintended pregnancy|last = Dyson, Mitchell|first = Sam, Alex|date = 2005|journal = Are we seeing the results?|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, research has been found to suggest that early intervention that prevents people from relying on [[welfare]] may be more important in reducing utilisation of welfare benefits in the future, by teenage mothers. This is because state dependence plays a bigger role in higher welfare reliance of teenage mothers. In Australia, [[policy]]-makers have been mainly concerned with the potential interference of teenage motherhood with teenage mothers’ school education, because lower education has been indicated to be associated with adverse [[Labour economics|labour market]] outcomes and hence higher welfare dependency.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The tax burden of social support for teenage mothers is an issue in Australian public discourse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Many argue that teenage pregnancy is a choice and teenage mothers should have to live with the issues associated with this choice. This is backed up by a growing number of studies suggesting that the level of control an adolescent maintains over their contraceptive behaviour is the strongest predictor of pregnancy outcomes, and inconsistent and non users of contraception have much higher odds of becoming pregnant compared to consistent users. However this view point has been challenged by further research stating that despite obvious links between behaviour and outcome, there is no study that fully understands the basic processes influencing adolescent’s sexual and reproductive choices, including contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pregnancy and Protection|author1=Skinner S.R |author2=Smith J. |author3=Fenwick J. |author4=Hendriks J. |author5=Fyfe S. |author6=Kendall G.  |last-author-amp=yes |date = 2009|journal = Perceptions, attitudes and experiences of Australian female adolescents.|doi = 10.1016/j.wombi.2008.12.001|pmid = |access-date = |volume=22 |pages=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing number of studies also suggest that, although teenage pregnancy may be perceived as problematic by Australian society, young people usually regard it differently.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Pregnant teenagers in Australia have a [[caesarean section]] rate of 13.4% compared to 33.4% among women aged over 40.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A third of teenage mothers become pregnant again within two years of their first child which has indicated to be because of poor contraceptive use, according to research published in ''[[The Medical Journal of Australia]]''.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Teenage mothers in Perth|last = Bainbridge|first = J|date = 2010|journal = Australia have second babies too quickly|doi = 10.12968/bjom.2010.18.10.78844|pmid = |access-date =|volume=18|pages=663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Western Australia]]n based study followed 150 first-time mothers and found that most of the teenagers were having sex again within 3 months of the birth of their babies, and in total 47 were pregnant again within 2 years. Two were said to be pregnant just 6 weeks after their first birth.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In Australia in 1995 there were 43.6 pregnancies per 1000 young women aged 15–19 years, and this rate had been stable for the previous 10 years. This is relatively low in comparison to the same age group in the [[United States|USA]] (83.6 per 1000), and is comparable to other Western developed nations like [[New Zealand]] (54 per 1000), [[United Kingdom]] (47 per 1000) and [[Canada]] (45.4 per 1000). Overall in Australia in 1995, there were 19.8 births and 23.8 terminations per thousand young women aged 15–19 years.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Australia's teenage [[fertility]] rate is higher than most developed countries outside the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In addition, Australia has one of the highest abortion rates in this age group, with the proportion of pregnancies ending in [[abortion]] having increased from 20% to over 50% over the past 30 years. This figure has since remained stable.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 2013, the birth rate in Australia among young women was 14.6 births per 1,000 women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

1 in 25 live births in Australia in 2009 were to teenage mothers, and two in every 100 girls aged between 15 and 19 years become pregnant every year.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/teen-pregnancy-crisis/story-e6freuzi-1111112681937|title = Teen Pregnancy Crisis|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Risk factors (AIHW)|url = http://www.aihw.gov.au/child-health/risk-factors/|website = www.aihw.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomo Razmilovic''' (born 31 May 1942) is a [[Croatia]]n-born businessman, formerly the [[chief executive officer]] of [[Long Island, New York]]-based [[Symbol Technologies]]. He is the suspected mastermind of a massive [[accounting scandal|accounting fraud]] that ultimately cost the company its independence.  Currently, the [[United States Government]] considers him a [[fugitive]], with the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]] offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.&lt;ref name=usps-poster&gt;{{cite web|title=Wanted Poster of Tomo Razmilovic|url=https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/radDocs/wanted/razmilov.htm|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Split, Croatia]], Razmilovic studied [[electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Zagreb]] and management at the Hammond Institute in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=nyt-longisland&gt;{{cite news|last=Tagliaferro|first=Linda|title=Long Island Q&amp;A: Tomo Razmilovic, Moving From Bar Codes to Advances in Communications|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/nyregion/long-island-q-tomo-razmilovic-moving-bar-codes-advances-communications.html?src=pm|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained Swedish [[citizenship]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=ceoannouncement&gt;[http://www.symbol.com/news/pressreleases/pr_finanstock_ceo.html Press release from Symbol] announcing appointment as CEO&lt;/ref&gt;

Razmilovic joined Symbol in 1989 as Senior Vice President of International Operations, becoming head of Worldwide Sales and Service in 1993 and president and [[chief operating officer]] in 1995.  He succeeded founder [[Jerome Swartz]] as CEO in 2000. Previously, he had been president of [[International Computers Limited]], a British computer manufacturer, and president and CEO of Cominvest, a [[Economy of Sweden|Swedish]] computer company.&lt;ref name=ceoannouncement/&gt;  He abruptly retired in 2002 in the midst of a [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] inquiry into its accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/nyregion/li-work-at-symbol-changes-at-top-ahd-hopes-for-revival.html|title=At Symbol, Changes At Top and Hopes for Revival|last=Strugatch|first=Warren|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2002-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2004, an [[arrest warrant]] for Razmilovic was issued by the [[United States District Court]] in [[Brooklyn]]. According to the United States Postal Inspection Service, he is wanted for orchestrating a massive accounting fraud that cost investors more than $200 million. &lt;ref name=newsday-fugitive&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrington|first=Mark|title=Fugitive ex-CEO faces $90M civil penalty |url=http://www.newsday.com/business/fugitive-ex-ceo-faces-90m-civil-penalty-1.3228303|work=Newsday|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was formally indicted on June 3, along with seven other former Symbol executives.  According to investigators, Razmilovic was the mastermind behind a wide-ranging scheme to inflate the company's sales and profits.  It included several types of fraud, such as [[channel stuffing]] (booking sales to wholesalers and distributors as final sales to customers), candy deals (selling products to distributors with no matching customer orders and then buying the products back), use of tango sheets (records of how much revenues had to be inflated to match quarterly targets) and use of cookie jar reserves (declaring nonrecurring expenses that far exceeded likely expenses).  On the same day, Razmilovic and 10 other executives were sued by the SEC for the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/04/business/ex-executives-at-symbol-are-indicted.htm|title=Ex-Executives at Symbol Are Indicted|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2004-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, four executives pleaded guilty, and seven executives settled SEC charges against them.  Several of those who pleaded guilty stated under oath that Razmilovic was the mastermind of the fraud.&lt;ref name=apologydemand/&gt;  After the fraud came to light, it was revealed that Razmilovic had been forced out at Cominvest due to accounting irregularities.&lt;ref name=WaitingOut&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-04/business/0407030278_1_tomo-razmilovic-swedish-charges|title=Ex-Symbol CEO waiting out charges in Sweden|last=Harrington|first=John|publisher=[[Newsday]]|date=2004-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Symbol learned of the fraud in the summer of 2002 via an internal investigation, and cooperated with authorities.  In late 2002, it restated almost four years worth of earnings from 1998 to 2001, in the process erasing $234 million in revenue and $325 million in net income.  It also paid $37 million to settle the SEC charges and $138 million to settle numerous shareholder suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/21/business/technology-day-2-i-learn-the-books-are-cooked.html|title=Technology, Day 2:  I Learn the Books Are Cooked|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18734.htm SEC suit against Symbol]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SECorder&gt;[http://www.secactions.com/sec-obtains-62-6-million-judgement-against-former-ceo/ SEC release announcing penalties against Razmilovic]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company never recovered, and was ultimately forced to merge with [[Motorola]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=AmericanGreed&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=2013 |title=[[American Greed|American Greed: The Fugitives]]:  Diamonds Aren't Forever |url= |format= |medium=Television Production |publisher=[[CNBC]] |location=[[United States]] |accessdate= |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Razmilovic was not heard from again until 2004, when [[WNBC]] in [[New York City]] and [[Newsday]], the main newspaper on [[Long Island]], found him living in a small town in Sweden.&lt;ref name=apologydemand&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Tomo-Razmilovic-Fugitive-Millionaire-Sweden-CEO-Symbol-Technologies-Long-Island-232921331.html|title=Fugitive Long Island CEO Accused of $200 Million Fraud Wants Apology |last=Dienst|first=Jonathan|publisher=[[WNBC]]|date=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaitingOut/&gt;  He had fled there citing claims that he would not be able to get a fair trial in the United States.&lt;ref name=newsday-fugitive/&gt;  In 2008, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine named Razmilovic one of the "World's Most Wanted White-Collar Fugitives".&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vardi|first=Nathan|title=The World's Most Wanted White-Collar Fugutives |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/08/27/legal-crime-fbi-biz-cz_nv_0827fugitives.html|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=17 February 2012 |author2=Asher Hawkins }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The SEC won a [[default judgement]] against Razmilovic in 2009.  In 2011, federal judge [[Sandra J. Feuerstein]] ordered Razmilovic to [[disgorgement (law)|disgorge]] $41.7 million in illegal profits and pay a $20.8 million civil penalty.  With interest, the penalty could add up to as much as $47 million.  He is also banned from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company again.&lt;ref name=newsday-fugitive/&gt;&lt;ref name=SECorder/&gt;  On January 17, 2014, federal prosecutors on Long Island filed a civil suit seeking the forfeiture of $12 million in illegal profits that they believe Razmilovic has hidden in a [[Credit Suisse]] account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/feds-seek-12m-from-fugitive-li-tech-exec-1.6823709|title=Feds seek $12M from fugitive LI tech exec|last=Riley|first=John|publisher=[[Newsday]]|date=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Razmilovic maintains that he is innocent, and in a 2013 interview with WNBC and [[CNBC]] went as far as to demand an apology from investigators and media covering the story.  He has stated that he has no intention of returning to the United States to face the charges against him.   Sweden will not give up Razmilovic for [[extradition]] because it does not turn over suspected white-collar criminals to a country not located in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=apologydemand/&gt;

The accounting fraud was profiled by CNBC's ''[[American Greed|American Greed: The Fugitives]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref name=AmericanGreed/&gt;

The '''[[Trinidad and Tobago]] Red Cross Society (TTRCS)'''  was founded on 12 July 1939 as a Branch of the [[British Red Cross]] Society. It has its headquarters in [[Port of Spain]], with branches in the North and South of the island of Trinidad and one branch on the island of [[Tobago]].  Following the attainment of [[independence]] in 1962, the TTRCS became an Independent Society by Act No. 15 of 1963. On August 8, 1963, the TTRCS became part of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The Constitution of the Trinidad and Tobago Red Cross Society is based on the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their additional Protocols of 1977 and the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement which are:
 
:• Humanity
:• Impartiality			
:• Neutrality
:• Independence
:• Voluntary Service
:• Unity
:• Universality
 
The TTRCS is made up of several departments with programmes grouped into six core areas:
 
:• Promoting Humanitarian Principles and Values
:• Disaster Preparedness and Response
:• Health and Care in the Community
:• HIV and AIDS information/ education
:• Youth Activities
:• Restoring family contacts
 
The Trinidad &amp; Tobago Red Cross Society (TTRCS) is an auxiliary in the humanitarian field to the Government of the Republic of Trinidad &amp; Tobago.

'''Governance'''

The Trinidad and Tobago Red Cross is controlled and administered by a General Council which represents the Society as a whole. The General Council has thirty-six members, some appointed and some elected.  18 are members of the Executive Committee, which governs the Trinidad and Tobago Red Cross Society.

A '''troop density''' ({{lang-ru|Плотность войск}}) also known as the ''dispersion factor'' in [[military science]] is a [[Statistics#Experimental and observational studies|statistical value]] assigned by commanders during the [[combat operations process]] in considering the ability of the [[Combat Arms]] to achieve [[Goal|military objectives]] during a [[military operation]]. It reflects [[combat readiness]] of the [[unit (military)|units]] to participate in [[engagement (military)|engagements]] with consideration to the [[Tactical Area of Responsibility|terrain]] and expected enemy strength.

The [[Units of measurement|unit of measurement]] is square metres per [[soldier]], although this is modified for each combat arm to reflect their primary [[weapon performance]] in combat as [[weapon density]] ({{lang-ru|Плотность оружия}});&lt;ref&gt;cf.p.243, Naveh&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[artillery|guns]] for artillery.&lt;ref&gt;pp.84-85, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; Troop density is also used to [[Intelligence analysis|estimate]] forces required to occupy a given populated territory in order to deny this population to being exploited by the enemy [[Covert operation|covert forces]] or insurgent troops.&lt;ref&gt;p.16, McGrath&lt;/ref&gt;

The troop density has decreased through [[military history]] in proportion to the increase in [[weapon lethality|lethality of weapons]] being use in combat.&lt;ref&gt;pp.84-85, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no accepted standard to calculate this value due to the large number of variables involved in the planning of combat operations.&lt;ref&gt;p.93, McGrath&lt;/ref&gt;

Military history can be divided into three periods according to ''average troop density'' employed in [[combat]]: ancient armies with about 10 square metres per foot soldier, the age of [[close order formation]] armed with firearms encompassing the period from the 1650s to the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1871 that increased the average to 250 square meters per [[infantryman]], and the [[Second World War]] when the density decreased to 27,500 square metres per [[infantryman]].&lt;ref&gt;p.84, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Army]] has based much of its post-war doctrine on the war experience, and had devoted considerable resources to the analysis of troop density, including these in almost all considerations of wartime operations.&lt;ref&gt;for example during strategic offensives to liberate Poland, p.295, Chaney&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[Cold War]] the density (in Europe) was estimated to be 50,000 square metres per [[infantryman]] due to widespread [[mechanised infantry|mechanisation]] of forces.&lt;ref&gt;p.84, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt;

Troop density was included in the [[Military doctrine|doctrine]] of the [[First World War]] belligerents, based on the [[battalion]] per [[forward zone]] front calculation.&lt;ref&gt;p.216, Samuels&lt;/ref&gt; The density of troops also affects the planning of [[close air support]] operations because of the higher rate of missions required to deliver adequate munitions to their targets.&lt;ref&gt;p.123, Brown&lt;/ref&gt; The increased dispersal of troops was the consideration behind the decision to develop [[nuclear bomb]]s before effects of radiation were realised.&lt;ref&gt;p.65, Bellamy&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical density of troops in the area of combat is not reflective of the average value for any given [[Command (military formation)|command]] because dispersion of troops tends to follow [[terrain]] and [[military tactics|tactical]] considerations of the combat planning, and actual location of troops tends to be in clusters of [[position (military)|positions]].&lt;ref&gt;p.191, Hughes&lt;/ref&gt; Low troop density is a particular problem as a period of vulnerability during [[air assault]], [[air landing]], [[amphibious assault]] and to some extent [[airborne assault]] operations,&lt;ref&gt;p.32, McCall &amp; Corder&lt;/ref&gt; as well as during pre-combat concentration of troops in the [[staging area]] prior to their movement to the battle area, denying them [[operational mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;p.64, National Research Council&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Urapmin people''' are an ethnic group numbering about 375 people in the [[Telefomin District]] of the [[West Sepik Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. One of the [[Mountain Ok people|Min peoples]]  who inhabit this area, the Urapmin share the common Min practices of [[hunter-gatherer]] subsistence, [[taro]] cultivation, and formerly, an elaborate secret cult available only to initiated men.

The Urapmin used to ally with the [[Telefol people|Telefolmin]] in war against other Min peoples, practicing [[cannibalism]] against the enemy dead, but warfare ceased by the 1960s with the arrival of [[colonialism]]. A [[Christian revival]] in the 1970s led to the near-complete abandonment of traditional beliefs and the adoption of a form of [[Charismatic Christianity]] originally derived from [[Baptist Christianity]]. The Urapmin vigorously use their native [[Urapmin language|Urap language]], and their small community maintains the practice of [[endogamy]].

The Urapmin are one of the [[Mountain Ok people|Min people]]s, a group of related peoples in [[Papua New Guinea]] who number about thirty thousand in total.&lt;ref name="b28"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Barker|2007|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m306" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mac31" /&gt; Min peoples are mainly found in the [[Telefomin District]], spread from the mountains of the [[Strickland River]] to [[West Papua Province]].&lt;ref name="c609"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cranstone|1968|p=609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b332"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Brumbaugh|1980|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Min'' derives from the suffix ''-min'', meaning 'peoples', which is present in their names (e.g. [[Telefol people|Telefolmin]], [[Wopkaimin people|Wopkaimin]], etc.).&lt;ref name="mac31"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|MacKenzie|1991|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Min peoples may also be known as Mountain Ok peoples, from the word ''ok'' meaning 'river' or 'water'.&lt;ref name="mac31" /&gt; The latter name contrasts them with the [[Lowland Ok people]] to the south who speak related languages but differ greatly culturally and in the environment that they live in.&lt;ref name="mac31" /&gt;

The Urapmin speak a [[Mountain Ok languages|Mountain Ok language]].&lt;ref name="b28" /&gt; Although this language family is tied to the Min ethnic grouping, it does not absolutely define the group, since the [[Oksapmin]] to the east and the Om river groups speak non-Mountain Ok languages.&lt;ref name="mac32" /&gt; The Urapmin kinship system is [[cognatic]];&lt;ref name="r2004_24" /&gt; in general the western Min groups have [[bilateral kinship]] systems, while the eastern Min groups have [[patrilineal kinship]] systems.&lt;ref name="mac32" /&gt;

The Min peoples are fairly homogeneous in technology, economy, and subsistence.&lt;ref name="mac32" /&gt; This includes hunting and gathering from forests and stream-beds, shifting [[taro]] cultivation, and raising small numbers of domestic pigs.&lt;ref name="mac32" /&gt; Min material culture is also fairly uniform; Telefol women describe [[bilum]]s throughout the Min region as being of "one kind", though there is some stylistic variation.&lt;ref name="mac33"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|MacKenzie|1991|pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A salient shared feature of Min culture is a common origin myth and initiation into a secret male religious cult.&lt;ref name="b332" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mac32" /&gt; Traditionally, the Min believed that all Min peoples other than the [[Baktaman]] are children of [[Afek (mythology)|Afek]], the "Primal Mother" and originator of all Min culture and religion.&lt;ref name="mac32-33"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|MacKenzie|1991|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types and number of cult initiation ceremonies differed among different Min groups.&lt;ref name="mac32-33" /&gt; The Telefol in particular were viewed as being guardians of Afek's legacy since they were her lastborn,&lt;ref name="mac33" /&gt; and the Urapmin were close to the Telefol in the Min ritual hierarchy.&lt;ref name="r2004_15,17"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|pp=15, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:OkTediMine.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Ok Tedi mine]] site.]]
Historically, the [[Mountain Ok people|Min peoples]] were in a constant state of warfare with one another.&lt;ref name="c610" /&gt; Each Min tribe was a unified group whose component groups did not wage war among each other, with  the exception of the [[Tifalmin people]] who were split into four mutually hostile groups.&lt;ref name="c610" /&gt; The primary weapon used in war was a [[bow and arrow|bow]] of black [[palm wood]], usually using arrows with barbed wooden heads.&lt;ref name="c610" /&gt;

Spears were unknown, though some tribes (e.g. the Telefolmin, but not the Tifalmin) used wooden clubs.&lt;ref name="c610" /&gt; Warfare might consist either of small ambush parties, which would surprise people on paths and in gardens and kill and [[cannibalism|eat]] all of those caught, no matter their age or sex.&lt;ref name="c610" /&gt; Other times, warfare was more formal, with groups marching out to meet each other for battle with freshly-painted shields.&lt;ref name="c610" /&gt;

The Urapmin divided up peoples encountered into traditional allies ([[Urapmin language|Urap]]: ''dup'') and enemies (''wasi''), along with foreigners (''ananang'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urapmin were allied with the Telefolmin, and engaged in trade with them, and in war joined with them to become a single unit.&lt;ref name="c618"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cranstone|1968|p=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b333"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Brumbaugh|1980|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based in the belief in descent from common ancestors.&lt;ref name="c610" /&gt; The Urapmin also were friendly with their southern neighbors, the [[Faiwolmin people|Faiwolmin]].&lt;ref name="c610" /&gt;

Friendly relations with foreign groups were based on [[trade]] — the Urapmin practiced a custom whereby men would have ''tisol dup'' (literally "wealth friend"), trading partners from other Mountain Ok groups.&lt;ref name="r2004_51"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Telefol and Urapmin were traditionally enemies with the Tifalmin to the northwest and the [[Feranmin]] to the southeast.&lt;ref name="mac32"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|MacKenzie|1991|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warfare was still practiced between the Min peoples in the first half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="c610" /&gt;

=== European contact ===
European contact came late to Papua New Guinea, and to the [[New Guinea Highlands|Highlands]] in particular.&lt;ref name="r2004_46"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the European contact with the Telefolmin dates to 1914, the earliest European contact with the Urapmin was made by the Williams party of 1936–1937, which was searching the [[Fly River|Fly]] and [[Sepik River|Sepik]] areas for mineral deposits.&lt;ref name="r2004_49"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by an [[United States|American]] by the name of Ward Williams, the party consisted of eight (later nine) Europeans and twenty-three natives recruited from the coast.&lt;ref name="r2004_49" /&gt; The Williams group had minimal contact with the Urapmin.&lt;ref name="r2004_50"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urapmin who were alive at the time attest that the Urapmin, unsure how to refer to the newcomers, learned from the Telefolmin to refer to them as the ''Wilumin'', a [[portmanteau]] of the name 'William' and the suffix used for [[demonyms]] among the Min peoples, ''-min''.&lt;ref name="r2004_50" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Urapmin later abandoned this term and began calling the whites ''dalabal'', meaning the smell of a [[penis gourd]]. Eventually the coastal natives that were hired by another patrol taught the Urapmin the term ''tabalasep'', which is the term that is currently used in the Urap language for whites. See {{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A trade relationship was quickly established, with [[salt]] being the most desired commodity among the Urapmin.&lt;ref name="r2004_51" /&gt; The Urapmin relate that:

{{Quote | text=We were afraid when we first saw whites, but they enticed us with salt. We tasted it and it was good. And then they gave us matches and showed us how to make fires. Then we went and got them food, sweet potato, taro, and bananas and we gave it to them. We exchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Babalok, a member of the Urapmin, quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1944, the [[Australian]]s built up the [[airstrip]] in [[Telefomin]] for use by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] as an emergency landing strip in the [[New Guinea campaign]] of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="r2004_53"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point until the end of the war, the [[Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit]] kept a post in Telefomin, though it is unclear to what extent this affected the Urapmin at the time.&lt;ref name="r2004_53" /&gt; In 1948, after the conclusion of the war, a patrol station was established at Telefomin, marking the beginning of Australian colonization of the region.&lt;ref name="r2004_53" /&gt;

The Urapmin refer to the subsequent colonial period as the time when "the law came and got us" ([[Tok Pisin]]: ''lo i kam kisim mipela'') or when "we got the law" (Tok Pisin: ''mipela kisim lo'').&lt;ref name="r2004_47"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What was likely the first government patrol of the Urapmin area was conducted in 1949 by Patrol Officer J. R. Rogers, accompanied by nine native policemen.&lt;ref name="r2004_54"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers convinced the Urapmin to make peace with the Tifalmin, stating that "fighting and cannibalism must cease."&lt;ref name="r2004_54" /&gt; The Urapmin performed a ''tisol dalamin'' ("equivalent exchange ceremony"), a traditional form of dispute resolution which had not been used before by the Urapmin to make peace with enemy peoples.&lt;ref name="r2004_54" /&gt;

By the 60s the majority of the Telefomin region had been pacified.&lt;ref name="c610"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cranstone|1968|p=610}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Large numbers of Urapmin converted to Christianity between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt; The religion was brought to Urapmin by [[Telefol people|Telefol]] and Urapmin pastors who had studied in Telefomin at the Australian Baptist Mission.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt; While Urapmin never hosted expatriate missionaries, by the mid-1970s there were a number of knowledgeable Christians in the community.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt; However, the majority of conversions occurred during a [[Christian revival]] which swept the New Guinea Highlands in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="r2001_903" /&gt; The ''rebaibal'', as it is known in [[Tok Pisin]], had begun in the [[Solomon Islands]] and reached Urapmin by 1977.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt; This movement caused all of the Urapmin to convert, and led to the rise of [[Charismatic Christianity]] among the Urapmin.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r2001_903" /&gt;

Urapmin society has been significantly affected by the [[Ok Tedi mine]].&lt;ref name="r1998_300-301"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|pp=300–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mine is located in [[Tabubil]], built in the early 1980s, which is located two-and-a-half days by foot from Urapmin, or accessible by plane from Telefomin.&lt;ref name="r1998_301"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, many Urapmin had begun visiting Tabubil once every few years, more frequently for prominent families.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt; For the Urapmin, Tabubil has become both a place where consumer goods are visible and a haven from sharing resources.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt;

Few Urapmin have been employed by the mine at any time, and due to the lack of a road or airstrip, the Urapmin have been unable to market vegetables to the mine as have their neighbors.&lt;ref name="r1995_213" /&gt; As a result, the Urapmin have not experienced much of the economic development that has occurred to neighboring groups.&lt;ref name="r1995_213" /&gt; The Kennecott company began prospecting for gold on Urapmin land in 1989, raising hopes, and while the company left Papua New Guinea in 1992, the Urapmin remain optimistic about future prospecting.&lt;ref name="r1995_213" /&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Papua new guinea west sepik province.png|thumb|300px|right|Location of the West Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea (dark red)]]

The Urapmin number about 375, living in the [[Telefomin District]] in [[West Sepik Province]], Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name="c609" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r1998_300"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the more-numerous [[Telefol people]], they are located by the headwaters of the [[Sepik River]], the [[Telefomin valley]], and the nearby [[Elliptaman valley]].&lt;ref name="b332-333"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Brumbaugh|1980|pp=332–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live in a remote region; [[Telefomin]], the District Office, and an airstrip can only be reached by a difficult seventeen-mile walk.&lt;ref name="r1998_300" /&gt;

The total area of Urapmin territory is small, and most villages are within walking distance.&lt;ref name="rgeo2" /&gt; Most of the Urapmin villages (Urap: ''abiip'') are located along the top of a ridge in the foothills of the [[Behrmann mountains]].&lt;ref name="rgeo1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ridge is known in Urap as ''Bimbel'', named after the earthquake spirit ''Bim'' who is believed to have flattened out the ridge.&lt;ref name="rgeo1" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The word for "earthquake" in Urap is also ''bim''. See {{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villages along the Bimbel ridge are ''Danbel'' (''Muli Kona''), ''Salafaltigin'', ''Drum Tem'', ''Atemkit'', and ''Dimidubiip''.&lt;ref name="rgeo1" /&gt;

There are also two villages known as "places at the sides" (Tok Pisin: ''saitsait ples'') which are near the ridge but not directly on top of it; these are ''Makalbel'' and ''Ayendubiip''.&lt;ref name="rgeo1" /&gt; Urapmin from the more northerly villages of Atemkit, Dimidubiip, and Ayendubiip are known as "bottom" Urapmin, while the others are known as "top" Urapmin.&lt;ref name="rgeo2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
As with other remote Papuan groups, the central elements of Urapmin life are subsistence agriculture, hunting, and Christianity.&lt;ref name="r1998_300" /&gt;

=== Language ===
{{main|Urapmin language|Tok Pisin}}

The native language of the Urapmin is known as the Urapmin or Urap language (Urap: ''urap weng''), a member of the [[Mountain Ok languages|Mountain Ok subfamily]] of the [[Ok languages]].&lt;ref name="rlang1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Urap is linguistically intermediate between its geographic neighbors [[Telefol language|Telefol]] and [[Tifal language|Tifal]], it is not a dialect of either.&lt;ref name="rlang1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Urapmin
  | publisher = [[SIL International]]
  | date = n.d.
  | url = http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=urm
  | accessdate = December 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multilingualism among the Urapmin has led many Telefolmin to believe that the Urapmin speak Telefol among themselves, but this is not the case.&lt;ref name="rlang1" /&gt; Although the Urapmin view the [[Tifal language]] as being closer to Urap than the [[Telefol language]] is, and an early account claimed that the Urapmin speak Tifal, more recent research indicates that they should not be considered the same language.&lt;ref name="rlang1" /&gt; Urap remains in vigorous use among the Urapmin, and is the main language that they use.&lt;ref name="rlang2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One unusual feature of the Urapmin language is the use of [[dyadic kinship term]]s.&lt;ref name="rdyad1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms translate into English as reciprocal kinship or affinity relations such as "(pair of) brothers" or "father and child", and may sometimes even refer to a relations between three or more people.&lt;ref name="rdyad2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms can encode relative age, kinship or affinity, number of members, and gender.&lt;ref name="rdyad2" /&gt; For example, a pair of siblings is ''alep'' (plural ''ningkil''), a pair of affines is ''kasamdim'' (plural ''amdimal''), a couple is ''agam'' (plural ''akmal''), a woman with a child is ''awat'' (plural ''aptil''), and a man with a child is ''alim'' (plural ''alimal'').&lt;ref name="rdyad2" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Urapmin differs from [[Telefol language|Telefol]] in that it does not distinguish groups of siblings (''ningkil'') based on whether they are single or mixed sex groups. See {{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=348}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plural forms are not marked for which generation is pluralized; thus ''alimal'' may either mean (a) one man and two children or (b) one man, one woman, and one child.&lt;ref name="rdyad2" /&gt; These terms are used to address groups, but not single individuals, so for example a mother of two children would never to referred to or addressed using the term ''aptil'' (rather, one would use ''alamon'' 'mother').&lt;ref name="rdyad2" /&gt; However, a pastor could address his congregation — a collection of husbands and their wives and children — as ''sios alimal'' 'church alimal' or just ''alimal''.&lt;ref name="rdyad3"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tok Pisin]] language is also widely used by the Urapmin.&lt;ref name="rlang1" /&gt; One of the national [[languages of Papua New Guinea]], Tok Pisin is an important [[lingua franca]] in rural areas.&lt;ref name="rlang1" /&gt; The Urapmin learn the language from older children and in school, becoming fluent around the age of twelve.&lt;ref name="rlang1" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The language of schooling is nominally [[English language|English]], and use of Tok Pisin is officially forbidden. However, in effect students become literate in Tok Pisin, while never getting close to becoming fluent in English. See {{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tok Pisin is regularly used in daily life, and has contributed many loan words to Urap.&lt;ref name="rlang2" /&gt; In particular, Tok Pisin is associated with modernity and Western institutions and is regularly used in contexts such as local governance and Christian services and discussions.&lt;ref name="rlang2" /&gt; Unlike some other peoples in Papua New Guinea, the Urapmin have not attempted to find native equivalents for Tok Pisin terms related to Christianity.&lt;ref name="rlang2" /&gt; The New Testament edition most used by the Urapmin is in Tok Pisin, the ''Nupela Testamen Ol Sam'' published by the Bible Society of Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name="rlang3"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbin|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic system ===
[[File:Taro root CDC.jpg|thumb|right|A [[taro]] root, a [[staple food]] of the Urapmin]]
The Urapmin practice [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, and raise small numbers of pigs.&lt;ref name="m306" /&gt; The main source of sustenance for the Urapmin is [[taro]] (Urap: ''ima'') and [[sweet potato]] (Urap: ''wan''), grown in swidden gardens (Urap: ''lang'') in the bush.&lt;ref name="r2004_24"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the main word for "food" in Urap is formed by compounding these two nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1995|pp=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are supplemented by [[banana]], [[pandanus]], [[sugar cane]], and various other [[cultigen]]s.&lt;ref name="r1995_213"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1995|pp=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hunting of marsupials, wild pigs, and other game is greatly valued in Urapmin culture, but it does not contribute significantly to sustenance.&lt;ref name="m306" /&gt; Domestic pigs are raised in only small numbers and killed on special occasions.&lt;ref name="r1995_213" /&gt; Tinned fish, rice, and frozen chicken must be brought in from Telefomin, the District Office, or Tabubil, and are considered by the Urapmin to be luxury goods.&lt;ref name="r1995_213" /&gt;

As with many other Papuan groups, the Urapmin consider the owner of an object or land to be the first person to create or work it.&lt;ref name="m307" /&gt; This is taken to the extent that every object in a household is considered to have an owner, and some households have even divided their shared gardens into individually owned plots.&lt;ref name="m307" /&gt; According to the traditional beliefs of the Urapmin, this fits into a general worldview where everything had an owner, either human or spirit.&lt;ref name="m307" /&gt;

=== Religion  ===
The Urapmin stand out among "remote" [[hunter-gatherer]] societies in how strongly they have rejected their traditional beliefs and practices ([[Urap language|Urap]]: ''alowal imi kukup'', literally "ways of the ancestors") and embraced those of [[Protestant Christianity]].&lt;ref name="r2001_903"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2001|p=903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in other Papuan cultures, among the Urapmin there is no ongoing conflict between Christians (Tok Pisin: ''kristins'') and "heathens" (Tok Pisin: ''haidens'').&lt;ref name="r1995_214"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1995|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rituals are still subjects of debate among the Urapmin as to whether they should still be practiced, in particular pig sacrifice and bridewealth exchange.&lt;ref name="r2001_904" /&gt;

====Traditional beliefs ====
According to traditional Urapmin belief all beings which existed in the world before the creation of humans were spirits.&lt;ref name="afek" /&gt; Humans were created in a multiple birth of the cultural heroine [[Afek (mythology)|Afek]], emerging immediately after the first dog (Urap: ''kyam'').&lt;ref name="afek" /&gt; Afek gave the bush to the spirits right before birthing humans so that they would clear out the villages for the humans to dwell in.&lt;ref name="afek"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2006|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since as such dogs are spirits, and as the Urapmin say the "older brother" of man, the Urapmin do not kill or eat them, unlike some neighboring tribes, nor do they let dogs breathe on their food&lt;ref name="afek" /&gt; (this contrasts with humans – the Urapmin previously had no [[cannibalism]] taboo, and they may share food with them    {{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason=unclear who "them" refers to. Probably the dogs, but with the interlude on cannibalism, it's weird. The lack of cannibalism taboo should probably be a new sentence}}).&lt;ref name="afek" /&gt; In fact, the taboo on eating dogs is one of the few still widely observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2006|pp=177, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afek was viewed both as the physical mother of all [[Mountain Ok people|Min peoples]] other than the [[Baktaman]], and as the originator of all Min culture and religion.&lt;ref name="mac32-33" /&gt; The [[Telefol people|Telefol]], as the lastborn of Afek, were thus entrusted with the guardianship of her legacy&lt;ref name="mac33" /&gt; (the Urapmin were at or at least quite close to the level of the Telefol in this hierarchy of religious knowledge).&lt;ref name="r2004_17"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Min peoples believed Afek to have left her primary relics in the cult house in the village of [[Telefolip]] (a contraction of ''Telefol abiip'' 'village of the Telefol').&lt;ref name="mac33" /&gt; Afek was believed to have married a serpent who formed the glade that only men could enter to reach Telefolip upon its death throes.&lt;ref name="c620"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cranstone|1968|p=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telefolip was never moved, and the buildings in Telefolip would constantly be rebuilt on the same locations.&lt;ref name="mac33" /&gt;

The traditional law of the Urapmin was characterized by many rules about religious behavior and an elaborate taboo system, focused especially on eating and land use, as well as regulating what could be touched and who could know what information.&lt;ref name="r1998_307"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r1998_305" /&gt; According to Urapmin tradition, Afek gave ownership of the wild (''sep'') to the ''motobil'' (nature spirits), who themselves gave ownership of the villages (''abiip'') to humans.&lt;ref name="m307"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Moretti|2007|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural resources, including streams, large trees, hunting ground, and game were believed to be owned by the motobil, and humans could only use what they were given permission to respectfully.&lt;ref name="m307" /&gt;

Violation of these rules was thought to cause illness.&lt;ref name="m307" /&gt; This system of taboos, known as ''awem'' in the Urapmin language, was well-developed and shaped everyday life.&lt;ref name="r1998_305"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who became ill due to disrespecting the land or animals of the motobil would pray for the spirits to "unhand" them, or if this did not work they would sacrifice pigs in order to appease the spirits.&lt;ref name="m306"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Moretti|2007|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m307" /&gt; Recently, the Urapmin required gold prospectors to sacrifice to these spirits before digging on their land, although this pre-emptive use of sacrifice is new to the Urapmin.&lt;ref name="m306" /&gt;

''Awem'' was abandoned in the late 1970s once the community had transitioned to Christianity, which was understood to be opposed to the practice of taboo.&lt;ref name="r1998_307-308"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|pp=307–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urapmin refer to the current period as "free time" (Tok Pisin: ''fri taim''), a liberating era where food and ground are freely available.&lt;ref name="r1998_307-308" /&gt; However, while the Urapmin now believe that God rather than Afek created everything, they still believe in the existence of motobil, albeit as "bad spirits" (Urap: ''sinik mafak'').&lt;ref name="r1995_214" /&gt;&lt;ref name="m309"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Moretti|2007|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They now believe that Afek and the other mythical Urapmin characters arose after the generations of "Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and Abraham" and lied, claiming falsely that they had created everything and that breaking their taboos would induce illness.&lt;ref name="r1995_216"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1995|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Urapmin now believe that God gave creation to humans to use, they see taking the motobils' property to be a moral imperative.&lt;ref name="m309" /&gt; However, the Urapmin still believe in motobil-induced illness, and therefore they do occasionally sacrifice to the motobil, despite this being against Christian teachings.&lt;ref name="m309" /&gt;

The Urapmin still abide by a traditional ethical code which requires mutual support (Urapmin: ''dangdagalin'') and forbidden social actions (Urapmin: ''awem'', but distinct from the other form of ''awem''), including adultery, anger, fighting, and theft.&lt;ref name="r1998_305" /&gt; As in many other Melanesian societies, one who eats alone (Urapmin: ''feg inin'') is condemned, for a person should share his food with others (Urapmin: ''sigil'').&lt;ref name="r1998_305" /&gt; Ethical breaches could be fixed by rituals such as "buying the anger" (Urapmin: ''aget atul sanin''), "buying the shame" (''fitom sanin''), and these are still practiced today.&lt;ref name="r1998_306,310"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|pp=306, 310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urapmin also used to ritually remove anger from the body in order to prevent disease, but this has now been replaced by prayer for God to remove one's anger.&lt;ref name="r1998_306,310" /&gt;

The Urapmin used to practice a type of male [[initiation]] known in Urap as ''ban''.&lt;ref name="r2001_904" /&gt; These elaborate rituals, for which the [[Mountain Ok people|Min peoples]] are famous, were a central part of Urapmin social life.&lt;ref name="b29"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Barker|2007|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ban'' was a multistage process which involved beatings and manipulation of various objects.&lt;ref name="r2001_904" /&gt; At each stage, the initiate was offered revelations of secret knowledge (Urap: ''weng awem''), but at the next stage these would be shown to be false (Urap: ''famoul'').&lt;ref name="r2001_904" /&gt; These initiations have been abandoned with the adoption of Christianity, and the Urap have expressed relief at no longer having to administer the beatings which were involved.&lt;ref name="r1998_307-308" /&gt;

==== Christianity ====
Due to the rise of Charismatic Christianity among the Urapmin, by the early 1990s, Urapmin Christianity was characterized by "healing, possession, constant prayer, confession, and frequent, lengthy church services."&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt; As elsewhere in Papua New Guinea, the form of Christianity among the Urapmin focuses especially on "millennial themes"—the return of Jesus and impending judgement.&lt;ref name="r1998_299"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the central themes of Urapmin Christianity are the last days ([[Tok Pisin]]: ''las de''), meaning the imminent return of Jesus to take his followers to heaven, and the need to live an ethical Christian life (Tok Pisin: ''Kristin laip'') in order to be one of those taken in the last days.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt;

Religious discourse often focuses on the need to control desires and obey the law of the Bible and the government in order to live a good Christian life.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt; These themes were traditionally important to the Urapmin even before the advent of Christianity.&lt;ref name="r1998_301" /&gt; Urapmin society recognizes an opposition between the character traits of willfulness ([[Urapmin language|Urapmin]]: ''futabemin'') and obeying the law (Urapmin: ''awem'')  or the demands of others (Urapmin ''weng sankamin'', lit. "to hear speech").&lt;ref name="r1998_303"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willfulness is defined as when one's will or desire (Urapmin: ''san'', Tok Pisin: ''laik'') causes one to ignore the demands of the law or other people.&lt;ref name="r1998_303" /&gt;

Both traits are considered important; for example, a woman is expected to choose her husband by exercising her own will, rather than caving to the pressure of her family or her suitors.&lt;ref name="r1998_304"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The practice of following the woman's desire in marriage is known in Tok Pisin as ''laik bilong meri''. Among many other Papuan groups, and in particular among the neighboring [[Telefol people|Telefomin]], ''laik bilong meri'' is a new practice associated with the colonial government. However, among Urapmin it is believed to be an old custom of theirs, as authenticated by the elaborate ritual surrounding it and in their oral genealogical records. See {{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=314}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Melanesia]]n societies recognize such an opposition; however, while in other societies balance between willfulness and respecting others' needs is achieved by community leaders or by dividing these traits between men and women, in Urapmin society each individual must balance these him or herself.&lt;ref name="r1998_302"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the adoption of Christianity led to a vilification of willful behavior in general, since salvation could only be reached by following God's will; therefore, the focus of Urapmin culture became the suppression of desire.&lt;ref name="r1998_307-308" /&gt;

The Urapmin have replaced traditional rituals with new, Christian methods for removing sin (Tok Pisin: ''sin'', Urapmin ''yum'', lit. debt).&lt;ref name="r1998_307" /&gt; The Urapmin have innovated an institution of [[confession (religion)|confession]] (Tok Pisin: ''autim sin''), which was not present in the [[Baptist Church]] which they belong to.&lt;ref name="r1998_308"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r2001_904" /&gt; Confessions are held at least once a month, and some Urapmin keep lists of sins in order not to forget to confess them.&lt;ref name="r1998_308" /&gt; Pastors and other leaders regularly give haranguing lectures (Urapmin: ''weng kem'') about avoiding sin.&lt;ref name="r1998_308" /&gt;

Another sin-removal ritual that the Urapmin practice is a form of group possession known as the "spirit disco" (Tok Pisin: ''spirit disko'').&lt;ref name="r1998_310-311"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|pp=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women gather in church buildings, dancing in circles and jumping up and down while women sing Christian songs; this is called "pulling the [Holy] spirit" (Tok Pisin: ''pulim spirit'', Urap: ''Sinik dagamin'').&lt;ref name="r1998_311"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r2004_284"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs' melodies are borrowed from traditional women's songs sung at drum dances (Urap: ''wat dalamin''), and the lyrics are typically in Telefol or other [[Mountain Ok languages]].&lt;ref name="r2004_284" /&gt; If successful, some dancers will "get the spirit" (Tok Pisin: ''kisim spirit''), flailing wildly and careening about the dance floor.&lt;ref name="r1998_311" /&gt;

After an hour or more, those possessed will collapse, the singing will end, and the spirit disco will end with a prayer and, if there is time, a Bible reading and sermon.&lt;ref name="r1998_311" /&gt; The body is believed to normally be "heavy" (Urap: ''ilum'') with sin, and possession is the process of the Holy Spirit throwing the sins from one's body, making the person "light" (Urap: ''fong'') again.&lt;ref name="r1998_311" /&gt; This is a completely new ritual for the Urapmin, who have no indigenous tradition of spirit-possession.&lt;ref name="r1998_312"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|1998|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Urapmin practice frequent prayer (Tok Pisin: ''beten''), at least beginning and ending the day with prayer, and often praying a number of times throughout the day.&lt;ref name="r2001_903" /&gt; Prayer may be both communal and individual, for such things as health, agriculture, hunting, relief from anger, bad omens in dreams, blessing meals, removal of sin, and just to offer praise to God.&lt;ref name="r2001_903" /&gt; In addition to ritual speech during prayer, the Urapmin emphasize that a Christian life involves listening to "God's talk" (Urap: ''Gat ami weng'').&lt;ref name="r2001_904" /&gt; The centrality of speech in modern Urapmin Christianity contrasts sharply with the mainly ritual-based traditional Urapmin culture, where sacred speech might even be blatantly false.&lt;ref name="r2001_904"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2001|p=904}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urapmin have a [[cliché]] that reflects this: "God is nothing but talk" (Urap: ''Gat ka weng katagup''; Tok Pisin: ''Gat em i tok tasol'').&lt;ref name="r2001_904" /&gt;

=== Kinship ===

The Urapmin practice [[endogamy]].&lt;ref name="r2004_24" /&gt; Since the Urapmin community is quite small, numbering in the hundreds, and Urapmin do not marry first cousins, the result is that most Urapmin are related to each other relatively directly.&lt;ref name="r2004_24" /&gt;

The Urapmin are divided into kinship classes known as ''tanum miit'' (literally "man origin").&lt;ref name="rtanum"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|pp=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five tanum miit currently in widespread use are the ''Awem Tem Kasel'', the ''Awalik'', the ''Atemkitmin'', the ''Amtanmin'', and the ''Kobrenmin''.&lt;ref name="rtanum" /&gt; There is also a ''Fetkiyakmin'' group which is dying out, and in the past there were other tanum miit which have already gone extinct.&lt;ref name="rtanum" /&gt; The tanum miit used to be related to specific ritual observances and secret mythologies.&lt;ref name="rtanum" /&gt; Supernatural powers were believed to be distributed among them; for example, one group controlled the wind and another the rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, they are viewed as the largest landholding units, and each village is thought to have a dominant tanum miit.&lt;ref name="rtanum" /&gt;

Tanum miit are inherited [[cognatic]]ly through both parents; so one person may be a member of four tanum miit at once just by considering his or her grandparents.&lt;ref name="rtanum" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Tanum miit do not play a role in marriage, so a person may inherit less tanum miit from his or her grandparent if they share tanum miit. See {{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|pp=191–192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the close family connections between all of the Urapmin, any Urapmin can assert membership in every tanum miit and some can calculate how they have inherited them.&lt;ref name="rtanum" /&gt; The ''tanum miit'' thus do little to differentiate people in Urapmin society, and their membership is "fluid".&lt;ref name="r2004_24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rtanum" /&gt; However, the kamokim ('big men'), the more influential Urapmin, may treat these groups as more exclusive in order to organize others' actions.&lt;ref name="rtanum" /&gt;

=== Political system ===

The Urapmin have a group of leaders, known as ''kamokim'' (singular ''kamok'') in the Urapmin language and ''bikman'' in Tok Pisin.&lt;ref name="b29" /&gt; These leaders organize people into villages, help people pay bridewealth payments, speak at court cases, and organize work groups to carry out large-scale projects.&lt;ref name="b29" /&gt; The kamokim are held in high regard in all public spheres and are a common topic of conversation.&lt;ref name="b29" /&gt;

The Urapmin make a division between the village (Urap: ''abiip'') and the bush (Urap: ''sep'').&lt;ref name="r2006_176" /&gt; These domains are kept separate, and the Urapmin keep their villages free of plant matter.&lt;ref name="r2006_176"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2006|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villages are U-shaped with dirt-packed plazas, with no grass or weeds.&lt;ref name="r2004_23"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Robbins|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Urapmin have at least one house in a village (Urap: ''am'').&lt;ref name="r2004_24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r1998_304" /&gt; However, due to the importance of forest gardens for sustenance, the Urapmin spend much of their time in isolated bush houses (Urap: ''sep am''), built in elaborate fashion near gardens and hunting grounds.&lt;ref name="r2004_24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r1998_304" /&gt; Villages are arranged by the kamokim, who coax people from ''sep am'' or from other villages.&lt;ref name="r1998_304" /&gt; When the kamok dies, the village inhabitants disperse.&lt;ref name="r1998_304" /&gt;

'''World Sparrow Day''' is a day designated to raise awareness of the [[house sparrow]] and then other common birds to urban environments, and of threats to their populations, observed on 20 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-21/kanpur/31219946_1_sparrows-and-other-birds-world-sparrow-day-bird-lover|title='Save sparrows for nature's balance'|newspaper=Times of India|date=21 March 2012|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/article3024688.ece
|newspaper=The Hindu|title=Spare a thought for the sparrow |last=Sathyendran |first=Nita |accessdate=22 March 2012|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an international initiative by the [[Nature Forever Society]] of India in collaboration with the Eco-Sys Action Foundation (France) and numerous other national and international organisations across the world.&lt;ref name=bnhs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnhs.org/press/press-releases/252-chirp-for-the-sparrow-tweet-for-the-sparrow-on-world-sparrow-day.html|title='Chirp for the Sparrow, Tweet for the Sparrow' on World Sparrow Day|publisher=Bombay Natural History Society|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nature Forever Society was started by Mohammed Dilawar, an Indian conservationist who started his work helping the house sparrow in [[Nashik]], and who was named one of the "Heroes of the Environment" for 2008 by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' for his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Time|title=Heroes of the Environment 2008: Mohammed Dilawar|first=Madhur|last=Singh|date=24 September 2008|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1841778_1841782_1841791,00.html|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mohammed Dilawar: World Sparrow Day March 20th |url=http://www.ecowalkthetalk.com/blog/2011/03/11/mohammed-dilawar-world-sparrow-day-march-20th/ |first=Bhavani |last=Prakash |work=Eco Walk the Talk |date=11 March 2011|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Todd|first=Kim|year=2012|title=Sparrow|series=Animal|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-875-3|page=150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of marking World Sparrow Day came up during an informal discussion at the Nature Forever Society's office. The idea was to earmark a day for the house sparrow to convey the message of conservation of the house sparrow and other common birds and also mark a day of celebration to appreciate the beauty of the common biodiversity which is taken so much for granted. The first World Sparrow Day was celebrated in 2010 in different parts of the world. The day was celebrated by carrying out different various kinds of activities and events like art competitions, awareness campaigns, and sparrow processions as well as interactions with media.&lt;ref name=bnhs/&gt;&lt;ref name=background&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsparrowday.org/background.html|work=World Sparrow Day|publisher=Nature Forever Society|title=Background|archivedate=8 May 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67WGPjYPr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Sparrow Day also has a broader vision to provide a platform where people who are working on the conservation of the house sparrow and other common birds can network, collaborate and exchange conservation ideas which will lead to better science and improved results. It aims to provide a meeting ground for people from different parts of the world to come together and form a force that can play an important role in advocacy and in spreading the awareness on the need of conserving common biodiversity or species of lower conservation status.&lt;ref name=bnhs/&gt;&lt;ref name=background/&gt;

==Sparrow Awards==
To encourage efforts made towards this cause and to selflessly conserve the environment, NFS has instituted the first Sparrow Awards in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, on 20 March 2011. In 2013, one of the key facilitators who has joined forces with NFS and supports Sparrow Awards is ''Sustainuance'' magazine. The Editor-In-Chief of the magazine, Shashwat D.C. who convened the event and handed out the award to the winners stated, "These awardees are unsung heroes who come from all walks of life. And what is remarkable is that they usually work without any government funding and do not seek any recognition."
