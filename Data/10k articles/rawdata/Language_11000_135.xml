In [[computer science]], the '''abstract syntax''' of data is its structure described as a [[data type]] (possibly, but not necessarily, an [[abstract data type]]), independent of any particular representation or encoding. This is particularly used in the representation of text in [[computer language]]s, which are generally stored in a tree structure as an [[abstract syntax tree]]. Abstract syntax, which only consists of the structure of data, is contrasted with [[concrete syntax]], which also includes information about the representation. For example, concrete syntax includes features like parentheses (for grouping) or commas (for lists) which are not included in the abstract syntax, as they are implicit in the structure.

Abstract syntaxes are classified as '''first-order abstract syntax''' (FOAS), if the structure is abstract but names (identifiers) are still concrete (and thus requires [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]]), and ''[[higher-order abstract syntax]],'' if the names themselves are abstract.

==Uses==
To be implemented either for computation or communications, a mapping from the abstract syntax to specific machine representations and encodings must be defined; these may be called the "[[concrete syntax]]" (in language implementation) or the "transfer syntax" (in communications).

A [[compiler]]'s internal representation of a program will typically be specified by an abstract syntax in terms of categories such as "statement", "expression" and "identifier". This is independent of the source syntax ('''concrete syntax''') of the language being compiled (though it will often be very similar). A [[parse tree]] is similar to an [[abstract syntax tree]] but it will typically also contain features such as parentheses which are syntactically significant but which are implicit in the structure of the abstract syntax tree.

[[Algebraic data type]]s are particularly well-suited to the implementation of abstract syntax.

'''Algerian Sign Language''' (French: ''Langue des signes algérienne (LSA)'', Tamazight: ''Tutlayt Tagugamt n Lezzayer'', Arabic: لغة الإشارة الجزائرية  
) is the [[sign language]] most commonly used in [[Algeria]]. It was officially recognized by the Algerian law on the protection and promotion of persons with a disability enacted on May 8, 2002.

It has influenced the deaf community in [[Oujda]] in northern [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ethnolink|asp|Algerian Sign Language}} at ''Ethnologue''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language''''' (London, 1668) is the best-remembered of the numerous works of [[John Wilkins]], in which he expounds a new [[universal language]], meant primarily to facilitate international communication among scholars, but envisioned for use by diplomats, travelers, and merchants as well.  Unlike many universal language schemes of the period, it was meant merely as an [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary]] to—not a replacement of—existing natural languages.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
&lt;!-- for future use: "So that if men should generally consent upon the same way or manner of Expression, as they do agree in the same Notion, we should then be freed from that Curse in the Confusion of Tongues, with all that unhappy consequences of it.&lt;p&gt;"Now this can only be done, either by 'enjoyning'' some one Language and Character to be universally learnt and practised, (which is not to be expected, till some person attain to the ''Universal Monarchy'', and perhaps it would not be done then) or else by ''proposing some such way as, by its facility and usefulness, (without the imposition of Authority) might ''invite'' and ingage men to the learning of it; which is the thing here attempted." (''Essay'', p.20) --&gt;
[[File:Wilkins An Essay towards a real.jpg|thumb|300px|The first edition cover page]]

==Background==
One of the aims of the ''Essay'' was to provide a replacement for the [[Latin language]], which had been the international language of scholars in Western Europe by then for 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ute |last=Dons|title=Descriptive adequacy of early modern English grammars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7ffwL7Gs14C&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=28 March 2012|year=2004|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-018193-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Amos Comenius|Comenius]] and others interested in international languages had criticisms of the arbitrary features of Latin that made it harder to learn, and Wilkins also made such points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Françoise |last=Waquet |translator-first=John |translator-last=Howe |title=Latin, or the Empire of a Sign |date=2001 |publisher=Verso |isbn=1859846157 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scheme for a ''[[lingua franca]]'' based on numerical values had been published by [[John Pell]] (1630); and in his 1640 work ''Mercury or the Secret Messenger'' (1640) Wilkins had mentioned the possibility of developing a [[trade language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Murphy |title=Comenius: a critical reassessment of his life and work |date=1995 |publisher=Irish Academic Press |pages=209–10 |isbn=0716525372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seth Ward (bishop)|Seth Ward]] was author with Wilkins of ''Vindiciae academiarum'' (1654), a defence of the Commonwealth period of the [[Oxbridge]] university system against outsider reformers. In it Ward put forward a related language scheme, though differing from the ''Essay'' of Wilkins in some significant ways.&lt;ref name="Wilkins1984"&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Wilkins|title=Mercury, or, The secret and swift messenger: shewing how a man may with privacy and speed communicate his thoughts to a friend at any distance ; together with an abstract of Dr. Wilkins's Essays towards a real character and a philosophical language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lc38yWFv3p8C&amp;pg=PR29|accessdate=28 March 2012|year=1984|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-3276-2|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward's ideas derived from a number of sources, such as [[Cyprian Kinner]] who was a follower of Comenius, [[Ramon Lull]], and [[Georg Ritschel]]. They went on to influence [[George Dalgarno]] as well as Wilkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=28706|title=Ward, Seth|first=John|last=Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was immediate interest in the ''Essay''; Wilkins is said to have regarded his work only in terms of a [[proof of concept]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry G. |last=Van Leeuwen|title=The problem of certainty in English thought, 1630–1690|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQXjQyIqVjcC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=28 March 2012|year=1970|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-247-0179-7|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the medium term enthusiasm for this kind of constructed language declined. The problem of a [[universal language]] remained as a topic of debate.&lt;ref name="Wilkins1984"/&gt;

==Composition and influences==
The stimulus for Wilkins to write the ''Essay'' came from the Council of the Royal Society, in 1662. The work was delayed by the [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666, which destroyed some of it in draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph L. |last=Subbiondo|title=John Wilkins and 17th-century British linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pP2LoB9eJkC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=28 March 2012|year=1992|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-4554-0|page=144 note 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was written by Wilkins, assisted by [[John Ray]], [[Francis Willughby]], and others. An influence was the ''Ars Signorum'' of George Dalgarno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Wilkins, John|display=Wilkins, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also influential, as Wilkins acknowledged, was ''The Ground-Work or Foundation Laid ... for the Framing of a New Perfect Language'' (1652) by [[Francis Lodwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=37684|title=Lodwick, Francis|first=Vivian|last=Salmon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The work is in five parts, of which the fourth contains the discussion of the "real character" and "[[philosophical language]]". The third deals with "philosophical grammar" ([[universal grammar]]).  The last part is the "alphabetical dictionary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John P. |last=Considine|title=Dictionaries in Early Modern Europe: Lexicography and the Making of Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqBkQFiTbX4C&amp;pg=PA298|accessdate=28 March 2012|date=27 March 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88674-1|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was compiled by [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lloyd, William (1627-1717)|display=Lloyd, William (1627–1717)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilkins' scheme==
[[File:Wilkins Essay Lord's Prayer.jpg|thumb|Sample of the "real character" from the ''Essay''. [[Joseph Moxon]] created the symbols for the printing of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=19466|title=Moxon, Joseph|first=D. J.|last=Bryden}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Wilkin's "Real Character" is a constructed family of symbols, corresponding to a [[classification scheme]] developed by Wilkins and his colleagues. It was intended as a [[pasigraphy]], in other words, to provide elementary building blocks from which could be constructed the universe's every possible thing and notion. The Real Character is not an [[orthography]]: i.e. it is not a written representation of [[spoken language]]. Instead, each symbol represents a concept directly, without (at least in the early parts of the ''Essay's'' presentation) there being any way of vocalizing it. Inspiration for this approach came in part from contemporary European accounts of the [[Chinese writing system]], which were somewhat mistaken.

Later in the ''Essay'' Wilkins introduces his "Philosophical Language", which assigns phonetic values to the Real Characters. For convenience, the following discussion blurs the distinction between Wilkins' Character and his Language.

Concepts are divided into forty main ''Genera'', each of which gives the first, two-letter syllable of the word; a Genus is divided into ''Differences'', each of which adds another letter; and Differences are divided into ''Species'', which add a fourth letter. For instance, ''Zi'' identifies the Genus of "beasts" (mammals); ''Zit'' gives the Difference of "rapacious beasts of the dog kind"; ''Zitα'' gives the Species of dogs. (Sometimes the first letter indicates a supercategory—e.g. Z always indicates an animal—but this does not always hold.) The resulting Character, and its vocalization, for a given concept thus captures, to some extent, the concept's [[semantics]].

The ''Essay'' also proposed ideas on weights and measure similar to those later found in the [[metric system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationLong.pdf |title=An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language |first=John |last=Wilkins |type=extract |accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.plover.com/physics/meter.html |title=John Wilkins invents the meter |work=The Universe of Discourse |first=Mark |last=Dominus |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The botanical section of the essay was contributed by [[John Ray]];
[[Robert Morison]]'s criticism of Ray's work began a prolonged dispute between the two men.&lt;ref name="Vines 1913"&gt;{{cite book | first=Sydney Howard |last=Vines |authorlink=Sydney Howard Vines | year = 1913 | chapter = Robert Morison 1620–1683 and John Ray 1627–1705 | editor-first = Francis Wall |editor-last = Oliver |editor-link=Francis Wall Oliver | title = Makers of British Botany | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related efforts, discussions, and literary references==

The ''Essay'' has received a certain amount of academic and literary attention,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} usually casting it as brilliant but hopeless.

One criticism (among many) is that "words expressing closely related ideas have almost the same form, differing perhaps by their last letter only...[I]t would be exceedingly difficult to remember all these minute distinctions, and confusion would arise, in rapid reading and particularly in conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guérard|first=Albert Léon |author-link=Albert Léon Guérard |title=A Short History of the International Language Movement |year=1921 |pages=90–92}} &lt;!-- Actually it's just one of these 3 pages, but I can't tell which page exactly from where I sit just now --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
([[Umberto Eco]] notes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eco |first=Umberto |year=1995 |title=The Search for the Perfect Language |trans-title=Ricerca della lingua perfetta nella cultura europea |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-17465-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Wilkins himself made such a mistake in the ''Essay,'' using ''Gαde'' (barley) where apparently ''Gαpe'' (tulip) was meant.)

[[George Edmonds (lawyer)|George Edmonds]] sought to improve Wilkins' Philosophical Language by reorganizing its grammar and orthography while keeping its taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmonds |first=George |year=1856 |title=A Universal Alphabet, Grammar, and Language, Comprising a Scientific Classification of the Radical Elements of Discourse: and Illustrative Translations from the Holy Scriptures and the Principal British Classics: to which is Added, A Dictionary of the Language |url=https://archive.org/details/universalalphabe00edmo |accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent ''a priori'' languages (among many others) are [[Solresol]] and [[Ro (language)|Ro]].  &lt;!-- why are these being called out in particular?  There are 100s of such proposals! --&gt;

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] discusses Wilkins' philosophical language in his essay ''El idioma analítico de John Wilkins'' (''The Analytical Language of John Wilkins''), comparing Wilkins’ classification to the fictitious Chinese encyclopedia ''[[Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge's Taxonomy|Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge]]'' and expressing doubts about any attempt at a universal classification.

In [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Quicksilver (novel)|Quicksilver]]'', character [[Daniel Waterhouse]] spends considerable time supporting the development of Wilkins' classification system. &lt;!-- what is meant by "supporting"— "assisting with,"  "championing"? --&gt;

'''Arcadocypriot''', or '''southern [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaean]]''', was an [[ancient Greek dialects|ancient Greek dialect]] spoken in [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]] in the central [[Peloponnese]] and in [[Cyprus]]. Its resemblance to [[Mycenaean Greek]], as it is known from the [[Linear B]] corpus, suggests that Arcadocypriot is its descendant.

==History==
Proto-Arcadocypriot (around 1200 BC) is supposed to have been spoken by Achaeans in the Peloponnese before the arrival of [[Dorians]], so it is also called southern Achaean. The [[isogloss]]es of the Cypriot and Arcadian dialects testify that the Achaeans had settled in Cyprus. As [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] reported:

{{bq|[[Agapenor]], the son of [[Ancaeus (son of Lycurgus)|Ancaeus]], the son of [[Lycurgus (Arcadia)|Lycurgus]], who was king after [[Echemus]], led the [[Arcadia]]ns to [[Troy]]. After the capture of Troy the storm that overtook the Greeks on their return home carried Agapenor and the Arcadian fleet to Cyprus, and so Agapenor became the founder of [[Paphos]], and built the sanctuary of Aphrodite at [[Kouklia#Palaipaphos|Palaepaphos]] (Old Paphos).&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+8.5.6 8.5.1]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The establishment happened before 1100 BC. With the arrival of Dorians in the Peloponnese, a part of the population moved to Cyprus, and the rest was limited to the Arcadian mountains.

According to John T Hooker, the preferable explanation for the general historico-linguistic picture is

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"that in the Bronze Age, at the time of the great Mycenaean expansion, a dialect of a high degree of uniformity was spoken both in Cyprus and in the Peloponnese but that at some subsequent epoch the speakers of [[Doric Greek|West Greek]] intruded upon the Peloponnese and occupied the coastal states, but made no significant inroads into Arcadia."&lt;ref&gt;John T Hooker, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=0CEiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164 ''Mycenaean Greece'' (Routledge Revivals).] Routledge, 2014 {{ISBN|1317751221}} p164&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later developments==
After the collapse of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] world, communication ended, and Cypriot was differentiated from Arcadian. It was written until the 3rd century BC with [[Cypriot syllabary]].&lt;ref&gt;Kypros,  [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]], c. 600 BC [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=208992&amp;bookid=353&amp;region=9&amp;subregion=0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kypros — [[Kourion]] ~320 BC [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=208432&amp;bookid=350&amp;region=9&amp;subregion=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[San (letter)#Arcadian "Tsan"|Tsan]] was a letter in use only in Arcadia until around the 6th century BC. Arcadocypriot kept many characteristics of Mycenaean, early lost in Attic and Ionic, such as the /w/ sound ([[digamma]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8061">'''Auditory agnosia''' is a form of [[agnosia]] that manifests itself primarily in the inability to recognize or differentiate between [[sounds]]. It is not a defect of the ear or "hearing", but a neurological inability of the brain to process sound meaning. It is a disruption of the [[Two-streams hypothesis#Ventral stream|"what" pathway]] in the brain.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Mio | first2 = Jeffery Scott | title = Cognitive psychology | date = 2009 | publisher = Cengage Learning/Wadsworth | location = Australia ; Belmont, CA | isbn = 978-0-495-50629-4 | oclc = 226291529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons with auditory agnosia can physically hear the sounds and describe them using unrelated terms, but are unable to recognize them. They might describe the sound of some environmental sounds, such as a motor starting, as resembling a lion roaring, but would not be able to associate the sound with "car" or "engine", nor would they say that it ''was'' a lion creating the noise.&lt;ref name="Martin 2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Martin | first1 = G. Neil. | title = Human neuropsychology | date = 2006 | publisher = Pearson/Prentice Hall | location = Harlow, England ; New York | isbn = 978-0-13-197452-4 | oclc = 61692682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory agnosia is caused by damage to the secondary and tertiary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe of the brain.&lt;ref name="Ingram 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Ingram | first1 = John C. L. | title = Neurolinguistics : an introduction to spoken language processing and its disorder | date = 2007 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 978-0-521-79640-8 | oclc = 73954871| pages = 160–170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are three primary distinctions of auditory agnosia that fall into two categories.

===Semantic-associative===
This type of auditory agnosia is caused by lesions to the left hemisphere of the brain, specifically the temporal lobes and Wernicke's area.&lt;ref name="Vignolo 1982"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Vignolo | first1 = LA. | title = Auditory agnosia. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 298 | issue = 1089 | pages = 49–57 |date=Jun 1982 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1982.0071 | pmid = 6125975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Linguistic (or verbal information or Wernicke's) agnosia'' indicates that the subject can't comprehend words, although they can understand words using [[sign language]] and words from reading books, and are themselves capable of speech (and even of deriving meaning from non-linguistic communication e.g. body language)&lt;ref name="Sacks 1985"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sacks | first1 = Oliver W. | title = The man who mistook his wife for a hat and other clinical tale | date = 1985 | publisher = Summit Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-671-55471-2 | oclc = 419872696  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the particular sounds associated to each word are meaningless.&lt;ref name="Ingram 2007" /&gt;

===Discriminative===
This type of auditory agnosia is caused by lesions to the right hemisphere of the brain.&lt;ref name="Vignolo 1982" /&gt;

''Classical (or pure) auditory agnosia'' is an inability to process environmental sounds, such as animal noises, industrial noises, or the like. An airplane roaring overhead would not be understood to be related to the idea of "airplane"—indeed, the person would not even think to look up.&lt;ref name="Heilman 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Heilman | first1 = Kenneth M. | last2 = Valenstein | first2 = Edward | title = Clinical neuropsycholog | date = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-513367-7 | oclc = 845504937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Interpretive or receptive agnosia (amusia)'' is an inability to understand [[music]]. The term "amusia" covers a broad spectrum: from those with a mere deficit of rhythmic ability (mild dysrhythmia), to those with heavy all-encompassing amusia, including the recently coined "distimbria"; sufferers regard music as simply "noise", often compared to drainpipes or drills, or other invasive forms of background noise. Vocal singing can be understood, but is simply seen as "odd tone of voice".&lt;ref name="Winn 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last = LastName | first = FirstName | title = Dictionary of biological psychology | publisher = Routledge | location = S.l | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780415867368 |oclc = 862988340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard is considered to be that amusics with a "normal" intensity of amusia are cortically unable to distinguish pitch changes of less than three semitones (when it includes a pitch-deficit; it is contentious whether without this symptom it can be considered amusia). They may appreciate or enjoy listening to or performing music, but some can not tolerate it or find it irritating.&lt;ref name="Mcdonald Stewart 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mcdonald|first1=Claire| last2=Stewart| first2=Lauren| title=Uses and functions of music in congenital amusia|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal| volume=25| issue=4|year=2008| pages=345–355|doi=10.1525/mp.2008.25.4.345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==

===Meaningless Sounds Discrimination Test===

In this test subjects are presented with two consecutive synthetic noises (usually with a two-second interval) and asked whether the noises are the same or different.  Those with damage to the right hemisphere have significantly lower scores on this test than those of controls and those with left hemisphere damage.&lt;ref name="Vignolo 1982" /&gt;

===Meaningful Sounds Identification Test===

In this test subjects are presented a natural sound followed by four pictures.  The subject is then asked to point to the picture that best represents the sound they just heard.  Those with damage to the left hemisphere do significantly poorer on this test than controls and those with right hemisphere damage.&lt;ref name="Vignolo 1982" /&gt;

==Special cases==

A seventy-four-year-old man named "M" had a special case of auditory agnosia.&lt;ref name="Saygin 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Saygin | first1 = AP. | last2 = Leech | first2 = R. | last3 = Dick | first3 = F. | title = Nonverbal auditory agnosia with lesion to Wernicke's area. | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–13 |date=Jan 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.08.015 | pmid = 19698727 | pmc=2794980}}&lt;/ref&gt; "M" had "unilateral left posterior temporal and parietal damage" (Saygin, Leech, &amp; Dick, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;107), including Wernicke's area. These areas of the brain are associated with language processing. He had a stroke when he was 62 and went through intensive speech therapy for twelve weeks to help him recover. He was able to regain his language capacity, but when tested at age 74, he had great difficulty in recognizing non-verbal environmental sounds. He did not have either verbal comprehension deficits nor peripheral hearing problems (p.&amp;nbsp;107). His condition was very rare because auditory agnosia for nonverbal sounds is usually associated with the right side of the brain. "M" was able to identify familiar Christmas songs and some animal sounds. When he heard music, he couldn't distinguish individual instruments or voices, but he knew it was music. fMRI scans show that after the stroke, his brain re-wired itself through neuronal compensation to account for the damage.

'''Bonin English''', or the '''Bonin Islands language''', is an [[English-based creole]] of the [[Bonin Islands]] south of Japan with strong Japanese influence, to the extent that it has been called a mixture of English and Japanese (Long 2007).

==History==
The [[Colony of Peel Island]] was the first permanent settlement in the archipelago. Peel island was settled in the early nineteenth century by speakers of eighteen European and Austronesian languages, including [[American English]] and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]. This resulted in a [[pidgin English]] that became a symbol of island identity. It creolized among second- and third-generation speakers as thousands of Japanese speakers settled the islands. The islanders became [[bilingual]], and during the early twentieth century Bonin English incorporated elements of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (Long 2007). Throughout the 20th century, most islanders used Bonin English at home. During the US occupation of 1946&amp;ndash;68, the so-called "Navy Generation" learned American English at school. While Bonin English vocabulary skewed toward English during this period, a trend towards Japanese resumed after the occupation ended. Today younger residents tend to be monolingual in a variety of Japanese closely resembling the Tokyo standard.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} A bilingual spoken dictionary  was published in 2005.

|}
In [[theoretical computer science]], in particular in [[formal language theory]], the '''Brzozowski derivative''' ''u''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' of strings and a [[string (computer science)|string]] ''u'' is defined as the set of all strings obtainable from a string in ''S'' by cutting off a [[prefix (computer science)|prefixing]] ''u'', formally: ''u''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' = { ''v'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''uv'' ∈ ''S'' }, cf. picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Janusz A. Brzozowski| title=Derivatives of Regular Expressions| journal=J ACM| year=1964| volume=11| pages=481–494| doi=10.1145/321239.321249}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is named after the computer scientist [[Janusz Brzozowski (computer scientist)|Janusz Brzozowski]] who investigated their properties and gave an [[algorithm]] to compute the derivative of a generalized [[regular expression]].

==Derivative of a regular expression==

Given a finite [[alphabet]] ''A'' of symbols,&lt;ref&gt;Brzozowski (1964), p.481, required ''A'' to consist of the 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; combinations of ''n'' [[bit]]s, for some ''n''.&lt;/ref&gt; a '''generalized regular expression''' denotes a possibly infinite set of finite-length strings of symbols from ''A''. It may be built of:
* ∅ (denoting the empty set of strings),
* ε (denoting the singleton set containing just the empty string),
* a symbol ''a'' from ''A'' (denoting the singleton set containing the single-symbol string ''a''),
* ''R''∨''S'' (where ''R'' and ''S'' are, in turn, generalized regular expressions; denoting their set's union),
* ''R''∧''S'' (denoting the intersection of ''R'' 's and ''S'' 's set),
* ¬''R'' (denoting the complement of ''R'' 's set with respect to the set of all strings of symbols from ''A''),
* ''RS'' (denoting the set of all possible concatenations of strings from ''R'' 's and ''S'' 's set),
* ''R''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (denoting the set of ''n''-fold repetitions of strings from ''R'' 's set, for any ''n''≥0, including the empty string).
In an ordinary regular expression, neither ∧ nor ¬ is allowed.
The string set denoted by a generalized regular expression ''R'' is called its '''language''', denoted as ''L''(''R'').

==Computation==

For any given generalized regular expression ''R'' and any string ''u'', the derivative ''u''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'' is again a generalized regular expression.&lt;ref&gt;Brzozowski (1964), p.483, Theorem 4.1&lt;/ref&gt;
It may be computed recursively as follows.&lt;ref&gt;Brzozowski (1964), p.483, Theorem 3.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the previous two rules, the derivative with respect to an arbitrary string is explained by the derivative with respect to a single-symbol string ''a''.
The latter can be computed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Brzozowski (1964), p.483, Theorem 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

{|

|-
| align=right | ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(¬''R'') || = ¬(''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'')
|}

Here, ν(''R'') is an auxiliary function yielding a generalized regular expression that evaluates to the empty string ε if ''R'' 's language contains ε, and otherwise evaluates to ∅. This function can be computed by the following rules:&lt;ref&gt;Brzozowski (1964), p.482, Definition 3.2&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|-
| align=right | ν(''a'') || = ∅ || for any symbol ''a''
|-
| align=right | ν(ε) || = ε
|-

|-
| align=right | ν(''R''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) || = ε
|-
| align=right | ν(''RS'') || = ν(''R'') ∧ ν(''S'')
|-
| align=right | ν(''R'' ∧ ''S'') || = ν(''R'') ∧ ν(''S'')
|-

|-
| align=right | ν(¬''R'') || = ε || if ν(''R'') = ∅
|-
| align=right | ν(¬''R'') || = ∅ || if ν(''R'') = ε
|}

==Properties==

A string ''u'' is a member of the string set denoted by a generalized regular expression ''R'' if and only if ε is a member of the string set denoted by the derivative ''u''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R''.&lt;ref&gt;Brzozowski (1964), p.483, Theorem 4.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering all the derivatives of a fixed generalized regular expression ''R'' results in only finitely many different languages. If their number is denoted by ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, all these languages can be obtained as derivatives of ''R'' with respect to string of length below ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Brzozowski (1964), p.484, Theorem 4.3&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is a complete deterministic finite automaton with ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; states which recognises the regular language given by ''R'', as laid out by the [[Myhill–Nerode theorem]].

In [[logic]], a '''categorical proposition''', or '''categorical statement''', is a [[proposition]] that asserts or denies that all or some of the members of one category (the ''subject term'') are included in another (the ''predicate term'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Churchill |first=Robert Paul |title=Logic: An Introduction |year=1990 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-02353-7 |oclc=21216829 |edition=2nd |page=143 |quote=A categorical statement is an assertion or a denial that all or some members of the subject class are included in the predicate class.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of [[argument]]s using categorical statements (i.e., [[syllogism]]s) forms an important branch of [[deductive reasoning]] that began with the [[Ancient Greeks]].

The Ancient Greeks such as [[Aristotle]] identified four primary distinct types of categorical proposition and gave them standard forms (now often called ''A'', ''E'', ''I'', and ''O''). If, abstractly, the subject category is named ''S'' and the predicate category is named ''P'', the four standard forms are:
*All ''S'' are ''P''. (''A'' form)
*No ''S'' are ''P''. (''E'' form)
*Some ''S'' are ''P''. (''I'' form)
*Some ''S'' are not ''P''. (''O'' form)
Surprisingly, a large number of sentences may be translated into one of these canonical forms while retaining all or most of the original meaning of the sentence. Greek investigations resulted in the so-called [[square of opposition]], which codifies the logical relations among the different forms; for example, that an ''A''-statement is contradictory to an ''O''-statement; that is to say, for example, if one believes "All apples are red fruits," one cannot simultaneously believe that "Some apples are not red fruits." Thus the relationships of the square of opposition may allow [[immediate inference]], whereby the truth or falsity of one of the forms may follow directly from the truth or falsity of a statement in another form.

Modern understanding of categorical propositions (originating with the mid-19th century work of [[George Boole]]) requires one to consider if the subject category may be empty. If so, this is called the ''hypothetical viewpoint'', in opposition to the ''existential viewpoint'' which requires the subject category to have at least one member. The existential viewpoint is a stronger stance than the hypothetical and, when it is appropriate to take, it allows one to deduce more results than otherwise could be made. The hypothetical viewpoint, being the weaker view, has the effect of removing some of the relations present in the traditional square of opposition.

Arguments consisting of three categorical propositions &amp;mdash; two as premises and one as conclusion &amp;mdash; are known as [[categorical syllogism]]s and were of paramount importance from the times of ancient Greek logicians through the Middle Ages. Although formal arguments using categorical syllogisms have largely given way to the increased expressive power of modern logic systems like the [[First-order logic|first-order predicate calculus]], they still retain practical value in addition to their historic and pedagogical significance.

==Translating statements into standard form==

Sentences in [[natural language]] may be translated into standard form. In each row of the following chart, ''S'' corresponds to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the example sentence, and ''P'' corresponds to the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].

{| class="wikitable" style="width:60%;"
|-
! Name
! English Sentence
! Standard Form
|-
| align="center" | ''A''
| {{yes|All cats have four legs.}}
| {{yes|All S is P.}}
|-
| align="center" | ''E''
| {{yes|No cats have eight legs.}}
| {{yes|No S is P.}}
|-
| align="center" | ''I''
| {{yes|Some cats are orange.}}
| {{yes|Some S is P.}}
|-
| align="center" | ''O''
| {{yes|Some cats are not black.}}
| {{yes|Some S is not P.}}
|}

Note that "All ''S'' is not ''P''" (e.g., "All cats do not have eight legs") is not classified as an example of standard form. This is because the translation to natural language is ambiguous. In common speech, the sentence "All cats do not have eight legs" could be used informally to indicate either (1) "At least some, and perhaps all, cats do not have eight legs" or (2) "No cats have eight legs".

==Properties of categorical propositions==
Categorical propositions can be categorized into four types on the basis of their "quality" and "quantity", or their "distribution of terms". These four types have long been named ''A'', ''E'', ''I'', and ''O''. This is based on the Latin ''{{Lang |la | '''a'''ff'''i'''rmo}}'' (I affirm), referring to the affirmative propositions ''A'' and ''I'', and ''{{Lang |la | n'''e'''g'''o'''}}'' (I deny), referring to the negative propositions ''E'' and ''O''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Churchill |first=Robert Paul |title=Logic: An Introduction |year=1990 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-02353-7 |oclc=21216829 |edition=2nd |page=144 |quote=During the Middle Ages, logicians gave the four categorical forms the special names of ''A'', ''E'', ''I'', and ''O''. These four letters came from the first two vowels in the Latin word '' 'a''ff''i''rmo' ('I affirm') and the vowels in the Latin 'n''e''g''o' '' ('I deny').}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantity and quality===
'''Quantity''' refers to the number of members of the subject class that are used in the proposition. If the proposition refers to all members of the subject class, it is ''universal''. If the proposition does not employ all members of the subject class, it is ''particular''. For instance, an ''I''-proposition ("Some ''S'' is ''P''") is particular since it only refers to some of the members of the subject class.

'''Quality''' It is described as whether the proposition affirms or denies the inclusion of a subject within the class of the predicate. The two possible qualities are called ''affirmative'' and ''negative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Copi |first1=Irving M. |authorlink1=Irving Copi |last2=Cohen |first2=Carl |authorlink2=Carl Cohen (professor) |title=Introduction to Logic |edition=11th |year=2002 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0-13-033735-8 |page=185 |quote=Every standard-form categorical proposition is said to have a '''quality''', either affirmative or negative.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an ''A''-proposition ("All ''S'' is ''P''") is affirmative since it states that the subject is contained within the predicate. On the other hand, an ''O''-proposition ("Some ''S'' is not ''P''") is negative since it excludes the subject from the predicate.

{| class="w

|-
! Name
! Statement
! Quantity
! Quality
|-
| align="center" | ''A''
| All S is P.
| align="center" | universal
| align="center" | affirmative
|-
| align="center" | ''E''
| No S is P.
| align="center" | universal
| align="center" | negative
|-
| align="center" | ''I''
| Some S is P.
| align="center" | particular
| align="center" | affirmative
|-
| align="center" | ''O''
| Some S is not P.
| align="center" | particular
| align="center" | negative
|}

An important consideration is the definition of the word ''some''. In logic, ''some'' refers to "one or more", which could mean "all". Therefore, the statement "Some S is P" does not guarantee that the statement "Some S is not P" is also true.

===Distributivity===
The two terms (subject and predicate) in a categorical proposition may each be classified as '''distributed''' or '''undistributed'''. If all members of the term's class are affected by the proposition, that class is ''distributed''; otherwise it is ''undistributed''. Every proposition therefore has one of four possible ''distribution of terms''.

Each of the four canonical forms will be examined in turn regarding its distribution of terms. Although not developed here, [[Venn diagram]]s are sometimes helpful when trying to understand the distribution of terms for the four forms.

====''A'' form====
An ''A''-proposition distributes the subject to the predicate, but not the reverse. Consider the following categorical proposition: "All dogs are mammals".  All dogs are indeed mammals, but it would be false to say all mammals are dogs. Since all dogs are included in the class of mammals, "dogs" is said to be distributed to "mammals". Since all mammals are not necessarily dogs, "mammals" is undistributed to "dogs".

====''E'' form====
An ''E''-proposition distributes bidirectionally between the subject and predicate. From the categorical proposition "No beetles are mammals", we can infer that no mammals are beetles. Since all beetles are defined not to be mammals, and all mammals are defined not to be beetles, both classes are distributed.

====''I'' form====
Both terms in an ''I''-proposition are undistributed. For example, "Some Americans are conservatives". Neither term can be entirely distributed to the other. From this proposition, it is not possible to say that all Americans are conservatives or that all conservatives are Americans.

====''O'' form====
In an ''O''-proposition, only the predicate is distributed. Consider the following: "Some politicians are not corrupt". Since not all politicians are defined by this rule, the subject is undistributed. The predicate, though, is distributed because all the members of "corrupt people" will not match the group of people defined as "some politicians". Since the rule applies to every member of the corrupt people group, namely, "All corrupt people are not some politicians", the predicate is distributed.

The distribution of the predicate in an ''O''-proposition is often confusing due to its ambiguity. When a statement such as "Some politicians are not corrupt" is said to distribute the "corrupt people" group to "some politicians", the information seems of little value, since the group "some politicians" is not defined. But if, as an example, this group of "some politicians" were defined to contain a single person, Albert, the relationship becomes clearer. The statement would then mean that, of every entry listed in the corrupt people group, not one of them will be Albert: "All corrupt people are not Albert". This is a definition that applies to every member of the "corrupt people" group, and is, therefore, distributed.

====Summary====
In short, for the subject to be distributed, the statement must be universal (e.g., "all", "no"). For the predicate to be distributed, the statement must be negative (e.g., "no", "not").{{sfn|Damer|2008|p=82}}

|-
| align="center" | ''O''
| Some S is not P.
| {{no2|undistributed}}
| {{yes|distributed}}
|}

====Criticism====
[[Peter Geach]] and others have criticized the use of distribution to determine the validity of an argument.&lt;ref name="SEP Medieval"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-syllogism/ |title=Medieval Theories of the Syllogism |date=2010-01-21 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |last=Lagerlund |first=Henrik |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphree"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdfview_1&amp;handle=euclid.ndjfl/1040511349 |title=The Irrelevance of Distribution for the Syllogism |last=Murphree |first=Wallace A. |journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic |volume=35 |number=3 |date=Summer 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that statements of the form "Some A are not B" would be less problematic if stated as "Not every A is B,"{{sfn|Geach|1980|pp=62–64}} which is perhaps a closer translation to [[Aristotle]]'s original form for this type of statement.&lt;ref name="SEP Square"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Traditional Square of Opposition |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/ |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |last=Parsons |first=Terence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations on categorical statements==
There are several operations (e.g., conversion, obversion, and contraposition) that can be performed on a categorical statement to change it into another. The new statement may or may not be equivalent to the original. [In the following tables that illustrate such operations, rows with equivalent statement shall be marked in green, while those with inequivalent statements shall be marked in red.]

Some operations require the notion of the ''class complement''. This refers to every [[Domain of discourse|element under consideration]] which is ''not'' an element of the class. Class complements are very similar to [[Complement (set theory)|set complements]]. The class complement of a set P will be called "non-P".

===Conversion===
{{main|Converse (logic)|l1=Logical conversion}}
The simplest operation is '''conversion''' where the subject and predicate terms are interchanged. 
{| class="wikitable" style="width:60%;"
|-
! Name
! Statement
! Converse / Obverted Converse
! Subaltern / Obverted / Condition
! Converse ''per accidens'' / Obverted / Condition
|-
| align="center" | ''A''
| {{no2|All S is P.}}
| {{no2|All P is S.&lt;br&gt;No P is non-S.}}
| {{partial|Some S is P.&lt;br&gt;Some S is not non-P.&lt;br&gt;(''if S exists'')}}
| {{partial|Some P is S.&lt;br&gt;Some P is not non-S.&lt;br&gt;(''if S exists'')}}
|-
| align="center" | ''E''
| {{yes|No S is P.}}
| {{yes|No P is S.&lt;br&gt;All P is non-S.}}
| {{partial|Some S is not P.&lt;br&gt;Some S is non-P.&lt;br&gt;(''if S exists'')}}
| {{partial|Some P is not S.&lt;br&gt;Some P is non-S.&lt;br&gt;(''if P exists'')}}
|-
| align="center" | ''I''
| {{yes|Some S is P.}}
| {{yes|Some P is S.&lt;br&gt;Some P is not non-S.}}
|rowspan=2 colspan=3 {{n/a}}
|-
| align="center" | ''O''
| {{no2|Some S is not P.}}
| {{no2|Some P is not S.&lt;br&gt;Some P is non-S.}}
|}
From a statement in ''E'' or ''I'' form, it is valid to conclude its converse. This is not the case for the ''A'' and ''O'' forms.

===Obversion===
{{main|Obversion}}
Obversion changes the ''quality'' (that is the affirmativity or negativity) of the statement and the predicate term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hausman |first1=Alan |last2=Kahane |first2=Howard |authorlink2=Howard Kahane |last3=Tidman |first3=Paul |title=Logic and Philosophy: A Modern Introduction |year=2010 |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth/Cengage learning |location=Australia |isbn=9780495601586 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EH3l1EW6kKgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA326#v=onepage 326] |url=http://www.cengagebrain.com/shop/en/US/storefront/US?cmd=CLHeaderSearch&amp;fieldValue=9780495601586 |edition=11th |accessdate=26 February 2013 |quote=In the process of '''obversion''', we change the quality of a proposition (from affirmative to negative or from negative to affirmative), and then replace its predicate with the negation or '''complement''' of the predicate.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a universal affirmative statement would become a universal negative statement.

{| class="wikitable" style="width:60%;"
|-
! Name
! Statement
! Obverse
|-
| align="center" | ''A''
| {{yes|All S is P.}}
| {{yes|No S is non-P.}}
|-
| align="center" | ''E''
| {{yes|No S is P.}}
| {{yes|All S is non-P.}}
|-
| align="center" | ''I''
| {{yes|Some S is P.}}
| {{yes|Some S is not non-P.}}
|-
| align="center" | ''O''
| {{yes|Some S is not P.}}
| {{yes|Some S is non-P.}}
|}

Categorical statements are logically equivalent to their obverse. As such, a Venn diagram illustrating any one of the forms would be identical to the Venn diagram illustrating its obverse.

===Contraposition===
{{main|Contraposition}}

{| class="wikitable" style="width:60%;"
|-
! Name
! Statement
! Contrapositive / Obverted
! Contrapositive ''per accidens'' / Obverted / Condition
|-
| align="center" | ''A''
| {{yes|All S is P.}}
| {{yes|All non-P is non-S.&lt;br&gt;No non-P is S.}}
| {{partial|Some non-P is non-S.&lt;br&gt;Some non-P is not S.&lt;br&gt;(''if non-P exists'')}}
|-
| align="center" | ''E''
| {{no2|No S is P.}}
| {{no2|No non-P is non-S.&lt;br&gt;All non-P is S.}}
| {{partial|Some non-P is not non-S.&lt;br&gt;Some non-P is S.&lt;br&gt;(''if S exists'')}}
|-
| align="center" | ''I''
| {{no2|Some S is P.}}
| {{no2|Some non-P is non-S.&lt;br&gt;Some non-P is not S.}}
|rowspan=2 colspan=2 {{n/a}}
|-
| align="center" | ''O''
| {{yes|Some S is not P.}}
| {{yes|Some non-P is not non-S.&lt;br&gt;Some non-P is S.}}
|}

A '''declarant''', generally speaking, is anyone who composes and [[signature|signs]] a [[:wikt:statement|statement]] or [[Wiktionary:declaration|declaration]] alleging that the information he has given therein is [[truth|true]]. This differs from an ''affiant,'' as in the case of an [[affidavit]] the facts therein are [[oath|sworn]] to before a [[notary public]] or other official, whereas a declaration is usually made by one person for the use of another.

Uttering a statement or declaration which is proven to be false is a crime in many jurisdictions, though usually a separate offence from [[perjury]].

The word declarant, when discussing the [[hearsay]] rule and its exceptions, refers to the person who makes an out-of-court statement.  For example, if John is on the [[witness stand]] and says "Mary said that she was afraid." Mary is the declarant, not John.  This concept is important in understanding many applications of the hearsay rule and its exceptions.

'''Dialogue in Silence''' is an [[exhibition]] about non-verbal communication, where participants discover a repertoire of expression possibilities with the help of [[deaf]] and [[Hearing loss|hearing impaired]] guides and trainers. Participants enter an area of complete silence, wearing noise-cancelling headsets, and experience an environment that helps them discover openness, [[empathy]] and an enhanced power of concentration. Throughout the entire exhibition tour, a reversal of [[role]]s is created: hearing visitors lose their usual routines of articulating themselves and discover a new repertoire of non-verbal expression. They experience a different openness and empathy towards "the other".

== Background and history ==
In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 278 million people worldwide having moderate to profound [[hearing loss]] in both ears or are born deaf.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The impact of hearing impairment on a child's speech, language, education and social integration depends on the level and type of hearing impairment, and the age of onset, especially if it begins before the age when speech normally develops." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs300/en/index.html World Health Organization].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The prototype of Dialogue in Silence was called “Schattensprache”. Focusing on silent communication it was presented for the first time 1998 in [[Frankfurt]]. Orna Cohen and [[Andreas Heinecke]] then developed this model further into the large exhibition format of today. In 2003 they introduced the new concept with great success to the public in [[Paris]] at the “[[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie|Cité des Sciences]] et l’Industrie”. In 2006 the exhibition was established as first permanent exhibition at the [[Children’s Museum Holon|Children’s Museum in Holon]], [[Israel]]. In 2008 and 2009 [[Mexico]] hosted the exhibition at the Children Museum in Papalote. In [[Germany]], the [[Museum für Kommunikation Frankfurt|Museum für Kommunikation]] in [[Frankfurt]] presented the exhibition in 2010 and 2011. So did the DASA Museum in [[Dortmund]] in 2009. In September 2014 Dialogue in Silence became the second permanent exhibition at the Dialoghaus in Hamburg, next to [[Dialogue in the Dark]]. In 2015, the exhibition Dialogue in Silence also became a permanent exhibition in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. In August 2017, a 30-days-trial will run in Japan, preparing for a longer exhibition in 2020.

Corporate learning workshops are offered as a spin off from the actual exhibition. All Dialogue in Silence exhibitions and corporate learning workshops are handled by Dialogue Social Enterprise GmbH, Hamburg.

== The exhibition layout ==
»Dialogue in Silence« is an exhibition that invites visitors into a world of silence. Different forms of expression are used here and language must be visible in order to be understood. Hearing-impaired guides lead visitors through the exhibition, which is totally soundproof. It is the encounter which lies at the heart of the experience. At the same time, a reversal of roles is created: hearing people are torn out of social routine and familiar perception. They discover their repertoire of non-verbal expression in order to communicate creatively by gestures and body language. Hearing-impaired people, who by virtue of their experience and ability to sign are more competent, support the visitors and become ambassadors of a world without sound which is no way poorer – but different.

The exhibition consists of a series of circular rooms dedicated to different aspects of [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal communication]]. All walls are specially constructed with a fabric absorbing [[sound]] to the best of effects, while providing a [[Monochromatic color|monochromatic]] background. The visitor’s visual concentration is not distracted and full attention can be is given to the visual experience and communication means. Each room has a name, indicating the activity it hosts. In each room, the [[scenario]] is broken down into several short stages thus creating a sense of progression:
* Invitation to Silence - Entrance into the world of silence
* Dance of Hands - Focus on hands and their capacity to express
* Gallery of Faces - Work on facial expressions and how to decipher them
* Play of Signs - Introduction to sign language
*[[File:Dialogue in Silence Guide .jpg|alt=Dialogue in SIlence Guide|thumb|265x265px|Dialogue in SIlence Guide]]Forum of Figures - Learning about the body's capacity to express via postures and movement
* Dialogue Room - Dialogue between visitors and the facilitator with the support of an interpreter
Whereas headphones are worn during the first 5 rooms, visitors are invited to go back to verbal language in the last room to get into an intensive dialogue with the tour guide and learn more about deaf culture and

'''Dubitante''' (Latin: "doubting") is used in [[law report]]s of a judge who is doubtful about a legal proposition but hesitates to declare it wrong. E.g., "Justice X acquiesces in the Court's opinion and judgment dubitante on the question of Constitutional preemption."

Some judges use this term after their names in separate opinions, as if analogous to concurring or dissenting. Doing so may signal that the judge has doubts about the soundness of the [[Majoritarianism|majority opinion]], but not so grave as to cause him to dissent.&lt;ref name="Czarnezki"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jason J.|first=Czarnezki|title=The Dubitante Opinion|journal=Akron Law Review|date=2006|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal philosopher [[Lon L. Fuller]] said that "the opinion entered ''dubitante'' [means that] the judge is unhappy about some aspect of the decision rendered, but cannot quite bring himself to record an open dissent."&lt;ref&gt;Lon Fuller, ''Anatomy of the Law'' 147 (1968) (quoted in ''Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. v. Grunwald'', {{report|400|F.3d|1119}}, 1151 (9th Cir. 2005)).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use—doubt but lack of conviction that the majority is wrong—is illustrated in Judge Friendly's concurrence in ''Feldman v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc''., in which he stated, "Although intuition tells me that the Supreme Court of Connecticut would not sustain the award made here, I cannot prove it. I therefore go along with the majority, although with the gravest doubts."&lt;ref name="Czarnezki"/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{report|524|F.2d|384}}, 393 (2d Cir. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Westlaw]] recorded 626 uses of the term in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Czarnezki, 2-3: "the term has been used in only 626 written opinions....Of the 626 total cases using the term, 269 are federal cases, twelve of those coming from the United States Supreme Court".&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly half of the instances of use of the term come from four federal court of appeals judges: [[Frank Coffin]] (First Circuit); [[Henry J. Friendly]] (Second Circuit); [[Frank Easterbrook]] (Seventh Circuit); and [[James C. Hill]] (Eleventh Circuit).&lt;ref&gt;Czarnezki, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* ''Majors v. Abell'', {{report|361|F.3d|349}}, 358 (7th Cir. 2004) (Easterbrook, J., dubitante).
::In ''Majors'', Judge Easterbrook wrote a ''dubitante'' opinion, arguing that Judge Posner's opinion ignored four controlling cases from the [[Supreme court]] protecting anonymous speech. He added: 
:::"Given ''McConnell'', I cannot be confident that my colleagues are wrong in thinking that five Justices will go along. But I also do not understand how that position can be reconciled with established principles of constitutional law".&lt;ref&gt;Judge Easterbrook is one of the most frequent users of ''dubitante'' among those few judges who use the term. Czarnezki 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Loughrin v. United States'', 573 U. S. __, {{report|134|S.Ct.|2384}}, 2395 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).
::United States Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote in his concurring opinion: "But I am ''dubitante'' on the point that one obtains bank property 'by means of' a fraudulent statement only if that statement is 'the mechanism naturally inducing a bank (or custodian of bank property) to part with money in its control' ... What the proper solution may be should in my view be left for another day."
* ''Lesley v. Chie'', {{report|250|F.3d|47}}, 56 n.10 (1st Cir. 2001) (“Thus, without using the burden-shifting model, we simply assume ''dubitante'' that the evidence Lesley has put forward is sufficient to require us to consider Dr. Chie’s reasons for his referral.”).
* ''Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc.'', {{report|244|F.3d|254}}, 262 (1st Cir. 2001) (“In any event, even were we to assume ''dubitante'' that Reed adequately requested an accommodation allowing her to walk away from conflicts with supervisors, Reed was never prevented from exercising such accommodation during her June 1, 1996 meeting with Callahan".)&lt;ref name=3n12&gt;Czarnezki 3 n.12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''United States v. Brady'', {{report|168|F.3d|574}}, 580 (1st Cir. 1999) ("But a significant purpose to obstruct is enough, even if we assume ''dubitante'' that a pure desire not to rat would avoid the obstruction charge".).&lt;ref name=3n12/&gt;
* ''Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc.'', {{report|105|F.3d|12}}, 15 (1st Cir. 1997) ("assuming, ''dubitante'', that a colorable claim may be made that 'ability to get along with others' is or may be ... a major life activity under the ADA...").

[[File:Emilia Fogelklou.jpg|thumb|Emilia Fogelklou in the 1930s.]]
'''Emilia Maria Fogelklou-Norlind''' (20 July 1878 in [[Simrishamn]] - 26 September 1972 in [[Uppsala]], Sweden) was a Swedish theologian and author.

She studied in Uppsala (B.Sc.  1906) and then was a candidate in theology (the first female in Sweden, 1909) and an honorary doctor of divinity (also the first female, Uppsala 1941).

She had various teaching positions including as a lecturer at the teachers' college in [[Kalmar]]. After 1923 she took leave from lecturing to devote herself entirely to writing and lecturing. Later she lectured at the National Institute [[Högre lärarinneseminariet]] and at the  [[University of Stockholm]]. 
She was a [[peace activist]] and attended the [[Women's Peace Congress (1915)]], also called the [[International Congress of Women#The Hague.2C April.E2.80.93May 1915|Hague Congress]] in 1915 and after the Second World War founded the Swedish Per Sundberg IAL. She collaborated with [[Nathanael Beskow]] in Birkagården. In 1932 she joined the [[Society of Friends]]. She wrote many important religious writings. She was a contributor to the liberal feminist magazine ''[[Tidevarvet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tidevarvsgruppen (The Age Group), Fogelstad-gruppen  (The Fogelstad Group) and the newspaper Tidevarvet (The Age.)|url=http://user.tninet.se/~uzt234e/Tidevarvet.htm|work=Hjördis Levin's homepage|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1922 to 1929 she was married to the geographer [[Arnold Norlind]]. Her book about him (''Arnold'' 1944) are at the top of her authorship. Her letters are also interesting, such as correspondence with [[Elin Wagner]], ''Dear Ili, dearest Elin'' (ed. Gunnel Vallquist, 1989).

In her final years she lived in [[Uppsala]].

== Background ==

Under the [[1975 Indira–Sheikh accord|1975 accord]], [[Sheikh Abdullah]] agreed to measures previously undertaken by the central government in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to integrate the state into India.{{sfn|Hussain, Kashmiri Visions of Freedom|2015|pp=102, 103}} Sociologist Farrukh Faheem states that it was met with of hostility among people of Kashmir and laid the groundwork for the future insurgency.{{sfn|Faheem, Interrogating the Ordinary|2018|pp=233, 234}} Those opposed to it included [[Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir]] and People's League in Indian Jammu and Kashmir, and [[Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF) based in [[Azad Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chowdhary|first1=Rekha |title=Jammu and Kashmir: Politics of identity and separatism |year=2015 |publisher= Routledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-2oCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 |isbn=1317414055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1970s, communalist rhetoric was being exploited in the state for [[votebank]] politics.

Critics of the then Chief Minister, Farooq Abdullah, charged that Abdullah was losing control. His visit to Pakistan administered Kashmir during then became an embarrassment, where according to [[Hashim Qureshi]], he shared a platform with JKLF . Though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of [[Indira Gandhi]] and his father, so that sentiments there could "be known first hand", few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed [[Khalistan movement|Khalistan]] terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On July 2, 1984, [[Ghulam Mohammad Shah|G. M. Shah]], who had support from Indira Gandhi, replaced his brother-in-law Farooq Abdullah and became the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, after Abdullah was dismissed, in what was termed as a political "coup".{{sfn|Praveen Swami; India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad: The Covert War in Kashmir, 1947–2004|2007|p=157}} 

G. M. Shah's administration, which did not have people's mandate, turned to Islamists and opponents of India, notably the [[Molvi Iftikhar Hussain Ansari]], [[Mohammad Shafi Qureshi]] and Mohinuddin Salati, to gain some legitimacy through religious sentiments. This gave political space to Islamists who previously lost overwhelmingly in the 1983 state elections.{{sfn|Praveen Swami; India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad: The Covert War in Kashmir, 1947–2004|2007|p=157}} In 1986, Shah decided to construct a mosque within the premises of an ancient Hindu temple inside the New Civil Secretariat area in Jammu to be made available to the Muslim employees for 'Namaz'. People of Jammu took to streets to protest against this decision, which led to a Hindu-Muslim clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verma|first1=P.

Islam is in danger). As a result, Kashmiri Pandits were targeted by the Kashmiri Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus. During the Anantnag riot in February 1986, although no Hindu was killed, many houses and other properties belonging to Hindus were looted, burnt or damaged.&lt;ref name="Tikoo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colonel Tej K Tikoo|title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&amp;pg=PT397|publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC|isbn=978-1-935501-58-9|pages=397–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation of Anantnag riots revealed that members of the 'secular parties' in the state, rather than the Islamists, had played a key role in organising the violence to gain political mileage through religious sentiments. Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on March 12, 1986, by the then Governor [[Jagmohan]] following communal riots in south Kashmir. This led Jagmohan to rule the state directly. The political fight was hence being portrayed as a conflict between "Hindu" New Delhi (Central Government), and its efforts to impose its will in the state, and "Muslim" Kashmir, represented by political Islamists and clerics.{{sfn|Praveen Swami; India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad: The Covert War in Kashmir, 1947– 19472004|2007|p=158}}

The Islamists had organised under a banner named [[Muslim United Front]], with manifesto to work for Islamic unity and against political interference from the centre, and contested the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 1987|1987 state elections]], in which they lost again. However, the 1987 elections were widely believed to be rigged so as to bring the secular parties ([[Jammu and Kashmir National Conference|NC]] and [[Indian National Congress|INC]]) in Kashmir at the forefront, and this caused the [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|insurgency in Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkTetMfI6QkC&amp;pg=PA137 |title=Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War|last=Schofield|first=Victoria|date=2000|publisher=I.B.

In order to undermine his political rival [[Farooq Abdullah]] who at that time was the Chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, the [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister of Home Affairs]] [[Mufti Mohammad Sayeed]] convinced [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[V.P. Singh]] to appoint Jagmohan as the governor of the state. Abdullah resented Jagmohan who had been appointed as the governor earlier in April 1984 as well and had recommended Abdullah's dismissal to [[Rajiv Gandhi]] in July 1984. Mufti was convinced that such a move will irritate Abdullah and make him quit. Abdullah had earlier declared that he would resign if Jagmohan was made the Governor. However, the Central government went ahead and appointed him as Governor on 19 January 1990. In response, Abdullah resigned on the same day and Jagmohan suggested the dissolution of the State Assembly. On 21 January 1990, two days after Jagmohan took over as governor, the [[Gawkadal massacre]] took place in Srinagar, in which the Indian security forces had opened fire on protesters, leading to the death of at least 50 people, and likely over 100. These events led to chaos. Lawlessness took over the valley and the crowd with slogans and guns started roaming around the streets. News kept coming of violent incidents and those Hindus who survived the night saved their lives by traveling out of the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ananth|first=V.

They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Pandit families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Pandits faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Pandits to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

The local organisation of Pandits in [[Kashmir]], Kashmir Pandit Sangharsh Samiti (KPSS) after carrying out a survey in 2008 and 2009, said that 399 [[Kashmiri Pandits]] were killed by insurgents from 1990 to 2011 with 75% of them being killed during the first year of the Kashmiri insurgency, and that during the last 20 years, about 650 Pandits have been killed in the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/201176134818984961.html |title=Kashmiri Pandits: Why we never fled Kashmir – Kashmir: The forgotten conflict |publisher=Al Jazeera English |author=Azad Essa |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/mobi/news/news/399-pandits-killed-since-1990-kpss/97140.html |title=399 Pandits killed since 1990 KPSS |date=20 June 2011 |publisher=Greater Kashmir |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti, estimates 357 pandits were killed in Kashmir in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://globalpressjournal.com/asia/indian-administered_kashmir/25-years-after-islamists-drove-out-hindus-kashmiris-debate-repatriation-incentives/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments==
Whilst some Pandit organisations such as [[Panun Kashmir]] etc. have accused Kashmiri Muslims of genocide and mass-rape, during the times of exodus,&lt;ref name="Chatterji et al."&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wB2DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT305 |title=Conflicted Democracies and Gendered Violence: Internal Conflict and Social Upheaval in India |last=Chatterji |first=Angana P. |last2=Buluswar |first2=Shashi |last3=Kaur |first3=Mallika |date=2016-11-04 |publisher=Zubaan |isbn=9789385932113}}&lt;/ref&gt; authors have labeled the claims as "exaggerated".&lt;ref name="Chatterji et al."/&gt; Scholars Mridu Rai&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/2011724204546645823.html |title=Kashmir: The Pandit question |last=Essa |first=Azad |website=www.aljazeera.com |access-date=2018-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907044311/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/2011724204546645823.html |archive-date=7 September 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and A. Evans{{sfn|Evans, A departure from history|2002|pp=23–24}} have outright rejected the claims of genocide.

Some scholars have also accused the Indian state and Media of utilizing the experience of Pandits as a tool of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC&amp;pg=PA121 |title=Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace |last=Bose |first=Sumantra |date=June 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674028555}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1993, a notable Indian magazine launched an investigation upon a list of 23 shrines provided by [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and found that the claims of alleged desecration of scores of Hindu shrines in Kashmir, widely perpetuated by the Indian media and right-wing Hindu politicians, were "false".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC&amp;pg=PA123 |title=Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace |last=Bose |first=Sumantra |date=June 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674028555}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Evans, A departure from history|2002|pp=23–24}}

Further, whilst significantly higher figures of death, in thousands, have been reported by certain Pandit-organisations, scholars have rejected the claims, instead choosing to roughly rely upon the official figures.{{sfn|Evans, A departure from history|2002|pp=23–24}} According to the government of Jammu and Kashmir 219 Kashmiri Pandits were killed and 24,202 families migrated out of the valley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ldquo219-Kashmiri-Pandits-killed-by-militants-since-1989rdquo/article16006510.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==
The Indian Government has tried to rehabilitate the Pandits and the separatists have also invited the Pandits back  to Kashmir. Tahir, the commander of a separatist Islamic group, ensured full protection to the Kashmiri Pandits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1246_land/page9.shtml |title=BBC World Service {{!}} World Agenda - Give me land |website=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=2017-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109093913/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1246_land/page9.shtml |archive-date=9 November 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apathy on the part of the government and the sufferings of the Kashmiri Pandits have been highlighted in a play titled 'Kaash Kashmir'.&lt;ref&gt;https://nehagargblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/br-kaash-kashmir/&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts or claims have lacked political will as journalist Rahul Pandita writes in a memoir.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/01/22/rahul-panditas-book-on-a-kashmir-exodus/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider Article 370 as a roadblock in the resettlement of Kashmiri Pandits as the [[Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir]] does not allow those living in India outside Jammu and Kashmir to freely settle in the state and become its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwW3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113 |title=Jammu &amp; Kashmir: A State in Turbulence |last=Sahagala |first=Narendra |date=2011-01-01 |publisher=Suruchi Prakashan |year= |isbn=9788189622831 |location= |pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tikoo1"&gt;{{citation |last=Tikoo |first=Colonel Tej K |title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&amp;pg=PT281 |year=2012 |publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC |isbn=978-1-935501-58-9 |pages=281–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjp.org/images/pdf_2014/full_manifesto_english_07.04.2014.pdf Election Manifesto 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704041114/http://www.bjp.org/images/pdf_2014/full_manifesto_english_07.04.2014.pdf |date=4 July 2017 }}, Bharatiya Janata Party, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanjay Tickoo, president of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), says that the 'Article 370' affair is different from the issue of exodus of Kashmiri Hindus and both should be dealt with separately. He remarks that, linking both the affairs is an "utterly insensitive way to deal with a highly sensitive and emotive issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2659432/Dont-confuse-Kashmiri-Pandit-issue-Artcle-370-expert-warns.html |title='Don't confuse Kashmiri Pandit issue with Article 370' expert warns |date=16 June 2014 |work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, a total of 1,800 Kashmiri Pandit youths have returned to the Valley since the announcing of Rs. 1,168-crore package in 2008 by the UPA government. R.K. Bhat, president of Youth All India Kashmiri Samaj criticised the package to be a mere eyewash and claimed that most of the youths were living in cramped prefabricated sheds or in rented accommodation. He also said that 4,000 vacancies have been lying vacant since 2010 and alleged that the BJP government was repeating the same rhetoric and was not serious about helping them. In an interview with NDTV on January 19, Farooq Abdullah commented that the onus was on Kashmiri Pandits to come back themselves and nobody would beg them to do so. His comments were met with disagreement by Kashmiri Pandit authors Neeru Kaul, [[Siddhartha Gigoo]], Congress MP [[Shashi Tharoor]] and retired General [[Syed Ata Hasnain]]. He also said that during his tenure as Chief Minister in 1996, he had asked them to return but they refused to do so. He reiterated his comments on January 23 and said that the time had come for them to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/when-will-we-finally-return-home-ask-displaced-kashmiri-pandits-2590640.html |title=When will we finally return home, ask displaced Kashmiri Pandits |work=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The issue of separate townships for Kashmiri Pandits has been a source of contention in Kashmir with separatists as well as mainstream political parties opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kps-seeks-centres-intervention-on-kashmiri-pandits-township-issue-2814059/ |title=KPS seeks Centre’s intervention on Kashmiri Pandits township issue |work=Press Trust of India |publisher=The Indian Express |date=22 May 2016 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hizbul Mujahideen]] militant, [[Burhan Muzaffar Wani]], had threatened of attacking the "Pandit composite townships" which were meant to be built for the rehabilitation of the non-Muslim community.

[[File:This Gun For Hire movie poster.jpg|thumb|''[[This Gun for Hire]]'' (1942) one sheet film poster]]

A '''film poster''' is a [[poster]] used to promote and advertise a [[film]]. Studios often print several posters that vary in size and content for various domestic and international markets. They  normally contain an image with text.  Today's posters often feature photographs of the main actors.  Prior to the 1980s, illustrations instead of photos were far more common.  The text on film posters usually contains the film title in large lettering and often the names of the main actors. It may also include a [[tagline]], the name of the director, names of characters, the release date, etc.

Film posters are displayed inside and on the outside of [[movie theater]]s, and elsewhere on the street or in shops. The same images appear in the film exhibitor's [[pressbook]] and may also be used on websites, DVD (and historically VHS) packaging, flyers, advertisements in newspapers and magazines, etc.

Film posters have been used since the earliest public exhibitions of film. They began as outside placards listing the programme of (short) films to be shown inside the hall or movie theater. By the early 1900s, they began to feature [[illustration]]s of a film scene or an array of overlaid images from several scenes. Other posters have used artistic interpretations of a scene or even the theme of the film, represented in a wide variety of artistic styles.

==History==
[[Image:Cinématographe Lumière.jpg|thumb|The world's first film poster, for 1895's ''[[L'Arroseur arrosé]]'', by the [[Lumière brothers]] ]]
[[File:Rudolph Valentino movie poster bullfight.jpeg|thumb|[[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''Blood and Sand'', 1922]]

The first film poster was based on an illustration by [[Marcellin Auzolle]] to promote the showing of the [[Lumiere Brothers]] film ''[[L'Arroseur arrosé]]'' at the Grand Café in Paris on December 26, 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://filmmakeriq.com/lessons/the-movie-poster-begins/|title=The Movie Poster Begins|publisher=Filmmakeriq.com|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, film posters were produced for the exclusive use by the theaters exhibiting the film the poster was created for, and were required to be returned to the distributor after the film left the theater. In the [[United States]], film posters were usually returned to a nationwide operation called the [[National Screen Service]] (NSS) which printed and distributed most of the film posters for the studios between 1940 and 1984. As an economy measure, the NSS regularly recycled posters that were returned, sending them back out to be used again at another theater. During this time, a film could stay in circulation for several years, and so many old film posters were badly worn before being retired into storage at an NSS warehouse (most often, they were thrown away when they were no longer needed or had become too worn to be used again). Those posters which were not returned were often thrown away by the theater owner or damaged by being outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/money-making-movie-poster/|title=How to Make A Mint From Movie Posters|publisher=Empire|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, the American [[film studio]]s began taking over direct production and distribution of their posters from the National Screen Service and the process of making and distributing film posters became decentralized in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnaboutmovieposters.com/NewSite/INDEX/COUNTRIES/US/HISTORY/NSS/nssdemise.asp|title=National Screen Service - Demise|publisher=Learnaboutmovieposters.com|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collecting==

[[File:Nadia-hunterwali-1935.jpg|thumb|Old [[Bollywood]] posters, like ''[[Hunterwali]]'' (1935) featuring [[Fearless Nadia]] are collectors items.]]
After the National Screen Service ceased most of its printing and distribution operations in 1985, some of the posters which they had stored in warehouses around the United States ended up in the hands of private collectors and dealers. Today there is a thriving collectibles market in film posters; some have become very valuable. The first auction by a major auction house solely of film posters occurred on December 11, 1990, when proceeds of a sale of 271 vintage posters run by [[Bruce Hershenson]] at [[Christie's]] totaled US $935,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312912,00.html|title=Entertainment Weekly Article | first=Barbara | last=Ettorre|date=1991-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emovieposter.com/agallery/publication/Hollywood%2520Posters%25201/archive.html|title=eMoviePoster.com Hollywood Posters I Auction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record price for a single poster was set on November 15, 2005 when $690,000 was paid for a poster of [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' from the Reel Poster Gallery in London.&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4438948.stm |title=Lang movie poster fetches record |publisher=BBC News |date=15 November 2005 |accessdate=11 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring extremely high prices as well, with an example from ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' realizing $452,000 in a 1997 [[Sotheby's]] auction,&lt;ref name=metropolis /&gt; and posters from both ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' selling for $334,600 in [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auctions, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2012/mar/14/10-most-expensive-film-posters-in-pictures |title=The 10 most expensive film posters – in pictures |author=Andrew Pulver |date=14 March 2012 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dracula One Sheet Style F.jpg|thumb|''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' Style F one sheet]]
Occasionally, rare film posters have been found being used as insulation in attics and walls. In 2011, 33 film posters, including a ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' Style F one-sheet (shown right), from 1930-1931 were discovered in an attic in Berwick, Pennsylvania and auctioned for $502,000 in March 2012 by Heritage Auctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Collecting Stories | url=http://www.moviepostercollectors.com/Stories.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, old [[Bollywood]] posters, especially with hand-painted art, have become collectors items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Collectors can make good money with old Bollywood posters|publisher=Economic Times

As a result of market demand, some of the more popular older film posters have been reproduced either under license or illegally.  Although the artwork on reproductions is the same as originals, reproductions can often be distinguished by size, printing quality, and paper type. Several websites on the Internet offer "authentication" tests to distinguish originals from reproductions.

Original film posters distributed to theaters and other poster venues (such as bus stops) by the movie studios are never sold directly to the public. However, most modern posters are produced in large quantities and often become available for purchase by collectors indirectly through various secondary markets such as eBay. Accordingly, most modern posters are not as valuable. However some recent posters, such as the ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' "[[Lucky Strike]]" U.S. one sheet poster (recalled due to a dispute with the cigarette company), are quite rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/11266055/Investing-in-film-posters-which-have-made-the-most-money.html |title=Investing in film posters: which have made the most money? |author=Rosie Murray-West |date=5 December 2014 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Lobby cards===
[[File:MaryPickford4.jpg|thumb|Lobby card for ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (1921), starring [[Mary Pickford]]]]

Lobby cards are similar to posters but smaller, usually {{convert|11|×|14|in|cm|abbr=on}}, also {{convert |8|×|10|in|cm| abbr=on}} before 1930. Lobby cards are collectible and values depend on their age, quality, and popularity. Typically issued in sets of eight, each featuring a different scene from the film. In unusual circumstances, some releases were promoted with larger (12 cards) or smaller sets (6 cards). The set for ''[[The Running Man (1963 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1963), for example, had only six cards, whereas the set for ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969) had twelve. Films released by major production companies experiencing financial difficulties often lacked lobby sets, such as ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' (1986).

A Jumbo Lobby Card is larger, 14 in x 17 in (36&amp;nbsp;cm x 45&amp;nbsp;cm) and also issued in sets. Prior to 1940 studios promoted major releases with the larger card sets. In addition to the larger size, the paper quality was better (glossy or linen). The title card displays the movie title and top stars prominently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://movieposters.ha.com/poster-sizes.s|title=Movie Poster Size Guide - Heritage Auctions|last=|first=|date=August 30, 2016|website=Heritage Auctions|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, sets of lobby cards are known as "Front of House" cards. These, however, also refer to [[Monochrome photography|black-and-white]] press photographs, in addition to the more typical 8&amp;nbsp;× 10 inch promotional devices resembling lobby cards.

The [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] at [[Yale University]] holds a collection of lobby cards from [[Silent film|silent]] [[Western (genre)|western]] films that date between 1910 and 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/digitallibrary/lobbycards.html | contribution = The Western Silent Films Lobby Cards Collection, 1910–1930 | title = Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library | publisher = Yale University | accessdate = 2009-07-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaser poster===
A '''teaser poster''' or '''advance poster''' is an early promotional film poster, containing a basic image or design without revealing too much information such as the plot, theme, and characters.  The purpose is to incite awareness and generate [[Promotion (marketing)|hype]] for the film.  A [[tagline]] may be included. There are some instances when teaser posters are issued long in advance before the film goes into production (teasers for cancelled projects are historically informative), although they are issued during the film development. Notable styles for teaser poster include:
* Bearing only a symbol associated with the film, or simply just the title.
* A main character, looking away from the screen but looking at something in the distance.

===Character posters===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:TMNT Character poster.jpg|thumb|[[TMNT (film)|TMNT]] character poster]] --&gt;
For a film  with an [[ensemble cast]] there may be a set of '''character posters''', each featuring an individual character from the film. Usually it contains the name of the actor or the name of the character played. It may also include a tagline that reflects the quality of the character.

==Sizes==
Film posters come in different sizes and styles depending on the country. The most common are listed below.&lt;ref name="Poster Sizes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpag.co.uk/posterglossary.htm |publisher=Movie Poster Art Gallery |title=Glossary Sizes |accessdate= December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Billing block==
{{main|Billing (filmmaking)}}
The "billing block" is the list of names that adorn the bottom portion of the official poster (or '[[one sheet]]', as it is called in the movie industry) of the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Movie Business: The Definitive Guide to the Legal and Financial Secrets of Getting Your Movie Made |first=Kelly |last=Crabb |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2005 |isbn=9780743264921 |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w-wkvUwc2hYC&amp;pg=PA72}}&lt;/ref&gt; A billing block can be seen at the bottom of Reynold Brown's poster from ''Attack of the 50 Foot Woman'' (1958), which is reproduced below. In the layout of film posters and other film advertising copy, the billing block is usually set in a highly condensed [[typeface]] (one in which the height of characters is several times the width).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://posterwire.com/poster-credits-font/ |title=Credit Where Credit is Due |date=March 21, 2005 |publisher=Posterwire.com |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By convention, the [[point size]] of the billing block is 25 or 35 percent of the average height of each letter in the title logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lettercult.com/archives/387 |title=Corey Holmes watches the Watchmen |last=Jaramillo |first=Brian |date=March 4, 2009 |work=Lettercult |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion in the credits and the billing block is generally a matter of detailed contracts between the artists and the producer. Using a condensed typeface allows the heights of the characters to meet contractual constraints while still allowing enough horizontal space to include all the required text.

==Notable film poster artists==
[[File:Attackofthe50ftwoman.jpg|thumb|''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'' (1958), an iconic poster by [[Reynold Brown]].]]
Normally, the artist is not identified on the film poster and, in many cases, the artist is anonymous. However, several artists have become well known because of their outstanding illustrations on film posters. Some artists, such as Drew Struzan, often sign their poster artwork and the signature is included on distributed posters.

==Awards==
The annual [[Key Art Awards]], sponsored by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', include awards for best film poster in the categories of comedy, drama, action adventure, teaser, and international film. ''The Hollywood Reporter'' defines the term "key art" as "the singular, iconographic image that is the foundation upon which a movie's marketing campaign is built."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zevendesign.com/key-art-creating-lasting-impression/|title=Key Art:Creating a Lasting Impression|publisher=Zevendesign.com|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the original poster for ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' was named best film poster "of the past 35 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sin-city-place-be-at-139338|title=Sin City' place to be at Key Art Awards|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GDL uses [[Context-free grammar|context-free formal grammar]] named GDLs (Gesture Description Language script). With GDLs it is possible to define rules that describe set of gestures. Those rules play similar role as rules in classic [[expert system]]s. With rules it is possible to define static body positions (so called key frames) and sequences of key frames that create together definitions of gestures or movements. The recognition is done by [[forward chaining]] [[inference engine]]. 
The latest GDL implementations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cci.up.krakow.pl/gdl/|title=Gesture Description Language|website=www.cci.up.krakow.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilize [[Microsoft]] [[Kinect]] controller and enable real time classification. The license for GDL-based software allows using those programs for educational and scientific purposes for free.

==Early life and career==
Born in 1965 in the [[Malësi e Madhe District]] of northern [[Albania]], Marinaj started his writing career as a restricted correspondent publishing in a number of Albanian media outlets, first in local newspapers in Shkodra, then in a series of Albanian national publications including ''Zëri i Rinisë'' ("The Voice of Youth"), ''Luftëtari'' ("The Fighter"), ''Vullnetari'' ("The Volunteer"), and ''[[Drita (magazine)|Drita]]'' (The Light).&lt;ref name=Alta&gt;{{cite web| author=Gary Montgomery| title=Public Profile| publisher=ALTA| url=http://www.utdallas.edu/alta/resources/public-profile-display?member=gmarinaj2005| accessdate=February 5, 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108092004/http://www.utdallas.edu/alta/resources/public-profile-display?member=gmarinaj2005| archivedate=November 8, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1990, Marinaj published an [[anti-communist]] satiric poem entitled "''Horses''" (original {{lang-sq|Kuajt}}) and aware of his imminent arrest from the communist regime, on September 12, 1990, Marinaj escaped authorities by illegally crossing the Albanian-Yugoslavian border and fled first to [[Yugoslavia]] and later on to the United States.&lt;ref name=Shkodra&gt;{{cite web | author=Shefqet Dibrani| date=December 15, 2003 | title=Sfidat e intelektualit| publisher=Bota Sot| url=http://www.shkoder.net/fjala/2003/gjm.htm| accessdate=April 18, 2012 |language=Albanian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alblink&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| title=I jepet çmimi "Pjetër Arbnori", poetit dhe përkthyesit Gjekë Marinaj| publisher=Alblink| url=http://alblink.com/?fq=brenda&amp;m=shfaqart&amp;aid=218| accessdate=April 17, 2012| language=Albanian| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112020401/http://alblink.com/?fq=brenda&amp;m=shfaqart&amp;aid=218| archivedate=January 12, 2014| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in [[San Diego]] in July 1991, then went to [[Richardson, Texas]]. In 2001, Marinaj founded the Albanian-American Writers Association&lt;ref name=Illyria&gt;{{cite web | author= Editorial | date=  | title= testimonials | publisher= Illyria | url= http://illyriapress.com/testimonials.php | accessdate= February 5, 2013 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130309183132/http://www.illyriapress.com/testimonials.php | archivedate= March 9, 2013 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as president until 2009.&lt;ref name="The Dallas Morning News"&gt;{{cite web | author= Brent Flynn | date= August 18, 2005| title= Albanian writers recognize 2 from UTD for translating poet | publisher= The Dallas Morning News | url= http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20120706-albanian-writers-recognize-2-from-utd-for-translating-poet.ece | accessdate=February 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author Interviews==
While pursuing his new life in America, Marinaj continued working as a freelance journalist for the Albanian media; his freelance work included interviews with President [[George Herbert Walker Bush]],&lt;ref name="Shekulli"&gt;{{cite web | author= Gjekë Marinaj| date= January 26, 2008| title=Këlliçi i mikorofonit sportiv bën 70 vjeç, në SHBA.|language=Albanian|publisher= Gazeta Shekulli| url= http://www.marinaj.info/pdf/gazeta_shekulli_kellici.pdf| accessdate=June 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ninth and current President of the State of Israel [[Shimon Peres]], and world-renowned soccer player [[Pelé]].&lt;ref name="Dallas News"&gt;{{cite web | author= Lindsey Bever | date=May 4, 2012 | title= Power of a poem | publisher= Neighborgo | url= http://www.marinaj.info/pdf/2012_marinaj_the_dallas_morning_news.pdf | accessdate=February 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horses==
Marinaj published his poem entitled "Horses" in the Albanian paper of record, ''Drita'', which at first glance it read like a simple poem about farm animals, but was actually a satirical social and political commentary about the Albanian people being herded and corralled by an oppressive communist regime.&lt;ref name="The Dallas Morning News"/&gt;  "Horses" appeared in ''Drita'' on August 19, 1990, and the response was immediate and overwhelming. The sheer audacity of publishing such a clearly subversive poem in a national publication amazed the Albanians (and soon after the international community as well).&lt;ref name= Shqip &gt;{{cite web | author= Eva Dore | date= November 11, 2011| title= Fenomeni "Gjekë Marinaj" | publisher= Shqip | url= http://gazeta-shqip.com/ndryshe/5667d722243cfccdc96f5f3ec50e7651.html| accessdate=February 5, 2013 |language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; " Within hours, copies of ''Drita sold'' out across the country, so people took to scrawling the poem on scraps of paper and passing it to one another in the subways and on the streets and months later, protesters chanted the poem through megaphones during anti-government demonstrations.&lt;ref name="UTD Mercury"&gt;{{cite web | author= Eric Nicholson| date= February 28, 2010| title= Award carries poetic justice| publisher= UTD Mercury | url=http://www.marinaj.info/pdf/utd_mercury_award_carries_poetic_justice.pdf | accessdate=February 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seen from this point of view, "Marinaj's words inspired freedom, helped defeat communism in Albania."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Lindsey Bever | date=May 4, 2012 | title= Power of a poem | publisher= The Dallas Morning News| url= http://www.marinaj.info/pdf/2012_marinaj_the_dallas_morning_news.pdf | accessdate=February 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, "having seen other poets hanged in the city's center for voicing similar notions of freedom and liberty, Marinaj knew that he had to leave the country immediately; packed a few of his favorite books, told his friends and family that he was going on vacation, and set off on an eight-hour hike over the mountains and into [[Yugoslavia]]."&lt;ref name="The Dallas Morning News"/&gt;

==Education in America==
After his education in [[Albania]], Marinaj earned an associate degree in science from [[Brookhaven College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=February 10, 2011| title=News Note| publisher=Brookhaven College| url=http://www.brookhavencollege.edu/news/2012/2286.aspx| accessdate=April 19, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724002338/http://www.brookhavencollege.edu/news/2012/2286.aspx| archivedate=July 24, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. He continued his education at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] where he graduated [[Magna Cum Laude]] in 2006 with a [[bachelor]]'s in literary studies, and a master's degree in the same subject in 2008. Three years later, he received a certificate in [[Holocaust]] Studies from the Ackerman Center for Holocaust Studies.&lt;ref name="The Dallas Morning News"/&gt;

===Doctor of Philosophy===
The University of Texas at Dallas awarded Marinaj a PhD in 2012. His [[dissertation]] which focus on the history and philosophy of [[oral poetry]] in the [[Balkans]] and on the Translation Theory is titled "Oral Poetry in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and Other [[Balkan]] Cultures:  Translating the Labyrinths of Untranslatability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=UTD | date=December 6, 2012 | title=Doctoral degrees awarded by U.T.

|accessdate= February 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protonism Theory==
According to [[The Dallas Morning News]], Marinaj's "Protonism Theory" seeks to "promote peace and positive thinking" through [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref name="Dallas News"&gt;{{cite web | author= Lindsey Bever | date=May 4, 2012 | title= Power of a poem | publisher= Neighborgo | url= http://www.marinaj.info/pdf/2012_marinaj_the_dallas_morning_news.pdf | accessdate=February 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protonism Theory proposes that there are strong and weak points in every piece of literature but argues that a critic's personal interests and biases influence how much focus those points receive.&lt;ref name="Prietenul Albanezului"&gt;{{cite web | author= Marius Dobrescu | date= August 2012 | title= Afinitatile culturale | publisher= Prietenul Albanezului | url= http://www.alar.ro/n65/literatura-c467/cauta.html?s_key=marinaj&amp;x=0&amp;y=0| accessdate=February 5, 2013 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinaj founded the Protonism Theory in 2005 as a response to the flood of unduly negative criticism in East European academia following the collapse of communism and as a response, he developed Protonism to provide a common ground from which critics could evaluate a literary work more objectively.&lt;ref name= Spektar&gt;{{cite web | author= Afrim A. Rexhepi | date=December 2012 | title= Haiku and the theory of Protonism | publisher= Spektar | url= http://www.marinaj.info/pdf/spekter_nr_60_2012.pdf | accessdate=February 5, 2013 |language=Macedonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protonism works along five central principles: truth, inquiry, restitution, protonismiotics, and ethics.&lt;ref name= Mapo&gt;{{cite web | author= Preç Zogaj | date=December 3, 2012 | title= teoria që sheh bardhë dhe lart | publisher= Mapo | url= http://www.mapo.al/2012/12/03/teoria-qe-sheh-bardhe-dhe-lart | accessdate=February 5, 2013 |language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26647">'''Gothic verbs''' have the most complex conjugation of any attested [[Germanic language]]. Most categories reconstructed for the [[Proto-Germanic verb]] system are preserved in Gothic. Note, however, that our knowledge of the Proto-Germanic verb is itself to a large degree based on Gothic, meaning that its reconstruction may be fragmentary.

==Weak verbs==
===Class I verbs===
The following is a sample paradigm of three class I weak verbs, '''nasjan''' "to save" (short stem-syllable), '''stōjan''' "to judge" (long open stem-syllable), and '''sōkjan''' "to seek" (long closed stem-syllable).

Note that verbs with a polysyllabic root behave like '''sōkjan''' regardless of the nature of the last syllable of the root; hence, '''glitmunjan''' "to shine" behaves like '''sōkjan''' and is conjugated in the present indicative '''glitmunja, glitmuneis, glitmuneiþ, ...'''.

Note '''stōjan''' changes to '''stauida''' in the past in accordance with general phonetic rules. Other verbs with similar changes are
*'''ana-niujan''' "to renew", '''ga-qiujan''' "to give life to", '''siujan''' "to sew", which change to e.g. '''ana-niwida''' in the past.
*'''*stráujan''' and '''*táujan''', which change to e.g. '''strawida''' in the past.

Some class I verbs have an irregular past due to the fact that the '''-i-''' in the past was lost in [[Proto-Germanic]]:

*'''briggan''' is properly a Class III strong verb, with other parts taken from a lost verb '''*braggjan''' (cf. [[Old English]] '''breng(e)an''', [[Old Saxon]] '''brengian''').

Class III is apparently a closed class, containing only the following verbs: '''áistan''' "to reverence", '''ana-silan''' "to be silent", '''and-staúrran''' "to murmur against", '''arman''' "to pity", '''bauan''' "to dwell", '''fastan''' "to fast, hold firm", '''fijan''' "to hate", '''ga-geigan''' "to gain", '''ga-kunnan''' "to recognize", '''haban''' "to have", '''hatan''' "to hate", '''jiukan''' "to contend", '''leikan''' "to please", '''liban''' "to live", '''liugan''' "to marry", '''maúrnan''' "to mourn", '''munan''' "to consider", '''reiran''' "to tremble", '''saúrgan''' "to sorrow", '''sifan''' "to rejoice", '''skaman (sik)''' "to be ashamed", '''slawan''' "to be silent", '''trauan''' "to trust", '''swēran''' "to honour", '''þahan''' "to be silent", '''witan''' "to watch, observe". Possibly also '''*bnauan''' "to rub" belongs here—only the present participle occurs, which is not enough to tell whether this is a Class III weak verb or Class VII strong verb.

Notes:
*'''bauan''' "to dwell" was originally a Class VII strong verb (cf. [[Old Icelandic]] '''būa''' "to dwell", past singular '''bjō''', past participle '''būenn'''), and the third singular present indicative is still normally '''bauiþ''', a strong form (vs. '''*bauáiþ''', the expected weak form).
*'''hatan''' also occurs as a Class I weak verb '''hatjan'''.

===Class IV Verbs===

The following is a sample paradigm of a class IV weak verb, '''fullnan''' "to become full".

So-called "[[preterite-present verb]]s" are a feature of Germanic languages that have a present tense formed like the past tense (or "preterite") of strong verbs. The verbs often have the semantics of [[modal verb]]s, and in fact the present-day English modal verbs "can, could, may, might, shall, should, must" are descended from [[Old English]] preterite-present verbs. The past tense of these verbs is a new formation and has the endings of weak verbs. Arguably, all seven classes of strong verbs are represented in Gothic by at least one preterite-present verb.

The following table presents substantially all extant forms of each of the existing preterite-present verbs in Gothic. In some cases, extant forms are not given when another closely related extant form appears. For example, third plural present indicative '''skulun''' is doubtless extant, but is not given because it is easily derivable from the extant first plural form '''skulum'''. Note that many of the missing forms can be derived from existing forms as the number of principal parts is small—in fact, three is usually enough: First/third person singular present indicative, first (or third) person plural present indicative, first/third person singular past indicative. However, occasional small irregularities may occur, and the table below errs on the side of under-generalization.

The forms given are:
*Infinitive.
*Present indicative first/third singular (the two forms are always the same),
*Present indicative second singular.
*Present indicative dual. Whichever forms are extant are given.
*Present indicative first plural. Other extant plural forms are subsumed under this category. When starred (i.e. indicated as hypothetical), this generally indicates that only the third plural form is extant.
*Present subjunctive first singular. Other extant forms are subsumed under this category.
*Past indicative first/third sunglar. Other extant forms are subsumed under this category.
*Past subjunctive first singular. Other extant forms are subsumed under this category.
*Imperative. Whichever forms are extant are given.
*Present Participle. Note that it is easily derivable from the infinitive.
*Past Participle. Note that it is easily derivable from the past tense stem. Note also that a gloss is given since the participle often has an unpredictable meaning, especially when the verb in question is inherently intransitive. In some cases a past participle is given without a gloss; this omission goes back to the source ([[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]]'s [[Grammar of the Gothic Language]]) used to compile the table.

===''wiljan'', "to want/will"===
This irregular verb derives from the fossilized [[optative mood]] of a [[Proto-Indo-European verb]] (not to be confused with the Gothic mood known as optative, which corresponds to the [[subjunctive mood]] of PIE and other Germanic languages).

'''Hamer''' or '''Hamer-Banna''' is a language within the [[South Omotic languages|South Omotic branch]] of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. It is spoken primarily in southern [[Ethiopia]] by the [[Hamar people]], [[Banna people]], and by speakers of [[Karo language|Karo]].

== Phonology ==

This is a sketch of the phonology of the non-Karo branch of Hamer.&lt;ref&gt;Lydall, Jean (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consonants ===

Hamer has six places of articulation for consonants, and eleven manners of articulation, though the system is not entirely orthogonal.

| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
|- 
| Lateral
| &amp;nbsp;
| l
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| Semivowels
| w
| &amp;nbsp;
| j
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

Consonants marked with parentheses are surface forms only, appearing predictably due to phonotactics or morphophonemic processes.

Consonant length is distinctive non-initially. Long /ɾ/ is realized as a trilled /r/.

=== Vowels ===

There are five basic vowels

{|
| i
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| u
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| e
| &amp;nbsp;
| o
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| a
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

The vowels are further subdivided into two main categories (with a third being a surface "umlaut" phenomenon (see below)). Category I vowels are shorter, pharyngealized, and have retracted tongue root. Category II vowels are longer, glottalized, and have advanced tongue root.

Vowel Harmony exists in that every root word and every suffix belongs to either category I or II. When the category of a root and its suffix do not agree, a kind of [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauting]] takes place. An umlauted vowel retains its basic place of articulation, and is pronounced between the corresponding category I and II vowels, i.e. of medium length, and unmarked for pharyngealization, glottalization or tongue root position. Generally, the vowel(s) of the suffix undergo umlauting, but there is a set of "strong" suffixes which retain their category, and cause the vowels of the root to undergo umlauting.

There is a sixth non-phonemic vowel, /ə/, which appears in speech epenthetically to "break up" otherwise invalid consonant clusters. There is no need to consider this a phoneme, and no definitive reason for it to require a grapheme, as it occurs entirely predictably as part of what is essentially an allophonic process.

=== Syllable and word structure ===

Syllable structure is simply (C)V(C), though syllable-final consonants are rare. Strings of at least three vowels are documented. Strings of more than two consonants are not documented. There are a large number of (mostly very simple) rules governing metathesis and epenthesis when consonant clusters appear. In summary, there are three sorts of consonant cluster: "valid", "special", and "invalid". Valid clusters undergo no change between their underlying and surface forms. Special clusters undergo some kind of (generally metathetic) transformation in their surface forms. Invalid clusters insert a non-phonemic /ə/ between the two consonants to create their surface forms.

== Orthography ==

There is no official writing system for Hamer, though several romanization schemes have been proposed, along with a [[Ge'ez script|Gə'əz]] orthography. As yet, there is no movement for official recognition of any of these systems.

=== "Lydall" romanization ===

This is the romanization used by Jean Lydall. It is perhaps the ''de facto'' standard, simply by being the one in which the majority of the existing corpus is presented.

| a
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

==== Umlauted vowels ====

Vowels which have been umlauted are written using the letter for their original sound, combined with an underline.

No marking of stress occurs.

=== "Minimal" romanization ===

This romanization will be used in this article to present grammar examples. The advantages of this scheme are that it allows capitalization (e.g. of proper nouns), and that it should be more familiar to the general linguist (especially one familiar with African studies).

| &amp;nbsp;

==== Vowel categories and umlauting ====

Within roots, the stressed vowel is marked with an acute (for Category I), a grave (for Category II), a circumflex (for Umlauted Category I) or a caron (for Umlauted Category II). Within "harmonic" suffixes (i.e. where no umlauting takes place), or suffixes which have caused Umlauting, no diacritic is used on the suffix. Within Umlauted suffixes, a circumflex or caron is used as appropriate on the first vowel of the suffix.

=== Gə'əz orthography ===

Letters are provided below with their traditional Amharic names. Rows marked in dark red have special meanings that cannot fully be explained in the table: the ʾÄlf row is used for Category II vowels without a preceding consonant, while the ʿÄyn row is used for Category I vowels without a preceding consonant.

'''Himariote Greek''' ({{lang-el|Χειμαρριώτικη διάλεκτος}} ''Kheimarrioutiki dialektos'' or {{lang|el|Xειμαρριώτικα}} ''Kheimarrioutika'') is a [[Varieties of Modern Greek|dialect]] of the [[Greek language]] that is mainly spoken by ethnic [[Greeks]] in the [[Himarë]] region of [[Albania]]. Despite the small distances between the towns in the region, there exists some dialectal variation, most prominently in accent.

==Classification==
Despite the fact that the Greek community in Himara resides at the northern end of the Greek-speaking world, in a region known among Greeks as [[Northern Epirus]], the Himariote dialect is a [[modern Greek dialects|southern dialect]] of the Greek language, a trait shared by most other dialects in Northern Epirus and [[Thesprotia (prefecture)|Greek prefecture of Thesprotia]].&lt;ref name="Στὰ βόρεια ἰδιώματα περιλαμβάνονται τὰ ἰδιώματα τῆς Στερεᾶς Ἑλλάδας (ἐκτὸς τῶν Μεγάρων, τῆς Παλαιᾶς Ἀθήνας καὶ τῆς νότιας Εὔβοιας), τοῦ μεγαλύτερου μέρους τῆς Ἠπείρου (ἐκτὸς τῆς Θεσπρωτίας καὶ τῶν ἑλληνόφωνων περιοχῶν τῆς Ἀλβανίας)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Παντελίδης|first1=Νικόλαος|title=Οι νεοελληνικές διάλεκτοι|url=http://tro-ma-ktiko.blogspot.gr/2014/02/blog-post_9854.html|website=http://tro-ma-ktiko.blogspot.gr|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although links with the Greek dialects spoken in [[Griko|Apulia]] and [[Maniates#Maniot dialect of Demotic Greek|Mani]] have been suggested,&lt;ref name="Nich20"&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholas|1998|p=405}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the exact provenance of Northern Epirote dialects remains obscure.&lt;ref name="Nich20"/&gt; According to Greek linguist Vayacacos, Himariote, as a subbranch of the Northern Epirote dialects, is classified as a southern dialect, but the two towns next to Himarë, [[Dhërmi]] and [[Palasë]], speak [[Modern Greek dialects|semi-northern dialects]].&lt;ref name="Nich29"&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholas|1998|loc=Chapter 2: "Grammaticalisation", p. 504}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the region's geography and isolation, the local dialect in the Himarë region became separated from the surrounding dialects and underwent a slower evolution, preserving a more conservative and faithful picture of the [[medieval Greek]] vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholas|1998|loc=Chapter 2: "Grammaticalisation", pp. 20, 29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Greek professor Anagnostopoulos, this dialect, like other conservative forms of [[modern Greek]], such as the Maniot dialect, was spoken by populations that lived in virtual autonomy during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]].&lt;ref name="Nich29"/&gt; Another linguistic analysis suggests that Himarë was colonised by [[Greeks in Italy#Medieval|Apulian Italiots]] after the Turkish raid on [[Otranto]] in 1480, but this position is vigorously questioned.&lt;ref name="Nich29"/&gt; Some scholars have argued that there are parallels with the local idioms spoken in [[Crete]] as well as in nearby [[Corfu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=H-7toRTGrFkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = On the Border: Transborder Mobility, Ethnic Groups and Boundaries Along the Albanian-Greek Frontier|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = LIT Verlag Münster|last = Basilēs G. Nitsiakos, Vassilis Nitsiakos|first = |orig-year = 2010|page = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, these scholars argue that the dialect of Himarë has parallels with dialects in Crete, whereas the dialect of Dhërmi and Palasë has parallels with those in Corfu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
In spite of the short distances between these towns, there are differences in the accents of the dialect in every town. Himariote has been affected by [[language contact]], and uses some borrowed words from the [[Lab Albanian dialect]].&lt;ref name="Bon, p. 63"&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Greek words have also been partially influenced by their Albanian counterparts, such as the local pronunciation of {{ipa|[m'''e'''xanikos]}} for Standard Greek {{ipa|[m'''i'''xanikos]}} ("engineer"), under the influence of Albanian ''mehaniku''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Brian D. "Multiple Exponents in Language Contact Situations: A Case Study from the Greek of Southern Albania". In Ralli, Angela, ''Contact Morphology in Modern Greek Dialects'', Page 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the nearby Albanian idioms that are spoken both inland ([[Kurvelesh (region)|Kurvelesh]]) and in the coastal region in Himara, Slavic influence in Himariote Greek is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyriazis|first1=Doris|title=Slavic elements in the Greek idioms of South Albania|journal=Philologica Jassyensia|date=2012|volume=15|issue=VII/I|pages=153, 163|url=http://www.diacronia.ro/ro/indexing/details/A1051/pdf|accessdate=12 September 2017|quote=The set is pretty different if we consider the lexical material (appellatives and place names) of the inland of Chimara (Kurvelesh region) and the nearby coastal Albanian - speaking villages (Bregdet) &amp; The Greek-speaking area that seems  to be less affected by Slavic is that of Chimara although elements of Slavic influence are present in the neighboring villages,...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
A common characteristic of local Greek dialects including Himariote is the use of the archaic disyllabic -ea form.&lt;ref name="Nich29"/&gt;  Moreover, the phoneme /s/ is pronounced in a slightly different way, depending on the town: in Dhërmi as a soft /ś/{{clarify|date=December 2017}}; in Palasa as a half-hard /š’/{{clarify|date=December 2017}} while in the town of Himarë as a hard /š/{{clarify|date=December 2017}}. The people who originate from Himarë sometimes also pronounce /k/ as /ts/.&lt;ref name="Bon, p. 65"&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many younger members do not use "hard accentuations" anymore, due to the widespread influence by standard modern Greek in the context of migratory patterns to Greece.&lt;ref name="Bon, p. 65"/&gt;
&lt;!--Note: expand with Spiro link on talk page, a lot is discussed there--&gt;

==History and politics==

The Himarriots were multi-lingualis at least since the 16th century. This was very common to the region and the period. They were writing in the Greek dialect of the region in their "in-group" communication, mixed with Albanian, Turkish, Italian and some Arabic words. They used Greek in their correspondence with the Pope and other representatives of western countries, as well as with the Russian Empire. When they communicated in Italian, they used a translator, but signed in Greek with Greek conferments of their names.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/33641726/Giakoumis_K._2016_Self-Identifications_by_Himarriots_16th_to_19th_Centuries_Erytheia._Revista_de_Estudios_Bizantinos_y_Neogriegos_v._37_pp._205-246 Giakoumis K. (2016), “Self-Identifications by Himarriots, 16th to 19th Centuries”, ''Erytheia. Revista de Estudios Bizantinos y Neogriegos'', v. 37, p. 226]&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
During the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|communist era]] in Albania, the country's borders were sealed for 45 years (1945–1990), while Himarë remained outside of the so-called Greek minority zone, which the Albanian state recognized as Greek populated regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pettifer|2001|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the communist Albanian policy of unification and homogenization, the use of the Greek language in Himarë was forbidden in public, and many Greek-speaking people were forced to move to places in northern or central Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Greek schools in the Himarë area were closed, and the local communities stuck to their language, which slowly became archaic when they started to emigrate to Greece (1991) in the aftermath of the communist regime's collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=60}}; {{harvnb|Bon|2008b|pp=7–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of communism, a considerable number of the population from Himarë migrated to [[Greece]] where it largely adopted standard Greek.&lt;ref name="Bon, p. 65"/&gt; At present they are still not considered as part of the recognized Greek minority by the Albanian state, while on the other hand they are counted as ethnic Greeks according to the Greek migration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related abbreviation, '''TINLA''', stands for "This is not legal advice." One or both of these expansions often precede opinions about [[law]].&lt;ref name="Wacha"/&gt; The use of these expansions serves as a warning for the reader not to take the opinion as professional legal advice. Many jurisdictions have legal restrictions on actually giving or even appearing to give legal advice, or otherwise practicing as a [[lawyer]] without legal qualifications and official registration. Rendition of legal advice by a person who is not licensed to do so can be the basis for a charge of [[unauthorized practice of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Origin and usage ==
The term appears to be inspired by a 1980s commercial for [[Vicks]] Formula 44 cough syrup, in which two spokesmen successively pitched the [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] medication with the line: "I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV."&lt;ref name="Zwicky"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesmen were soap opera actors [[Chris Robinson (actor)|Chris Robinson]] (who played Dr. [[Rick Webber]] on ''[[General Hospital]]'') and [[Peter Bergman]] (who played Dr. [[Cliff Warner]] on ''[[All My Children]]'').&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt; The transfer from ''doctor'' to ''lawyer'' is an example of a [[snowclone]].&lt;ref name="Zwicky"/&gt; The term IANAL is reported to have been common on Usenet by the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of IANAL is '''IANYL''' ("I am not ''your'' lawyer"). The term may be used by a lawyer posting comments on a message board to indicate that the commentator is, in fact, a lawyer, but to emphasize that the commentator does not represent the reader, and to indicate that the comments are not protected by [[attorney–client privilege]] and that the commenter disclaims any [[malpractice]] or other [[tort]] liability should the suggestion be followed with undesirable results. '''IAAL''' ("I am a lawyer") is sometimes used as well, usually with an explicit disclaimer such as "IAAL, but I'm not your lawyer".{{fact|date=April 2018}}

The [[case law]] standard for determining what comments cross the line is generally "the application of law to facts specific to an individual seeking legal advice". Attorneys may use a disclaimer to reduce confusion, and "I am not your lawyer" is part of a typical disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It is not legal advice, and I am not your lawyer. You have to find your own local lawyer to get legal advice and help with your problem."
|accessdate=2008-01-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are "weighty obligations" that go along with the creation of a lawyer–client relationship, particularly if an "online exchange includes legal advice relating to the client's specific facts". Courts have held that (in the case of [[900 number]]s) [[Standard form contract|boilerplate]] disclaimers without clear actions to indicate assent may not avoid the creation of a lawyer–client relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Variations of IANAL can be applied to different fields, such as '''IANAMD''' for "I am not a [[Medical Doctor]]" or '''IANAP''' for "I am not a [[physicist]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=963459&amp;cid=24998529 |title=Tying knots with light |publisher=science.slashdot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expansions serve the same general purpose as IANAL{{snd}}to discourage the use of the information as professional advice.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

He was born on 1 August 1941 at [[Vengara (Kannur district)|Vengara]] in [[North Malabar]] as the son of Seythammadath Alikunji and Puthiya Veettil Kunjamina.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} His father died when he was barely three years old. He started his primary school education at Vengara Mappila Upper Primary School but the study ended in two years. Later, he learned to read and write Malayalam from an old age school, which was under the auspices of the Public Library, [[Taliparamba]]. At the age of 13, he left home. He travelled across India and did all kinds of jobs in different parts of the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[File:Klaus-modick-2011-ffm-014.jpg|thumb|Klaus Modick in 2011]]

== Education and early career ==
Klaus Modick was born in [[Oldenburg]] and completed his secondary education at the Altes Gymnasium there in 1971. He then attended [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg University]], where he read German, History and Educational Theory, completing his teaching qualification in 1977. Modick then took a doctorate in 1980, with a thesis on the German-Jewish novelist and playwright [[Lion Feuchtwanger]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Modick spent five years as an advertising copywriter and worked as a part-time lecturer in German literature in the higher education sector before becoming a freelance writer and translator in 1984.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/von-roman-zu-roman.1153.de.html?dram:article_id=182464|title=- Von Roman zu Roman|newspaper=Deutschlandradio Kultur|access-date=2017-02-07|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 he married an American citizen he met during one of his frequent visits to Crete and they have two daughters. Modick has said that he feels a special affinity with Crete and its people and in 2003 he published the novel ''Der kretische Gast,'' set in 1943 during the [[Fortress Crete|German occupation of Crete]]''.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Truschke"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.literaturatlas.de/~lf2/menue3/seite0.html|title=Wie auf Flügeln - der Schriftsteller Klaus Modick|last=Truschke|first=Jan-Hendrik Baade, Karin Benecke, Danica von Bloh, Piet Julius, Jehal Noman, Michael Opasinski, Key Riebau, Erik Siegel, Sarah Tölle, Olga|website=www.literaturatlas.de|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Established writer ==
From 1986 to 1992 Modick wrote a monthly column on paperbacks for [[Die Zeit]] and from 1997 to 2002 for [[Die Tageszeitung]]. He has held a number of guest lectureships in Germany, the USA and Japan ([[#Guest_lectureships|see below]]). He is a member of [[PEN Centre Germany]] and has received numerous [[#Awards|awards]].

Modick returned to live in Oldenburg in 2000 after spending several years abroad, including a year in Rome and another in Paris and ‘three to four years’ in the USA.&lt;ref name="Truschke"/&gt;

From 2000 to 2003 he was a member of the literary commission of the Lower Saxony Ministry for Science and the Arts, having previously received a number of awards from this body.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwk.niedersachsen.de/live/search.php?_psmand=19&amp;q=klaus+modick&amp;searchMode=0&amp;searchType=0&amp;searchInst=www.mwk.niedersachsen.de&lt;/ref&gt;

Modick is also an essayist and literary critic and has published several volumes of non-fiction writings including ''Das Stellen der Schrift'', ''Milder Rausch'' and ''Ein Bild und tausend Worte''.

== USA themes ==
Many of Modick’s novels are concerned with German–American themes, for example, ''Die Schatten der Ideen,'' which tells the story of a German historian who emigrates to the USA in 1935 and later finds himself swept up in the witch-hunts of the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]]. Other exile-themed novels include ''Sunset'', which tells of the friendship between [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Lion Feuchtwanger]] whilst in Los Angeles in the early 1940s. ''Sunset'' was nominated in 2011 for the [[German Book Prize]] and the [[Wilhelm Raabe Literature Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.literaturpreisgewinner.de/shortlist-wilhelm-raabe-literaturpreis-2011|title=Shortlist Wilhelm-Raabe-Literaturpreis 2011|website=Literaturpreis Gewinner|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work as a translator ==
As a literary translator Modick has translated numerous English-language works into German including works by [[Aravind Adiga]], [[Sebastian Faulks]], [[William Gaddis]], [[William Goldman]], [[Sudhir Kakar]], [[Victor LaValle]], [[Andrew Motion]], [[Jeffrey Moore]], [[John O'Hara|John O’Hara]], [[Robert Olmstead]], [[Matt Rees|Matt Beynon Rees]], [[Charles Simmons (author)|Charles Simmons]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Nathanael West]].

Despite his high reputation in the German-speaking world and prolific output, Modick has not yet been translated into English. A number of his works have English titles, reflecting the time Modick spent in the USA.

== Bestseller ==
Modick’s 2015 novel ''Konzert ohne Dichter'', which tells of the difficult relationship between artist [[Heinrich Vogeler]]  and poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] in 1905, became an almost immediate bestseller on publication.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daserste.de/information/wissen-kultur/druckfrisch/sendung/denis-scheck-empfiehlt-klaus-modick-konzert-ohne-dichter100.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Modick has enjoyed great critical acclaim in the German-speaking world.

'''Krikor Peshtimaldjian''' ({{lang-hy|Գրիգոր Փեշտիմալջյան}}, Born [[Constantinople]], [[Ottoman Turkey]] 1778 - died [[Constantinople]], [[Ottoman Turkey]] January, 1839) was a prominent ethnic [[Armenian people|Armenian]] philosopher, educator, translator, and linguist.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times."&gt;{{cite book|last=J.

== Life ==
Krikor Peshtimadjian was born in [[Constantinople]] and devoted his entire life to writing and teaching.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; He became the principal of the Bezciyan Armenian School, where he also taught language, rhetoric, philosophy, and religion. In 1828, soon after the establishment of the religious school attached to the Patriarchate of Kum Kapi, he was appointed head teacher and chief administrator there.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leon|first=Arpee|title=A century of Armenian Protestantism, 1846-1946|year=1946|publisher=The Armenian missionary association of America, inc|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught at an Armenian seminary in Haskoy and worked as a private tutor to a bankers family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shenk|first=Wilbert R.|title=North American foreign missions : 1810 - 1914 : theology, theory, and policy|year=2004|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=9780802824851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=az7WbP8IBU8C&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Peshtimaljian&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=Peshtimaljian&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 December 2012|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an educator, he worked on textbooks and curriculum organization and wrote regulations for discipline in the school and the fair treatment of all students.

== Works ==

Early in his life he started to compile a dictionary of [[Classical Armenian]], intended to comprise two volumes, but the project was discontinued.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt;

He lived at a time when the Armenian intelligentsia were actively engaged in sharp disputes about classical versus the more vernacular modern Armenian. In 1829 he published ''Kraganutyun Haykazian Lezvi'' (A Grammar of the Armenian Language), in essence a grammar of [[Classical Armenian]]. His ''Tramabnutiun Gam Arvest Banakan'' (Logic, or the Art of Reason), a philosophical treatise, is also in [[Classical Armenian]].&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; Yet his other works, such as ''Krtutiun Kaghakavarutyun'' (Education in Civility) and ''Lusashavigh'' (The Path of Enlightenment), are written in a very clear modern Armenian.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; Peshtimaldjian's works reflect the crucially important transition in Armenian letters during the early 19th century.

He also taught, and wrote on, philosophical topics, tending to adhere to the European philosophers of the Age of Reason. Although he was a layman, his knowledge in matters of religion and theology far exceeded that of most clerics.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; Living at a time when several schismatic movements arose, he came forward as a staunch defender of the Armenian Apostolic Church, her doctrines, and her traditions, attempting to preserve the national and religious unity of the Armenian community.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt;

The [[Nuba Mountains]], located in the [[West Kordofan]] and [[South Kordofan]] states in the south of [[Sudan]], are inhabited by a diverse set of populations (collectively known as [[Nuba peoples]]) speaking various languages not closely [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|related]] to one another.

The vast diversity of languages among the Nuba Mountains indicates that the mountains served as a retreat area by many people in the past.&lt;ref name="Thelwall n.d."&gt;Thelwall, R., T., &amp; te Leiden, R. (n.d.). The Linguistic Settlement of the Nuba Mountains. Retrieved February 11, 2016, from http://www.occasionalwitness.com/related/nuba/02Culture02settlement.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages ==
In addition to [[Sudanese Arabic]], around 42 other languages are spoken in the Nuba Mountains. They belong to the [[language families]] [[Katla languages|Katla]], [[Rashad languages|Rashad]], [[Lafofa languages|Lafofa]], [[Talodi–Heiban languages|Talodi–Heiban]], [[Kadu languages|Kadu]], [[Temein languages|Temein]], [[Daju languages|Daju]], [[Nyima languages|Nyima]] and [[Hill Nubian languages|Hill Nubian]].

Five of these families, Kadu, Temein, Daju, Nyima and Hill Nubian, belong to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language phylum]], while four, Katla, Rashad, Lafofa and Talodi–Heiban, belong to the [[Niger–Congo language family]]. Kadu's relationship to Nilo-Saharan is uncertain; it was previously classified as Niger–Congo, and a conservative classification would consider it an independent family.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrit Dimmendaal, 2008. "Language Ecology and Linguistic Diversity on the African Continent", ''Language and Linguistics Compass'' 2/5:843''ff.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the four Niger–Congo language groups along with the Nilo-Saharan Kadu group were classified together as the [[Kordofanian languages]]. However, Kordofanian is no longer considered a valid family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Kordofanian/Nuba%20Hills%20conference%20paper%202011%20Kordofanian.pdf|title=Should Kordofanian be split up?|last=Roger Blench|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=Nuba Hills Conference|location=Leiden|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the languages spoken in the Nuba Mountains are indigenous to the mountains and found nowhere else. The only exceptions are the [[Daju languages]], the rest of which belong to Western Daju and are found in eastern [[Chad]], and Sudanese Arabic, which is spoken in the rest of Sudan.

== Internal classifications ==
The languages of the Nuba Mountains belong to several distinct subdivisions of their respective languages families.

'''Bold''' = not exclusive to the Nuba Mountains.

=== Niger–Congo ===

* '''[[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]]'''
** [[Katla languages|Katla]]
** [[Rashad languages|Rashad]]
** '''[[Atlantic–Congo]]'''
*** [[Lafofa languages|Lafofa]]
*** [[Talodi–Heiban]]
**** Talodi
**** Heiban

Atlantic–Congo is a major division of Niger–Congo which only excludes the [[Mande languages|Mande]], [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] and [[Dogon languages|Dogon]] languages of [[West Africa]], along with the Katla and Rashad languages of the Nuba Mountains.

=== Nilo-Saharan ===

* '''[[Nilo-Saharan]]'''
** [[Kadu languages|Kadu]]
** '''[[Eastern Sudanic]]'''
*** '''[[Kir–Abbaian]]'''
**** [[Temein languages|Temein]]
**** [[Daju languages|Daju]]
*** '''[[Astaboran languages]]'''
**** [[Nyima languages|Nyima]]
**** '''[[Nubian languages]]'''
***** [[Hill Nubian languages|Hill Nubian]]

Eastern Sudanic is a large division of Nilo-Saharan spoken throughout the upper [[Nile]] region. Kir–Abbaian and Astaboran are the two branches branches of Eastern Sudanic, roughly distributed in the North and South of the region, respectively.

The Nubian languages are spoken mostly in northern Sudan and southern [[Egypt]]. Only [[Midob language|Midob]] and the extinct [[Birgid language|Birgid]] are found in southern Sudan, along with the Hill Nubian languages of the Nuba Mountains.

'''Lathóg of Tír Chonaill''' (fl. 9th century) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]].

==Overview==
According to a tract seemingly composed well after the 9th century, Lathóg of [[Tír Chonaill]] was mother of the poet [[Flann mac Lonáin]]. Lathóg once advised Flann to be liberal and open-handed, because the [[ollamh]] is bound to give the same hospitality he receives (MacCana, 1974).

==A verse==
*''My blessing and my counsel take my son and [[Aidhne]]'s glory, Flan. Be generous for our honour's sake, since men give all that you demand. Believe your mother's word that still the niggard poet is in the wrong; Give of your riches with good will, you ask rewards from all for song.'' (Flower, 1947)

The area in which it is spoken roughly fits within a wide circle from [[Venlo]] to [[Düsseldorf]] to [[Aachen]] to [[Maastricht]] to [[Tienen]] and back to Venlo. In some parts of this area it is generally used as the colloquial language in daily speech.

It shares many characteristics with both [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and is often considered as a variant of one of these languages (see also {{lang|de|[[Dachsprache]]}}). Within the modern communities of the Belgian and Dutch provinces of Limburg, intermediate [[idiolects]] are also very common, which combine standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]] with the [[accent (dialect)|accent]] and some grammatical and pronunciation tendencies derived from Limburgish. This "Limburgish Dutch" is confusingly also often referred to simply as "Limburgish", although in Belgium such intermediate idiolects tend to be called {{lang|nl|[[tussentaal]]}} ("in-between language"), no matter the exact dialect/language with which standard Dutch is combined.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Limburgish'' (and variants of it) derives only indirectly from the now Belgian town of [[Limbourg]] (''Laeboer'' in Limburgish, IPA: {{IPA|/ˈlæːbuʁ/}}), which was the capital of the [[Duchy of Limburg]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. More directly it is derived from the more modern name of the [[Province of Limburg (1815–39)]] in the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], which has been split today into a [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] and a [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]]. In the area around the old Duchy of Limburg the main language today is French, but there is also a particular Limburgish (or Limburgish like, depending on definitions) language which is sometimes referred to as "[[Low Dietsch dialects]]".

People from Limburg usually call their language ''Plat'', the same as [[Low German]] speakers do. This ''plat'' refers simply to the fact that the language is spoken in the low plains country, as opposed to the use of ''High'' in [[High German languages]], which are derived from dialects spoken in the more mountainous southerly regions. The word can also be associated with ''platteland'' (Dutch: "countryside"). The general Dutch term for the language of ordinary people in former ages was ''Dietsch'' or ''Duutsch'', as it still exists in the term Low Dietsch (''Plattdütsch'').  This term is originally derived from Proto-Germanic "[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/þiudiskaz|þiudiskaz]]", meaning "of the people" (this word has also been preserved in the Italian word for German, which is "Tedesco", and the English word "Dutch").

In Dutch the word "plat" means "flat", but also refers to the way a language is spoken: "plat" means "slang" in that case.

==Extent==
[[File:Limburgs.png|thumb|Limburgish using several definitions.]]

Limburgish has partially overlapping definition areas, depending on the criteria used:
# All dialects spoken within the political boundary of the two Limburg provinces.
# Limburgish according to Jo Daan, the associative "arrow" method of Meertens Institute.
# South Lower Franconian, isogloss definition between the [[Uerdingen line|Uerdingen]] and [[Benrath line]]s by Wenker, Schrijnen and Goossens (University of Leuven).
# Western limit of Limburgish pitch accent (Largest lexical distance from Standard Dutch, Hoppenbrouwers)
# [[Southeast Limburgish dialect]] (Wintgens and Frins); this includes a part of the [[Ripuarian language]] in Germany.

==History and classification==
{{See also|Old Dutch|Low Franconian languages}}
Except for the Southeast Limburgish dialect, Modern Limburgish descends from some of the dialects that formed the offspring of [[Old Dutch]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]], its history being at least as long as that of other [[Low Franconian languages]], of which some eventually yielded [[Standard Dutch]]. Being a variety of Franconian descent, Limburgish can today be considered as a regional language overarched by two succeeding ''[[Dachsprache]]n'', which are Dutch in Belgium and the Netherlands and German in Germany.

Under the influence of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] and especially the [[Carolingian dynasty]], Eastern Low Franconian underwent much influence from the neighbouring High German languages. This resulted among other things in the partial participation of Eastern Low Franconian in the [[High German consonant shift]] in the 10th and especially the 11th century, which makes the Limburgish-speaking area also part of the so-called [[Rhenish fan]]. It is especially this trait which distinguishes Limburgish from Western Low Franconian.

In the past, all Limburgish dialects were therefore sometimes seen as [[West Central German]], part of High German. This difference is caused by a difference in definition: the latter stance defines a High German variety as one that has taken part in any of the first three phases of the High German consonant shift. It is nevertheless most common in linguistics to consider Limburgish as Low Franconian.

From the 13th century on, however, the [[Duchy of Brabant]] extended its power. As a consequence, at first the western (i.e. spoken until [[Genk]]) and then also the eastern variants of Limburgish underwent great influence of Brabantian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061231190557/http://www.veldeke.be/pub/1131610533_vbl_de_regenboogkleuren_van.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; When Standard Dutch was formed out of elements of different Low Franconian dialects in the 16th century, the Limburgish dialects spoken in the [[Low Countries]] had little or no influence on this process. As a result, Limburgish – although being essentially a variety of Low Franconian – still has a considerable distance from Standard Dutch with regards to phonology, morphology and lexicon today.&lt;ref name="Dialect loss in Maastricht"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dialect loss in Maastricht|year=1989 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pb1dJDAcwUUC&amp;pg=PA99 |author=Muenstermann, H. |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, being of East Low Franconian origin, it also has many distinctive features in comparison with the West Low Franconian varieties such as the [[Hollandic dialect]], the [[Brabantian dialect]] and [[South Guelderish]].

=== Limburgish and Meuse-Rhenish ===
[[File:Meuse-Rhenish-nl.png|thumb|The dialects between and around Meuse and Rhine.]]
{{Main article|Meuse-Rhenish}}
In German sources, the dialects linguistically counting as Limburgish spoken to the east of the river [[Rhine]] are called ''[[Bergish]]'' (named after the former [[Duchy of Berg]]). West of the river Rhine (the former [[Duchy of Jülich]]) they are called "Low Rhenish", which is considered a transitional zone between Low Franconian and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]]. Thus, formerly German linguists tended to call these dialects [[Low German]].

Limburgish is spoken in a considerable part of the German Lower Rhine area, in what linguistically (though not in any sense politically) could be called German Limburg. This area extends from the border regions of [[Cleves]], [[Aachen]], [[Viersen]] and [[Heinsberg]], stretching out to the [[Rhine]] river. Modern linguists, both in the Netherlands and in Germany, now often combine these distinct varieties with the Cleves dialects (Kleverländisch). This superordinating group of Low Franconian varieties (between the rivers Meuse and Rhine) is called Meuse-Rhenish (Dutch: ''Maas-Rijnlands'', Welschen 2002), or in German: ''Rheinmaasländisch''.

Both Limburgish and [[Low Rhenish]] belong to this greater [[Meuse]]-[[Rhine]] area, building a large group of southeastern Low [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] dialects, including areas in Belgium, the Netherlands and the German Northern [[Rhineland]]. The northwestern part of this triangle came under the influence of the Dutch standard language, especially since the founding of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815. At the same time, the southeastern portion became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and was subject to [[High German]] language domination. At the dialectal level however, mutual understanding is still possible far beyond both sides of the national borders (Welschen 2002).

The Meuse-Rhenish dialects can be divided into Northern and Southern varieties. Hence, Limburgish is Southwestern Meuse-Rhenish as spoken in Belgium, the Netherlands and the German Lower Rhine. The Northeastern Meuse-Rhenish dialects as spoken in the Netherlands and in Germany (a little eastward along the Rhine) are unambiguously Low Franconian and can be considered as Dutch. As discussed above, Limburgish straddles the borderline between "Low Franconian" and "Middle Franconian" varieties. These Southwestern Meuse-Rhenish dialects are more-or-less mutually intelligible with the Ripuarian dialects, but have been influenced less by the [[High German consonant shift]] (R. Hahn 2001).

==Form==
Limburgish is far from being homogeneous. In other words, it has numerous [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] instead of one single [[standard language|standard form]]. Between 1995 and 1999, a uniform standard form called AGL (''Algemein Gesjreve Limburgs'', "Generally written Limburgish") was developed and proposed, but found too little support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.d66limburg.nl/Archief/fractie/cult/streektaal.htm |title=Streektaal |publisher=D66limburg.nl |language=Dutch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121050354/http://www.d66limburg.nl/Archief/fractie/cult/streektaal.htm |archivedate=2004-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the so-called "Veldeke-spelling" which was first applied in the 1940s is most of the time used to write in a specific Limburgish dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opgenort.nl/limburgs/veldekespelling.php |title=Limburgse taal |website=Jean Robert Opgenort.nl |date=2003-12-01 |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the parliament of the province of East-Limburg enacted a measure establishing the Limburgish Language Council (Raod veur 't Limburgs), a committee which advises the East Limburgish parliament on measures in relation to Limburgish. In 2003 the Limburgish Language Council adopted a standard orthography for Limburgish.  On the basis of this standard orthography the Limburgish Academy Foundation (''Stiechting Limbörgse Academie'') is creating Limburgish-Dutch, Limburgish-English, Dutch-Limburgish and English-Limburgish dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limburgs.org |title=limburgs.org |publisher=limburgs.org |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
Limburgish is spoken by approximately 1.6 million people in the [[Low Countries]] and by many hundreds of thousands in [[Germany]]. It is especially in the Dutch province of Limburg that Limburgish is used not only in everyday speech, but also often in more formal situations and on the local and regional radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.hum.uva.nl/natlearn/limburgs/bijl4.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430233327/http://cf.hum.uva.nl/natlearn/limburgs/bijl4.html |date=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a recent study by Geert Driessen, in 2011 Limburgish was spoken by 54 percent of the adults and 31 percent of the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.its-nijmegen.nl/pdf/NTR12%20dialect1995-2011.pdf |title=Ontwikkelingen in het gebruik van Fries, streektalen en dialecten in de periode 1995-2011 |format=PDF|website=Its-nijmegen.nl |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limburgish has no real written tradition, except for its early beginnings. [[Hendrik van Veldeke]] wrote in a Middle Limburgish dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowlands-l.net/anniversary/limburgs-info.php |title=Lowlands-L Anniversary Celebration |publisher=Lowlands-l.net |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the Netherlands, the cultural meaning of the language is also important. Many song texts are written in a Limburgish dialect, for example during [[Carnival]]. [[Jack Poels]] writes most of his texts for [[Rowwen Hèze]] in Sevenums, a local dialect within the Northern Limburgish dialects, which is often wrongly assumed to be part of the Limburgish dialect, since the Northern Limburgs dialect is classified in the greater group of South Guelderish dialects and not in the Limburgish dialects.

To what degree Limburgish actually is spoken in Germany today remains a matter of debate. Depending on the city in these parts of Germany, 50% to 90% of the population speak a local or regional form of Meuse-Rhenish, which is either Limburgish or [[Bergish]], according to A. Schunck 2001. However, this percentage seems to be a clear overestimation, as far as the German situation is concerned.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The same holds true for his estimation of the Belgian situation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Moreover, research into some specific variants seems to indicate a gradual process of development towards the national standardised Dutch, especially amongst younger generations.&lt;ref name="Dialect of Maastricht"&gt;{{cite web|title=The dialect of Maastricht|year=1999|publisher=University of Nijmegen, Centre for Language Studies|url=http://www.let.kun.nl/gep/carlos/Maastrich2ipa.pdf|author1=Gussenhoven, C.|author2=Aarts, F.|accessdate=2009-07-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612092141/http://www.let.kun.nl/gep/carlos/Maastrich2ipa.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, the Limburgish dialects are more endangered than in the Netherlands.

==Linguistic versus societal status==
In a decree dated December 24, 1990, the Belgian Flemish regional government was the first to officially recognise Limburgish, as spoken in West Limburg, as a regional, indigenous language. In March 1997 the Dutch government recognised Limburgish as a [[regional language]] (Dutch: ''streektaal'') in the [[Netherlands]]. As such, it receives moderate protection under chapter 2 of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].

It has been argued, however, that this recognition was highly politically motivated and done more on [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] than purely linguistic grounds. In 1999, the [[Dutch Language Union]], the ''de facto'' language authority which asserted that it had not been asked for advice, opposed the recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/erkenning_van_het_limburgs/ |title=Erkenning van het Limburgs |language=Dutch |publisher=Taalunieversum.org |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Limburgish side it has been argued that the arguments put forth against the recognition of Limburgish were not based on linguistic considerations, but rather a concern for maintaining the dominance of the Dutch language.

On the other hand, Limburgish has not been recognised by the German and Belgian national governments as an official language so far.  An attempt at recognition, made after Limburgish had been recognised in the Netherlands, failed in the Belgian parliament due to Flemish opposition. Because in Belgium political power is divided according to linguistic lines, recognizing Limburgish as an official language would have had considerable constitutional implications and undermine the small majority Flemish speakers hold over Walloon speakers in the Belgian State.

''{{lang|de|Südniederfränkisch}}'' is a concept used in Germany to describe the Limburgish language ("South Low Franconian") of Germany. It is a group spoken in a part of the [[Bergisches Land|Bergisches Land Region]] near [[Düsseldorf]] east of the [[Rhine]] and in the lower Rhine area between the rivers Rhine and [[Meuse (river)|Maas]], the latter (called ''{{lang|de|Rheinmaasländisch}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Südostniederfränkisch}}'' "Southeast Low Franconian") shortly behind the Dutch–German border in the vicinity of [[Heinsberg]] and [[Nettetal]]. These languages are predominantly seen as belonging to the Limburgish language group.

They were also referred to as the ''East Limburgish'' group. It encompasses the varieties of Limburgish spoken in Germany. They are also seen as part of the [[Meuse-Rhenish]] language group. Population using one of the languages in the group either name their local variety ''[[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]'' (in the {{lang|de|Bergisches Land}} Region only), or ''{{lang|de|[[Low German|Platt]]}}'', or after their village, town, or city ''place''er {{lang|de|Platt}}. People from outside the Rhineland often make less distinctions and use the term [[Rhinelandic]] for large set of varieties of languages.

The Limburgish group belongs to the Continental West Germanic [[dialect continuum]]. As usual inside dialect continua, neighboring languages have a maximum of similarities, and speakers being used to the rather small individual lingual differences in their immediate neighborhood perceive them as close, and familiar, while more distant ones become gradually harder to understand with distance. That ends, in the Dutch–German continuum at least, most often with incomprehensible dialects. Isoglosses are so dense in this area that practically every village or town has its own distinct dialect of Limburgish. Large cities such as [[Mönchengladbach]], [[Krefeld]], and [[Düsseldorf]] have several local dialect varieties. The named cities have in common, that they are large enough to in part extend outside the area of the dialect group. Thus each has one or more quarters outside, having vernacular languages belonging to adjacent groups, such as Cleverlands or Ripuarian.

A few sample South Low Franconian dialects are: {{lang|de|[[Dremmener Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Dremmen]]}} near {{lang|de|[[Heinsberg]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Breyellsch Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Breyell]]}} in {{lang|de|[[Nettetal]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Jlabbacher Platt]]}} of central {{lang|de|Mönchengladbach}}, {{lang|de|[[Jriefrother Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Grefrath]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Viersener Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Viersen]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Föschelner Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Krefeld-Fischeln|Fischeln]]}} in Krefeld, {{lang|de|[[Krieewelsch]]}} of central {{lang|de|Krefeld}}, {{lang|de|[[Ödingsch]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Krefeld-Uerdingen|Uerdingen]]}} in {{lang|de|Krefeld}}, {{lang|de|[[Düsseldorver Platt]]}} of northern and central {{lang|de|[[Düsseldorf]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Rotinger Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Ratingen]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Wülfrother Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Wülfrath]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Metmannsch Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Mettmann]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Solinger Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Solingen]]}}, {{lang|de|[[Remscheder Platt]]}} of {{lang|de|[[Remscheid]]}}, and many more.

The group combines [[Low Franconian]] properties with some [[Ripuarian (language)|Ripuarian]] properties, such as tonal accents, the pronoun "I" translates as ''{{lang|li|ech}}'' or ''{{lang|li|iech}}'', the word "but" most often as ''{{lang|li|awwer}}'', all like Ripuarian. Contrasting, "time" is translated as ''{{lang|li|tied}}'', "to have" mostly as ''{{lang|li|hebbe}}'', "today" as ''{{lang|li|vandag}}'', all typical for Low Franconian.

An area close to [[Westphalia]] called ''{{lang|de|[[Bergisches Land]]}}'' is considered to be the area where {{lang|de|Bergisch}} is spoken. This area is limited roughly by a line {{lang|de|[[Düsseldorf]]–[[Mettmann]]–[[Solingen]]–[[Remscheid]]}}. For a more encompassing view, see the article on [[Low Rhenish]].

''{{lang|nl|Noord-Limburgs}}'' (also called ''{{lang|nl|ik-Limburgs}}'') is the Dutch term for a group of dialects spoken north of the [[Uerdingen line]], i.e. from just south of Venlo upward to the North in the Dutch province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. These dialects share many features with both the {{lang|nl|[[Zuid-Gelders]]}} and [[Brabantian]] dialects and are closer to Standard Dutch than the more southern language varieties (see e.g. Hoppenbrouwers 2001). The term {{lang|nl|Noord-Limburgs}} is used by Jo Daan for the entire province north of the Uerdingen line, whereas other linguists use it only for the part that has tonality, the language north of this region then being considered [[Kleverlandish]].

The north border of the Limburgish tonality zone lies a little north of [[Arcen]] and [[Horst aan de Maas]] and just above the ''meej/mich'' isogloss, also known as the "mich-kwartier". This makes this Limburgish isogloss the northernmost of all. Venlo lies between the ''meej/mich'' isogloss and the Uerdingen line, so the Venlo dialect is the only one with both forms ''ik'' and ''mich/dich''. All dialects in the Dutch province of Limburg spoken north of the tonality border are South Guelderish in linguistic respect.

The dialects spoken in the most southeastern part of the Dutch province of [[North Brabant]] (i.e. in and around [[Budel]] and [[Maarheeze]]) also have many Limburgish characteristics. An important difference between these dialects and the adjacent ones in the Dutch province of Limburg is, however, that the second-person pronoun  ''gij'' is here used instead of ''doe'', as in "purely" Brabantian dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arielis.com/img/archive/naamloos6tn.png|format=PNG|title=Map|website=Arielis.com|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Centraal-Limburgs'' includes the area around [[Maastricht]], [[Sittard-Geleen|Sittard]], [[Roermond]], the eastern half of Belgian Limburg, and the Belgian [[Voeren]] area, and stretches further Northeast. Belgian linguists {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} use a more refined classification. Dutch linguists use the term ''Oost-Limburgs'' for the form of Limburgish spoken in an area from Belgian [[Voeren]] south of [[Maastricht]] in the Netherlands to the German border. For them, ''West-Limburgs'' is the variety of Limburgish spoken in [[Belgium]] in the area east of the Uerdingen line, for example in and around [[Hasselt]] and [[Tongeren]]. It includes areas in Dutch Limburg (like [[Ool]], [[Maria Hoop]] and [[Montfort, Netherlands|Montfort]]) and Dutch Brabant. The border of ''West-Limburgs'' and ''Oost-Limburgs'' starts a little south of the area between the villages of 's-Gravenvoeren and Sint-Martens-Voeren in the Belgian municipality of [[Voeren]].

[[Southeast Limburgish]] (''{{lang|nl|Zuidoost-Limburgs}}'') is spoken in and around [[Kerkrade]], [[Simpelveld]], [[Bocholtz]] and [[Vaals]] in the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kgv.nl/wiki/index.php?title=Dialect |title=Dialect - KGV |language=nl |publisher=Kgv.nl |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aachen]] in [[Germany]] and [[Raeren]] and [[Eynatten]] in [[Belgium]]. Especially in [[Germany]] these dialects are usually considered as variants of [[Ripuarian (language)|Ripuarian]], not of Limburgish. According to a more contemporary vision, however, all varieties in a wider half circle some 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;km around Aachen, including 2/3 of Dutch South Limburg and also the so-called [[Low Dietsch]] area between [[Voeren]] and [[Eupen]] in Belgium, can be taken as a group of its own, which recently has been named ''Limburgish of the [[Vaalserberg|''Three Countries Area'']]'' (Dutch: ''{{lang|nl|Drielandenlimburgs}}'', German: ''{{lang|de|Dreiländerplatt}}''), referring to the place where the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany meet.

Its concept was introduced by Ad Welschen, mainly based on research by Jean Frins (2005, 2006). This variety still possesses interesting syntactic [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]], probably dating from the period in which the old [[Duchy of Limburg]] existed. Jan Goossens defines the northwest boundary of South East Limburgish at the ''lijk-lich'' isogloss. The area between this line and the [[Benrath line]] is called Ripuarian-Limburgish. The area between the Benrath line and the ''aat-alt'' isogloss is then called Aachens or Limburgish-Ripuarian.

If only tonality is to be taken as to define this variety, it stretches well across the river Rhine into [[Germany]] (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20070318135536/http://www.let.ru.nl/gep/jp/TonenLimburg%20engels.html Fournier et al]). In Germany, it is consensus to class it as belonging to [[High German languages|High German]] varieties. In order to include this variety properly a more encompassing concept is needed. The combination of [[Meuse-Rhenish]] and Ripuarian, including their overlapping transitional zones of [[Southeast Limburgish]] and [[Low Dietsch]], will do.

* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} may not show up in the Hasselt dialect, but is common in other Limburgish dialects, e.g. ''zègke'' (Dutch: ''zeggen'') "to say".
* Other Limburgish dialects also have the following sounds: {{IPAblink|c}} (lan'''dj'''); {{IPAblink|ɲ}} (te'''nj''', teeth).
* {{IPA|/w/}} is realized as {{IPAblink|β̞}} in Belgian Limburgish.
* {{IPA|[ɫ]}} is a common allophone of {{IPA|/l/}}, especially in coda position. It is rare in the Montfortian dialect.
* {{IPA|[ç]}} and {{IPA|[ʝ]}} are allophones of {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, occurring in a front-vowel environment.
* {{IPA|[ɦ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/h/}}. In some dialects, it may be the usual realization of {{IPA|/h/}}.
* In most dialects, {{IPA|/r/}} is nowadays [[uvular consonant|uvular]].

Overall, Limburgish dialects tend to have more consonants than Dutch. They also tend to have more vowels. According to [[Peter Ladefoged]], the vowel inventory of the dialect of Weert is perhaps the richest in the world. It has 28 vowels, among which there are 9 long monophthongs, 10 short monophthongs and 9 diphthongs (three of which pattern with the long monophthongs, rather than the other diphthongs).&lt;ref name="let.ru.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.let.ru.nl/gep/jp/TonenLimburg.html |title=carloslimburg |publisher=Let.ru.nl |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Heijmans|first1=Linda|last2=Gussenhoven|first2=Carlos|year=1998|title=The Dutch dialect of Weert|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|volume=28|page=109|doi=10.1017/S0025100300006307|url=http://gep.ruhosting.nl/carlos/weert.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of the Limburgish dialects spoken to the southeast of [[Panningen]]—for example those of Roermond, Sittard and Heerlen—{{IPAblink|ʃ}} appears at the beginning of words in the consonant clusters ''sp'', ''st'', ''sl'', ''sm'', ''sn'' and ''zw''. The same sound is realized as {{IPAblink|s}} elsewhere (e.g. ''sjtraot''/''straot'', "street"). This is not the case, however, in the dialects of for example Venlo, Weert, Maastricht, Echt, Montfort and Posterholt.

* {{IPA|/ə/}} only occurs in unstressed syllables.

====Diphthongs====

The diphthongs {{IPA|/iə ø eɪ æɪ uɪ ɔɪ aɪ ou/}} occur, as well as combinations of {{IPA|/uː ɔː ɑː/}} + {{IPA|/j/}}. {{IPA|/aɪ/}} only occurs in French loanwords and [[interjection]]s.

{{IPA|/ou/}} is realized as {{IPA|[oə]}} before alveolar consonants. {{IPA|/eɪ/}} can be realized as {{IPA|[eə]}} or {{IPA|[ejə]}}. In the dialect of [[Geleen]], {{IPA|/eː/}} is realized as {{IPA|[iɛ]}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} as {{IPA|[ɔː]}}. In many dialects such as that of Maastricht and Sittard, the long vowel {{IPA|/aː/}} in Dutch [[cognate]]s is most of the time realized as {{IPA|[ɒː]}}, as in ''nao'' ("after", "to, towards"). The Standard Dutch equivalents are ''na'' {{IPA|[naː]}} and ''naar'' {{IPA|[naːr]}}.

In about 50 Belgian Limburgish dialects, the rounded front vowels {{IPA|/y, yː, ʏ, øː, œ, œː, œy/}} are unrounded to {{IPA|/i, iː, ɪ, eː, e ~ ɛ, ɛː, ɛi/}} in most native words. They are retained in French loanwords such as ''dzjuus'' {{IPA|/dʒys/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Belemans, R. &amp; Keulen R. (2004): 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
{{see|Tone (linguistics)}}
[[File:Germanic pitch.png|thumb|Extent (orange) of the region where a pitch accent is used in The Benelux, France and Germany]]
[[File:Sleeptoon.png|thumb|100px|Tone contour in pulling tone]]
[[File:Valtoon.png|thumb|100px|Tone contour in push tone]]
Many dialects of Limburgish (and of Ripuarian)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/phonetik/aktuell/PuP5_Abstracts/Hermans_Meertens_Amsterdam.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302070019/http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/phonetik/aktuell/PuP5_Abstracts/Hermans_Meertens_Amsterdam.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; have a [[pitch accent]], having two different accents used in stressed syllables. The difference between these two accents is used for differentiating both various grammatical forms of a single [[lexeme]] and [[minimal pair|minimal tone pairs]] one from the other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040731120137/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J01/J01-3005.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;

With specific regards to Limburgish, these two accents are traditionally known as ''sjtoettoen'' ("push tone") and ''sjleiptoen'' ("dragging tone"). The dragging tone is [[lexical tone|lexical]] while the push tone is not. For example, {{IPA|[daːx˦˨˧]}} ''daãg'' with a dragging tone means "a day" in Limburgish, while in many Limburgish dialects {{IPA|[daːx˦˨]}} ''daàg'' with a push tone is the plural form, "days" (in addition, {{IPA|[daːx]}} can also be articulated in a neutral tone as a third possibility. In this case, it means "bye-bye").

This difference is grammatical, but not lexical. An example of a lexical difference caused by dragging tone is the word {{IPA|[biː˦˨]}} ''biè'' which is articulated with a push tone and means "bee", forming a tonal minimal pair with {{IPA|[biː˦˨˧]}} ''biẽ'', which is articulated with a dragging tone and means "at".

====Pitch accent in comparison with "real" tonality====
However, this feature cannot be compared to the "real" [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] systems such as for example that of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] or some [[African languages]] such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], the number of [[tone contour]]s and their division being far more restricted in Limburgish than in these languages. Other [[Indo-European languages]] with a pitch accent include [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], Standard [[Slovene language|Slovene]] (only some speakers), and [[Serbo-Croatian]].

Most of these languages being spoken at the borders of Europe, it has been suggested that tonality once was present in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], and that its disappearance would have spread from the center of the European continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanoostendorp.nl/pdf/atlascursus02.pdf|format=PDF|title=Taalvariatie in Nederland : Limburgse tonen : Marc van Oostendorp|date=November 2004|website=Vanoostendorp.nl|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is generally accepted that this system was already lost in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]]. A more plausible explanation of the origin of the Limburgish/Ripuarian tone system is that it originated in the Middle Ages from the [[apocope]] of plural [[schwa]]s in the dialect of [[Cologne]] ([[Colognian language|Kölsch]]). This change necessitated at its turn a somewhat different articulation of the preceding vowel in the singular form, which was lengthened as in German but only to a limited extent, in order to keep on distinguishing the singular from the plural forms. This specific way of vowel lengthening may finally have resulted in the dragging tone.&lt;ref name="let.ru.nl"/&gt;

====Particular local features====
=====Bitonality=====
It has been proven by speech analysis that in the Belgian Limburgish dialect of [[Borgloon]], the dragging tone itself is bitonal, while it has also been proved that this is not the case in the adjacent Limburgish dialects of [[Tongeren]] and [[Hasselt]].

=====Steeper fall=====
Other research has indicated that the push tone has a steeper fall in the eastern dialects of Limburgish (e.g. those of Venlo, Roermond and Maasbracht) than it has in western dialects. In addition, both the phonetic realisation and the syllable-based distribution of the contrasts between push and dragging tone seem to be [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]-bound in the eastern dialects only. This has been examined especially by Jörg Peters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXEgn1PCQsAC&amp;pg=PA167 |title=Tones and Tunes: Typological studies in word and sentence prosody - Tomas Riad, Carlos Gussenhoven - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Diphthongization=====
Moreover, in some dialects such as that of Sittard and Maastricht, especially the [[mid vowel|mid]] and [[high vowel|high]] vowels tend to [[diphthongization|diphthongize]] when they have a push tone. So in the dialect of Sittard ''keize'' means "to choose" while in the dialect of [[Maasbracht]] no diphthongization takes place, so ''keze'' means the same here. This difference has been examined in particular by Ben Hermans and Marc van Oostendorp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanoostendorp.nl/pdf/sittards.pdf|format=PDF|title=Synchrone beperkingen op de Sittardse diftongering|author1=Ben Hermans|author2=Marc van Oostendorp|website=Vanoostendorp.nl|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include plural
* {{IPA|[stæɪn˦˨˧]}} ''steĩn'' "stone"
* {{IPA|[stæɪn˦˨]}} ''steìn'' "stones"
and lexical
* {{IPA|[ɡraːf˦˨]}} "grave"
* {{IPA|[ɡraːf˦˨˧]}} "hole next to a road"

Verbs distinguish mood with tone:
* {{IPA|[weːʁ˦˨˧ˈkɪ˦˨və˧]}} "We conquer!"
* {{IPA|[weːʁ˦˨˧ˈkɪ˦˨˧və˧]}} "May we conquer!"

The difference between push tone and dragging tone may also purely mark grammatical [[declension]] without there being any difference in meaning, as in the dialect of Borgloon: ''gieël'' ("yellow", with dragging tone) as opposed to ''en gieël peer'' ("a yellow pear", with push tone). This tonal shift also occurs when the adjective gets an inflectional ending, as in ''nen gieëlen appel ("a yellow apple").&lt;ref&gt;Belemans, R. &amp; Keulen R. (2004): 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of Limburg, the tonal plural is being replaced with the Dutch forms among the younger generation, so that the plural for ''daag'' becomes ''dage'' ({{IPA|[daːʝə]}}).

==== Gender ====
{{improve|reason=&lt;br /&gt;
# "determinative particle", "indeterminative particle" -- what's that? With the article having some remains of inflections (like masculine and feminine de vs. neuter het) it's not a particle. Thus it's more appropriate and more common to call it "definite article" and "indefinite article".

According to some, Dutch has three genders too, e.g. [[Dutch language#Genders and cases]]: "standard Dutch has three grammatical genders". And that masculine and feminine forms often are similar, like using the article "de" for both, isn't enough to assume a common gender. 2. The number of Dutch genders is irrelevant, so it can simply be "Limburgish has three grammatical genders."
&lt;br /&gt;|date=November 2017}}
Unlike Dutch, Limburgish has three grammatical genders. In Dutch, for nouns of common gender the determinative particle is ''de'', while neutral nouns use ''het'' as the definite article. In some of the dialects however, similar to most Belgian-Dutch dialects, "den" is used before masculine words beginning with ''b'', ''d'', ''h'', ''t'' or with a vowel and in many other dialects ''der'' is used before all masculine words. In most dialects, the indeterminative particle is ''eine(n)'' for masculine nouns, ''ein'' for feminine nouns and ''ei'' or '''n'' for neuter nouns. Without stress, these forms are most of the time realized as ''ne(n)'', ''n'' and ''e''.

==== Plural ====
For some nouns, Limburgish uses [[simulfix]]es (i.e. [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]) to form the plural:

* ''broor'' – ''breurke'' – ''breur'' (brother – little brother – brothers)
* ''sjoon'' – ''sjeunke'' – ''sjeun'' (shoe – little shoe – shoes): note this can also be 'sjoon' with ''sjtoettoen'' (pushing tone).

Plural and diminutive nouns based on Umlaut start to prevail east towards Germany. However, towards the west, the phonemic distinction between dragging and pushing tone will stop just before [[Riemst]].&lt;ref&gt;Belemans, R. &amp; Keulen R. (2004): 33&lt;/ref&gt;

This way of forming plurals is also known in other Germanic languages, in particular German and also, to a lesser degree, English (e.g. ''man'' – ''men'' ; ''goose'' – ''geese''). However, it does not exist in modern Dutch. (The Dutch pair ''stad'' – ''steden'' "cities" is the only case where Dutch has preserved the original umlaut, although it is now just an additional feature along with the standardized ending ''-en'').

==== Diminutives ====
The diminutive suffix is most often ''-ke'', as in Brabantian, or ''-je''/''-sje'' after a dental consonant.

=== Adjectives ===
According to their declension, Limburgish adjectives can be grouped into two classes. Adjectives of the first class get the ending ''-e'' in their masculine and feminine singular forms and always in plural, but no ending in their neuter singular form. When combined with a masculine noun in singular adjectives may also end on ''-en'', under the same phonological conditions which apply to articles. To this class belong most adjectives ending on a ''-ch[t]'', ''-d'', ''-k'', ''-p'', ''-t'' or ''-s'' preceded by another consonant or with one of the suffixes ''-eg'', ''-ig'' and ''-isch''. The other declension class includes most adjectives ending on ''-f'', ''-g'', ''-j'', ''-l'',''-m'',''-n'', ''-ng'', ''-r'', ''-w'' or ''-s'' preceded by a vowel; these adjectives only get the ending ''-e(n)'' in their masculine singular form.

When used as a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], Limburgish adjectives never get an ending: ''Dee mins is gek'' (Maastrichtian: "That man is crazy"). Except for neuter adjectives which sometimes get -t: "'t Eint of 't angert", though this is dying out.

In the masculine singular forms of ''mien'', ''dien'', ''zien'' and ''oos'', final ''-n'' is added under the same phonological conditions which apply to articles and adjectives.

The most common demonstrative pronouns in Limburgish are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Singular masculine !! Singular feminine !! Singular neuter !! Plural !! Translation
|-
| ''deze(n)''/''dizze(n)'' || ''dees''/''dis'' || ''dit'' || ''dees'' || this/these
|-
| ''dae(n)'' (Maastrichtian: ''dee'') || ''die'' || ''det'' (Venlo, Roermond), ''dat'' (Maastricht) || ''die'' || that/those
|}

==Vocabulary==
Most of the Limburgish vocabulary is very similar to that of Standard Dutch or to that of Standard German. However, the more basic words of the language clearly have their grounds in Central German Dialects. For Example, [[personal pronouns]] are overwhelmingly similar to German.

Historically, the vocabulary of the varieties of Limburgish spoken within [[Flanders|Flemish]] (Belgian) territory has been more influenced by [[french language|French]] than that of the Limburgish dialects spoken on Dutch and German soil, as appears form words such as ''briquet'' ("cigarette-lighter"), ''camion'' ("truck") and ''crevette'' ("shrimp"). The language has similarities with both German and Dutch, and [[Hendrik van Veldeke]], a medieval writer from the region, is referred to as both one of the earlier writers in German and one of the earliest writers in Dutch.

'''Lunda''', also known as '''Chilunda''', is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language spoken in [[Zambia]], [[Angola]] and, to a lesser extent, in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC). Lunda and its dialects are spoken and understood by perhaps 4.6% of Zambians (1986 estimate), and the language is used mainly in the [[Northwestern Province, Zambia|Northwestern]] province of Zambia. The majority of the Lunda can be found in DRC, especially [[Katanga Province]], as well as in Angola. A small number of Lunda dialects are represented in [[Namibia]].

'''Midob''' (also spelt Meidob) is the language of the [[Midob people]] of [[North Darfur]], [[Sudan]]. It is one of the [[Nubian languages]], which are part of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language phylum. Apart from in their homeland of North Darfur, Midob speakers also live in the [[Khartoum]] area and Jezirat Aba. The Midob people call their language ''tìd-n-áal'', literally "mouth of the Midob", and themselves ''tìddí'' (singular), ''tìd'' (plural). There are an estimated 50,000 Midob speakers in two main dialects, Urrti and Kaageddi.

Recent research on Midob has been done by Thelwall (1983) and Werner (1993). Both studies concerned the Urrti dialect.

==Phonology==
The following tables show the phonological consonants and vowels without phonetic variations and without more recent [[Arabic]] loans.

===Vowels===
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; width: 250px;"
|-
| [[Close front unrounded vowel|i]], ii
| &amp;nbsp;
| [[Close back rounded vowel|u]], uu
|-
| [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|e]], ee
| [[Mid central vowel|ə]], əə
| [[Close-mid back rounded vowel|o]], oo
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| [[Open front unrounded vowel|a]], aa
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

Note: All vowels occur long and short. The [[mid central vowel]] ''ə'' only appears in Midob, not in other Nubian languages.

===Consonants===

===Tone===

Midob is a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] language with two registers: High and Low. Tone is both lexical and grammatical. 

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: left; width: 200px;"
|+ Lexical tone
|-
| àadí  || we (exclusive)
|-
| áadí  || stick
|-
| àadì  || light
|}

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: left; width: 200px;"
|+ Grammatical tone
|-
| ná || you (sgl obj)
|-
| nà || him, her
|}

==Grammar==
Midob is an [[agglutinative language]], like the other Nubian languages. The default word order is [[subject–object–verb|SOV]].

===Verb===
The verbs consist of: 
:verbal stem ( + extension ) + tense/aspect.
The stem is not altered. Extensions modify or add meaning to the verb like [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]], intention, [[Affirmative mood|affirmation]], completed action, [[Grammatical number|plurality]] of subject–object or action, [[durative]], [[Habitual aspect|habitual]] and sometimes can be combined (especially negation).

=== Tense and aspect ===
Midob has two basic tenses (Perfect and Continuous) plus Intentional. There are sets of suffixes for [[indicative]], [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and two question forms (to ask for a fact, i.e. "When/Why..." and to verify a fact, i.e. "Did you...").

Sets of personal endings:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! &amp;nbsp; !! Indicative !! Subjunctive !! Question1 !! Question2
|-
| Perfect || x || x || x || x
|-
| Continuous &amp;nbsp; || x || x || x || x
|- 
| Intentional || x || - || - || -
|}

'''Neo''' is an artificially constructed [[international auxiliary language]] created by [[Arturo Alfandari]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] diplomat of Italian descent. The language combines features of [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Novial]] and [[Volapük]]. The root base of the language and grammar (in contrast to that of Esperanto and Ido) are closely related to that of the [[French language]], with some [[English language|English]] influences.

==History==

The first Neo draft was published in 1937 by [[Arturo Alfandari]] but attracted wider attention in 1961 when Alfandari published his books ''Cours Pratique de Neo'' and ''The Rapid Method of Neo''. The works included both brief and complete grammar, learning course of 44 lectures, translations of literary works (poetry and prose), original Neo literature, scientific and technical texts, idioms, detailed bidirectional French and English dictionaries. The total volume of the publications was 1304 pages, with dictionaries numbering some 75 000 words. Such a degree of details was unprecedented among constructed languages of the time.

The language stands in the tradition of international auxiliary languages such as [[Esperanto]] or [[Ido (language)|Ido]], with the same goal: a simple, neutral and easy to learn second language for everybody.

Neo attracted the interest of the circle around the ''[[International Language Review]]'', a periodical for IAL proponents whose publishers co-founded the international Friends of Neo (''Amikos de Neo'') with Alfandari; the organization also published its bulletin, the ''Neo-bulten''. For a few years it looked like Neo could give some serious competition to [[Esperanto]] and [[Interlingua]].

As Alfandari's health worsened, to avoid disappearance of his language, he founded a second, more serious organization: the Academy of Neo (''Akademio de Neo''), with the task of regulating, nurturing and spreading the language; but the organization turned out to not to be very successful.  Progress was cut short by Alfandari's death in 1969 and the language was mostly forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Overview==

Grammatically, the language is mostly influenced by Ido and [[Esperanto]]; but also, in some characteristics such as a [[plural]] ''-s'' and natural-appearing [[pronoun]]s, by the naturalistic IALs like [[Interlingua]] and [[Occidental language|Occidental]].
[[Image:Rapid Method of Neo Cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''The Rapid Method of Neo'']]
The way of forming the vocabulary and the preference for short, monosyllabic words show a substantial [[Volapük]] influence but, unlike the latter's roots which are often changed and mutilated beyond recognition, the Neo roots are easily recognizable as [[Romance languages|Romance]].

It is also notable for its terseness, which exceeds that of [[English language|English]] or any [[International auxiliary language]] (IAL) of the ''a priori'' type, which makes it very compact and brief in expression, and for the facility of its grammar whose overview occupies only two pages.

Neo uses the 26 letters of the standard Roman alphabet: five vowels and 21 consonants. When spelling a word, the letters have an -e ending:

a, be, ce, de, e, fe, ge, he, i, je, ke, le, me, ne, o, pe, qe, re, se, te, u, ve, we, xe, ye, ze.

===Pronunciation===

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
|+ '''Examples:'''
! Neo !! How to pronounce
|-
| c (ch) || '''ch'''air, su'''ch'''
|-
| g || '''g'''arden, lo'''g'''
|-
| j || '''j'''ewel, ba'''dg'''e
|-
| q (kw) || '''qu'''art, li'''qu'''id 
|-
| s || '''s'''ome, ma'''sh'''
|-
| sh || '''sh'''all, ma'''sh'''
|-
| ts || '''ts'''etse, lo'''ts'''
|-
| w || '''w'''ing, south'''w'''est
|-
| x (ks) || o'''x'''en, ta'''x'''es
|-
| y || '''y'''arn, '''y'''ogurt
|}

Note that the ''c'' has the same pronunciation as the digraph ''ch''; both are pronounced as in English words like '''''ch'''alk'' or '''''ch'''imney'', and in borrowed Italian words like '''''c'''iao'' or ''boccon'''c'''ini'', never with the 'k' sound in ''care'' or the 's' sound in ''certain.'' The ''g'' always has the “hard” pronunciation, never the “soft” pronunciation of '''''g'''em'' or '''''g'''iant''. The ''s'' is always unvoiced, never pronounced with the 'z' sound in ''ro'''s'''e'' or the 'zh' sound in ''lei'''s'''ure.''

Other letters, including the vowels, are pronounced as in [[Esperanto]]. Words with the letters ''q'' (not pronounced 'kjoo' but as in English 'qu') and ''x'' (pronounced 'ks' without an initial vowel) may optionally be spelled with ''kw'' and ''ks'', respectively. Each letter is always spoken in the same way, except that final ''h'' is silent in a few borrowed words like pasha''h'', mufti''h'', kadi''h'', papa''h'', mama''h''.

===Spelling===
All words are written with initial small letters (minuscules), except for proper nouns and the first word of a sentence.

===Stress===
Words ending in a vowel have a stress accent on the second-last syllable. Words ending in a consonant have a stress accent on the last syllable.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
|+ '''Examples:'''

|-
| kem'''i'''o || chemistry
|-
| f'''o'''lyo || leaf
|-----
| gard'''e'''n || garden
|-
| am'''i'''k || friend
|}

The plural '''-s''' or '''-os''' does not affect the stress accent.

|-
| l'''i'''bros || books
|-
| gard'''e'''nos || gardens
|-
| am'''i'''kos || friends
|}

In the combinations '''uo''', '''au''' and '''eu''', the vowels are to be pronounced separately, not as [[diphthong]]s. Nevertheless, the stress accent does not fall on the '''u''' in such vowel combinations.

==Grammar==

The articles are invariable:
*  lo (the) : lo frato, lo soro, lo arbro --&gt; l'arbro
*  un (a/an) :    un arbro

Adjectives end in ''a'' and are invariable:
*  un bona soro, un bona frato, lo bona fratos (no ''s'' added to ''lo'', nor to ''bona'')

Adverbs end in ''e'' and are invariable:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4094">The '''ω-regular languages''' are a class of [[omega language|&amp;omega;-languages]] that generalize the definition of [[regular language]]s to infinite words. [[Julius Richard Büchi|Büchi]] showed in 1962 that ω-regular languages are precisely the ones definable in a particular monadic [[second-order logic]] called S1S.

== Formal definition ==
An ω-language L is ω-regular if it has the form

* ''A''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; where A is a nonempty regular language not containing the empty string
* ''AB'', the concatenation of a regular language ''A'' and an ω-regular language ''B'' (Note that ''BA'' is ''not'' well-defined)
* ''A''∪''B'' where ''A'' and ''B'' are ω-regular languages (this rule can only be applied finitely many times)

The elements of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; are obtained by concatenating  words from ''A'' infinitely many times.
Note that if ''A'' is regular, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; is not necessarily ω-regular, since ''A'' could be {ε}, the set containing only the [[empty string]], in which case ''A''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;=''A'', which is not an ω-language and therefore not an ω-regular language.

== Equivalence to Büchi automaton==

'''Theorem''':'' An ω-language is recognized by a [[Büchi automaton]] if and only if it is an ω-regular language.''

'''Proof''': Every ω-regular language is recognized by a nondeterministic [[Büchi automaton]]; the translation is constructive. Using the [[Büchi automata#Closure properties|closure properties of Büchi automata]] and structural induction over the definition of ω-regular language, it can be easily shown that a Büchi automaton can be constructed for any given ω-regular language.

Conversely, for a given Büchi automaton ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''Q'',Σ,Δ,''I'',''F''), we construct an ω-regular language and then we will show that this language is recognized by ''A''. For an ω-word ''w''=a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...&amp;nbsp;, let ''w''(i,j) be the finite segment a&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,a&lt;sub&gt;j-1&lt;/sub&gt;,a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; of ''w''.
For every q,q'∈ Q, we define a [[regular language]] ''L&lt;sub&gt;q,q'&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is accepted by the finite automaton (''Q'',Σ,Δ,q,{q'}). 
:'''Lemma:''' We claim that Büchi automaton ''A'' recognizes language ⋃&lt;sub&gt;q∈''I'',q'∈''F''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''L&lt;sub&gt;q,q'&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;(''L&lt;sub&gt;q',q'&lt;/sub&gt;'' -&amp;nbsp;{ε}&amp;nbsp;)&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;.
:'''Proof:''' Let's suppose word ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L(A)'' and q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... is an accepting run of ''A'' on ''w''. Therefore, q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is in ''I'' and there must be a state q' in ''F'' such that q' occurs infinitely often in the accepting run. Let's pick the increasing infinite sequence of indexes i&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... such that, for all k≥0, q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is q'. Therefore, ''w''(0,i&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)∈''L&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,q'&lt;/sub&gt;'' and, for all k≥0, ''w''(i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,i&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;)∈''L&lt;sub&gt;q',q'&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;. Therefore, ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,q'&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;(''L&lt;sub&gt;q',q'&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;)&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;.
:Now, suppose ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L&lt;sub&gt;q,q'&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;(''L&lt;sub&gt;q',q'&lt;/sub&gt;'' -&amp;nbsp;{ε}&amp;nbsp;)&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; for some q∈''I'' and q'∈''F''. Therefore, there is an infinite and strictly increasing sequence i&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... such that ''w''(0,i&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L&lt;sub&gt;q,q'&lt;/sub&gt;'' and, for all k≥0,''w''(i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,i&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;)∈''L&lt;sub&gt;q',q'&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;. By definition of ''L&lt;sub&gt;q,q'&lt;/sub&gt;'', there is a finite run of A from q to q' on word ''w''(0,i&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). For all k≥0, there is a finite run of A from q' to q' on word ''w''(i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,i&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;). By this construction, there is a run of ''A'', which starts from q and in which q' occurs infinitely often. Hence, ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L(A)''.

'''Oskar Braaten''' (25 November 1881 – 17 July 1939) was a Norwegian [[novelist]] and [[playwright]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Oskar_Braaten ''Oskar Braaten'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Oskar Alexander Braaten was  born in [[Sagene]], a borough of the city of [[Oslo]]. Sagene was one of Norway's oldest industrial areas dating to the mid-19th century. Oskar Braaten attended school in Sagene until he was 15 years old.  In 1899, he was hired by [[antiquarian]] bookstore Bertrand Jensen, where he remained until 1910.

Though born and raised in Oslo, Braaten joined the mostly rural [[nynorsk|landsmål]]-movement.
Braaten is best known for his popular plays and novels depicting the life of factory workers  alongside [[Akerselva]] in Oslo.  He published seven novels between 1917 and 1925. Braaten convey a new image of the Oslo not seen before in literature. Braaten was able to provide  vivid and richly nuanced images of working-class life on the east side of Oslo during a historical period of industrialization. Criticism of injustice and inequality arises, but there is relatively little political tendency in his literary works. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/kontekst/7105.html ''Oskar Braaten'' (Dagbladet)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011129223254/http://www.dagbladet.no/kontekst/7105.html |date=2001-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as an advisor and theater manager at the  [[Det Norske Teatret]] in Oslo from its start in 1915 until his death. He was a consultant for the theater 1915-25, served as its theater director (''Teatersjef'') from 1934 to 1936 and dramatic performance manager from 1937 until his death. He was editor of ''For Bygd og By'' in 1912 and co-editor of the ''St. Hallvard'' from 1933. Braaten was the chairman of the Norwegian writer association (''Den norske forfatterforening'') at the end of 1921/22 and again 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Oskar_Braaten/utdypning ''Oskar Braaten'' (Hans H. Skei. Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Det_Norske_Teatret ''Det Norske Teatret'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Oskar Braaten and Nanna Thorvaldsen were married in 1910. Oskar and Nanna had a son Bjorn in 1912, daughter Berit in 1918. In 1921, the family moved to [[Ullevål Hageby]], a residential area in the [[Nordre Aker]] borough of Oslo.

An '''outtake''' is a portion of a work (usually a [[film]] or [[music]] [[Video recording|recording]]) that is removed in the [[editing]] process and not included in the work's final, publicly released version. In the digital era, significant outtakes have been appended to [[CD]] and [[DVD]] [[reissue]]s of many [[album]]s and films as [[bonus track]]s or features, in film often, but not always, for the sake of humor. In terms of photos, an outtake may also mean the ones which are not released in the original set of photos (i.e. photo shoots and digitals).

==Film==
An outtake is any [[take]] of a movie or a [[television program]] that is removed or otherwise not used in the final cut. Some of these takes are humorous mistakes made in the process of filming (commonly known to American audiences as [[blooper]]s). Multiple takes of each shot are always taken, for safety. Due to this, the number of outtakes a film has will always vastly outnumber the takes included in the edited, finished product.

An outtake may also be a complete version of a recording that is dropped in favor of another version.

Often outtakes can be found as special features on [[DVD]]s. Outtakes can also be found playing over credits at the end of a film or TV program. Well known examples of this are [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Pixar]] movies, almost all of which play outtakes at the end of the movie. Pixar films, being computer-generated, do not feature "real" outtakes, but rather staged ones in which the animation features "mistakes."

Outtakes may also enter [[stock footage]] libraries and appear in future productions. For example, ''[[Don't Tell Everything]]'' (1921) started as an outtake from ''[[The Affairs of Anatol]]'' (1921) and was then expanded with additional footage.&lt;ref name="silentera"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/D/DontTellEverything1921.html |title=Progressive Silent Film List: ''Don't Tell Everything'' |accessdate=2009-07-05|work=Silent Era}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally considered that the inclusion of outtakes in a film's finished product started with ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'' (1978), helmed by stunt-man-turned-director [[Hal Needham]] and starring [[Burt Reynolds]]. Needham decided to include outtakes in the film's end credit scrawl to highlight alternate camera angles for the impressive stunts performed for the movie. Needham also interspersed comedic outtakes of the actors as well.

The inclusion was so successful with fans that Needham continued to insert comedic outtakes in his future directorial efforts such as ''[[Smokey &amp; The Bandit 2]]'' (1980), ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981), ''[[Stroker Ace]]'' (1983) and ''[[Cannonball Run 2]]'' (1984).

===Criticism===
Film critic [[Gene Siskel]] has been critical of outtakes being played over a film's credits, saying of the film ''[[Liar Liar]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMJLU_KAxDU YouTube clip] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626043657/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMJLU_KAxDU |date=June 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This picture ends over the credits with outtakes. I hate that. I don't even care if they're funny, I still hate it because to me it's almost like an act of desperation from the filmmakers saying "Well we're not sure if we made a funny picture, but we're gonna throw this stuff in and we'll leave you laughing on the way out."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Television==
The British programme ''[[It'll be Alright on the Night]]'', has been running on ITV since 1977 featuring outtakes. The BBC's answer to this was ''[[Auntie's Bloomers]]'', eventually replaced by ''[[Outtake TV]]''. Prior to these series, production errors were rarely seen for pre-recorded programmes, since these were edited out before transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagedissectors.com/article/77 Image Dissectors - TV Trends: Conspicuous cameras]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, it is common to see outtakes at the end of films, or compiled into programmes like these.

==Music==
Just like a movie outtake, music outtakes are recordings that are not used in a final version of an album.  Collections of this sort of material are often compiled and distributed illegally by fans, and known as a [[bootleg recording|bootlegged recording]].  Sometimes, artists release collections of outtakes, sometimes grouped with other rarities such as [[demo (music)|demos]] and unreleased [[song]]s.

Occasionally collections of outtakes become recognized as part of an artist's major creative output, especially in cases where an artist is unusually prolific or dies young. One example would be ''[[The Lillywhite Sessions]]'' by [[Dave Matthews Band]], an album that was considered unfinished and not ready to be distributed, yet is widely considered part of the discography of the band by their fans. An example of the former is the eleven-volume ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961-1991|Bootleg Series]]'' from [[Bob Dylan]], which contains many important Dylan songs omitted from his albums, some of which were made famous by other artists. An example of the latter is the CD ''[[Time of No Reply]]'' by [[Nick Drake]], a British [[singer-songwriter]] who died almost unknown at the age of 26 in 1974, but whose music became highly influential on other artists in subsequent decades.

==Video games==
In a similar vein as a music outtake, video game outtakes are elements (characters, levels, items, cutscenes, etc.) that weren't used in a game's final version. These can be unlocked via hacking or officially through [[game demo|demos]].

Examples include ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'', whose notable abandoned level "Stormy Ascent" can be unlocked through hacking. Similarly, [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], Silver the Hedgehog, Cream the Rabbit, Jet the Hawk, Espio the Chameleon, Big the Cat and a Goomba can be unlocked via hacking on ''[[Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6806">The term '''phrase structure grammar''' was originally introduced by [[Noam Chomsky]] as the term for [[formal grammar|grammar]] studied previously by [[Emil Post]] and [[Axel Thue]] ([[Post canonical system]]s). Some authors, however, reserve the term for more restricted grammars in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]]: [[context-sensitive grammar]]s or [[context-free grammar]]s. In a broader sense, phrase structure grammars are also known as ''constituency grammars''. The defining trait of phrase structure grammars is thus their adherence to the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation of [[dependency grammar]]s.

==Constituency relation==
In [[linguistics]], phrase structure grammars are all those grammars that are based on the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation associated with dependency grammars; hence, phrase structure grammars are also known as constituency grammars.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (1981:71ff.) provides an insightful discussion of the distinction between constituency- and dependency-based grammars. See also Allerton (1979:238f.), McCawley (1988:13), Mel'cuk (1988:12-14), Borsley (1991:30f.), Sag and Wasow (1999:421f.), van Valin (2001:86ff.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Any of several related theories for the [[parsing of natural language]] qualify as constituency grammars, and most of them have been developed from Chomsky's work, including

::* [[Government and binding theory]],
::* [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]],
::* [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]],
::* [[Lexical functional grammar]],
::* the [[minimalist program]], and
::* [[Nanosyntax]].

Further grammar frameworks and formalisms also qualify as constituency-based, although they may not think of themselves as having spawned from Chomsky's work, e.g.

::* [[Arc pair grammar]], and
::* [[Categorial grammar]].

The fundamental trait that these frameworks all share is that they view sentence structure in terms of the constituency relation. The constituency relation derives from the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] division of Latin and Greek grammars{{fact|date=May 2017}} that is based on [[term logic]] and reaches back to [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bobzien|first1=Susanne|title=Ancient Logic|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/logic-ancient/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in antiquity. Basic [[clause]] structure is understood in terms of a binary division of the clause into [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] ([[noun phrase]] NP) and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] ([[verb phrase]] VP).

The binary division of the clause results in a one-to-one-or-more correspondence. For each element in a sentence, there are one or more nodes in the tree structure that one assumes for that sentence. A two word sentence such as ''Luke laughed'' necessarily implies three (or more) nodes in the syntactic structure: one for the noun ''Luke'' (subject NP), one for the verb ''laughed'' (predicate VP), and one for the entirety ''Luke laughed'' (sentence S). The constituency grammars listed above all view sentence structure in terms of this one-to-one-or-more correspondence.

::[[File:Thistreeisillustratingtherelation(PSG).png|Constituency and dependency relations]]

==Dependency relation==
By the time of [[Gottlob Frege]], a competing understanding of the logic of sentences had arisen. Frege rejected the binary division of the sentence and replaced it with an understanding of sentence logic in terms of predicates and their arguments. On this alternative conception of sentence logic, the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate was not possible. It therefore opened the door to the dependency relation (although the dependency relation had also existed in a less obvious form in traditional grammars long before Frege). The dependency relation was first acknowledged concretely and developed as the basis for a comprehensive theory of syntax and grammar by [[Lucien Tesnière]] in his posthumously published work ''Éléments de syntaxe structurale'' (Elements of Structural Syntax).&lt;ref&gt;See Tesnière (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

The dependency relation is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (word or morph) in a sentence, there is just one node in the syntactic structure. The distinction is thus a [[graph theory|graph-theoretical]] distinction. The dependency relation restricts the number of nodes in the syntactic structure of a sentence to the exact number of syntactic units (usually words) that that sentence contains. Thus the two word sentence ''Luke laughed'' implies just two syntactic nodes, one for ''Luke'' and one for ''laughed''. Some prominent dependency grammars are listed here:

::* [[Recursive categorical syntax]], sometimes called ''algebraic syntax''
::* [[Functional generative description]]
::* [[Lexicase]]
::* [[Link grammar]]
::* [[Meaning-text theory]]
::* [[Operator grammar]]
::* [[Word grammar]]

Since these grammars are all based on the dependency relation, they are by definition NOT phrase structure grammars.

==Non-descript grammars==
Other grammars generally avoid attempts to group syntactic units into clusters in a manner that would allow classification in terms of the constituency vs. dependency distinction. In this respect, the following grammar frameworks do not come down solidly on either side of the dividing line:

::* [[Construction grammar]]
::* [[Cognitive grammar]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4900">A traditional '''production board''', '''stripboard''', or '''production strip''' is a [[filmmaking]] term for a cardboard or wooden chart displaying color-coded strips of paper, each containing information about a scene in the film's [[shooting script]]. The strips can then be rearranged and laid out sequentially to represent the order one wants to film in, providing a schedule that can be used to plan the production. This is done because most films are shot "out of sequence," meaning that they do not necessarily begin with the first scene and end with the last. For logistical purposes, scenes are often grouped by [[Cast member|talent]] or [[Filming location|location]] and are arranged to accommodate the schedules of [[Cast member|cast]] and [[Film crew|crew]]. A production board is not to be confused with a [[Stripboard]] used for electronics prototyping.

A modern version of a strip board will commonly be printed using dedicated computer software, such as MovieMagic Scheduling, [[Celtx]], or [[Scenechronize]], or by customizing general purpose software such as [[OpenOffice.org Calc]] or [[Microsoft Excel]].

==Common Contents==
Information on the strips can include
* The scene number
* The [[time of day#Colloquial|day]] (Sunrise/Morning/Noon/Afternoon/Evening/Sunset/Night)
* The number of pages in that scene

==Color Conventions==
Production strip boards are often color-coded according to the following convention:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singleton |first=Ralph |date=1991 |title=Film Scheduling |chapter=4 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">A '''rare species''' is a group of [[organisms]] that are very uncommon, scarce, or infrequently encountered. This designation may be applied to either a plant or animal [[taxon]], and is distinct from the term ''[[endangered species|endangered]]'' or ''[[threatened species|threatened]].'' Designation of a rare species may be made by an official body, such as a national government, state, or province. The term more commonly appears without reference to specific criteria. The [[IUCN]] does not normally make such designations, but may use the term in scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/assessment-process|title=Assessment Process|website=www.iucnredlist.org|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rarity rests on a specific species being represented by a small number of organisms worldwide, usually fewer than 10,000. However, a species having a very narrow [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] range or [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitat]] also influences the concept.&lt;ref&gt;R.MacNally and G.W.Brown, ''[[Reptile]]s and Habitat Fragmentation in the Box-ironbush Forests of Central Victoria, [[Australia]]: Predicting Compositional Change and Faunal Nested-ness'', [[Oecologia]] 128:116-125 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prendergast|first=J.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature uses the term "rare" as a designation for species found in isolated geographical locations. They are not endangered but classified as "at risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/rare-species|title=Rare Species - Dictionary definition of Rare Species {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/node/29228|title=IUCN - A brief history|date=2017-10-06|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A species may be endangered or vulnerable, but not considered rare if it has a large, dispersed population. Rare species are generally considered threatened because a [[small population size]] is more likely to not recover from [[Environmental disaster|ecological disasters]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Rare species are species with small populations. Many move into the endangered or vulnerable category if the negative factors affecting them continue to operate. Examples of rare species include the [[Himalayan brown bear]], [[Fennec fox]], [[Wild Asiatic buffalo]] and [[Hornbill]].

A rare plant's legal status can be observed through the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]'s Plants Database.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1438">A '''revolution from above''' refers to major political and social changes that are imposed by an [[elite]] on the population it dominates. It usually occurs in urban areas in the capital city. By contrast, the plain term [[revolution]] suggests that pressure from below is a major driving force in events, even if other social groups cooperate with—or ultimately capture—the movement. The phrase was coined by the Spanish writer [[Joaquín Costa]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''The Franco Regime'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a "revolution from below" refers to a [[grassroots]] campaign against elites.

==Some examples==
* [[Enlightened Despotism]] in 18th-century Europe
* The [[Constitution of the German Confederation 1871]] and the formation of the [[German Empire]]
* [[Fascism]]
* [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivization]] of agriculture
* [[De-Stalinization]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]]
* [[German Reunification]]
* [[White Revolution]] in [[Iran]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20053">The [[Romani language]] has for most of its history been an entirely oral language, with no written form in common use. Although the first example of written Romani dates from 1542,&lt;ref name="mat2002"&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Matras-2002 | reference= Matras, Yaron (2002). ''Romani: A Linguistic Introduction'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-02330-0}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not until the twentieth century that vernacular writing by native [[Romani people]] arose.

Printed anthologies of Romani folktales and poems began in the 20th century in Eastern Europe, using the respective national scripts (Latin or Cyrillic).&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web

Written Romani in the 20th century used the writing systems of their respective host societies, mostly [[Latin script|Latin alphabets]] ([[Romanian alphabet|Romanian]], [[Czech alphabet|Czech]], [[Croatian alphabet|Croatian]], etc.).

== Standardization ==
Currently there is no one single standard orthography used by both scholars and native speakers. Efforts of language planners have been hampered by the significant dialectal divisions in Romani: the absence of a standard phonology in turn makes the selection of a single written form problematic.

In an effort to overcome this, during the 1980s and 1990s [[Marcel Courthiade]] proposed a model for orthographic unification based on the adoption of a meta-phonological orthography, which "would allow dialectal variation to be accommodated at the phonological and morpho-phonological level".&lt;ref name="mat2002"/&gt; This system was presented to the [[International Romani Union]] in 1990, who adopted it as the organization's "official alphabet". This recognition by the International Romani Union allowed Courthiade's system to qualify for funding from the [[European Commission]].

Despite being used in several publications, such as the grammar of Romani compiled by Gheorghe Sarău&lt;ref&gt;Sarău, Gheorghe (1994) ''Limba Romani: Manual pentru Clasele de Invățători Romi ale Școlilor Normale'' Bucharest: Editura Didactică și Pedagogică&lt;/ref&gt; and the Polish publication ''Informaciaqo lil'',&lt;ref name="han"&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Hancock-1995 | reference= Hancock, Ian (1995). ''A Handbook of Vlax Romani'', Columbus: Slavica Publishers. {{ISBN|0-89357-258-6}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the IRU standard has yet to find a broad base of support from Romani writers. One reason for the reluctance to adopt this standard, according to Canadian Rom Ronald Lee, is that the proposed orthography contains a number of specialised characters not regularly found on European keyboards, such as '''θ''' and '''ʒ'''.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Lee-2005 | reference= Lee, Ronald (2005). ''Learn Romani: Das-dúma Rromanes'', Hatfield: University of Hertfordshire Press. {{ISBN|1-902806-44-1}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the most common pattern among native speakers is for individual authors to use an orthography based on the writing system of the dominant contact language: thus [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in [[Romania]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] in [[Hungary]] and so on. A currently observable trend, however, appears to be the adoption of a loosely English-oriented orthography, developed spontaneously by native speakers for use online and through email.&lt;ref name="mat2002"/&gt;

Descriptive [[linguistics]] has, however, a long and established tradition of transcription.&lt;ref name="mat2002"/&gt; Despite small differences between individual linguists in the representation of certain [[phonemes]], most adhere to a system which Hancock terms ''Pan-Vlax''.&lt;ref name="han"/&gt;

== Latin script ==

The overwhelming majority of academic and non-academic literature produced currently in Romani is written using a Latin-based orthography.&lt;ref name="mat2002"/&gt; There are three main systems which are likely to be encountered: the ''Pan-Vlax'' system, the ''International Standard'' and various Anglicised systems.&lt;ref name="han"/&gt;

=== Pan-Vlax ===

In most recent descriptive literature, a variety of the orthography which [[Ian Hancock]] terms ''Pan-Vlax'' will likely be used.&lt;ref name="han"/&gt; This orthography is not a single standardised form, but rather a set of orthographical practices which exhibit a basic "core" of shared graphemes and a small amount of divergence in several areas. The Pan-Vlax script is based on the Latin script, augmented by the addition of several [[diacritic]]s common to the languages of eastern Europe, such as the [[caron]].

In the following table, the most common variants of the graphemes are shown. The phonemes used in the table are somewhat arbitrary and are not specifically based on any one current dialect (for example, the phoneme denoted {{IPA|/dʒ/}} in the table can be realised as {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, {{IPA|/ʐ/}} or {{IPA|/ɟ/}}, depending on dialect):

{{PanVlaxAlphabet}}

The use of the above graphemes is relatively stable and universal, taking into account dialectal mergers and so on. However, in certain areas there is somewhat more variation. A typically diverse area is in the representation of sounds not present in most varieties of Romani. For example, the centralised vowel phonemes of several varieties of Vlax and Xaladitka, when they are indicated separately from the non-centralised vowels, can be represented using '''ə''', '''ъ''' or '''ă'''.&lt;ref name="han"/&gt; Another particularly variant area is the representation of [[palatal|palatalised consonants]], which are absent from a number of dialects. Some variant graphemes for {{IPA|/tʲ/}} include '''tj''', '''ty''', '''ć''', '''čj''' and '''t᾿'''.&lt;ref name="mat2002"/&gt; Finally, the representation of the phoneme {{IPA|/ɻ/}} (the reflex of the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] [[retroflex]] series{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}), which in several dialects has been merged with {{IPA|/r/}}, tends to vary between '''rr''', '''ř''' and '''rh''', and sometimes even '''gh''', with the first two being the most frequently found variants.&lt;ref name="han"/&gt;

=== International Standard ===

The ''International Standard'' orthography, as devised by Marcel Courthiade and adopted by the International Romani Union, uses similar conventions to the Pan-Vlax system outlined above. Several of the differences are simply graphical, such as replacing [[caron]]s with [[acute accent]]s, transforming '''č š ž''' into '''ć ś ź'''. However, its most distinctive feature is the use of "meta-notations", which are intended to cover cross-dialectal phonological variation, particularly in degrees of palatalisation; and "morpho-graphs", which are used to represent the morphophonological alternation of case suffixes &lt;ref&gt;Whether these endings are to be analysed as postpositions or case endings is still a matter of debate in Romani linguistics. See, for example, [[#Reference-Hancock-1995|Hancock (1995)]] and [[#Reference-Matras-2002|Matras (2002)]] for varying approaches.&lt;/ref&gt; in different phonological environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Matras-1999 | reference= Matras, Yaron (1999). Writing Romani: The pragmatics of codification in a stateless language. ''Applied Linguistics'', vol. 20, pp 481-502.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three "morpho-graphs" are '''ç''', '''q''' and '''θ''', which are used to represent the initial phonemes of a number of case suffixes, which are realised {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} after a [[vowel]] and {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} after a [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]]. The three "meta-notations" are '''ʒ''', '''ŏ''' and '''ă''', the realisation of which varies by dialect. The latter two, for example, are pronounced {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} in [[Lovaricka]], but {{IPA|/jo/}} and {{IPA|/ja/}} in [[Kalderash]].&lt;ref name="han"/&gt;

=== Anglicised ===

The English-based orthography commonly used in North America is, to a degree, an accommodation of the Pan-Vlax orthography to English-language keyboards, replacing those graphemes with diacritics with digraphs, such as the substitution of '''ts ch sh zh''' for '''c č š ž'''.&lt;ref name="han"/&gt; This particular orthography seems to have arisen spontaneously as Romani speakers have communicated using email, a medium in which graphemes outside the [[Latin-1]] [[charset]] have until recently been difficult to type.&lt;ref name="mat2002"/&gt; In addition, it is this orthography which is recommended for use by Romani scholar and activist [[Ronald Lee]].&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;

===Romani in Macedonia===
Romani in Macedonia is written with the following alphabet:&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/e-ucebnici/docs/jazik_i_kultura_na_romite_3?mode=embed&amp;layout=http://e-ucebnici.mk/issuu/theme/layout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true I čhib thaj i kultura e Romengiri], eucebnici.mk&lt;/ref&gt;

This alphabet is used in the educational system in Macedonia for Romani-speaking students.

==Greek script==
In [[Greece]], for instance, Romani is mostly written with the Greek alphabet (although very little seems to be written in Romani in Greece).

==Arabic script==
The Arabic script has also been used, for example, in [[Iran]]. More importantly, the first periodical produced by Roma for Roma was printed in the Arabic script in the 1920s in [[Edirne]] in [[Turkey]]. It was called "Laćo" which means "good".&lt;ref&gt;P. Bakker, K. Kyuchukov, ''What is the Romani language ?'', p. 90, Centre de Recherches Tsiganes, University of Hertfordshire Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-902806-06-9}}

'''Saam''',  ''Saama Kha'', is a nearly extinct [[Kiranti languages|Kiranti]] language spoken in [[Nepal]]. The name ''Saam'' is ambiguous, and shared with neighboring languages.

[[Chukwa language|Chukwa]] may be Saam if it is not Kulung.

==Geographical distribution==
Saam is spoken in the following locations of Nepal (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

*[[Dobhane]] and [[Khatamma]] (Khartangma) VDC's, northern [[Bhojpur District, Nepal|Bhojpur District]], [[Kosi Zone]]; straddling the Irkhuwa River, in Dangmaya, Okharbote, Khartangma, and Dobhane settlements between the [[Phedi River]] and [[Irkhuwa River]]

[[File:Ed Grey.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon (1862–1933)]]
"'''The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our life-time'''", [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] remarked to a friend on the eve of [[History of the United Kingdom during World War I#Government|the United Kingdom's entry into the First World War]]. First published in Grey's memoirs in 1925, the statement earned wide attention as a correct perception of the [[First World War]] and its geopolitical and cultural consequences.

==Original sources==

Grey's memoirs ''Twenty-Five Years 1892–1916'' mention the remark as taking place on 3 August 1914: 
{{quote|A friend came to see me on one of the evenings of the last week — he thinks it was on Monday, August 3rd. We were standing at a window of my room in the Foreign Office. It was getting dusk, and the lamps were being lit in the space below on which we were looking. My friend recalls that I remarked on this with the words: "The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our life-time."&lt;ref&gt;Viscount Grey of Fallodon: ''Twenty-Five Years 1892–1916'' (New York, 1925) [https://books.google.com/books?id=d68gSzbih8QC&amp;q=%22lamps+are%22 p. 20 books.google].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1927, [[John Alfred Spender]], editor of the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'' until 1922, identified himself as the friend to whom Grey had spoken: 
{{quote|I had two short talks with Grey during the "twelve days."&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/historyoftwelved00inhead&lt;/ref&gt; I ran into him on the stairs of the Foreign Office on Saturday, August 1st [...] I saw him again late in the evening at his room at the Foreign Office on Monday, August 3rd, and it was to me he used the words which he has repeated in his book, "The lamps are going out all over Europe, and we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime." We were standing together at the window looking out into the sunset across St. James's Park, and the appearance  of the first lights along the Mall suggested the thought.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Spender, "Life, Journalism and Politics", Vol. 2. Frederick A. Stokes Company, New York 1927. Chapter 20, [https://archive.org/stream/lifejournalismpo02jasprich#page/14/mode/2up p. 14-15 archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Later allusions==
Grey's quotation has been used as a summation of the war in numerous historical works. The German author [[Ludwig Reiners]] (1896–1957) published an account of World War I entitled ''The lamps went out in Europe''. Therein Grey's comment is followed by the assertion attributed to [[Otto von Bismarck]]: "The mistakes that have been committed in foreign policy are not, as a rule, apparent to the public until a generation afterwards."&lt;ref&gt;Reiners, L. ''The lamps went out in Europe'', (London, 1955), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VcrRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=generation p. 5 books.google]. Translated from the German by [[Richard and Clara Winston]]. ''In Europa gehen die Lichter aus. Der Untergang des Wilhelminischen Reiches''. Munich 1954.&lt;br /&gt;
Bismarck's memoirs contain the following: "Concerning the blunders which had been made in our foreign policy public opinion is, as a rule, first enlightened when it is in a position to look back upon the history of a generation, and the ''Achivi qui plectuntur'' are not always immediately contemporary with the mistaken actions." ''The Kaiser vs. Bismarck. Suppressed Letters by the Kaiser and New Chapters from the Autobiography of the Iron Chancellor.'' Translated by [[Bernard Miall]]. Harper New York &amp; London 1921,  [https://archive.org/stream/kaiservsbismarck00bismuoft#page/n223 p. 183 archive.org]&lt;br /&gt;
"Ueber die Fehler, welche in der auswärtigen Politik begangen wurden, wird sich die öffentliche Meinung in der Regel erst klar, wenn sie auf die Geschichte eines Menschenalters zurückzublicken im Stande ist, und die Achivi qui plectuntur sind nicht immer die unmittelbaren Zeitgenossen der fehlerhaften Handlungen." Otto von Bismarck: ''Gedanken und Erinnerungen'' [http://www.zeno.org/nid/20002732971 chapter 12 zeno.org]&lt;br /&gt;
''Achivi qui plectuntur'' refers to the proverbial verse "Quidquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi" from [[Epistles (Horace)|Horace's Epistles]] [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Epistulae_(Horatius)_-_Liber_I Liber I Epistula II la.wikisource]: Whatever their kings are raging the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] have to pay for.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Hynes began his 1990 ''A War Imagined'' with a paragraph covering the quotation, referring to it as the best-known and most often quoted response to the beginning of the war.&lt;ref name="Hynes"&gt;Hynes, S. ''A War Imagined, The First World War and English Culture'', (London, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;id=8ckmmHjt6h4C&amp;q=lamps p. 3 books.google.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Grey's words were the inspiration for part of the British commemoration of the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. Between 10 and 11 pm on 4 August 2014, lights were dimmed at many public locations and in private homes, including progressively at [[Centenary of the outbreak of World War I#Westminster Abbey|a national memorial service]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 August 2014 and other newspapers&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World War II]] song "[[When the Lights Go On Again]]" was written as a direct counterpart.

In the 1963 [[Theatre Workshop]] play ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!]]'' the lines are given to an unnamed Englishman. In the [[Oh! What a Lovely War|1969 film adaptation]] they are spoken by the character of Grey, portrayed by [[Ralph Richardson]].

In the ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'' Series Three finale "The Sudden Storm", which concerns the beginning of the First World War, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP Richard Bellamy ([[David Langton]]) tells his daughter-in-law Hazel Bellamy ([[Meg Wynn Owen]]) that he was in Grey's presence when he said it the previous day (3 August 1914).

The quote is sometimes referenced in discussions of current events.  For instance, ''[[The Nation]]'' asked "Are the lights going out all over Nigeria{{sic}}?" in response to the [[2010 Nigerien coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/web2/articles/33639/1/Are-the-lights-going-out-all-over-Nigeria/Page1.html|title=Are the lights going out all over Nigeria?|date=24 January 2010|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]]'s song "When The Lights Go Out All Over Europe," from the ''Promenade'' album (1994), is a paean to the cinema stars of the 1940s and '50s.

In the final episode  of the third series of ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look]]'', a sketch depicts the show closing down due to lack of funds (because the show was illegally pirated). At the end of the sketch David Mitchell (in character as himself) declares tearfully "The lights are going out all over television, we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime!"

On October 16, 1938, [[Winston Churchill]] broadcast a speech known as "The Defence of Freedom and Peace (The Lights are Going Out)" to London and the United States.  In the speech he says, "The stations of uncensored expression are closing down; the lights are going out; but there is still time for those to whom freedom and parliamentary government mean something, to consult together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Churchill|first1=Winston|title=The Defence of Freedom and Peace (The Lights are Going Out)|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/524-the-defence-of-freedom-and-peace|publisher=The International Churchill Society|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Fritz Leiber]] short parallel worlds story "[[Catch That Zeppelin!]]" (1975), which received the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]] and the [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story]] in 1976, the protagonist hears the words in his head, "The lights of Europe are going out, I do not think they will be rekindled in my generation —".  He hears this as he is ejected from a parallel world that does not have many of the wars and injustices of the 20th century and returns to our world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20030">[[File:Barbearia.jpg|thumb|300px|''A barber shop in Brazil.'' The barber shop is an example of the '''third place'''; in many societies it has been a traditional area for (especially) men to congregate separate from work or home.]]
In [[community building]], the '''third place''' is the social surroundings separate from the two usual social environments of home ("first place") and the workplace ("second place").  Examples of third places would be environments such as churches, cafes, clubs, [[public library|public libraries]], or parks. In his influential book ''[[The Great Good Place (Oldenburg)|The Great Good Place]]'', [[Ray Oldenburg]] (1989, 1991) argues that third places are important for [[civil society]], [[democracy]], [[civic engagement]], and establishing feelings of a [[sense of place]].

[[Robert Putnam]] addressed issues related to third place in ''[[Bowling Alone|Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital]]'' (1995, 2000).

== Oldenburg's characteristics ==
Oldenburg calls one's "first place" the home and those that one lives with. The "second place" is the workplace — where people may actually spend most of their time. Third places, then, are "anchors" of community life and facilitate and foster broader, more creative interaction.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; In other words, "your third place is where you relax in public, where you encounter familiar faces and make new acquaintances."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Rebekah|date=July–August 2018|title=A third place|url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/a-third-place/|journal=New Zealand Geographic|volume=|issue=152|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars have summarized Oldenburg view of a third place with a similar eight characteristics:&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pete Myers|title=Going Home: Essays, Articles, and Stories in Honour of the Andersons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ja_1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-291-12167-4|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QuandtKröger2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thorsten Quandt|author2=Sonja Kröger|title=Multiplayer: The Social Aspects of Digital Gaming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zd_eAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|date=30 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-09219-2|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Neutral ground
*: Occupants of third places have little to no obligation to be there. They are not tied down to the area financially, politically, legally, or otherwise and are free to come and go as they please.

* Leveler (a leveling place)
*: Third places put no importance on an individual's status in a society. Someone's economic or social status do not matter in a third place, allowing for a sense of commonality among its occupants. There are no prerequisites or requirements that would prevent acceptance or participation in the third place.

* Conversation is main activity
*: Playful and happy conversation is the main focus of activity in third places, although it is not required to be the only activity. The tone of conversation is usually light hearted and humorous; wit and good natured playfulness are highly valued.

* Accessibility and accommodation
*: Third places must be open and readily accessible to those who occupy them. They must also be accommodating, meaning they provide the wants of their inhabitants, and all occupants feel their needs have been fulfilled.

* The regulars
*: Third places harbor a number of regulars that help give the space its tone, and help set the mood and characteristics of the area. Regulars to third places also attract newcomers, and are there to help someone new to the space feel welcome and accommodated.

* A low profile
*: Third places are characteristically wholesome. The inside of a third place is without extravagance or grandiosity, and has a homely feel. Third places are never snobby or pretentious, and are accepting of all types of individuals, from several different walks of life.

* The mood is playful
*: The tone of conversation in third places are never marked with tension or hostility. Instead, they have a playful nature, where witty conversation and frivolous banter are not only common, but highly valued.

* A home away from home
*: Occupants of third places will often have the same feelings of warmth, possession, and belonging as they would in their own homes. They feel a piece of themselves is rooted in the space, and gain spiritual regeneration by spending time there.

==Types of third places==
Jeffres et al. (2009) listed the following types of environments as possible third places, considered in their research: community centers, senior centers, coffee shops and cafes, bars and pubs, restaurants, shopping centers, stores, malls, markets, hair salons, barber and beauty shops, recreation centers, YM/WCA, pools, movie theaters,  churches, schools, colleges and universities, clubs and organizations, libraries, parks and other places allowing for outdoor recreation, streets, neighbors’ yards, homes and apartments, and events like neighborhood parties, block parties, cookouts, barbecues, town meetings, bingo, and various media (online, newsletters, newspapers, phone, bulletin boards).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Impact of Third Places on Community Quality of Life|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-009-9084-8|journal = Applied Research in the Quality of Life|date = 2009-10-13|access-date = 2015-04-15|issn = 1871-2584|pages = 333–345|volume = 4|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s11482-009-9084-8|first = Leo W.|last = Jeffres|first2 = Cheryl C.|last2 = Bracken|first3 = Guowei|last3 = Jian|first4 = Mary F.|last4 = Casey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a "third place" has become popularized and has been picked up by various small businesses, including as a name for various locally owned coffee shops, and is commonly cited in urban planning literature on the issue of community-oriented business development and [[public space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-community-builders/|title="Third places" as community builders|last=Diaz|first=Stuart M Butler and Carmen|date=2016-09-14|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gensleron.com/cities/2012/7/25/heyleave-my-third-place-alone.html|title=Hey…Leave my third place alone! - Urban Planning and Design - architecture and design|website=www.gensleron.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As "third place" becomes more popular, several [[coworking]] office spaces have embraced this concept as the basis of their interior design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasworkbase.com/|title=ATLAS Workbase|last=|first=|date=|website=ATLAS Workbase|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thirdspacecoworking.com/|title=Third Space Coworking|last=|first=|date=|website=Third Space|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.steelcase.com/research/articles/topics/employee-engagement/real-work/|title=Merging Third Places to Create a Positive Work Environment - Steelcase|date=2015-01-05|work=Steelcase|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variant forms of the concept include the "[[Coffeehouse|community coffee house]]" and the "community living room", a term which has been adopted by several organizations&lt;ref name="New Deal Cafe"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2002/05/new-deal-city|work=Mother Jones|title=New Deal City|author=Sue Halpern|issue=May 2002|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.takoma.com/archives/copy/2004/05/electricmaid.html|work=Takoma Voice|title=Talk of Takoma|issue=Takoma Park, Maryland, May 2005|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the model of a cooperatively-run "third space" which includes commercial or non-commercial functions with an emphasis on providing a [[Social center|free space]] for social interaction.

The [[general store]] or pub and occasionally [[bookstore]] or [[diner]] are traditional variants of the concept, provided in such cases there is an emphasis on expectation of socialization, and customers are invited to stay and "hang out" with or without making any (or additional) purchases.  Institutions which traditionally provided some functions of a third place included shared leisure facilities such as a [[bowling alley]] or [[video arcade|arcade]], [[function hall]]s, [[Fraternity|lodge]]s or [[social club]]s, when and if facilities were available for casual use.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

A church community fills this role for many people, including groups that focus on common interests and hobbies. Activities, events, and [[cell group]]s can build the connections that are necessary for authentic community.&lt;ref name="ThirdPlaceSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdplacesc.org |title=ThirdPlace |year=2012 |accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2014}}

=== Virtual third places===
Since Oldenburg’s writings, there are people in the computer and internet industry that have declared that third places are observed or shifting to the virtual world or virtual third places.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Soukup, [http://nms.sagepub.com/content/8/3/421.abstract Computer-mediated communication as a virtual third place: building Oldenburg’s great good places on the world wide web]&lt;/ref&gt;  This descriptive practice is easily adopted because of the similarities in descriptive characteristics found between the virtual and physical worlds.

In combination with the Industrial Revolution and as media transitioned from the public space to more comfortable roles inside one's home, there was a large shift away from public activities because they could be enjoyed within the confines of one’s home.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} With the advent of online technologies these virtual third places have been observed in online communities. The characteristics observed in these communities vary from their physical application but meet the context of personalization, permeability, approachability, and comfortability.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

With the increasing popularity of online multiplayer video games, individuals from across the world are becoming more connected with each other through these video games. The potential for social culture clashes is inherently high considering the large volume of interactions of users from different cultures. However, the online virtual communities constructed within these games share the same characteristics with traditional third places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinkuehler|first=Constance|author2=Dmitri Williams |title=Where Everybody Knows Your (Screen) Name: Online Games as ‘‘Third Places’’|journal=Computer-Mediated Communication|date=2006|volume=11|pages=885–909|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00300.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more prominent features of these communities is the social equalizing aspect. These games allow users to interact through their in-game character, or avatar, which serve as a medium for the player and removes the players's social identifiers. Avatars often interact via built-in text chat systems, allowing users to communicate without revealing their identity through their voice. Therefore, any type of social identification is dependent upon the avatar, not the actual player.

While these online communities provide freedom from traditional social status, that is not to say there are no social hierarchies within the games; each game community constructs their own social norms that determine in-game social status. However, each player begins the game at an equal footing and must achieve social recognition through their in-game accomplishments. The concept of "regulars" within third spaces is also prominent in online gaming communities. These regulars are often identifiable through some type of special identifier; some games include special insignia or titles for accomplished users, making these users stand out to all users. The regulars set standards for accepted in-game behavior, serving as a type of social moderator (especially for new players). For instance, many of these games offer the opportunity for PvP (player vs player) combat, in which users battle against each other. However, this creates an opportunity for users to "grief" one another, which is intentional harassment meant to disrupt gameplay for other users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Victoria|author2=Sarah Camm |title=Deception in video games: examining varieties of griefing|journal=Online Information Review|volume=37|issue=3|pages=369–387|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1468-4527&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=3&amp;articleid=17092384&amp;show=html|doi=10.1108/oir-10-2011-0181}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of behavior is often kept in check by the community regulars. "Regular" status is attainable for all users, which furthers the sense of community within the game. As users play more, they are accepted into the community by fellow regulars, forming new social bonds.

As online technologies advance, these online video games become more accessible to individuals across all backgrounds. While these games are often played on traditional video game consoles or on PCs (which often requires purchasing the video game software), there are many internet browser based games (such as ''[[RuneScape]]'' and ''[[Farmville]]'') that allow anyone with internet access to play for free. This widens the variety of individuals that are entering into the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Xiao|last2=Cao|first2=Shinan|last3=Shen|first3=Zhesi|last4=Zhang|first4=Boyu|last5=Wang|first5=Wen-Xu|last6=Cressman|first6=Ross|last7=Stanley|first7=H.

An increasing percentage of [[United States|American]] workers now [[telecommute]], not from home, but from a third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2006-10-04-third-space_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Third place office space | date=2006-10-05 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers cite isolation when telecommuting from home and find working in public spaces a happy medium between the home office and the corporate office.  Availability of public [[wifi]] has been a major enabler of this trend, and an increasing number of [[retail]] chains are catering to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/887990/starbucks-third-place-and-creating-ultimate-customer-experience|title=Starbucks, "The Third Place", and Creating the Ultimate Customer Experience|date=2008-06-11|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third place which provides internet access may create a hollow effect in that the patrons are physically present but do not make social contact with each other, being absorbed by their remote connections. This is similar to how patrons behave in learning commons environments like those in university libraries where the preponderance of socializing is among people who already know each other. Some businesses, like The Third Place coffeehouse in Arlington, VA,&lt;ref name="The Third Place"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thethird.place/|title=The Third Place |year=2014 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are trying to ameliorate this effect by staging performance art such as live [[jazz]] and hosting game nights to encourage audience engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10950463|title=The new oases|date=April 10, 2008|publisher=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postmodern conception ==

Political geographer and urban planner [[Edward Soja]] also developed a theory of Thirdspace, in his 1996 book ''Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-And-Imagined Places''. His postmodern conception draws on and is influenced by [[Henri Lefebvre]], [[Michel Foucault]], and postcolonial thinkers [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], [[bell hooks]], [[Edward Said]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha]]. Soja's concept of Thirdspace "breaks the Firstspace-Secondspace dualism and comprises such related concepts as ‘place, location, locality, landscape, environment, home, city, region, territory and geography’ (50) that attempts to come to terms with the representational strategies of real and imagined places. He proposes a ‘trialectics of spatiality’ (57) which is a process, a dynamic force and ‘recombinational and radically open’ (50)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalal|first=Sanghamitra|title=Book Reviews: Communicating in The Third Space edited by Karin Ikas and Gerhard Wagner|journal=Transnational Literature|date=November 2010|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://fhrc.flinders.edu.au/transnational/home.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Towards a Fourth Place ==

Morisson (2018) argues that places in the knowledge economy are evolving.&lt;ref name="Morisson A. (2019) A Typology of Places in the Knowledge Economy: Towards the Fourth Place. In: Calabrò F., Della Spina L., Bevilacqua C. (eds) New Metropolitan Perspectives. ISHT 2018. Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, vol 100. Springer, Cham"&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320739010_A_Typology_of_Places_in_the_Knowledge_Economy_Towards_the_Fourth_Place&lt;/ref&gt; He argues the existence of a [[Fourth Place]]. In the knowledge economy, the rise of new social environments is blurring the conventional separation between the first place ([[home]]), the second place (work), and the third place. New social environments in the knowledge city can combine elements of the first and second place ([[coliving]]); of the second and third place ([[coworking]]); and of the first and third place (comingling).&lt;ref name="Morisson A. (2019) A Typology of Places in the Knowledge Economy: Towards the Fourth Place. In: Calabrò F., Della Spina L., Bevilacqua C. (eds) New Metropolitan Perspectives. ISHT 2018.

Springer, Cham"&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320739010_A_Typology_of_Places_in_the_Knowledge_Economy_Towards_the_Fourth_Place&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the combination of elements of the first, second, and third place in new social environments implies the emergence of a new place, the fourth place.

'''Voiceroid''' is a speech synthesizer application developed by [[AH Software]] and is designed for speech. It is only available in the [[Japanese language]].  Its name comes from the singing software [[Vocaloid]], for which [[AH-Software]] also develops voicebanks. Both AH-Software's Vocaloids and Voiceroids went on sale on December 4, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vocaloidism.com/2009/11/14/new-voiceroid-software-from-ah-software/|title=New VOICEROID Software From AH-Software|publisher=Vocaloidism|date=November 14, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from regular [[Speech synthesis|Text to Speech]] programs in that it gives the user more control over settings like [[tempo]], [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], and [[Intonation (music)|intonation]].

==Overview==
Voiceroid uses an engine called ''AITalk'' developed by AI Inc.  The user is able to adjust the [[tempo]], [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], and [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] to make the program sound more natural. The original two products Tsukuyomi Shouta and Tsukuyomi Ai were packaged with the animating software, Crazy Talk SE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.gigazine.net/index.php?/news/comments/20091113_voiceroid/|title=VOICEROID "Tsukuyomi Ai" and "Tsukuyomi Shouta" will Read Out Your Favourite Line in Moe Voices|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707190745/http://en.gigazine.net/index.php?/news/comments/20091113_voiceroid/|archive-date=7 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2010, a new version of the engine was introduced known as, ''Voiceroid+''. The first of this new engine featured a character from the children's anime ''[[Eagle Talon (anime)|Eagle Talon]]'', known as Yoshida-kun. Much like Shouta &amp; Ai, he is aimed at young audiences. 

The first three Voiceroids were targeted at younger audiences, so they were subject to censorship, and inappropriate words were filtered out.  However, Maki Tsurumaki was designed specifically for a more older audience and is the first of the series to have no form of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vocaloid-creativity.totalh.com/index.php/vocaloid-news/47-new-voiceroid-is-new Vocaloid news article]&lt;/ref&gt;  Yuzuki Yukari is also the first Vocaloid to have a Voiceroid voicebank as well as a [[Vocaloid]] voicebank.  For Tohoku Zunko's release the software has been vastly improved compared to previous Voiceroid+ voices.The first two Voiceroids to come in one package are Kotonoha Akane・Aoi.  In 2015, the software was upgraded to ''Voiceroid+ ex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ah-soft.com/voiceroid/|title=AH-Software - VOICEROIDシリーズ|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the newest version of the software "Voiceroid 2" was announced.  This version has a number of new features and differences, though can still import the past Voiceroid and its variants into it.  However, older engine versions will not be able to use any new features.
