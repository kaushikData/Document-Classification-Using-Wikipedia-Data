The {{lang|es|'''aduaneros'''}} (lit. "customs officers") were a special military force created by [[Tomás de Zumalacárregui]] during the [[First Carlist War]].  They were entrusted with the levying of revenue for various consumer goods.  During the first years of the war, they prohibited the export and import of goods to isolated barracks and fortified villages that had sided with the Liberal ([[Isabel II of Spain|Isabeline]]) cause.      

The aduaneros' uniform included [[corduroy]] pants, jacket, and vest; a flesh-colored corset; blue [[beret]] with white tassel; gray cloak; and {{lang|es|alpargatas}}, a sort of light sandal made of hemp.  Their weapons included a [[bandolier]] and [[carbine]]. 

[[Mariano José de Larra]] wrote a satirical article about them called {{lang|es|"Nadie pase sin hablar con el portero"}} ("No one can pass without speaking first with the doorman").

The '''Bantu Educational Kinema Experiment''' ('''BEKE''') was a project of the International Missionary Council in coordination with the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial governments of [[Tanganyika]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Northern Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]] in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Notcutt, L.A. and G.C. Latham, The African and the Cinema : An Account of the Work of the Bantu Educational Cinema Experiment during the Period March 1935 to May 1937 (London: Edinburgh House Press, 1937).

&lt;/ref&gt; The project involved [[educational film]]s played by mobile cinemas to educate the black ("[[Bantu peoples|bantu]]") people. About 35 such films, on [[16mm]], were produced between 1935 and 1937, when the Carnegie grant expired. The project was led by J. Merle Davis, director of the International Missionary Council's Department of Social and Industrial Research; George Chitty Latham, former head of Northern Rhodesia's Education Department; and Major Leslie Allen Notcutt, a former plantation manager in Kenya. 

BEKE productions were [[silent film|silent]], low quality films with naive plots that usually involved a "wise guy" (giving the good example) prevailing over a "stupid guy" (impersonating bad habits). While some actors were black, everything else in the production was British, building on a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] representation of Africa and Africans. The main teachings conveyed by the films were about [[hygiene|hygienical]] rules, methods of cash crop cultivation and cooperative marketing, and "prestige films" that highlighted the institutions of British rule. Only three BEKE films survive, and are held at the [[British Film Institute]] Archives: 
*"Veterinary Training of African Natives" (1936),&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Film, Moving Images of the British Empire [http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/node/1533 link to film]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*"Tropical Hookworm" (1936),&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Film, Moving Images of the British Empire [http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/node/735 link to film]&lt;/ref&gt; and 
*"African Peasant Farms - the Kingolwira Experiment" (1936).&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Film, Moving Images of the British Empire [http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/node/230 link to film]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox First Balkan War}}
The '''Battle of Kirk Kilisse''' or '''Battle of Kirkkilise'''&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Erickson, ''Defeat in detail: the Ottoman Army in the Balkans, 1912–1913 '', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-275-97888-4}}, p. 86, 181.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Battle of Lozengrad''' was part of the [[First Balkan War]] between the armies of [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It took place on 24 October 1912, when the [[Bulgaria]]n army defeated an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army in Eastern [[Thrace]].
[[File:Bitka kod Kirklarelija.svg|thumb|Map of the battle]]
The initial clashes were around several villages to the north of the town. The Bulgarian attacks were irresistible and the Ottoman forces were forced to retreat. On 10 October the Ottoman army threatened to split 1st and 3rd Bulgarian armies but it was quickly stopped by charge by 1st Sofian and 2nd Preslav brigades. After bloody fights along the whole town the Ottomans began to pull back and on the next morning Kırk Kilise (Lozengrad) was in Bulgarian rule.

After the victory, the [[France|French]] minister of war [[Alexandre Millerand]] stated that the [[Bulgarian Army]] was the best in [[Europe]] and that he would prefer 100,000 Bulgarians for allies than any other European army.&lt;ref&gt;В. Мир, № 3684, 15. X. 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flavour of cider varies. Ciders can be classified from dry to sweet. Their appearance ranges from cloudy with sediment to completely clear, and their colour ranges from almost colourless to amber to brown. The variations in clarity and colour are mostly due to filtering between pressing and [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]]. Some apple varieties will produce a clear cider without any need for filtration. Both sparkling and still ciders are made; the sparkling variety is the more common.

Modern, mass-produced ciders closely resemble [[sparkling wine]] in appearance. More traditional brands tend to be darker and cloudier. They are often stronger than the mass-produced varieties and taste more strongly of apples. Almost colourless, white cider has the same apple juice content as conventional cider but is harder to create because the cider maker has to blend various apples to create a clearer liquid. White ciders tend to be sweeter and more refreshing. They are typically 7–8 %&amp;nbsp;ABV in strength. Black cider, by contrast, is dry amber premium cider which has an alcohol content of 7–8 %&amp;nbsp;ABV. The descriptor black usually comes after the brand name such as ''Union Black'' and ''Barnstormer Black''.

== Cider styles ==
===Geography and origins===

Cider is an ancient beverage, though no one is quite sure when it was first made because of the geography of its main component, the apple. In the cider market, the ciders can be broken down into two main styles, standard and specialty. The first group consists of modern ciders and heritage ciders. Modern ciders are produced from culinary apples such as [[Gala (apple)|Gala]]. Heritage ciders are produced from heritage, cider specific, crab or wild apples, like [[Golden Russet]]. Historically, cider was made from the only resources available to make it,&lt;ref name="naborg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northamericanbrewers.org/about/contributed-articles-by-naba-members/cider-styles-a-primer/|title=North American Brewing Association|last=Beckwith|first=Bob|date=May 18, 2000|website=North American Brewing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; so style wasn't a large factor when considering the production process. Apples were historically confined to the cooler climates of Western Europe and Britain where civilization was slow to develop record keeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delage|first=Elisabeth|last2=Bohuon|first2=G.|last3=Baron|first3=A.|last4=Drilleau|first4=J.-F.|date=August 1991|title=High-performance liquid chromatography of the phenolic compounds in the juice of some French cider apple varieties|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021967301871727|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=555|issue=1–2|pages=125–136|doi=10.1016/s0021-9673(01)87172-7|issn=0021-9673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cider was first made from crab apples, ancestors of the bittersweet and bittersharp apples used by today's English cider makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DuPont|first=M. Susan|last2=Bennett|first2=Richard N.|last3=Mellon|first3=Fred A.|last4=Williamson|first4=Gary|date=2002-02-01|title=Polyphenols from Alcoholic Apple Cider Are Absorbed, Metabolized and Excreted by Humans|url=https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/132/2/172/4687159|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|language=en|volume=132|issue=2|pages=172–175|doi=10.1093/jn/132.2.172|pmid=11823574|issn=0022-3166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English cider contained a drier, higher alcohol content version, using open fermentation vats and bittersweet crab apples. The French developed a sweet, low alcohol "cidre" taking advantage of the sweeter apples and the keeving process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanoner|first=Philippe|last2=Guyot|first2=Sylvain|last3=Marnet|first3=Nathalie|last4=Molle|first4=Daniel|last5=Drilleau|first5=J.-F.|date=December 1999|title=Polyphenol Profiles of French Cider Apple Varieties (Malus domesticasp.)|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=47|issue=12|pages=4847–4853|doi=10.1021/jf990563y|issn=0021-8561}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the roots of the standard styles we know today. Cider styles evolved based on the methods used, the apples available and local tastes. Production techniques developed, as with most technology, by trial and error. In fact, the variables were nearly too widespread to track, including: spontaneous fermentation, the type of vessels used, environmental conditions, and the apple varieties. Refinements came much later when cider became a commercial product and the process was better understood. However, since there is growing popularity in ciders, the production of specialty styles has begun to increase.&lt;ref name="naborg" /&gt;

===Modern ciders===

Modern ciders are made from culinary apples and are lower in [[tannin]]s and higher in acidity than other cider styles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ciderassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/USACM-Style-Guidelines-V1pt1.pdf|title=Cider Style Guide|last=United States Association of Cider Makers|date=October 2017|website=USACM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common culinary apples used in modern ciders include [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]], [[Golden Delicious]], [[Jonagold]], [[Granny Smith]], Gala, and [[Fuji (apple)|Fuji]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A sweet or low alcohol cider may tend to have a strong aromatic and flavor character of apple, while drier and higher alcohol ciders will tend to produce a wider range of fruity aromas and flavors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Modern ciders vary in color from pale to yellow and can range from brilliant to a hazy clarity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Clarity can be altered through various cider making practices, depending on the cider maker's intentions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Heritage ciders===

Heritage ciders are made from both culinary and cider apples, including bittersweet, bittersharp, heirlooms, wild apples, and crabapples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Common apples used in heritage cider production include [[Dabinett]], [[Kingston Black Apple|Kingston Black]], [[Roxbury Russet]], and Wickson.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Heritage ciders are higher in tannins than modern ciders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They range in color from yellow to amber, and range from brilliant to hazy in clarity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Clarity of heritage ciders also depends on the cider making practices used and will differ by cider maker as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Specialty style ciders===

Specialty style ciders are open to a lot more manipulation than modern or heritage style ciders. There is no restriction to apple varieties used and the list of specialty styles continues to expand. Listed on the USACM Cider Style Guide, specialty styles include: fruit, hopped, spiced, wood-aged, sour, and iced ciders. Fruit ciders have other fruit or juices added before or after fermentation, like cherries, blueberries, and cranberries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hopped cider is fermented with added [[hops]], common [[List of hop varieties|hop varieties]] being [[Cascade hop|Cascade]], Citra, Galaxy, and Mosaic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Spiced ciders have various spices added to the cider before, during, or after fermentation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Spices like cinnamon and ginger are popular to use in production.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Wood-aged ciders are ciders that are either fermented or aged in various types of wood barrels, to aid in extraction of woody, earthy flavors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sour ciders are high acid ciders that are produced with non-standard, non-[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Saccharomyces]] [[yeast]] and bacteria, which enhance [[Acetic acid|acetic]] and [[Lactic acid fermentation|lactic acid]] production, in order to reach a sour profile.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ice ciders can be made by using pre-pressed frozen juice or frozen whole apples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Whole apples either come frozen from the orchard, dependent on harvest date, or are stored in a freezer prior to pressing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When the pre-pressed juice or whole apples freeze, sugars are concentrated and mostly separated from the water. Whole apples are then pressed in order to extract the concentrated juice and for the pre-pressed juice, the concentrated solution is drawn off while thawing occurs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although, according to the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB) cider producers can only label a product 'Ice Cider' if it is produced from apples naturally frozen outdoors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Two styles not mentioned in the USACM Cider Style Guide are Rosé and Sparkling Cider. Rosé cider can be produced from apple varieties that have reddish-pink pulp, like [[Pink Pearl (apple)|Pink Pearl]] and Amour Rouge.&lt;ref name="fw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodandwine.com/news/rose-cider-shacksbury-angry-orchard-crispin|title=The Year of Rose Cider Is Upon Us|last=Pomranz|first=Mike|date=February 23, 2018|website=Food and Wine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosé ciders can also be created through the addition of food grade red dyes, previously used red grape skins, like [[Marquette (grape)|Marquette]] with high [[anthocyanin]] concentration, red fruits, rose petals, or [[hibiscus]].&lt;ref name="fw" /&gt; Lastly, sparkling ciders can be produced through methods of direct carbonation, addition of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or by [[Sparkling wine production|Méthode Champenoise]] to re-create the traditional Champagne style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winespectator.com/glossary/index/id/GL_m%C3%A9thode_champenoise|title=Methode Champenoise|last=Methode Traditionnelle|website=Wine Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ashridgecider.co.uk/how-we-make-it/|title=How We Make Sparkling Ciders|last=Ashridge Cider|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

=== Scratting and pressing ===
{{main|Cider mill|Cider press}}

Apples grown for consumption are suitable for cider making, though some regional cider-makers prefer to use a mix of eating and cider apples (as in [[Kent]], England), or exclusively cider apples (as in the [[West Country]], England). There are many hundreds of varieties of cultivars developed specifically for cider making.

[[File:Tou d'preinseu, Morel Farm, Jèrri.jpg|thumb|left|Few traditional horse-drawn circular cider presses are still in use, but many may still be seen used as garden ornaments, flower planters, or architectural features]]

Once the apples are gathered from trees in [[orchards]] they are ''scratted'' (ground down) into what is called ''[[pomace]]'' or ''pommage''. Historically this was done using pressing stones with circular troughs, or by a cider mill. Cider mills were traditionally driven by the hand, water-mill, or horse-power. In modern times, they are likely to be powered by electricity. The pulp is then transferred to the cider press and built up in layers known as ''cheeses'' into a block.

Traditionally the method for squeezing the juice from the apples involves placing sweet straw or haircloths between the layers of pomace. This will alternate with slatted ash-wood racks until there is a pile of ten or twelve layers.

The ''set'' is then subjected to increasing degrees of pressure until all the 'must' or juice is squeezed from the pomace. This juice, after being strained in a coarse hair-sieve, is then put into either open vats or closed casks. The pressed pulp is given to farm animals as winter feed, composted, discarded or used to make [[liqueur]]s.&lt;ref name="Somerset Cider"&gt;{{cite web | first= James | last= Crowden | title= Somerset Cider | publisher= [[Somerset County Council]] | url= http://www.somerset.gov.uk/celebratingsomerset/cidermap/home.htm | accessdate= 2006-06-20 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060524050427/http://www.somerset.gov.uk/celebratingsomerset/cidermap/home.htm | archive-date= 2006-05-24 | dead-url= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fermentation ===
{{Main|Fermentation (food)}}

Fermentation of ciders occurs by a very similar mechanism to the fermentation of wine. The process of alcoholic fermentation is characterized by the conversion of simple sugars into ethanol by yeasts, especially ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''.&lt;ref name="whenWhy"&gt;Dashko, S., Zhou, N., Compagno, C., Piškur, J., Molekylär cellbiologi, Lund University, . . . Lunds universitet. (2014). Why, when, and how did yeast evolve alcoholic fermentation?''FEMS Yeast Research, 14''(6), 826-832. doi:10.1111/1567-1364.12161&lt;/ref&gt; This is because, as “Crabtree positive” yeasts, they produce ethanol even during aerobic fermentation; in contrast, Crabtree-negative yeasts produce only biomass and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="whenWhy" /&gt; This adaptation allows them a competitive edge in the fermentation of ciders due to their high alcohol tolerance, and because of this tolerance, it is common for ciders to be fermented to dryness, although that is not always the case. Fermentations will carry on until the yeasts run out of nutrients and can no longer metabolize, resulting in a "stuck" fermentation,&lt;ref&gt;Boudreau, T. F., Peck, G. M., O'Keefe, S. F., &amp; Stewart, A. C. (2017). The interactive effect of fungicide residues and yeast assimilable nitrogen on fermentation kinetics and hydrogen sulfide production during cider fermentation. ''Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 97''(2), 693-704. doi:10.1002/jsfa.8096&lt;/ref&gt; or the fermentation is stopped.

Steps taken before fermentation might include fruit or juice blending, titratable acidity and pH measurements and sometimes adjustments, and sulfur dioxide and yeast additions.&lt;ref name="The Science of Cidermaking"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lea|first1=Andrew|title=The Science of Cidermaking|url=http://www.cider.org.uk/part3.htm|website=cider.org|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermentation is carried out at a temperature of 4&amp;ndash;16&amp;nbsp;°C (40&amp;ndash;60&amp;nbsp;°F). This temperature would be low for most kinds of fermentation, but is beneficial for cider, as it leads to slower fermentation with less loss of delicate aromas. Fermentation can occur due to natural yeasts that are present in the must; alternately, some cider makers add cultivated strains of cider yeast, such as ''[[Saccharomyces bayanus]]''.

During the initial stages of fermentation, there are elevated levels of carbon dioxide as the yeasts multiply and begin to break down the sugar into ethanol.&lt;ref name="The Science of Cidermaking"/&gt; In addition to fermentative metabolism of yeast, certain organoleptic compounds are formed that have an effect on the quality of cider, such as other alcohols, esters and other volatile compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arias Abrodo|first1=Pilar|title=Fatty Acid Composition of Cider Obtained by traditional or controlled fermentation|journal=Food Chemistry|date=2005|pages=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; After fermentation, racking occurs into a clean vessel, trying to leave behind as much yeast as possible.&lt;ref name="The Science of Cidermaking"/&gt; Shortly before the fermentation consumes all the sugar, the liquor is "racked" ([[siphon]]ed) into new vats. This leaves dead yeast cells and other undesirable material at the bottom of the old vat. At this point, it becomes important to exclude airborne acetic bacteria, so vats are filled completely to exclude air. The fermenting of the remaining available sugar generates a small amount of carbon dioxide that forms a protective layer, reducing air contact. This final fermentation creates a small amount of [[carbonation]]. Extra sugar may be added specifically for this purpose. Racking is sometimes repeated if the liquor remains too cloudy.

Apple-based juice may also be combined with fruit to make a fine cider; fruit purées or flavourings can be added, such as [[grape]], [[cherry]], [[raspberry]], or [[cranberry]].

The cider is ready to drink after a three-month fermentation period, although it is more often matured in the vats for up to three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= History of cider| publisher= W3commerce| year= 2000| url= http://www.history-of-cider.co.uk/index.html| accessdate= 2006-06-20| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061001010518/http://www.history-of-cider.co.uk/index.html| archive-date= 2006-10-01| dead-url= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blending and bottling ===
[[File:Cider making Jersey.jpg|thumb|upright|Layers of pomace wrapped in canvas]]

For larger-scale cider production, ciders from vats produced from different varieties of apple may be blended to accord with market taste. If the cider is to be bottled, usually some extra sugar is added for sparkle. Higher quality ciders can be made using the [[Sparkling wine production|champagne method]], but this is expensive in time and money and requires special corks, bottles, and other equipment. Some home brewers use beer bottles, which work perfectly well, and are inexpensive. This allows the cider to become naturally carbonated

== Chemistry ==

=== Flavour compounds ===
[[Phenolic content in wine|Tannins]] are crucial flavour compounds in cider. Since perfecting the tannin content in the cider is needed for optimal success, the tannins or “polyphenols of apples are largely implicated in cider quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Polyphenol Profiles of French Cider Apple Varieties|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=47|issue=12|pages=4847–4853|last=Sanoner|first=P|date=1999|doi=10.1021/jf990563y}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are important because they control the [[Astringency (wine)|astringency]] and bitterness of the cider. Tannins are necessary components to focus on when producing cider because the length of the aftertaste of the cider (astringency) and bitterness are both strong chemicals that affect people's opinion on the cider. Tannins are polyphenol compounds that are naturally occurring in apples. Depending on the type of cider apple the producer is using, the tannin levels will be different. The more well-known ciders typically have lower tannin levels while traditional ciders have more. One example of a common tannin present in cider is [[Procyanidin B2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Phenolics of Ciders: Bitterness and Astringency|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|volume=29|issue=5|pages=478–483|last=Lea|first=A|date=1978|doi=10.1002/jsfa.2740290512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[acid]]s in cider play a vital role in both the cider making process and in the final flavour of a finished cider. They are present in both apples and cider, and add a sour taste and a pungent odor to these respective substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia-Medina|first=Maria Rosa|date=1981|title=Flavor-odor taste interactions in solutions of acetic acid and coffee|url=https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/6/1/13/277873|journal=Chemical Senses|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=13–22|doi=10.1093/chemse/6.1.13|issn=0379-864X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acids also serve as a preservative in the cider since microbes grow less in lower pH environments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=RAJASHEKHARA|first=E.|last2=SURESH|first2=E.

Most of the natural sugar in apples are used up in the fermentation process and are converted into alcohol, and carbon dioxide. If the fermentation goes all the way, the cider will have no perceivable residual sugar and be dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-11-01|title=French cider characterization by sensory, technological and chemical evaluations|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002364380600017X|journal=LWT - Food Science and Technology|language=en|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1033–1044|doi=10.1016/j.lwt.2006.02.018|issn=0023-6438|last1=Le Quéré|first1=Jean-Michel|last2=Husson|first2=François|last3=Renard|first3=Catherine M.G.C|last4=Primault|first4=Jo}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the cider will not taste sweet, and might show more bitterness, or acidity. Ciders are made in many parts of Europe and in the United States and each country has different representations of cider with different flavour compounds. Keeving is a traditional method of fermentation with low amounts of nitrogen in French and English ciders that is intended to slow down the rate of fermentation in hopes of retaining high esters as well as retaining some residual sugar in the bottled cider to increase effervescence in the aging process.&lt;ref name="Log In - ProQuest"&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/209774851&lt;/ref&gt; Ciders can be back sweetened, after fermentation is complete to add a sweet taste and balance out acids, tannins, and bitterness. Natural sugar can be used but this can restart fermentation in a bottle if not filtered correctly.&lt;ref name="Log In - ProQuest"/&gt; Artificial sweeteners can be used which are non-fermentable but some of these create an aftertaste, such as saccharin or sucralose, yet some of these are known for adding off flavour compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1984-08-01|title=The influence of flavour preexposure and test interval on conditioned taste aversions in the rat|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0023969084900225|journal=Learning and Motivation|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–278|doi=10.1016/0023-9690(84)90022-5|issn=0023-9690|last1=Kraemer|first1=Philipp J|last2=Roberts|first2=William A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apples to cider ===
An important component in cider-making is the addition of sulphur dioxide to inhibit the growth of many spoilage bacteria or yeasts in the juice. This encourages the inoculated yeast to dominate the juice environment, converting sugars to alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cider.org.uk/frameset.htm|title=The Wittenham Hill Cider Pages|website=www.cider.org.uk|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once sulfur dioxide dissolves in the juice, it converts into a pH dependent mixture of bisulfite, sulfite ions, and molecular sulfur dioxide. The "unbound" sulfur dioxide provides the antimicrobial environment in the juice, while the bisulfite and sulfite ions contribute to flavor. The quantity of sulfur dioxide needed to inhibit microbial activity is directed related to pH of the juice; lower pH means less should be added, while higher pH juice requires more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261730244_Cider_Cyder_Hard_Cider|title=Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology|last=Jarvis|first=Basil|date=2014-12-31|pages=vol 1 pp 437–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cider producers add sulfur dioxide immediately after pressing and juicing, but before fermentation. However, in some cases it can be added afterwards to act as an antioxidant or stabilizer. This prevents the finished cider from releasing hydrogen peroxide or aldehydes that produce "off" odors and flavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cider.org.uk/sulphite.html|title=Sulphur dioxide in cidermaking|last=Lea|first=Andrew|website=www.cider.org.uk|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrogen is also very important nutrient to support yeast growth and fermentation in cider. Yeast require different forms of nitrogen to take up and use themselves so nitrogenous compounds are often added to apple juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.extension.iastate.edu/wine/files/page/files/nitrogenmetabolismduringfermentation.pdf|title=Nitrogen Metabolism During Fermentation|last=Dharmadhikari|first=Murli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of nitrogen-containing compounds that yeast can use are referred to as 'Yeast Assimilable Nitrogen', or YAN. Even though YAN can be added into juice before fermentation, there are other ways to affect the levels of nitrogen in the juice before pressing, like the maturity of the orchard or what type of fertilizer is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042815-130133/unrestricted/Improvement_of_Hard_Cider_Production.pdf|title=Improvement of Hard Cider Production|last=Collins|first=Joseph|work=Worcester Polytechnic Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a fertilizer with a good amount of nitrogen will help the roots of apple trees; nitrogen fixing bacteria on the roots will be able to provide the tree with more nitrogen that will be able to make its way into the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cider.org.uk/nitro.htm|title=Nitrogen - the Forgotten Element in Cider Making|last=Lea|first=Andrew|website=www.cider.org.uk|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low crop load can also yield juices with more YAN than a high crop load because the nitrogen in more concentrated in the low number of apples instead of being distributed to many apples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Gregory|title=Crop Load Density Affects 'York' Apple Juice and Hard Cider Quality|url=http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/51/9/1098.full|journal=HortScience}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a sufficient amount of YAN is good for the yeast and ensures fermentation of the sugars in the juice to alcohol, some cider makers may choose to limit nitrogen because it is the limiting factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-04-01|title=Modeling the effects of initial nitrogen content and temperature on fermentation kinetics of hard cider|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877411005590|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|language=en|volume=109|issue=3|pages=588–596|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.10.020|issn=0260-8774|last1=Kelkar|first1=Shantanu|last2=Dolan|first2=Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the yeast are starved for nitrogen, they stop fermenting and die off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northernbrewer.com/documentation/cider.pdf|title=A BASIC OVERVIEW OF MAKING HARD CIDER FROM JUICE|website=Northern Brewer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be desirable if cider makers prefer their cider to have some more sugar than alcohol in their cider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|date=Feb 1974|title=FLAVOUR RESEARCH AND THE CIDER INDUSTRY|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.2050-0416.1974.tb06795.x|journal=Inst.

Primary cider fermentation can be initiated by inoculating the cider must with selected yeast strains or by permitting indigenous yeast strains present on the fruit and in the cider production equipment to spontaneously commence fermentation without inoculation. Inoculation with different strains of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and other yeast strains with strong fermentative metabolism traits, including ''[[Saccharomyces bayanus]]'' and ''[[Torulaspora delbrueckii]]'' strains, has been shown to produce few differences in cider phenolic compounds, save for concentrations of phloretin (see [[Phloretin]]) in samples that underwent malolactic fermentation. Spontaneous fermentation commenced by indigenous yeasts and finished by ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' can produce ciders with similar concentrations of important non-volatile acids (see [[Nonvolatile acid]]), including lactic acid, succinic acid and acetic acid, while concentrations of volatile compounds such as methanol and 1-butanol, were present in different concentrations, dependent on apple cultivar . Extending the time during which the cider remains in contact with yeast lees increased concentrations of most of the minor volatile compounds present, especially fatty acids, ethyl esters and alcohols. Major volatile compound concentrations did not exhibit a similar pattern, with ''iso''-butanol, amyl alcohols, and acetoine decreasing 1-propanol decreasing.

Sparkling ciders can be produced using different methods, including the Champenoise method used to produce Champagne. Use of different strains of indigenous ''Saccharomyces'' to perform secondary fermentation produced ciders with consistent alcohol and acidic characteristics, variable glycerol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, methanol, propanol, ''i''-butanol and 2-phenylethanol characteristics and acceptable sensory analysis results.

== Microbiology ==

=== Yeast ===
The selection of yeast used for cider production is critical to the quality of the final product. As with other fermented beverages, like [[wine]] and [[beer]], the strain of yeast used to carry out the [[alcoholic fermentation]] also converts precursor molecules into the odorants found in the final product. In general, two broad categories of yeast are used for cider making: commercially developed strains and wild, or autochthonous, strains. In either case, the species tend to be either ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' or ''Saccharomyces bayanus.'' Commercial strains are available for purchase from numerous distributors, and their characteristics are typically outlined in manuals from the companies. Selection for fermentation may be based on a yeast's ability to ferment at particular sugar concentrations, temperatures, or pH. Some producers may also select for yeasts that produce [[Killer yeast|killer factors]], allowing them to out-compete other yeast in the juice, or they may select yeast that contribute [[mouthfeel]] or specific aromas to the cider.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Laboratories Cider Handbook (2015-2016). http://www.scottlab.com/pdf/2015CiderHandbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

"Wild fermentations" occur when autochthonous yeast are allowed to carry out fermentation; indigenous yeasts can spontaneously initiate fermentation without any addition of other yeast strains by the cider maker. Autochthonous yeasts are wild yeast strains that are endemic to the specific location in which a cider is produced; this is the traditional method used for cider making, and many producers feel that the strains unique to their cidery contribute a sense of [[terroir]] to their product. Wild yeast populations can be incredibly diverse and commonly include species of ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'', ''[[Pichia]]'', ''[[Hanseniaspora]]'' and ''[[Metschnikowia]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valles|first=B|last2=Pando Bedriñana|first2=R|last3=Tascon|first3=N|last4=Simon|first4=A|last5=Madrera|first5=R|date=2007|title=Yeast species associated with the spontaneous fermentation of cider|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=25–31|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2006.04.001|pmid=16943091|issn=0740-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the native yeast take up residence in the cidery, and can be important to the unique flavor of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pando Bedriñana|first=R.|last2=Querol Simón|first2=A.|last3=Suárez Valles|first3=B.|date=2010|title=Genetic and phenotypic diversity of autochthonous cider yeasts in a cellar from Asturias|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=27|issue=4|pages=503–508|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2009.11.018|issn=0740-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was once believed that the native yeast carrying out these spontaneous fermentations also came from the orchard itself, research has shown that the microbes cultured from apples in the orchard do not align with the microbes found during the various stages of fermentation, suggesting that the sole source of native yeast is the cidery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alonso|first=Sergio|last2=Laca|first2=Amanda|last3=Rendueles|first3=Manuel|last4=Mayo|first4=Baltasar|last5=Díaz|first5=Mario|date=2015-03-19|title=Cider Apple Native Microbiota Characterization by PCR-DGGE|journal=Journal of the Institute of Brewing|language=en|volume=121|issue=2|pages=287–289|doi=10.1002/jib.220|issn=0046-9750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous yeast strain population dynamics are affected by climatic conditions, apple variety, geographic location, and cider making technologies used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Genetic and phenotypic diversity of autochthonous cider yeasts in a cellar from Asturias|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b6e/43f01d51b79048dc42342e766a7f9b742736.pdf|journal=Food Microbiology|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; These variables cause different regions to host unique endemic yeast populations. The particular composition of endemic yeast strains and the yeast's activity during fermentation are responsible for the unique characteristics of ciders produced in certain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morrissey|first=W.F.|last2=Davenport|first2=B.|last3=Querol|first3=A.|last4=Dobson|first4=A.D.W.|date=2004|title=The role of indigenous yeasts in traditional Irish cider fermentations|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2004.02354.x|journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology|volume=97|issue=3|pages=647–655|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2004.02354.x|issn=1364-5072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique autochthonous yeast populations promote different compositions of volatile flavor compounds, which form distinct tastes, aromas, and mouthfeel in finished ciders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-01-01|title=Composition of aroma compounds in fermented apple juice: effect of apple variety, fermentation temperature and inoculated yeast concentration|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211601X11002537|journal=Procedia Food Science|language=en|volume=1|pages=1709–1716|doi=10.1016/j.profoo.2011.09.252|issn=2211-601X|last1=Rita|first1=Riekstina-Dolge|last2=Zanda|first2=Kruma|last3=Daina|first3=Karklina|last4=Dalija|first4=Seglina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using wild yeast populations for fermentation introduces variability to the cider making process that makes it more difficult to generate multiple batches of cider that retain consistent characteristics.

Aside from carrying out the primary fermentation of cider, yeast may also play other roles in cider production. The production of sparkling cider requires a second round of fermentation, and a second yeast selection. The yeast used for the secondary fermentation in sparkling cider production serve the same purpose as the yeast used in the [[Champagne method]] of sparkling wine production: to generate [[carbonation]] and distinct aromas with a fermentation that occurs in the bottle. The yeast are selected based on critical properties, such as tolerance to high pressure, low temperature, and high ethanol concentration, as well as an ability to [[Flocculation|flocculate]], which allows for [[riddling]] to remove the yeast when the fermentation has finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suárez Valles|first=Belén|last2=Pando Bedriñana|first2=Rosa|last3=Lastra Queipo|first3=Ana|last4=Mangas Alonso|first4=Juan José|date=2008|title=Screening of cider yeasts for sparkling cider production (Champenoise method)|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=25|issue=5|pages=690–697|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2008.03.004|issn=0740-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have also suggested that non-Saccharomyces yeasts could be used to release additional flavor or mouthfeel compounds, as they may contain enzymes, such as [[Beta-glucosidase|β-glucosidase]], [[Xylan 1,4-b-xylosidase|β-xylosidase]], or [[polygalacturonase]], which ''Saccharomyces'' yeast may not produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pando Bedriñana|first=R.|last2=Lastra Queipo|first2=A.|last3=Suárez Valles|first3=B.|date=2011-12-29|title=Screening of Enzymatic Activities in Non-Saccharomyces Cider Yeasts|journal=Journal of Food Biochemistry|language=en|volume=36|issue=6|pages=683–689|doi=10.1111/j.1745-4514.2011.00583.x|issn=0145-8884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all yeast associated with cider production are necessary for fermentation; many are considered spoilage microbes and can be a significant source of off odors in the finished product. ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' species produce [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]] [[phenols]], especially [[4-Ethylphenol|4-ethyl phenol]], which impart a distinct aroma called "Bretty", typically described as "barnyard", "horsey", or "bandaid".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buron|first=Nicolas|last2=Coton|first2=Monika|last3=Legendre|first3=Patrick|last4=Ledauphin|first4=Jérôme|last5=Kientz-Bouchart|first5=Valérie|last6=Guichard|first6=Hugues|last7=Barillier|first7=Daniel|last8=Coton|first8=Emmanuel|date=2012|title=Implications of Lactobacillus collinoides and Brettanomyces/Dekkera anomala in phenolic off-flavour defects of ciders|journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology|volume=153|issue=1–2|pages=159–165|doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.11.002|issn=0168-1605}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these aromas would be considered spoilage odors in wines, many cider producers and consumers do not consider them a fault. Yeast species like ''[[Hanseniaspora|Hanseniaspora uvarum]]'', ''[[Metschnikowia pulcherrima]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces uvarum]]'', 
''[[Zygosaccharomyces|Zygosaccharomyces cidri]]'', ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida pomicole]]'', and ''[[Pichia membranifaciens]]'' have also been found to produce enzymes linked to generation of spoilage odors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buron|first=Nicolas|last2=Coton|first2=Monika|last3=Desmarais|first3=Cécile|last4=Ledauphin|first4=Jérôme|last5=Guichard|first5=Hugues|last6=Barillier|first6=Daniel|last7=Coton|first7=Emmanuel|date=2011|title=Screening of representative cider yeasts and bacteria for volatile phenol-production ability|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=28|issue=7|pages=1243–1251|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2011.05.001|issn=0740-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Festivals ==

The western British tradition of [[wassailing]] the apple trees and making an offering of cider and bread in Autumn to protect the fertility of the [[orchard]] appears to be a relatively ancient tradition, superficially dating back to the pre-Christian [[Early Medieval]] period.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The [[autumn]] tradition of 'bobbing' for apples is due to the abundance of fruit at this time.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A modern cider festival is an organized event that promotes cider and (usually) [[perry]]. A variety of ciders and perries will be available for tasting and buying. Such festivals may be organized by [[pub]]s, cider producers, or cider-promoting private organizations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

== Uses and variations ==

[[Calvados (brandy)|Calvados]] and [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]] are distilled from cider. Calvados is made throughout [[Normandy]], France, not just in the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]] [[Department (country subdivision)|département]]. It is made from cider by [[double distillation]]. In the first pass, the result is a liquid containing 28&amp;ndash;30% alcohol. After the second pass, the concentration of alcohol is about 40%.

Applejack is a strong alcoholic beverage made in North America by concentrating cider, either by the traditional method of [[Fractional freezing|freeze distillation]] or by true evaporative [[distillation]]. In traditional freeze distillation, a barrel of cider is left outside during the winter. When the temperature is low enough, the water in the cider starts to freeze. If the ice is removed, the (now more concentrated) alcoholic solution is left behind in the barrel. If the process is repeated often enough, and the temperature is low enough, the alcohol concentration is raised to 20&amp;ndash;30 % alcohol by volume. Home production of applejack is popular in Europe.

A few producers in [[Quebec]] and England, inspired by [[ice wine]], have developed [[ice cider]] (French: ''cidre de glace''). For this product, the apples are frozen either before or after being harvested. Its alcohol concentration is 9&amp;ndash;13 % [[alcohol by volume|ABV]].

A popular [[Apéritif and digestif|apéritif]] in Normandy is ''[[pommeau]]'', a drink produced by blending unfermented apple juice and apple brandy in the barrel (the high alcoholic content of the spirit prevents fermentation of the juice and the blend takes on the character of the aged barrel).

[[Cocktail]]s may include cider. Besides [[Kir (cocktail)|kir]] and [[Snakebite (beer cocktail)|snakebite]], an example is [[Black Velvet (beer cocktail)|Black Velvet]] in a version of which cider may replace champagne.

Cider may also be used to make [[vinegar]]. [[Apple cider vinegar]] is noted for its high acidity and flavour.

== Related drinks ==

Other fruits can be used to make cider-like drinks. The most popular is made from fermented [[pear]] juice, known as perry. It is called ''poiré'' in France and produced mostly in [[Lower Normandy]] there. A branded sweet perry known as [[Babycham]], marketed principally as a women's drink and sold in miniature Champagne-style bottles, was once popular but has become unfashionable. Another related drink is [[mead|cyser]] &amp;ndash; cider fermented with honey.

Although not widely made in modern times, various other [[pome]] fruits can produce palatable drinks. [[Apicius]], in Book II of ''[[De re coquinaria]]'', includes a recipe calling for [[quince]] cider.

== National varieties ==
=== Europe ===

Before the development of rapid long distance transportation, regions of cider consumption generally coincided with those of cider production. As such, cider was said to be more common than wine in 12th-century [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, R.A., ''Liber Sancti Jacobi''&lt;/ref&gt; and certainly the idea of it was present in England by the Conquest of 1066, using crab apples: the word "Wassail" is derived from a Saxon phrase, wæs hæl": it is what would have been said by Saxons as a toast at [[Yuletide]]. Southern Italy, by contrast, though indeed possessing apples, had no tradition for cider apples at all and like its other neighbours on the Mediterranean Sea preserved the Roman tradition of apples as an ingredient for desserts, as evidenced by the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii, descriptions by Classical writers and playwrights, and [[Apicius]], whose famous cookbook does not contain a single recipe for fermenting apples but rather includes them as part of main courses, especially accompanying pork.

==== Austria ====

In Austria, cider is made in the southwest of [[Lower Austria]], the so-called "[[Mostviertel]]" and in [[Upper Austria]] as well as in parts of [[Styria]]. Almost every farmer there has some apple or pear trees. Many farmers also have a kind of inn called a "Mostheuriger", similar to a [[heuriger]] for new wine, where they serve cider and traditional fare. Non-sparkling cider is typically called "Most". Austria's most popular sparkling cider [[Goldkehlchen]] is produced in south [[Styria]] and marketed internationally since 2013 by the company founders Adam and Eva.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==== Belgium ====

Cidrerie Ruwet SA, established in 1898, is the only independent craft cider producer in Belgium. In addition to their own brand Ruwet, the company produces 'high-end' ciders for private labels.

Heineken owns the other Belgian cider maker Stassen SA, who in addition to their own local brands such as Strassen X Cider also produce Strongbow Jacques, a 5.5% ABV cider with [[cherry]], [[raspberry]], and [[blackcurrant]] flavours. [[Zonhoven]] based Konings NV specialises in private label ciders for European retailers and offers a wide variety of flavours and packaging options to the beverage industry. ''[[Stella Artois]] Cidre'' is produced in Zonhoven and has been marketed since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Knack | title= Konings maakt Stella Artois Cidre | date= 30 March 2011 | url= http://trends.knack.be/economie/bedrijven/konings-maakt-stella-artois-cidre/article-normal-231333.html | accessdate= 2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====

Despite a strong apple tradition, Denmark has little cider production. Six places that produce cider in Denmark are Pomona (since 2003), Fejø Cider (since 2003), Dancider (since 2004), Ørbæk Bryggeri (since 2006), Ciderprojektet (since 2008), and Svaneke Bryghus (since 2009). All are inspired mainly by English and French cider styles. The assortment of imported ciders has grown significantly since 2000, prior to that only ciders from Sweden, primarily non-alcoholic, were generally available. The leading cider on the Danish market is made by [[CULT A/S]].&lt;ref&gt;Business.dk http://www.business.dk/foedevarer/cult-overhaler-somersby-cider&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] launched an alcoholic cider in Denmark called [[Somersby cider]] which has an alcohol content of 4.7% and a sweet taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Somersby Cider | publisher= Carlsberg Group | url= http://www.carlsberggroup.com/brands/Pages/SomersbyCider.aspx | accessdate= 28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressesystemet.dk/default.asp?id=1910 Very ApS | Somersby Cider byder foråret velkommen! - Pressesystemet.dk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120526205108/http://www.pressesystemet.dk/default.asp?id=1910 |date=2012-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finland ====

The best-known brands labelled as cider are ''[[Golden Cap (cider)|Golden Cap]]'', ''[[Fizz (cider)|Fizz]]'', and ''Upcider''. They typically contain 4.5–4.7 %vol of alcohol. Virtually all Finnish "cider" is produced from fermented apple (or pear) juice concentrate mixed with water and is not cider as per the traditional description of the drink. Flavored ciders, available in a large selection, are very popular and widely available in stores, with a variety of flavours ranging from forest berry to rhubarb and vanilla.

==== France ====

France was one of the countries that inherited a knowledge of apple cultivation from both the Celtic [[Gauls]] and the later [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who ruled the country for approximately 500 years: both had knowledge of grafting and keeping apples. The earliest mentions of cider in this country go back to the Greek geographer [[Strabo]]: he speaks of the profusion of apple trees in [[Gaul]] and describes a cider-like drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= About "Cidre" | publisher= La Chouette | url= http://www.lachouettecider.com/en/about-cidre/?accept-condition=1 | accessdate= 28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, Charlemagne, in the Capitulars, ordered skilled brewers (the Sicetores) to always be present on his estates to make him ale, "pommé" (pomacium), perry and all the liquors liable to be used as drinks, and also ordered an expansion of planting apple trees in what is now Northern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Cider History | publisher= Apple Journal | url= http://www.applejournal.com/fr05.htm | accessdate= 28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cidre Artisinal from Brittany.jpg|thumb|upright|Artisanal cider from Brittany]]

French ''cidre'' ({{IPA-fr|sidʁ}}) is an alcoholic drink produced predominantly in Normandy and [[Brittany]]. It varies in strength from below 4% alcohol to considerably more. Cidre Doux is a sweet cider, usually up to 3% in strength. 'Demi-Sec' is 3&amp;ndash;5% and Cidre Brut is a strong dry cider of 4.5% alcohol and above. Most French ciders are sparkling. Higher quality cider is sold in champagne-style bottles (''cidre bouché''). Many ciders are sold in corked bottles, but some screw-top bottles exist.
In crêperies ([[crêpe]] restaurants) in Brittany, cider is generally served in traditional ceramic bowls (or wide cups) rather than glasses. A ''kir Breton'' (or ''kir normand'') is a cocktail [[apéritif]] made with cider and [[Crème de cassis|cassis]], rather than white wine and cassis for the traditional ''[[kir (cocktail)|kir]]''. The Domfrontais, in the [[Orne]] (Basse-Normandie), is famous for its pear cider (poiré). The ''calvados du Domfrontais'' is made of cider and poiré.

Some cider is also made in southwestern France, in the French part of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. It is a traditional drink there and is making a recovery. Ciders produced here are generally of the style seen in the Spanish part of the Basque Country. A recently popular variety is the Akived, a piquant drink served cold.

[[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]], from Normandy, and Lambig from Brittany are a spirits made of cider through a process called double [[distillation]]. In the first pass, the result is a liquid containing 28%&amp;ndash;30% alcohol. In a second pass, the amount of alcohol is augmented to about 40%.

German cider, usually called ''[[Apfelwein]]'' (apple wine), and regionally known as ''Ebbelwoi'', ''Apfelmost'' (apple must), ''Viez'' (from [[Latin]] ''vice'', the second or substitute wine), or ''Saurer Most'' (sour must), has an alcohol content of 5.5%&amp;ndash;7% and a tart, sour taste.

German cider is mainly produced and consumed in [[Hessen]], particularly in the [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], [[Wetterau]], and [[Odenwald]] areas, in Moselfranken, [[Merzig]] ([[Saarland]]) and the [[Trier]] area, as well as the lower [[Saar (river)|Saar]] area and the region bordering on Luxembourg and in the area along the [[Neckar]] River in [[Swabia]]. In these regions, several large producers, as well as numerous small, private producers, often use traditional recipes. An official ''Viez'' route or cider route connects [[Saarburg]] with the border to Luxembourg.

==== Ireland ====
[[File:Magners cider.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Magners cider]]

Cider is a popular drink in Ireland. A single cider, [[Bulmers (Republic of Ireland)|Bulmers]], dominates sales in Ireland: owned by [[C&amp;C Group plc|C&amp;C]] and produced in [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]], Bulmers has a connected history to the British Bulmers cider brand up until 1949. Outside the Republic of Ireland, C&amp;C brand their cider as Magners. It is very popular in Ireland to drink cider over ice and encouraged in their advertising. [[Cidona]], a non-alcoholic version of Bulmers, is a popular [[soft drink]] in Ireland and used to be a C&amp;C-owned brand. However, in recent years, other ciders have begun to take a large share in the market, for example, Heineken's 'Orchard Thieves'.

There has been a renaissance in the smaller artisanal cider producers since 2010. These now number more than a dozen across the island of Ireland and offer the consumer a broad range of differing, typically non-mainstream flavour profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciderireland.com|title=Cider Ireland {{!}} the best source for real cider in Ireland|website=www.ciderireland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Orchard Thieves - Heineken Ireland|publisher=Heineken|url=http://www.heinekenireland.ie/Brands/Orchard-Thieves/#| accessdate=26 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====

Cider was once widely produced in [[Northern Italy]]'s apple growing regions, with a marked decline during [[Economy of Italy under Fascism, 1922–1943|fascist rule]], due to the introduction of a law banning the industrial production of alcoholic beverages derived from fruits of less than 7% [[ABV]], which was aimed at protecting [[Italian wine|wine producers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sottocoperta.net/cucina/enologia/art24.htm |title=SIDRO: TRA I FOLLETTI E LE FATE&amp;nbsp;... |author=Henry Tiziana |publisher=sottocoperta.net |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Present laws and regulations are favourable to cider makers, but production has only survived in a few [[Alps|alpine]] locations, mostly in the regions of [[Trentino]], and in [[Piedmont]], where it is known as ''vin ëd pom'' (apple wine) or ''pomada'', because it traditionally was left to ferment in a vat along with grape [[pomace]], giving it a distinctive reddish colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialissimo.it/eventi/osservatorio-sidro.asp |title=Osservatorio per il sidro |publisher=specialissimo.it |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, cider is not as commonly available as in its surrounding countries. In 2007, [[Heineken]] started testing a cider-based drink branded [[Jillz]] in a number of bars throughout the country. The beverage, an [[alcopop]] made by blending sparkling water, fruit flavoring, malt, and cider, is marketed towards female drinkers as an alternative to beer. At the same time, Heineken also introduced Strongbow Gold as a secondary brand to provide the choice of a real cider, which was targeted to a male audience. Both beverages contain 5% alcohol by volume, which is similar to a typical draught beer in the Netherlands. Other brands are available in supermarkets, most noticeably Magners and Savanna Dry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savannacider.nl/info.html|title=Savanna Cider|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in liquor stores, generally, a broader range may be obtained.

====Norway====
In Norway, cider (sider) is a naturally fermented apple juice. Pear juice is sometimes mixed with the apple to get a better fermenting process started.

Three brands of sparkling cider with an abv of approximately 10% are available to the Norwegian public through distribution by the monopoly outlet [[Vinmonopolet]], ''Hardanger Sider Sprudlande'' from [[Hardanger]], ''Krunesider'' from [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] sourcing apples from Hardanger, and ''Liersider'' from [[Lier, Norway|Lier]].&lt;ref name=BT&gt;{{cite web |last=Hofseth |first=Arne, ''Bergens Tidende'' |title=Sprudlande Hardanger i stettglas |url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/hordaland/article271897.ece |date=2006-05-29 |language=Norwegian |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316050112/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/hordaland/article271897.ece |archive-date=2007-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VG&gt;{{cite web |last=Jacobsen |first=Aase E., ''VG'' |title=Brusende nasjonalfølelse |url=http://www.vg.no/pub/vgart.hbs?artid=139419 |date=2006-05-29 |language=Norwegian |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112061911/http://www.vg.no/pub/vgart.hbs?artid=139419 |archive-date=2009-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the law of 1975 prohibiting all advertising of alcoholic beverages of abv above 2.5%,&lt;ref name=alkoloven&gt;{{cite web |last=Stortinget |title=Alkoholloven |url=http://www.stortinget.no/inno/2004/200405-019-005.html |language=Norwegian |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512173522/http://www.stortinget.no/inno/2004/200405-019-005.html |archive-date=2011-05-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the products receive little exposure despite a few favourable press reviews.&lt;ref name=VG/&gt;&lt;ref name=aperitif/&gt;

Ciders of low alcohol levels are widely available, mostly brands imported from Sweden; carbonated soft drinks with no alcoholic content may also be marketed as "cider".&lt;ref name=aperitif&gt;{{cite web |last=Ørjasæter |first=Lars Ola, ''Aperitif'' |title=Nødvendig opprydding |url=http://www.aperitif.no/index.db2?id=82063 |date=2005-04-20 |language=Norwegian |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229200758/http://www.aperitif.no/index.db2?id=82063 |archive-date=2008-02-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal====
Cider was once very popular in [[Northern Portugal]]&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/1504.pdf |title=A Região dos Vinhos Verdes |page=139|author=Hélder Marques|publisher=Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|year= 1987|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where its production was larger than wine production until the 11th century,&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; but nowadays, its popularity has decreased and it is only consumed in the coasts of Minho, Âncora e Lima, where it is used as a refreshment for thirst. In some festivities, it is still used rather than wine. There's also a traditional production of the drink in [[Madeira]].

====Poland====
Poland is the largest producer of apples in Europe. Cider is known in Poland as Cydr or Jabłecznik. In 2013, Poles drank 2 million litres of cider, which adds up to 1% of the country's annual alcohol sales. Sales more than doubled from the previous year. In the summer of 2014, Minister of Economy [[Janusz Piechociński]] supported in vain the creation of a draft law to legalise television cider publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sedia|first=Giuseppe|date=16 September 2015|url=http://www.krakowpost.com/9952/2015/09/the-rise-of-polish-cider|title= The Rise of Polish Cider|work=[[Krakow Post]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category is just gaining popularity among consumers. Areas strong in cider production are focused around the centre of the country in the [[Masovian Voivodeship|Masovian]] and [[Łódź Voivodeship|Łódź]] voivodeships.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.polskatimes.pl/artykul/957388,cydr-z-polskich-jablek-to-moze-byc-eksportowy-przeboj,id,t.html |title= Cydr z polskich jabłek | author= Joanna Pienczykowska |publisher = Polska The Times | year= 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Large quantities of Polish apple concentrate are exported to UK, Scandinavia, and Ireland for cider production.

====Spain====
[[File:Escanciar.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Asturian cider being poured ("escanciado") in the traditional manner]]
[[File:Sidra Natural Piñera.jpeg|thumb|upright|Asturian cider]]
The making and drinking of cider is traditional in several areas of northern Spain, mainly [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the [[Asturias|Principality of Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

The largest producer of cider in Spain is the Atlantic region of Asturias, where cider is considered not only a beverage but an intrinsic part of its culture and folklore. Asturias amounts more than 80% of the whole production of Spain. The consumption of cider in Asturias is of 54 litres per person/year, probably the highest in any European region.
One of the most popular ciders in Spain is called "El Gaitero" (the bagpipe player) which can be found everywhere in Spain and which is produced in this region. However, it must not be confused with the traditional Asturian cider as it is a sparkling cider more in the way of French ciders. It is a factory produced cider, sweet and very foamy, much like lambrusco, different from the more artisan and traditional cider productions. Recently, new apple tree plantations have been started in grounds belonging to the old coal mines, once important in Asturias.

The first testimony about cider in Asturias was made by Greek geographer Strabo in 60 BC.

The traditional Asturian ''sidra'' is a still cider of 4&amp;ndash;8% strength, although there are other varieties. Traditionally, it is served in ''sidrerías'' and ''chigres'', pubs specializing in cider where it is also possible to have other drinks as well as traditional food. One of the most outstanding characteristics is that it is poured in very small quantities from a height into a wide glass, with the arm holding the bottle extended upwards and the one holding the glass extended downwards. This technique is called ''escanciar un culín'' (also ''echar un culín'') and is done to get air bubbles into the drink (''espalmar''), thus giving it a sparkling taste like Champagne that lasts a very short time.
Cider is also poured from barrels in the traditional Espichas.

[[File:Sagardotegian txotxetik edaten.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basque people]] drinking cider in a ''[[sagardotegi]]'' (cider house)]]
Cider has also been popular in the Basque Country for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applejournal.com/fr05.htm|quote="...Before the Christian era, the various peoples of Europe had succeeded in producing beverages more or less similar to cider from a variety of fruit. STABON, the Greek geographer, described the abundance of apple and pear trees in Gaul and mentioned the 'Phitarra' in the Basque country, which was a beverage obtained by boiling pieces of apples in water with honey..."|title=Cider history. Volcler, Societe|website=applejournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst [[Txakoli]] and [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]] wines became more popular in Biscay, Álava, and Navarre during the 19th century, there is still a strong [[Basque cider]] culture in [[Gipuzkoa]]. From the 1980s, government and gastronomic associations have worked to revive this culture in all Basque regions. Known as ''sagardoa'' (IPA: /s̺a'gardoa/), it is drunk either bottled or in a [[cider house]] (called a ''[[sagardotegi]]''), where it is poured from barrels. Most of "sagardotegis" are in the north of [[Gipuzkoa]] (Astigarraga, Hernani, Urnieta, and Usurbil), but they can be found everywhere in Gipuzkoa, the northwest of [[Navarre]] and the [[Northern Basque Country]].

Cider tasting events are popular in the Basque province of Gipuzkoa, where stalls are set up on the street selling the drink from several producers at cheap prices and served until stock runs out.

====Sweden====
[[File:Rekorderlig berries.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A glass of [[Rekorderlig]] wild-berries cider]]
Due to Swedish law, stores in Sweden cannot sell cider with less than 15 percentage juice by volume under the name Cider.&lt;ref name="Livsmedelsverkets föreskrifter om cider | LIVSFS 2005:11(H 161) (Swedish)"&gt;[http://www.slv.se/upload/dokument/Lagstiftning/2005-2006/2005-11.pdf Livsmedelsverkets författningssamling LIVSFS 2005:11 (H 161)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511161632/http://www.slv.se/upload/dokument/Lagstiftning/2005-2006/2005-11.pdf |date=2011-05-11 }}, (2009-10-21) (in Swedish).&lt;/ref&gt; "Cider" with none or less than 15% juice is instead usually sold as ''"Apple/Pear beverage of cider character"'' (Swedish: ''"Äpple-/Pärondryck med Ciderkaraktär"''). Brands of cider in Sweden include [[Rekorderlig]], [[Kivik]], [[Herrljunga Cider|Herrljunga]] and [[Kopparbergs Brewery|Kopparberg]].

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland cider is called ''Suure Most'' or ''Saft'' in the German-speaking part, ''Cidre'' in the [[Romandy]], and ''Sidro'' in the Italian-speaking regions. The drink was made popular in the 19th century when apple production increased due to progress in [[pomology]]. At the turn of the century, cider consumption was at 28.1 Liter per person. In the 1920s, advantages in the [[pasteurisation]] of apple juice and the emerging [[temperance movement]] led to a strong decrease of cider production.&lt;ref name="Kulinarisches Erbe der Schweiz (German)"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160405192315/http://www.kulinarischeserbe.ch/product.aspx?id=448 Die Texte zu den Produkten sind in der Regel in der jeweiligen Landessprache abgefasst] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, typical Swiss cider consists of fermented apple juice mixed with 30% fresh juice which is added for sweetness. This drink is then [[pasteurised]] and [[Carbonation#Natural and artificial carbonation|force-carbonated]]. Imported cider is not common as according to Swiss laws cider must contain more than 70% of juice.&lt;ref name="Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Ernährung SGE: Das Cassis-de-Dijon-Prinzip"&gt;[http://www.sge-ssn.ch/media/spezial_2-11_d.pdf Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Ernährung SGE: Das Cassis-de-Dijon-Prinzip] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{Main|Cider in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Cider-strongbow.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[pint glass]] of [[Strongbow cider]]]]
There are two broad main traditions in cider production in the UK: the West Country tradition and the eastern Kent and [[East Anglia]] tradition. The former are made using a much higher percentage of true [[cider apple]]s and so are richer in tannins and sharper in flavour. Kent and East Anglia ciders tend to use a higher percentage of or are exclusively made from, culinary and dessert fruit; they tend to be clearer, more vinous and lighter in body and flavour.

At one end of the scale are the traditional, small [[farm]]-produced varieties. These are non-carbonated and usually cloudy orange in appearance. Britain's West Country contains many of these farms which have an abundance of ancient varieties of specialist cider-apples. Production is often on such a small scale, the product being sold only at the site of manufacture or in local [[public house|pubs]] and shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/travel/fare-of-the-country-england-s-realm-of-cider-with-a-kick.html?sec=travel&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Fare of the country; England's Realm Of Cider With a Kick|date=1989-04-02|accessdate=2006-06-20 |publisher=The New York Times | first=Paul | last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end of the scale are the factories mass-producing brands such as [[Strongbow Cider|Strongbow]] and [[Blackthorn Cider|Blackthorn]].

Mass-produced cider, such as that produced by [[H. P. Bulmer|Bulmers]], is likely to be [[pasteurised]] and [[Carbonation#Natural and artificial carbonation|force-carbonated]]. The colour is likely to be golden yellow with a clear appearance from the [[filtration]]. ''White ciders'' are almost colourless in appearance.

===South America===
====Argentina====
In Argentina, cider, or ''sidra'' is by far the most popular alcoholic [[carbonated]] drink during the [[Christmas]] and New Year holidays. It has traditionally been considered the choice of the middle and lower classes (along with ''ananá fizz ''and pineapple juice), whereas the higher classes would rather go for champagne or local sparkling wines for their Christmas or New Year toast. Popular commercial brands of cider are ''Real'', ''La Victoria'', "Rama Caida", Tunuyan. It is usually marketed in 0.72&amp;nbsp;litre glass or plastic bottles. However, there has been lately a campaign by some bottlers to make cider a drink consumed all year round, in any occasion, and not only seasonally. Cider now comes in smaller bottle sizes and commercials show people drinking at any time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYyGzexJ9o|title=Sidra Real|date=15 November 2011|work=YouTube|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and not only toasting with it around a traditional Christmas or New Year table).

====Chile====
Cider has been made in Chile since [[Colonial Chile|colonial times]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016|New Market Report="Cider/Perry in Chile - New Market Report." ClickPress, 27 June 2016. Infotrac Newsstand, http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A456567342/STND?u=ccsf_main&amp;sid=STND&amp;xid=c0688ee3.}} [[Zona Sur, Chile|Southern Chile]] accounts for nearly all cider production in the country. Chileans make a distinction between "''sidra''" ("cider"), in fact, sparkling cider, and "''chicha de manzana''" ("apple [[chicha]]"), a homemade cider that is considered of less quality.

====Uruguay====
Cider [[Fizz (cocktail)|fizz]] or fizz is a cider variety made by mixing and fermenting various fruit juices other than apple with cider, as ''ananá fizz'' (pineapple juice), ''frutilla fizz'' (strawberry juice) or ''durazno fizz'' (peach juice).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Asia===
====East Asia====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Usually, cider in East Asia refers to a [[soft drink]] similar to [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] or [[lemonade]].

A popular drink in China is called "Apple Vinegar", which is apple juice. Shanxi Province is noted for the "vinegar" produced there.

In Japan, The terms {{nihongo|"cidre"|シードル|shīdoru}} or "apple [[sparkling wine]]" refer to the alcoholic beverage. Cidre is also used as a marketing term to describe canned or bottled ciders containing a cider widget or ciders which are cold-filtered rather than pasteurised. The term "cidre bouché" applies to higher quality cider sold in champagne-style bottles. Many ciders are sold in corked bottles, but some screw-top bottles exist.

==== India ====
Recent economic growth has led to development of new categories of alcohol in India. Cider is one such category. New product launches are seen in almost all metropolitan cities. The nuanced taste and rich legacy of cider from the British era helps the prospects of the drink in the bored scenario of pale lagers.

Also a filtereded non-alcoholic carbonated apple juice called "[[Appy Fizz]]" was introduced by Parle in India in 2005 and it became an instant hit. Recently, they have decided to push the brand beyond the Rupees 1000 crore mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/X3uFw16lYwB4gWv5n0O82O/Parle-Agro-plans-Rs100-crore-marketing-push-for-Appy-Fizz.html|title=Parle Agro plans Rs100 crore marketing push for Appy Fizz|last=Tewari|first=Saumya|date=2018-05-11|work=livemint.com/|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
Non-alcoholic, apple-flavoured carbonated drinks are popular in the country, with local brands such as Mehran Bottler's Apple Sidra and [[Murree Brewery]]'s Big Apple in the market.

===Africa===
====Kenya====
East African Breweries launched Tusker Premium Cider in 2017.

====South Africa====
There are two main brands of cider produced in South Africa, Hunters and Savanna Dry. They are produced and distributed through [[Distell Group Limited]]. Hunters Gold was first introduced in South Africa in 1988 as an alternative to beer. The Hunters range includes Hunters Dry, Hunters Gold, Hunters Export and Hunters Edge launched in April 2017. [[Savanna Dry]] was introduced in 1996 and also comes in a Light Premium variety as well as in a Savanna Dark variant.

===Oceania===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

====Australia====
The composition of cider is defined in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and "means the fruit wine prepared from the juice or must of apples and no more than 25% of the juice or must of pears".
Cider has been made in Australia since its early settlement. Primarily this production has been for limited local usage, with national commercial distribution and sales dominated by two brands: Mercury Cider and Strongbow. Since early 2005, they have been joined in the market by numerous new producers including [[Three Oaks Cider]], [[Pipsqueak (cider)|Pipsqueak]], and [[Tooheys Brewery|Tooheys 5 Seeds Cider]] as well as imported brands like [[Magners]], [[Weston's Cider|Weston's]], [[Monteith's]], [[Kopparbergs Brewery|Kopparberg]], Rekorderlig, and [[Somersby cider|Somersby]].

With the growth in interest in cider, the number of local producers has increased. Some cider producers are attempting to use more traditional methods and traditional cider apple varieties such as Henry's of Harcourt and Crucible in S.W. Victoria. Other smaller brands rely on the available culinary (standard eating - supermarket and cooking apples) fruit. In the Yarra Valley early producers were Kelly Brothers cider and Lilydale. Later came Napoleone &amp; Co. The Bridge Road Brewery and Amulet Winery, both in Victoria's Beechworth, have released ciders. South Australia's boutique ciders include Lobo (Adelaide Hills), The Hills Cider (Adelaide Hills), Thorogoods (Burra), and Aussie Cider (Barossa). In [[Western Australia]], the number of cider producers has also grown in the southwest region, particularly in areas where wine is also produced with producers in [[Denmark, Western Australia|Denmark]], [[Pemberton, Western Australia|Pemberton]], and [[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]]. In [[Tasmania]], there are a number of boutique cider makers including Red Sails (Middleton), Pagan Cider (Huon Valley), Dickens Cider (Tamar Valley), and Spreyton Cider (Spreyton). Willie Smiths is a medium to large producer of commercial and craft cider.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, cider is categorised as a fruit wine and the rules which define what can be called a cider are very lax – the standards do not even specify a minimum for the amount of apple juice required to call a drink "cider".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2011C00589|title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 2.7.3 - Fruit Wine and Vegetable Wine|last=Health|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time [[Ready to Drink]] beverages are not permitted for sale in supermarkets and grocery outlets. These two factors have resulted in the production of a wide range of low juice content, sweet, often flavoured drinks under the "cider" banner being used to circumvent this restriction. Most of these ciders are produced and marketed by the three large brewers (Lion Nathan, DB and Independent).

Most New Zealand ciders are made from concentrate or from reject apples from the country's significant export apple industry. These ciders are made year round with little consideration given to maturation.

A few producers have demonstrated that NZ's excellence in apple production can translate into the manufacture of world class ciders. [[Peckham's Cider]] is the principal producer in this class. They make whole juice ciders from apples grown specifically for cidermaking, principally from their own orchard of 30 heritage cider varieties. They have won Champion Cider in the NZ Cider Awards in 2015, 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidernz.com/awards.html|title=Awards|website=CIDER NEW ZEALAND|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abel Cider of Nelson is another producer to make vintage cider from 100% freshly harvested apples and pears. Unlike the bulk producers, Abel hand harvest tree ripened fruit, crush it, then ferment until dry. Abel is unfined and unfiltered, meaning they allow the cider to naturally clarify via gravity; this gentle process helps preserve the natural fruit characteristics.

All mass-produced ciders in New Zealand are loosely regulated with their minimum content of fruit juice and alcohol content (mostly 4 to 5%).

[[Lion Nathan|Lion]] produces Isaac's ciders from concentrate under the Mac's trademark. The range includes three artificial flavours: apple, pear, and berry with limited edition ciders that are released seasonally. Their [[Speight's]] brand also makes a cider from concentrate.

The [[Dominion Breweries]] brands [[Monteith's]] Brewery in [[Greymouth]] on the west coast of the South Island makes an apple and a pear cider while their Old Mout Cider – based in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in the South Island – is blending fruit wines with cider to create fruit ciders including boysenberry and feijoa varieties. Rekorderlig Cider (Pear, Wild Berries, Mango and Raspberry, Strawberry and Lime, Apple and Blackcurrant and Apple and spice), and Johnny Arrow Cider are another two brands owned by this company.

=== North America ===
In the US, "[[apple cider|cider]]" refers to unfiltered apple juice, traditionally made with a distinct sweet-tart taste, and in these regions, the fermented beverage is known as "hard cider". In Canada, the terms "cider" and "apple cider" are interchangeable although they generally refer to alcoholic and juice beverages, respectively.

==== Canada ====
Cider is produced commercially in every Canadian province except Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan, usually with a 5–7% alcohol content although the term is also used for some non-fermented apple juices. According to the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, alcoholic cider is an alcoholic fermentation of apple juice that does not contain more than 13% absolute alcohol by volume (ABV) or less than 2.5% ABV. [[File:Verger lafrance.jpg|thumb|Frozen apples in Quebec for the making of ice cider]]

[[Quebec cider]] is considered a traditional alcoholic beverage. It is generally sold in 750&amp;nbsp;ml bottles, has an alcohol content generally between 7% and 13% (with aperitifs ciders having alcohol content up to 20%), and can be served as a substitute for wine. As in the rest of the world, sparkling cider is getting more and more popular in Quebec and thanks to the law cider sold in the province can only be made from 100% pure apple juice.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Cider making was, however, forbidden from the early years of British rule as it was in direct conflict with established British brewers' interests (most notably [[John Molson]]). In recent years, a new type called [[ice cider]] has been sold. This type of cider is made from apples with a particularly high level of sugar caused by natural frost.

====Mexico====
Two types of cider (''sidra'') are sold in Mexico. One type is a popular apple-flavoured, carbonated soft drink, sold under a number of soft drink brands, such as [[Sidral Mundet]] and [[Manzana Lift]] (both [[Coca-Cola]] [[FEMSA]] brands), [[Manzanita Sol]] (owned by [[PepsiCo]]), and [[Sidral Aga]] from Group AGA. The other type, alcoholic ''sidra'', is a sparkling cider typically sold in Champagne-style bottles with an alcohol content comparable to beer. ''Sidra'' was, due to the expense of imported [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]], sometimes used as a substitute for [[New Year's Eve]] toasts in Mexico, as it is also a sweet, fruity drink. However, now the practice is to drink cider on Christmas Eve, celebrated with the family, and Champagne on New Year's celebrated with friends. Cider beverages form a very small share of the Mexican alcoholic beverage market, with the figures for 2009 volume sales amounting to only 3.8&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;litres.

{{main|Cider in the United States}}

In the United States, the definition of "cider" is usually broader than in Europe and specifically Ireland and the UK. There are two types, one being traditional alcoholic ''hard cider'' and the other ''sweet'' or ''soft cider'', often simply called ''apple cider''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17171">{{main|Automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010}}

The Canadian auto industry is closely linked to the U.S., due to the [[Automotive Products Trade Agreement]] and later the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and is in similar trouble.  Canada's 3,500 car dealers, which employ 140,000 people, told the federal and Ontario governments in mid-November they are at risk from the financial crisis; they are asking the national government to help out despite a record year{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} of sales.  Ottawa is considering providing financial aid to the Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three, and possibly auto parts companies as well. The auto industry argued that loan guarantees and other help would try to save tens of thousands of Canadian jobs threatened by the sudden drop in North American car sales. Chrysler Canada has asked for $1 billion in aid, making it the only Canadian arm of the Big Three to make a specific dollar request.

Industry analyst Anthony Faria criticized the labor contracts that [[Canadian Auto Workers]] then-president [[Buzz Hargrove]] negotiated with the [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big Three US automobile manufacturers]] in 2007, predicting that the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and currency would hit Canadian auto production especially hard. Faria noted that [[UAW]] president [[Ron Gettelfinger]] agreed to have the UAW's "all-in" wage, benefit and pension costs drop from a high of $75.86 per hour in 2007 to an average of about $51 per hour starting in 2010. By comparison, the CAW's cost per hour was $77 in 2007 and will rise to over $80 per hour by the end of the new contract. Faria said that Gettelfinger went into negotiations "with the right intention...Save jobs. The CAW strategy was to squeeze every dime out of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris Vander |last=Doelen |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=63a938bc-58fa-4795-9ec4-10741d105193 |title=Thousands of CAW auto job losses predicted |work=The Windsor Star |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215053440/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=63a938bc-58fa-4795-9ec4-10741d105193 |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hargrove was said to have "instilled backbone and an attitude that the union could always make the auto makers buckle at the bargaining table".&lt;ref name="business.theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Derek Decloet |url=http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090309.wdecloet0310/BNStory/robColumnsBlogs/home |title=reportonbusiness.com: Columns and Blogs |publisher=Business.theglobeandmail.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313035141/http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090309.wdecloet0310/BNStory/robColumnsBlogs/home |archivedate=2009-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current union president [[Ken Lewenza, Sr.|Ken Lewenza]] has argued that labor is not responsible for the bankruptcy crisis facing the Big Three automakers, saying that his members would not make concessions part of any taxpayer-funded bailout. "We don't see this as us being the problem", Lewenza said, adding he would "absolutely not" accept any further cuts after losing tens of thousands of jobs in recent years. "We've suffered our share of pain."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5grcl5q0uPoqkOoWENxe22Q3dbqwg]{{dead link|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lawenza argued that the CAW agreed in 2007 to make concessions that will save the Big Three $900 million over three years.&lt;ref&gt;"Car dealers plead for government help," 
[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081121.wcdeals1121/BNStory/National/home ''The Canadian Press'' Nov. 21, 2008 online]; "Labour rates not a problem in auto industry: Lewenza," [http://www.edmontonsun.com/Business/News/2008/11/20/7474801.html Canadian Press, Nov. 20, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123013323/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081121.wcdeals1121/BNStory/National/home |date=November 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]] has criticized the CAW's "no-concession" stance, saying that it only serves to strengthen the opposition to a taxpayer-funded bailout for the struggling Detroit Three automakers. The CTF further pointed out that "It is especially difficult to understand anyone asking for government help that refuses to do anything to help itself to begin with", since they "fail to realize they've existed at the substantial largesse of taxpayers for decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Grace |last=Macaluso |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=c07f9882-2f99-4479-b067-831ac302129a |title=Lewenza 'petulant' child |work=The Windsor Star |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215051012/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=c07f9882-2f99-4479-b067-831ac302129a |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly McParland, a columnist for the [[National Post]], has suggested that "if he won't give anything, he and his members are likely to lose everything." He also said that the problem facing the North American auto industry was borne equally by management and labor alike, criticizing labor for building up pay and benefits for themselves that was as unsustainable as it was enviable, while attacking management for its short-term strategy of selling gas-guzzling trucks and sales tactics (price cuts, rebates, free gas and cash-back schemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kelly |last=McParland |url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2008/11/19/kelly-mcparland-stop-the-revolution-the-caw-wants-to-get-off.aspx |title=Kelly McParland: Stop the revolution, the CAW wants to get off |publisher=National Post |date=November 19, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-12 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CTF has opposed the proposed $3.5 CAD billion bailout for Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three, saying that it was an unfair financial burden on the average Canadian, as well as another excuse for the Detroit automakers to postpone much needed change. The CTF noted that federal and provincial governments spent $782-million in the past five years on the Big Three, saying "These have been a bottomless pit of requests for cash". Lewenza disagreed, saying that the bailout should be seen by Canadians as a loan that will be paid back when the country's economy is prosperous again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Linda |last=Nguyen |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=1073285 |title=Canadian taxpayers and auto union butt heads over bailout |agency=Canwest News Service |publisher=National Post |date=2008-12-13 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, the government of Canada and the province of [[Ontario]] offered $3.3 billion in loans to the auto industry. Under the plan [[General Motors|GM]] will receive $3 billion and [[Chrysler]] will receive the rest. [[Ford]] only asked for a line of credit but will not be participating in the bailout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Austen |first=Ian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/worldbusiness/21canada.html?ref=business |title=Canada Agrees to Its Own Auto Industry Bailout |location=Canada |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAW negotiated a cost-cutting deal with General Motors Canada on March 8, 2009. The deal would extend the current contract for an additional year to September 2012, and preserves the current average assembly-worker base pay of about $34 an hour. It would eliminate a $1,700 annual "special bonus," and reduce special paid absences or "SPA days" from two weeks to one week a year, while maintaining vacation entitlements which range up to six weeks a year for high-seniority workers. The deal also introduce payments by members toward their health benefits - $30 monthly per family for workers and $15 a month for pensioners. Lewenza said it also would trim by 35 per cent company contributions to union-provided programs such as child care and wellness programs. Lewenza called the package a "major sacrifice." However, observers noted that the deal did not go far enough; DBRS analyst Kam Hon described it as "not material." Automotive industry consultant [[Dennis DesRosiers]] said that General Motors had missed the chance to slash labour costs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/CityandRegion/2009/03/09/8687446.html |title=London Free Press - City &amp; Region - GM missed the boat, auto analyst says |publisher=Lfpress.ca |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}{{dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that bankruptcy was a looming threat, Ottawa and Queen's Park demanded cuts to the labour bill as a condition of the bailout, and that the deficit to the pension fund would prevent the CAW from striking.&lt;ref name="business.theglobeandmail.com"/&gt; He estimated the total hourly cost of a GM Canada worker, including benefits, is $75 to $78, and saying that "they [GM] got six or seven" when it should have been cut by $20. DesRosiers also said giving up cost-of-living increases is not significant when inflation is nearly non-existent and added that the 40-hour reduction in [[paid time off]] merely means "five fewer spa days." [[University of Toronto]] professor Joe D'Cruz calculated that it would save $148 million a year, though GM is seeking $6 billion in Canadian government support.

The agreement is contingent on Canada being allocated 20% of GM's North American, and getting billions of dollars in federal and provincial taxpayer support, which Lewenza stressed will be loans. However, some suggested that this would not be the final time that automakers would request a bailout.&lt;ref name="financialpost1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=1343240 |title=John Ivison: Automotive bailout must not be free ride |publisher=Financialpost.com |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2009-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402161023/http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=1343240 |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dennis DesRosiers estimated that GM will go through its government loans in a couple of quarters, long before any recovery in the market. Furthermore, GM Canada president Arturo Elias had admitted to MP [[Frank Valeriote]] that GM had pledged all its assets worldwide to the U.S. government in order to secure the first [[tranche]] of a US$30-billion loan, leaving no assets to collateralize the $6 billion loan from the Canadian government. The Canadian Taxpayers' Federation noted that between 1982 and 2005, Ottawa handed out over $18.2 billion to corporations, of which only $7.1 billion was repayable, and only $1.3 billion was ever repaid.
&lt;ref name="financialpost2"/&gt;

Chrysler vice-chairman and president [[Thomas W. LaSorda]] (himself the son of a CAW official) and Ford's chief of manufacturing Joe Hinrichs said that the GM-CAW deal was insufficient, suggesting that they would break the CAW's negotiating pattern set by GM. LaSorda told the [[House of Commons of Canada]] finance committee that he would demand an hourly wage cut of $20, suggested that Chrysler may withdraw from Canada if it fails to achieve more substantial cost savings from the CAW.

On March 31, 2009, the Canadian federal and Ontario governments jointly rejected the restructuring plans submitted by GM and Chrysler. This came a day after US President [[Barack Obama]] had rejected the plans of their parent companies. Both federal Industry Minister [[Tony Clement]] and Ontario Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] suggested the CAW's initial deal was insufficient in cutting costs and the union had return to the bargaining table to make further concessions, in order to show that taxpayers' money is justified.

On May 14, 2018, the Canadian federal government announced it would fall short of breaking even from the bailouts of Chrysler Group LLC and General Motors Co. by $3.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadian-taxpayers-lose-35-billion-on-2009-bailout-of-auto-firms/article23828543/|title=Canadian taxpayers lose $3.5-billion on 2009 bailout of auto firms|publisher=''The Globe and Mail''|date=May 14, 2018|last=Siu|first=Michelle|accessdate=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2018, the remaining undisclosed loan amount was written off.&lt;ref name="CBC180626"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/loans-canada-account-finance-auto-sector-bailout-2009-gm-chrysler-1.4722529|title=Federal government quietly writes off loan — but won't reveal sum or say who got it|publisher=''CBC News''|date=June 26, 2018|last=Beeby|first=Dean|accessdate=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fraser Institute]] estimates the total cost to taxpayers at $3.7 billion that was never repaid.&lt;ref name="CBC180626" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">'''Endola''' is a constituency in the [[Ohangwena Region]] of [[Namibia]], on the border of [[Angola]]. It has 36,659 inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statoids.com/yna.html Constituencies of Namibia, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; the district centre is the settlement of [[Endola]]. Ferdinand Ingashipola Shifidi became a councillor of the constituency in November 2014 and was re-elected in 2015. 

The constituency is hard-hit by the drought just like the rest of the northern region, but the situation was made worse by lack of drinking water for people and their animals as many water points were disconnected because of unpaid bills. The constituency is also faced with the issue of people who have no national documents. Endola is a flood-prone area with many water pans therefore, good roads are needed to avoid a situation where villages are totally cut off during the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ewi.com.na/local-news/water-scarcity-hits-endola-constituency.216776# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827132340/http://www.ewi.com.na/local-news/water-scarcity-hits-endola-constituency.216776# |archive-date=2016-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the crime front, the constituency is badly affected as it has only one police station at Ongha.

==Politics==
As is common in all constituencies of former [[Owamboland]], Namibia's ruling [[South West Africa People's Organization|SWAPO Party]] has dominated elections since [[Independence of Namibia|independence]]. [[Ruth Kepawa Nhinda]] (SWAPO) was regional councillor for the Endola constituency from 2004. Her death in 2014 necessitated a [[by-election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=RDP names candidate for Endola by-election | date=1 October 2014 | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | publisher=[[NAMPA]] | url=https://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=128622}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was won by [[Ferdinand Shifidi]], also SWAPO. Shifidi was reelected in the [[Namibian local and regional elections, 2015|2015 regional election]], gathering 5,703 votes, while the only opposition candidate, Hafeni Pius of the [[Rally for Democracy and Progress (Namibia)|Rally for Democracy and Progress]] (RDP), received 398 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Regional Council Election Results 2015 | publisher=[[Electoral Commission of Namibia]] | date=3 December 2015 | page=13 | url=http://www.ecn.na/documents/27857/223442/Regional+Counils+Election+Results_Duly+elected+candidates+2015.pdf/32493774-80b3-4be3-9ca1-1f6ce187673a?version=1.0 | access-date=2016-06-12 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208163948/http://www.ecn.na/documents/27857/223442/Regional+Counils+Election+Results_Duly+elected+candidates+2015.pdf/32493774-80b3-4be3-9ca1-1f6ce187673a?version=1.0# | archive-date=2015-12-08 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2204">'''Estonian animation''' tradition dates back to the 1930s when the first experimental films were made. The only surviving short film from the era is ''[[Kutsu-Juku seiklusi]]'' (Adventures of Juku the dog) (1931). After the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], and Soviet Occupation interrupted its development, Estonian animation was reborn in 1958. [[Elbert Tuganov]] founded a [[Puppetoon|puppet film]] division [[Nukufilm]] in Tallinnfilm Studio. The first film was titled ''Peetrikese unenägu'' based on a Danish writer Jens Sigsgaard's children story ''Palle alene i verden''. [[Joonisfilm]] a [[Traditional animation|traditional cell animation]] division of Tallinnfilm was founded by [[Rein Raamat]] in 1971. Films like ''Põld'' (1978), nominee for Golden Palm at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1979; ''Lend'' (1973), the winner of Special Jury Award at the [[Zagreb World Festival of Animated Films]]; the ''Suur Tõll'' (1980), 2nd place at [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] in 1982 and ''Põrgu'' (Hell) (1983), the winner of FIPRESCI Prize and Special Jury Award at the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] made Raamat the first internationally recognized Estonian animation director.

Since Estonia regained independence in 1991 Nukufilm and Joonisfilm continued to operate as  private companies owned by the filmmakers. During the era internationally most successful Estonian animation director has been [[Priit Pärn]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0681264/awards Priit Pärn's awards at IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; the winner of  Grand Prize at the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] in 1998 for [[Porgandite öö]] (Night of the Carrots).
''Crocodile'' by Kaspar Jancis was selected to be the Best European Anima film at [[Cartoon d'or]] 2010. The other film of Jancis "Villa Antropoff" was awarded with the Special Mention on Scancroma Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scanorama 2012 winners|url=http://www.filmneweurope.com/news/lithuania/104407-festivals-scanorama-2012-winners/menu-id-156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Council on Foreign Relations''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik e. V. (DGAP)}} is [[Germany]]'s national [[foreign policy]] [[Business network|network]]. As an independent, private, [[non-partisan]] and [[non-profit]] organisation, the Council actively takes part in political decision-making and promotes the understanding of German foreign policy and [[international relations]].

It serves as [[Forum (legal)|forum]] for foreign policy and facilitates a comprehensive network of political, [[economic]] and [[academic]] decision makers. The institution aims at linking foreign politicians to the German public.

==History==
The association was founded in 1955 in [[Bonn]]. The model for the foundation was in many respects the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York and the [[Chatham House]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisermann in „''Außenpolitik und Strategiediskussion''“, „''Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik 1955–1972''“, [[R. Oldenbourg Verlag|Oldenbourg]] Verlag, München 1999, Band 66, S. 62ff, {{ISBN|3-486-56338-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first president of the newly founded DGAP was the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] politician, diplomat and entrepreneur [[Günter Henle]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisermann in „''Außenpolitik und Strategiediskussion''“, „''Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik 1955–1972''“, S. 79f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yugoslavia diplomatic Mission Berlin Rauchstr Drakestr.jpg|thumb|left|The office of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für auswärtige Politik in Berlin]]

Between 1956-1959 in Bonn the DGAP was seated in the villa at [[Joachimstraße 7]] and then between 1965-1966 in the [[Villa Schaumburg-Lippe-Straße 6]]. In 1965 it acquired with the former [[House of Craftsmen]] at Adenauerallee 131a in Bonn, including the [[Villa Adenauerallee 131]], which in later years served as a logo of DGAP, for the first time its own building. It served from April 1966 to 1999 as headquarters of the DPAG.

The current seat of the DGAP is the building of the [[Embassy of Yugoslavia, Berlin|Yugoslav embassy]] in the embassy district in [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Berlin-Tiergarten]].

==Function==
The association works to actively influence the foreign policy opinion-forming at all levels. Its work is aimed at decision-makers in German politics, business, public administration, in NGOs, in the military and to the general public. DGAP publishes the bimonthly journal ''[[Internationale Politik]]''.  It is among other organisers of the [[EU-Russia Forum]]. Internationally known as the "German Council on Foreign Relations", the institution sees itself as a practical [[think tank]] offering demand-driven policy advice on a scientific basis.  It is financed through the contributions of its members, acquired project funds and contributions from sponsors and patrons, including among others, the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]], [[Deutsche Bank]], the [[EADS|European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] and the [[Robert Bosch Stiftung|Robert Bosch Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;''DGAP Webseite'': [https://dgap.org/de/gesellschaft/foerderer/foerdererkreis "Förderer"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The president of DGAP since 2005 has been [[Arend Oetker]], Managing Vice President is the former German diplomat and former ambassador [[Paul Freiherr von Maltzahn]]. The DGAP is a member of the [[European Movement Germany]].

The Council provides:
* A platform for discussions at conferences and in study group meetings as well as at public events.
* Policy oriented analyses from research institute fellows.
* Authoritative publications on contemporary topics by its journal [[Internationale Politik]], the "Jahrbuch Internationale Politik" as well as in the publications from the research institute.
* Expert and extensive [[documentation]] by its [[library]] and documentation section.

The '''Mark''' was the currency of [[German South West Africa]] between 1885 and 1915. Until 1914, the [[German gold mark|German Mark]] circulated. Within days of the outbreak of the [[First World War]], an issue of paper money titled ''Deutsch-Südwestafrikanische Mark'' was authorized in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Marks.

== History ==
From 1884 to 1901, the main currency of German South West Africa was the British Pound Sterling. However, in 1885, the German South West African mark began to be circulated. In 1893, an established rate of £1 for every 20[[German gold mark|ℳ]]. It is worth noting that the gold content of the [[British pound sterling|British Pound Sterling]] was 7.3224 grams, while the gold content of 20 marks was 7.168 grams. According to [[Gresham's law|Gresham's Law]], "bad money drives out good", so the "bad" Mark replaced the "good" British Pound Sterling. In 1901, the German Mark became the official currency of [[German South West Africa]], hence replacing the 20 and 5 mark denominations of the German South West African Mark, for which they were also demonetized (although, they continued use in the metropolis of German South West Africa until 1907). In 1923, the coins of the German South West African Mark were demonetized also. At the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], it was decided to produce cash-coupon banknotes thereafter; this occurred until the occupation by [[South Africa]] in 1915 officially replaced the Mark with the [[South African pound|pound]]. The [[Windhoek]] Chamber of Commerce issued ''Gutscheine'' (vouchers) denominated in [[Pfennig]] and [[Mark (money)|Mark]] between 1916 and 1918.

== Banknotes in 1914 ==
When after the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]] when the cash-coupon banknotes began to be used, were denominated into five denominations, of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 marks.

The '''greater mouse-tailed bat''' (''Rhinopoma microphyllum'') is a species of [[bat]] in the [[Rhinopomatidae]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Schlitter, Duane A., and Mazin B. Qumsiyeh. "[https://academic.oup.com/mspecies/article-pdf/doi/10.2307/3504243/8071428/542-1.pdf Rhinopoma microphyllum]." Mammalian Species 542 (1996): 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in [[Algeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burkina Faso]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Egypt]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Libya]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]], [[Myanmar]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Senegal]], [[Sudan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tunisia]], the [[Western Sahara]] and [[Yemen]]. Its natural [[habitat]] is subtropical or tropical dry [[shrubland]]. They mate at the beginning of spring.

According to a recent research published in [[Royal Society of London]], the species Rhinopoma microphyllum is found to be hibernating at the unusually warm and constant temperature of 68&amp;nbsp;°F in caves in Israel's [[Jordan Rift Valley|Great Rift Valley]]. From October to February, these bats were discovered semi-conscious, breathing only once every 15–30 minutes, with extremely low energy expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciguru.org/newsitem/18645/bat-species-first-mammal-found-hibernating-constant-warm-temperatures | title=Subtropical mouse-tailed bats use geothermally heated caves for winter hibernation |author1=Eran Levin |author2=Brit Plotnik |author3=Eran Amichai |author4=Luzie J.

The '''Group of Ten''' ('''G-10''' or '''G10''') refers to the group of countries that agreed to participate in the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), an agreement to provide the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) with additional funds to increase its lending ability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of Economics|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=76j6OXNgY_4C|publisher = Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9788126905355|language = en|first = S. N.|last = Chand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The GAB was established in 1962, when the governments of eight [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) members&amp;mdash;[[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]&amp;mdash;and the central banks of two others, [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], agreed to make resources available to the IMF with an additional $6 billion of their resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The additional money was intended to allow the IMF to have increased lending resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

In 1964, the funds were used by the IMF to rescue the [[Pound sterling]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The G-10 grew in 1964 by the association of the eleventh member, [[Switzerland]], then a nonmember of the Fund, but the name of the G10 remained the same. In 2011, Spain and Australia followed.  

The Group of Ten signed the [[Smithsonian Agreement]] in December 1971, replacing the world's [[fixed exchange rate]] regime with a [[floating exchange rate]] regime.

== Activities ==
The GAB enables the IMF to borrow specified amounts of currencies from these 11 industrial countries (or their central banks), under certain circumstances. Specifically, a proposal for calls under the GAB may only be made when a proposal for the establishment of an activation period under the [[New Arrangements to Borrow]] (NAB) is not accepted by NAB participants, who number 38 countries, amongst which are the [[BRICS]] nations and Middle Eastern powers.  

The potential amount of credit available to the IMF under the GAB totals [[Special Drawing Rights|SDR]] 17bn (about $26bn), with an additional SDR 1.5bn available under an associated arrangement with [[Saudi Arabia]].  The GAB was established in 1962 and expanded in 1983 to SDR 17bn, from about SDR 6bn. It has been activated ten times, the last time in 1998. The GAB and the associated credit arrangement with Saudi Arabia have been renewed, without modifications, for a period of five years from December 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/gabnab.htm imf.org: Factsheet - IMF Standing Borrowing Arrangements], 30 Apr 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observers ===
The following international organizations are official observers of the activities of the G10: the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS), [[European Commission]], [[International Monetary Fund]], and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. [[Luxembourg]] is an associate member.

'''''Hemidactylus bouvieri''''', also known as '''Bouvier's leaf-toed gecko''' or '''Cape Verde leaf-toed gecko''', is a [[species]] of [[gecko]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Gekkonidae]].&lt;ref name="RDB"&gt;{{NRDB species|genus=Hemidactylus|species=bouvieri|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[Cape Verde]] Islands and is listed as critically endangered. It has been found on the islands of [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]], [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]], [[Santa Luzia, Cape Verde|Santa Luzia]], [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]], [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and [[Ilhéu Raso]].&lt;ref name=arnold&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/carranza/pdf/HemidactylusCapeVerde2008.pdf |title= Systematics, biogeography and evolution of the endemic Hemidactylus geckos (Reptilia, Squamata, Gekkonidae) of the Cape Verde Islands: based on morphology and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences|author1=E.N.

''H. bouvieri'' was originally described and named by [[Marie Firmin Bocourt]] in 1870. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''bouvieri'', is in honor of French zoologist [[Aimé Bouvier]] (died 1919).&lt;ref name="RDB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

'''Hrabia''' (abbreviated ''hr.'' before a surname) is the title used for a rank of Polish nobility roughly corresponding to that of a [[Count]]. An earlier counterpart, ''[[komes]]'', was used for a non-hereditary office in [[Piast Poland]] and faded from use before the establishment of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. 

The wife of a ''hrabia'' is a ''hrabina'', and the daughter a ''hrabianka''; the territory he governs is a ''hrabstwo'' (pronounced "HRAHP-stvoh").

The '''Human Genome Organisation''' ('''HUGO''') is an organization involved in the [[Human Genome Project]], a project about mapping the human genome.  HUGO was established in 1989 as an international organization, primarily to foster collaboration between genome scientists around the world.  The [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee]] (HGNC), sometimes referred to as "HUGO", is one of HUGO's most active committees and aims to assign a unique gene name and symbol to each human gene.

==History==
HUGO was established in late April 1988 at the first meeting dedicated to genome mapping at Cold Spring Harbor. The idea of starting the organization stemmed from a South African biologist by the name of [[Sydney Brenner]], who is known for his significant contributions to work on the genetic code and other areas of molecular biology, as well as winning the Nobel prize in Physiology of Medicine in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sydney Brenner]]&lt;/ref&gt; A Founding Council was elected at the meeting with a total of 42 scientists from 17 different countries. HUGO is grounded in Geneva Switzerland, and later went on to elect an additional 178 members, bringing the total up to 220.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hugo-international.org/HUGO-History|title=Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) International Ltd. - History|website=www.hugo-international.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Journey by Moonlight''''' ({{lang-hu|Utas és holdvilág}}, literally "Traveler and Moonlight") is among the best-known novels in contemporary Hungarian literature. Written by [[Antal Szerb]], it was first published in 1937. According to [[Nicholas Lezard]], it is "one of the greatest works of modern European literature...I can't remember the last time I did this: finished a novel and then turned straight back to page one to start it over again. That is, until I read ''Journey by Moonlight''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/28/fiction.reviews1|last=Lezard|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Lezard|title=Just divine|date=28 July 2001|accessdate=5 February 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot introduction==
The novel follows Mihály, a [[Budapest]] native from a [[bourgeois]] family on his honeymoon in Italy, as he encounters and attempts to make sense of his past. The novel features his romantic figure, aloof and poetic, but struggling to break with an adolescent rebelliousness which he tries to quell under respectable bourgeois conformism, but also with the disturbing attraction of an erotic death-wish. There is no doubt an element of  [[Freudianism]] in this. Psychoanalysis was especially influential and risqué at the time. Also present is perhaps the sexual and emotional claustrophobia of a society with strong [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and marital traditions. These influences notwithstanding, the novel has a distinct originality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

A '''''kgotla''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|t|.|l|ə}} is a public meeting, community council or [[customary law|traditional law]] court of a [[Botswana]] village. It is usually headed by the village [[Tribal chief|chief]] or headman, and community decisions are always arrived at by [[consensus]]. Anyone at all is allowed to speak, and no one may interrupt while someone is "having their say". In fact there is a [[Setswana]] saying that the highest form of war is dialogue (''[[ntwa kgolo ke ya molomo]]''). Because of this tradition, Botswana claims to be one of the world's oldest [[democracy|democracies]].{{cn| date= October 2017}}

The custom of allowing everyone their full say is carried over into meetings of all kinds, from discussing a bill to a staff briefing, and can mean meetings last many hours.{{cn| date= October 2017}}

''Kgotla'' can also refer to the place where such meetings are held. This can range from a few chairs under a shade canopy to a permanent ground with covered seating. In both senses, the term is a [[loan word]] in Botswana English from [[Setswana]], where it means ''court''.{{cn| date= October 2017}}

In [[South African English]], a '''''lekgotla''''' is a meeting called by government to discuss strategy planning. The term is still a loan word from [[Setswana language|Setswana]], again meaning ''court''.{{cn| date= October 2017}}

'''Laugavegur''' ({{IPA-is|ˈlœi:ɣaˌvɛɣ.ʏr}}) is the primary commercial artery of downtown [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] and one of the oldest shopping streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chark|first1=Jordan|title=New Glass Building in Downtown Reykjavík Causes Controversy|url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2017/07/12/new-glass-building-downtown-reykjavik-causes-controversy|accessdate=21 July 2017|work=[[Iceland Review]]|date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name means "wash road", as it used to lead to the [[hot spring]]s in [[Laugardalur]] where in olden times the women of Reykjavík took their laundry for washing.

It was constructed in 1885 as a result of town council's decision. It has experienced economic setbacks in recent{{When?|date=January 2017}} years mostly because of the increase in popularity of shopping malls, most notably [[Kringlan]] and the recent [[Smáralind]]. It still maintains the charm of a historical shopping street and is still home to the more exclusive stores in Iceland.

It is also home to many bars, nightclubs and restaurants. On Friday and Saturday nights, the street is often filled with people all night long. The [[Icelandic Phallological Museum]] is also located on this street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24593">The following is an incomplete list of sports '''[[stadium]]s''' in '''Africa'''. They are in order by their [[Seating capacity|capacity]], that is the maximum number of spectators the stadium can accommodate.
Most large stadiums in Africa are used for [[association football|football (soccer)]], with some also used for [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]] and [[rugby union]].
Currently all African stadiums with a capacity of 25,000 or more are included. [[Soccer City]] in [[Johannesburg]] is currently the largest stadium in Africa since its capacity was increased to 94,700 for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. This event, which took place in June–July, was the first time an African country has hosted the World Cup. The [[Olympic Games]] have never been staged in Africa.

At a construction cost of $600 million, the [[Cape Town Stadium]], located in the legislative capital of South Africa is the most expensive stadium in Africa. The stadium, which is often referred to as the “Green Point Stadium” because it sits on the piece land that previously housed the Green Point stadium, was constructed by an indigenous company, Murray &amp; Roberts Construction Company.[https://tinamagazine.com/2018/04/best-stadiums-in-africa.html]

The '''Maldives''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔː|l|d|iː|v|z}}, {{IPAc-en|US|audio=en-us-Maldives.ogg|ˈ|m|ɔː|l|d|aɪ|v|z}}; {{lang-dv|ދިވެހިރާއްޖެ}} ''Dhivehi Raa'jey''), officially the '''Republic of Maldives''', is a South Asian country, located in the [[Indian Ocean]], situated in the [[Arabian Sea]]. It lies southwest of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]]. The chain of [[Atolls of the Maldives|26 atolls]] stretches from [[Atolls of the Maldives|Ihavandhippolhu Atoll]] in the north to the [[Addu City]] in the south. Comprising a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] spanning roughly {{convert|298|km2}}, the Maldives is one of the world's most geographically dispersed [[sovereign state]]s as well as the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia|smallest Asian country]] by land area and population, with around {{UN_Population|Maldives}} inhabitants. [[Malé]] is the capital and most populated city, traditionally called the "[[List of sultans of the Maldives|King's Island]]" for its central location.

The Maldives archipelago is located on the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]], a vast submarine mountain range in the Indian Ocean, which also forms a [[terrestrial ecoregion]], together with the [[Chagos Archipelago]] and [[Lakshadweep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion |id=im0125 |name=Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an average ground-level elevation of {{convert|1.5|m}} above sea level,&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/11/climatechange-endangered-habitats-maldives |work=[[The Guardian]] |location= London |title= The last days of paradise |first=Jon |last=Henley |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2010 | quote= [The Maldives] holds the record for the country with the lowest high point on earth: nowhere on any of the islands on Maldives does the natural ground level exceed 2.3m.

[[Islam]] was introduced to the Maldivian archipelago in the 12th century which was consolidated as a [[list of Sultans of the Maldives|sultanate]], developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. From the mid 16th-century, the region came under the increasing influence of European [[colonialism|colonial powers]], with the Maldives becoming a British [[protectorate]] in 1887. [[Second Republic of the Maldives|Independence]] from the United Kingdom was achieved in 1965 and a [[presidential republic]] was established in 1968 with an elected [[People's Majlis]]. The ensuing decades have been characterised by political instability, efforts at democratic reform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/maldives |title=Maldives – Country report – Freedom in the World – 2015 |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and environmental challenges posed by [[climate change]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The Maldives is a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC). It is also a member of the United Nations, the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]], and the [[Non Aligned Movement]]. The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper [[middle income]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/income-level/UMC Upper middle income] [[World Bank]]. Retrieved 18 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fishing in the Maldives|Fishing]] has historically been the dominant economic activity, and remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing [[tourism in the Maldives|tourism]] industry. Along with Sri Lanka, it is one of only two South Asian countries rated "high" on the [[Human Development Index]],&lt;ref name="HDI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr_2015_statistical_annex.pdf |title=2015 Human Development Report Statistical Annex |date=2015 |accessdate=14 December 2015 |publisher=United Nations Development Programme | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its per capita income one of the highest among SAARC nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr_2016_statistical_annex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maldives was a [[Commonwealth republic]] from July 1982 until its withdrawal from the Commonwealth in October 2016 in protest of international criticism of its records in relation to corruption and human rights.

==Toponymy==
{{see also|Names of Maldives}}

The name "Maldives" may derive from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] words ''{{lang|ta-Latn|maalai}}'' (garland / evening) and ''{{lang|ta-Latn|theevu}}'' (island),&lt;ref name="Hogendorn" /&gt; or {{lang|si|මාල දිවයින}} (''{{lang|si-Latn|Maala Divaina}}'', "Necklace Islands") in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]].&lt;ref name="ParanavitanaPrematilleka1978"&gt;{{cite book |author1=P.E.P Deraniyagala in Senarat Paranavitana |author2=Leelananda Prematilleka |author3=Johanna Engelberta van Lohuizen-De Leeuw |title=Senarat Paranavitana Commemoration Volume |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OIceAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |year=1978 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-05455-4 |pages=52– }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maldivian people are called ''Dhivehin''. The word ''{{lang|oty|theevu}}'' (archaic ''{{lang|oty|heevu}}'', related to Tamil {{lang|ta|தீவு}}, ''{{lang|ta-Latn|dheevu}}'') means "island", and ''Dhives'' (''Dhivehin'') means "islanders" (i.e., Maldivians).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The ancient Sri Lankan chronicle ''[[Mahawamsa]]'' refers to an island called ''{{lang|pi-Latn|Mahiladiva}}'' ("Island of Women", {{lang|pi|महिलादिभ}}) in [[Pali]], which is probably a mistranslation of the same [[Sanskrit]] word meaning "[[garland]]".

Jan S Hogendorn, Grossman Professor of Economics, theorises that the name Maldives derives from the Sanskrit ''{{lang|sa-Latn|mālādvīpa}}'' ({{lang|sa|मालाद्वीप}}), meaning "garland of islands".&lt;ref name="Hogendorn"&gt;Hogendorn, Jan and Johnson Marion (1986). ''The Shell Money of the Slave Trade''. African Studies Series 49, [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge]] {{ISBN|0521541107}}, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt; In Tamil, "Garland of Islands" can be translated as ''{{lang|ta-Latn|Malai Theevu}}'' ({{lang|ta|மாலைத்தீவு}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonames.org/MV/other-names-for-maldives.html |title=Altername Names for Republic of Maldives |publisher=Geonames.org |accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Malayalam, "Garland of Islands" can be translated as ''{{lang|ml-Latn|Maladweepu}}'' ({{lang|ml|മാലദ്വീപ്}}). In Kannada, "Garland of Islands" can be translated as ''{{lang|kn-Latn|Maaledweepa}}'' ({{lang|kn|ಮಾಲೆದ್ವೀಪ}}). None of these names is mentioned in any literature, but classical Sanskrit texts dating back to the [[Vedic period]] mention the "Hundred Thousand Islands" (''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[Lakshadweep]]a}}''), a generic name which would include not only the Maldives, but also the [[Laccadives]], [[Aminidivi]] Islands, [[Minicoy]], and the [[Chagos Archipelago|Chagos island]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;Apte, Vaman Shivram (1985). ''Sanskrit–English Dictionary''. Motilal Banarsidass, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medieval travellers such as [[Ibn Battuta]] called the islands ''{{lang|ar-Latn|Mahal Dibiyat}}'' ({{lang|ar|محل دبيأت}}) from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{lang|ar-Latn|mahal}}'' ("palace"), which must be how the [[Berber people|Berber]] traveller interpreted the local name, having been through Muslim North India, where [[Perso-Arabic]] words were introduced to the local vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Battuta ''Travels in Asia and Africa''. translated by A. R. Gibb.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the name currently inscribed on the scroll in the [[Emblem of Maldives|Maldive state emblem]]. The classical Persian/Arabic name for Maldives is ''{{lang|ar-Latn|Dibajat}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Akhbar al-Sin wa 'l-Hind (Notes on China and India), which dates from 851.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200504/the.seas.of.sindbad.htm|title=The Seas of Sinbad|volume=56|issue=4|year=2005|journal=Saudi Aramco World|access-date=24 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208223341/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200504/the.seas.of.sindbad.htm|archive-date=8 February 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch referred to the islands as the ''{{lang|nl|Maldivische Eilanden}}'' ({{IPA-nl|mɑlˈdivisə ˈʔɛilɑndə(n)|pron}}), while the British [[anglicisation|anglicised]] the local name for the islands first to the "Maldive Islands" and later to "Maldives".

Garcia da Orta writes in his conversational book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colloquies on the Simple and Drugs of India|last=Orta|first=Garcia|publisher=Sri Satguru Publications|year=2016|isbn=81-7030-117-3|location=India|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; first published in 1563 as follows: "I must tell you that I have heard it said that the natives do not call it Maldiva but Nalediva. In the Malabar language ''nale'' means four and ''diva'' island. So that in that language the word signifies "four islands," while we, corrupting the name, call it Maldiva."

===Ancient history and settlement===
{{main article|History of the Maldives#Early Age}}

The first Maldivians did not leave any archaeological artifacts. Their buildings were probably built of wood, palm fronds and other perishable materials, which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind of the tropical climate. Moreover, chiefs or headmen did not reside in elaborate stone palaces, nor did their religion require the construction of large temples or compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Kalpana Ram (1993). ''Mukkuvar Women''. Macquarie University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative studies of Maldivian oral, linguistic and cultural traditions and customs confirm that the first settlers were people from the southern shores of the neighboring [[Indian subcontinent]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Xavier Romero-Frias, ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom''&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Giraavaru people]] mentioned in ancient legends and local folklore about the establishment of the capital and kingly rule in [[Malé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=zSjhruMm748C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Giraavaru+people&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXx-uNnPTSAhWB1SwKHU6OCyUQ6AEIUTAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Maldives|last=Ellis|first=Royston|year=2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841622668|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong underlying layer of [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] population and culture survives in Maldivian society, with a clear [[Tamil–Kannada languages|Tamil-Malayalam]] substratum in the language, which also appears in place names, kinship terms, poetry, dance, and religious beliefs. [[Malabar region|Malabari]] seafaring culture led to the settlement of the Islands by [[Malayali]] seafarers.&lt;ref name="Maloney, Clarence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives People |author=Maloney, Clarence |url=http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn5/insouasi/maloney.html|work=International Institute for Asian Studies |accessdate=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written history of the Maldives was marked by the arrival of [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] people in Sri Lanka and the Maldives (''Mahiladvipika'') circa 543 to 483 BC, as reported in the ''[[Mahavansa]]''. Their settlement marks a significant change in demographics and the development of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] [[Dhivehi language]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Buddhist period===
{{main article|History of the Maldives#Buddhist period|Buddhism in the Maldives}}
[[File:Loamaafaanu.jpg|thumb|[[Isdhoo (Laamu Atoll)|Isdhoo]] Lōmāfānu is the oldest [[Lōmāfānu|copper-plate]] book to have been discovered in the Maldives to date. The book was written in AD 1194 (590 AH) in the Evēla form of the [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|Divehi akuru]], during the reign of [[Dhinei of the Maldives|Siri Fennaadheettha Mahaa Radun (Dhinei Kalaminja)]].]]

Despite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400-year-long Buddhist period has a foundational importance in the history of the Maldives. It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture which survives today. The Maldivian [[Dhivehi language|language]], the first Maldive [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|scripts]], the architecture, the ruling institutions, the customs and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Maloney. ''People of the Maldive Islands.'' Orient Longman&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BC at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion, and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century AD. The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, are from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist [[stupa]]s and monasteries, and all artifacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.
Buddhist (and Hindu) temples were [[Mandala]] shaped, they are oriented according to the four cardinal points, the main gate being towards the east.
Local historian Hassan Ahmed Maniku counted as many as 59 islands with Buddhist archaeological sites in a provisional list he published in 1990.

===Islamic period===
{{See also|History of the Maldives#Islamic Period|Islam in Maldives|List of sultans of the Maldives}}
[[File:Yousuftabrizi.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque in Juma Mosque, Malé, Maldives, on which Tabrezi's name is written. Tabrezi was a Persian who is said to have converted Maldives in 12th century AD to [[Islam]].]]

The importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi]] converted to [[Islam]] in the year 1153 (or 1193), adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al Adil, and initiating a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives'' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''.

The person traditionally deemed responsible for this conversion in 1153, was a [[Somalis|Somali]] Muslim visitor named Abu'l Barakat al-Barbari also known as [[Aw Barkhadle]], according to the story told to [[Ibn Battutah]], who goes on to say a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu'l Barakat al-Barbari.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=235–236, 320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF2spo9BKacC The Adventures of Ibn Battuta: A Muslim Traveller of the Fourteenth Century]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the East African origins account that was known as well at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Honchell|first=Stephanie|title=Sufis, Sea Monsters, and Miraculous Circumcisions: Comparative Conversion Narratives and Popular Memories of Islamization|volume=|page=5|year=2018|contribution=|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University and the University of Cape Town|quote=In reference to Ibn Batuta's Moroccan theory of this figure, citation 8 of this text mentions, that other accounts identify Yusuf Al Barbari as East African or Persian. But as fellow Maghribi, Ibn Battuta likely felt partial to the Moroccan version.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when Ibn Battuta visited the islands the governor of the island at that time was [[Abd al-Aziz of Mogadishu|Abd Aziz Al Mogadishawi]], a [[Somalis|Somali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=1av8DsKezysC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=it+came+into+my+heart+to+go+back+to+maldive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqxoLA2Y_cAhVLaVAKHfYyBPwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=it%20came%20into%20my%20heart%20to%20go%20back%20to%20maldive&amp;f=false|title=Ibn Battuta in the Maldives and Ceylon|last=Defremery|first=C.|year=1999|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120612198|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have posited another scenario where this Abu Barakat might have been a native of [[Berbera|Barbera]], a significant trading port on the northwestern coast of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_G5Qpc2dBI|title=Richard Bulliet – History of the World to 1500 CE (Session 22) – Tropical Africa and Asia|date=23 November 2010|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Barbara'' or ''Barbaroi'' (Berbers), as the ancestors of the [[Somali people|Somalis]] were referred to by medieval [[Arab people|Arab]] and ancient [[Greeks|Greek]] geographers, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bagley222"&gt;F.R.C.

His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of [[Hukuru Mosque]], or miski, in the capital of [[Malé]]. Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.

Compared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the [[Malabar Coast]] since the 7th century, and [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Bin Qāsim]] had converted large swathes of [[Sindh]] to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of [[Malabar Coast]] and Sindh—perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.

Middle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to  Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]—widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the [[East Africa]]n coast—and coir fiber. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal–Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ|title=Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History|first=P.|last=Boomgaard|date=1 January 2008|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The other essential product of the Maldives was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].

===Colonial period===
[[File:18th-century Maldives map by Pierre Mortier.jpg|thumb|18th-century map by Pierre Mortier of The [[Netherlands]] depicting with detail the islands of the Maldives]]

In 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a ''Viador'' (''Viyazoru''), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al-Azam]] and his two brothers, that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as National Day.
In the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.

The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a [[Protected state|British protected area]]. The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[Maldivian annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].

In the British period the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the aging Sultan nor the wily Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.

Maldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Muhammad Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalized the fish export industry. As president he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Malé eventually ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.

Beginning in the 1950s, the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence in the islands. In 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost [[Addu Atoll]], employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on [[Gan (Seenu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afif]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as capital. One year later the Suvadive republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Malé with government police, and Abdulla Afif went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960 the Maldives had allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hitaddu facilities for a thirty-year period, with the payment of £750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of Maldives' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.&lt;ref name="gan.philliptsmall.me.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |publisher=Gan.philliptsmall.me.uk |date=17 May 1971 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919212227/http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence and republic===
In line with the broader British policy of decolonisation on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of His Majesty the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, prime minister, and on behalf of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador designate to the Maldive Islands, which ended the British responsibility for the defence and external affairs of the Maldives. The islands thus achieved full political independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in Colombo. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King rather than Sultan.

On 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, forty voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of [[Ibrahim Nasir]]. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.

[[File:Maumoon-Abdul-Gayoom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mamoon Abdul Gayoom]], [[President of the Maldives]] (1978–2008)]]

[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in the Maldives was [[Kurumba Maldives]] which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 persons residing in Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/4.htm Maldives – Population". Library of Congress Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;
Political infighting during the '70s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport|British airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export. With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.

[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Gayoom's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Gayoom's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Gayoom was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.&lt;ref name="cnn_sinking"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |author=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2008|date=11 November 2008}}BAT&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80-person mercenary force of the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] who seized the airport and caused Gayoom to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1600 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian troops]] airlifted into [[Malé]] restored order.

A November 1988 coup was headed by Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee, a small-businessman. On the night of 3 November 1988, the [[Indian Air Force]] airlifted a parachute battalion group from [[Agra]] and flew them over {{convert|2000|km|mi}} to the Maldives. The Indian [[paratroopers]] landed at [[Hulule]] and secured the airfield and restored the government rule at Malé within hours. The brief operation, labelled ''[[Operation Cactus]]'', also involved the [[Indian Navy]].

During the later part of Gayoom's rule, independent political movements emerged in Maldives, which challenged the then-ruling [[Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party]] (Maldivian People's Party, MPP) and demanded democratic reform. The dissident journalist and activist [[Mohamed Nasheed]] founded the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] (MDP) in 2003 and pressured Gayoom into allowing gradual political reforms.&lt;ref name="brownpoliticalreview.org"&gt;[http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2015/04/autocracy-and-back-again-the-ordeal-of-the-maldives/ Autocracy and Back Again: The Ordeal of the Maldives].

[[File:Malosmadulu Atolls, Maldives.jpg|thumb|upright|Malhosmadulhu Atoll seen from space. "Fasdutere" and [[Southern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll]] can be seen in this picture.]]

The Maldives consists of 1,192 [[coral island]]s grouped in a double chain of 26 [[atoll]]s, along the north-south direction, spread over roughly {{convert|90000|km²}}, making this one of the world's most dispersed countries. It lies between latitudes [[1st parallel south|1°S]] and [[8th parallel north|8°N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian east|72°]] and [[74th meridian east|74°E]]. The atolls are composed of live [[coral reef]]s and [[sand bar]]s, situated atop a submarine ridge {{convert|960|km}} long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south.

Only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of Maldives. For administrative purposes, the Maldivian government organised these atolls into 21 [[Administrative divisions of the Maldives|administrative divisions]]. The largest island of Maldives is [[Gan (Laamu Atoll)|Gan]], which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives. In [[Addu Atoll]], the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef (collectively called Link Road) and the total length of the road is {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Maldives is the lowest country in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of only {{convert|2.4|m}} and {{convert|1.5|m}} above sea level, respectively. In areas where construction exists, however, this has been increased to several metres. More than 80 per cent of the country's land is composed of coral islands which rise less than one metre above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2010/06/201062915490741700.html |title=Entire Maldives cabinet resigns |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Maldives are at high risk of being submerged due to [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]].

===Climate===
[[File:Bathala (Maldives) 8.JPG|thumb|left|A beach of [[Bathala (island)|Bathala]] island]]

The Maldives has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am) under the [[Köppen climate classification]], which is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north. Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest [[monsoon]]. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season which brings strong winds and storms.

The shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of August. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia. The annual rainfall averages {{convert|254|cm}} in the north and {{convert|381|cm}} in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives – Atlapedia Online|url=http://www.atlapedia.com/online/countries/maldives.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monsoonal influence is greater in the north of the Maldives than in the south, more influenced by the [[Equatorial Counter Current|equatorial currents]].

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s 2007 report predicted the upper limit of the sea level rises will be {{convert|59|cm}} by 2100, which means that most of the republic's 200 inhabited islands may need to be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/editorial/where-climate-change-threatens-survival-20120108-1pq4c.html |accessdate=18 September 2015 |title=Where climate change threatens survival |date=9 January 2012 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study appears to show that the sea level in the Maldives dropped {{convert|20|-|30|cm|0}} throughout the 1970s and '80s, although later studies failed to back this up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mörner N.-A. |author2=Tooley M. |author3=Possnert, G |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=18 September 2015|title=New Perspectives for the future of the Maldives|url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/MornerEtAl2004.pdf|date=7 May 2003|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The observed rate of sea level rise is only 1.7–1.8 millimetres per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/globalregional.htm Sea Level Trends – Global Regional Trends].

According to former Maldivian president [[Mohamed Nasheed]], the Maldives are ranked the third most endangered nation due to flooding from [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Marcus | last = Stephen | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+sinking+feeling%3A+why+is+the+president+of+the+tiny+Pacific+island...-a0273079165 | title = A sinking feeling: Why is the president of the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru so concerned about climate change?| work = [[The New York Times Upfront]] |accessdate = 9 February 2015 | authorlink = Marcus Stephen | date = 14 November 2011 | quote = Most Endangered Island nations at highest risk for flooding due to climate change 3 Maldives (Indian Ocean) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March and April 2012, Nasheed stated, "If carbon emissions were to stop today, the planet would not see a difference for 60 to 70 years." "If carbon emissions continue at the rate they are climbing today, my country will be under water in seven years." He called for more [[climate change mitigation]] action while on the American television shows ''[[The Daily Show]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ptdix5/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-exclusive---mohamed-nasheed-extended-interview-pt--2 |title=Exclusive – Mohamed Nasheed Extended Interview Pt. 2 |work=The Daily Show |publisher=Comedy Central |date=2 April 2012 |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World Nation |url=http://www.guilfordian.com/worldnation/2012/04/06/endangered-island-nations-call-for-global-action-on-climate-change/ |title=Endangered island nations call for global action on climate change |publisher=Guilfordian.com |date=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion was disputed in 2012, when the next president said: "The good news is that Maldives is not about to disappear....on the basis of technical and scientific information that we have, that we will be able to manage climate change in the Maldives and prolong the life for the islands and for our life on these islands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=12&amp;dcid=7951 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006213342/http://presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=12 |archivedate=6 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, President Mohamed Nasheed announced plans to look into purchasing new land in India, Sri Lanka, and Australia because of his concerns about global warming, and the possibility of much of the islands being inundated with water from rising sea levels. The purchase of land will be made from a fund generated by tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/10/maldives-climate-change|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Paradise almost lost: Maldives seek to buy a new homeland| first=Randeep| last= Ramesh| date=10 November 2008|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President has explained his intentions: "We do not want to leave the Maldives, but we also do not want to be [[climate refugee]]s living in tents for decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ramesh, Randeep |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/10/maldives-climate-change |title=Paradise almost lost: Maldives seek to buy a new homeland|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 November 2008|accessdate=30 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 2008, then President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] pleaded for a cut in global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, warning that rising sea levels could submerge the island nation of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;(AFP) – 22 April, "awareness of threats from climate change to low-lying nations such as the Maldives."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maldives leader in climate change stunt |author=Lang, Olivia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8312320.stm |accessdate=19 October 2010|work=BBC News|date=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2020, Maldives plans to eliminate or offset all of its greenhouse gas emissions. At the 2009 International Climate Talks, President Mohamed Nasheed explained that: &lt;blockquote&gt;For us swearing off fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do, it is in our economic self-interest... Pioneering countries will free themselves from the unpredictable price of foreign oil; they will capitalise on the new green economy of the future, and they will enhance their moral standing giving them greater political influence on the world stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Climate Change Gridlock: Where Do We Go From Here?

Other environmental issues include bad waste disposal and [[beach theft]]. Although the Maldives are kept relatively pristine and little [[litter]] can be found on the islands, no good [[Waste management|waste disposal]] sites exist. Most trash from Male and other resorts is simply dumped at [[Thilafushi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans |first=Judith |url=https://www.ft.com/content/29399966-e80b-11e4-9960-00144feab7de |title=Maldives island swamped by rising tide of waste |publisher=Financial Times |accessdate=14 February 2017 |date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine ecosystem===

The Maldives have a range of different habitats including deep sea, shallow coast, and reef ecosystems, fringing mangroves, wetlands and dry land. There are 187 species of coral forming the [[coral reefs]]. This area of the Indian Ocean, alone, houses 1100 [[species]] of fish, 5 species of [[sea turtle]], 21 species of whale and dolphin, 400 species of mollusc, and 83 species of echinoderms. The area is also populated by a number of crustacean species: 120 copepod, 15 amphipod, as well as more than 145 crab and 48 shrimp species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/mv/mv-nr-04-en.pdf |title=Fourth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity of Maldives |publisher=Ministry of Housing and Environment |page=7 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104002542/https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/mv/mv-nr-04-en.pdf |archivedate=4 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many marine families represented are [[Pufferfish]], [[Caesionidae|Fusiliers]], [[Carangidae|Jackfish]], [[Lionfish]], [[Oriental Sweetlips]], [[reef sharks]], [[Grouper]]s, [[Eel]]s, [[Lutjanidae|Snappers]], [[Bannerfish]], [[Ogcocephalidae|Batfish]], [[Humphead Wrasse]], [[Spotted Eagle Ray]]s, [[Scorpionfish]], [[Lobster]]s, [[Nudibranches]], [[Pomacanthidae|Angelfish]], [[Butterflyfish]], [[Squirrelfish]], [[Soldierfish]], [[Asiatic glassfish|Glassfish]], [[Surgeonfish]], [[Naso (genus)|Unicornfish]], [[Triggerfish]], [[Napoleon wrasse]]s, and [[Barracuda]]s.&lt;ref name=scuba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scubadivemaldives.com/category/maldives-marine-life/ |title=Maldives Marine Life |publisher=Scubadivemaldives.com |accessdate=2 April 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222080727/http://www.scubadivemaldives.com/category/maldives-marine-life/ |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharks of the Maldives|url=http://www.themaldives.com/diving/maldives-sharks.html|website=TheMaldives.com|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These coral reefs are home to a variety of marine ecosystems that vary from [[planktonic]] organisms to whale sharks. Sponges have gained importance as five species have displayed anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties.&lt;ref name="Coral reefs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5627E/X5627E00.htm |title=Regional Workshop on the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Coral Reefs |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, sea-temperature warming of as much as {{convert|5|C-change}} due to a single [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño phenomenon]] event caused [[coral bleaching]], killing two-thirds of the nation's coral reefs.&lt;ref name=Wheatley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcoral.org/Maldives%20Nurses%20Its%20Coral%20Reefs%20Back%20to%20Life.htm |title=Maldives Nurses Its Coral Reefs Back to Life |publisher=Globalcoral.org |date=2 May 2004 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921010958/http://www.globalcoral.org/Maldives%20Nurses%20Its%20Coral%20Reefs%20Back%20to%20Life.htm |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to induce the regrowth of the reefs, scientists placed electrified cones anywhere from {{convert|20|–|60|ft}} below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment. In 2004, scientists witnessed corals regenerating. Corals began to eject pink-orange eggs and sperm. The growth of these electrified corals was five times faster than untreated corals.&lt;ref name=Wheatley/&gt; Scientist Azeez Hakim stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;before 1998, we never thought that this reef would die. We had always taken for granted that these animals would be there, that this reef would be there forever. El Niño gave us a wake-up call that these things are not going to be there for ever. Not only this, they also act as a natural barrier against the tropical storms, floods and tsunamis. Seaweeds grow on the skeletons of dead coral.&lt;ref name=scuba /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, in 2016, the coral reefs of the Maldives experienced a [[Coral bleaching#Maldives|severe bleaching incident]]. Up to 95% of coral around some islands have died, and, even after six months, 100% of young coral transplants died. The surface water temperatures reached an all-time high in 2016, at 31 degrees Celsius in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coral Bleaching Updates|url=http://marinesavers.com/2016/07/coral-bleaching-updates/|website=MarineSavers|publisher=Marine Savers and Four Seasons Resorts Maldives (2012–2017)|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent scientific studies suggest that the faunistic composition can vary greatly between neighbour atolls, especially in terms of benthic fauna. Differences in terms of fishing pressure (including poaching) could be the cause.&lt;ref name="Ducarme between"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Frédéric |last=Ducarme |date=2016 |title=Field Observations of Sea Cucumbers in Ari Atoll, and Comparison with Two Nearby Atolls in Maldives |url=http://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/InfoBull/BDM/36/BDM36_09_Ducarme.pdf |journal=SPC Beche-de-mer Information Bulletin |volume=36 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
{{main article|Politics of the Maldives}}
[[File:JumhooreeMaidan.JPG|thumb|Independence Square in Malé]]

Maldives is a [[presidential system|presidential]] republic, with extensive influence of the president as [[head of government]] and [[head of state]]. The president heads the executive branch, acts at the same time as minister of defence and appoints the cabinet which is approved by the [[Majlis of the Maldives|People's Majlis (Parliament)]]. He leads police, army, coast guards, fire brigade and judiciary. There is no separation of powers. The current president as of 17 November 2018 is [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]]. Members of the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] Majlis serve five-year terms, with the total number of members determined by atoll populations. At the [[Maldivian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 election]], 77 members were elected. The People's Majlis, located in Male, houses members from all over the country.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maldives-ethnography.com/ |title=Maldives Enthnography |publisher=Maldives-ethnography.com |accessdate=30 June 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116051343/http://www.maldives-ethnography.com/ |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The republican constitution came into force in 1968, and was amended in 1970, 1972, and 1975. On 27 November 1997 it was replaced by another Constitution assented to by the President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom]]. This Constitution came into force on 1 January 1998. All stated that the [[President of the Maldives|president]] was the head of state, head of government and the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Maldives National Defence Force|Armed Forces]] and the Police of the Maldives.

In 2018, the ruling [[Progressive Party of Maldives|PPM-Y]]'s tensions with opposition parties and subsequent crackdown was termed as an "assault on democracy" by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights]] chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/feb/08/maldives-crackdown-an-assault-on-democracy-un-rights-chief-1770198.html|title=Maldives crackdown an 'assault on democracy': UN rights chief|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
{{See also|Judiciary in the Maldives}}

According to the [[Constitution of Maldives]], "the judges are independent, and subject only to the Constitution and the law. When deciding matters on which the Constitution or the law is silent, judges must consider Islamic [[Sharia|Shari'ah]]". Article 15 of the Act Number 1/81 (Penal Code) gives provision for [[hudud]] punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives Penal Code|url=http://www.agoffice.gov.mv/pdf/sublawe/PC1.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 156 of the constitution states that law includes the norms and provisions of sharia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/islamic-family-law/home/research/legal-profiles/maldives-republic-of/ |title=Maldives, Republic of |work=Islamic Family Law |author=[[Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im]] |publisher=Emory University School of Law |date=2015 |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam is the official religion of the Maldives and open practice of any other religion is forbidden and liable to prosecution. Article 2 of the revised constitution says that the republic "is based on the principles of Islam". Article nine says that "a non-Muslim may not become a citizen"; article ten says that "no law contrary to any principle of Islam can be applied". Article nineteen states that "citizens are free to participate in or carry out any activity that is not expressly prohibited by sharia [Islamic law] or by the law".

The requirement to adhere to a particular religion and prohibition of public worship following other religions is contrary to Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and Article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] to which Maldives has recently become party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreign.gov.mv/v3/?p=menu_item&amp;sub_id=21&amp;submenu=Human%20Rights%20and%20Democracy |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maldives |publisher=Foreign.gov.mv |accessdate=30 June 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921022819/http://www.foreign.gov.mv/v3/?p=menu_item&amp;sub_id=21&amp;submenu=Human%20Rights%20and%20Democracy |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was addressed in Maldives' reservation in adhering to the Covenant claiming that "The application of the principles set out in Article 18 of the Covenant shall be without prejudice to the Constitution of the Republic of the Maldives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis, Thomas W.

===Human rights===
{{main article|Human rights in the Maldives|LGBT rights in the Maldives}}

Human rights in the Maldives is a contentious issue. In its 2011 [[Freedom in the World]] report, [[Freedom House]] declared the Maldives "Partly Free", claiming a reform process which had made headway in 2009 and 2010 had stalled.&lt;ref name='FH 2011'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2011/maldives | title = Freedom in the World 2011: Maldives| accessdate = 25 August 2012 | author = [[Freedom House]] | year = 2011 | publisher = Freedom House}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] claims in their 2012 report on human rights practices in the country that the most significant problems are corruption, lack of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]], and abuse and unequal treatment of women.&lt;ref name='State 2012'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?dlid=186470 | title = Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011: Maldives | accessdate = 24 August 2012 | author = [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] | year = 2012 | publisher = [[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the court sentenced a 15-year-old rape victim to 100 lashes and 8 months of house arrest for having had extra-marital relations.

===Foreign relations===

{{main article|Foreign relations of the Maldives}}

[[File:Maldivian Defence Minister Mohamed Nazim addressing an audience in Kochi.jpg|thumb|Former Maldivian Defence Minister [[Mohamed Nazim]] at an Indian naval base in [[Kochi]]]]

Since 1996, the Maldives has been the official progress monitor of the [[Indian Ocean Commission]]. In 2002, the Maldives began to express interest in the commission but {{As of|2008|lc=y}} had not applied for membership. Maldives' interest relates to its identity as a small island state, especially economic development and environmental preservation, and its desire for closer relations with France, a main actor in the IOC region.

The Maldives is a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] ([[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]]). The republic joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1982, some 17 years after gaining independence from the United Kingdom. In October 2016, Maldives announced its withdrawal from the Commonwealth&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/secretary-general-statement-maldives-decision-leave-commonwealth Secretary-General statement on Maldives decision to leave the Commonwealth], 13 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; in protest at allegations of human rights abuse and failing democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/maldives-quits-commonwealth-over-alleged-rights-abuses Maldives quits Commonwealth over alleged rights abuses], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The Maldives enjoys close ties with Commonwealth members [[Seychelles]] and [[Mauritius]]. The Maldives and [[Comoros]] are also both members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].

[[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] and his Cabinet has decided that the Maldives will be returning to its status as a [[Commonwealth republic]].&lt;ref&gt;https://presidency.gov.mv/presidentNews/news/10346&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
{{main article|Maldives National Defence Force}}
[[File:Maldives-vaixells de bombers.jpg|thumb|left|Fire &amp; Rescue Service boats]]

The Maldives National Defence Force is the combined security organisation responsible for defending the security and sovereignty of the Maldives, having the primary task of being responsible for attending to all internal and external security needs of the Maldives, including the protection of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the maintenance of peace and security. The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps and the Corps of Engineers.

As a water-bound nation much of the security concerns lie at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} × {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the largest island being not more than {{convert|8|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints.

The Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters. The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to the maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations in a timely manner. Maritime pollution control exercises are conducted regularly on an annual basis for familiarisation and handling of such hazardous situations.

===Administrative divisions===
{{main article|Administrative divisions of the Maldives}}

[[File:Atolls of the maldives.png|thumb|Each administrative atoll is marked, along with the [[thaana]] letter used to identify the atoll. Natural atolls are labelled in light blue. [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Atolls_of_the_maldives.png Full view of the map].]]
The Maldives has twenty-six natural [[Atolls of the Maldives|atolls]] and few island groups on isolated reefs, all of which have been divided into twenty-one administrative divisions (19 administrative atolls and cities of [[Malé]] and [[Addu City|Addu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/umv.html |title=Maldives Atolls|publisher=Statoids.com|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each atoll is administered by an elected Atoll Council. The islands are administered by an elected Island Council.

Between 2008 and 2010 the Maldives had 7 provinces each consisting of the following administrative divisions (the capital Malé is its own administrative division):

In addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as "[[Haa Alif]]" for [[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll|Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi]] (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo. Since most Atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Divehiraajjege Jōgrafīge Vanavaru''. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name. Under such circumstances it is hard to know which is the correct name to use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

[[File:The western side (382669110).jpg|thumb|left|Malé harbour]]
[[File:Maldives treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Maldives's product exports in 28 color-coded categories]]

In ancient times the Maldives were renowned for [[cowry shell]]s, [[coir]] rope, dried [[tuna]] fish (Maldive Fish), [[ambergris]] (Maavaharu), and [[coco de mer]] (Tavakkaashi). Local and foreign trading ships used to load these products in Sri Lanka and transport them to other harbours in the Indian Ocean.

Historically Maldives provided enormous quantities of [[cowry]] shells, [[history of money|an international currency of the early ages]]. From the 2nd century AD the islands were known as the 'Money Isles' by the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJD94VZweCIC&amp;pg=PA9 | title=Maldives | author=Lyon, James  | date=October 2003 | publisher=Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd | page=9 | isbn=978-1-74059-176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Monetaria moneta]]'' were used for centuries as a currency in Africa, and huge amounts of [[Maldive Islands|Maldivian]] cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of [[slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogendorn, Jan and Johnson Marion (1986). ''The Shell Money of the Slave Trade''. African Studies Series 49, [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge]] {{ISBN|0521541107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cowry is now the symbol of the [[Maldives Monetary Authority]].

The Maldivian government began an [[economic reform]] programme in 1989, initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalised regulations to allow more foreign investment. Real GDP growth averaged over 7.5% per year for more than a decade. Today, the Maldives' largest industry is tourism, accounting for 28% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Fishing is the second leading sector.

The Maldivian economy is to a large degree based on tourism. In late December 2004, the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|major tsunami]] [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on the Maldives|left more than 100 dead]], 12,000 displaced, and property damage exceeding $400&amp;nbsp;million. As a result of the tsunami, the GDP contracted by about 3.6% in 2005. A rebound in tourism, post-tsunami reconstruction, and development of new resorts helped the economy recover quickly and showed an 18% increase on 2006. 2013 estimates show Maldivians enjoy the highest GDP (PPP) per capita $11,900 (2013 est) among south Asian countries.

Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour. Tourism gave a major boost to the country's fledgling traditional [[cottage industries]] such as mat weaving, [[lacquer]] work, [[handicraft]], and coir rope making. New industries that have since emerged include printing, production of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] [[Pipe (material)|pipes]], brick making, marine engine repairs, bottling of [[aerated water]], and garment production.

===Tourism===
{{main article|Tourism in the Maldives|Diving in the Maldives|List of mosques in the Maldives}}
[[File:Filitheyo bar.jpg|thumb|left|Filitheyo island beach with tall palm trees and blue fresh lagoons]]

The Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s. Only 185 islands are home to its 447,137 inhabitants. The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.

The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the [[Economy of the Maldives|country's economy]]. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/coup-what-coup-tourists-ignore-maldives-turmoil-20120213-1t0wi.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Coup? What coup? Tourists ignore Maldives turmoil | date=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which transformed the Maldives economy.

[[File:Landaa Giraavaru vue du ciel.JPG|thumb|The [[resort island]] of [[Landaa Giraavaru]] (Baa atoll)]]

According to the [[Ministry of Tourism (Maldives)|Ministry of Tourism]], the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy, moving rapidly from dependence on fisheries to tourism. In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to the GDP. {{As of|2008}}, 89 resorts in the Maldives offered over 17,000 beds and hosted over 600,000 tourists annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.mv/ |title=Ministry of Tourism. Retrieved 3 April 2009 |publisher=Tourism.gov.mv |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of resorts increased from 2 to 92 between 1972 and 2007. {{As of|2007}}, over 8,380,000 tourists had visited Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tourism.gov.mv/pubs/35_years_of_tourism_final.pdf |title=35 years of tourism |format=PDF |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Visitors to the Maldives do not need to apply for a visa pre-arrival, regardless of their country of origin, provided they have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and the money to be self-sufficient while in the country.&lt;ref name=doi&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry into Maldives|url=http://www.immigration.gov.mv/index.php/entry-to-maldives.html|publisher=Department of Immigration and Emigration, Republic of Maldives|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most visitors arrive at [[Malé International Airport]], on [[Hulhulé]] Island, adjacent to the capital Malé. The airport is served by flights to and from India, Sri Lanka, [[Doha]], [[Dubai]], Singapore, Istanbul, and major airports in South-East Asia, as well as charters from Europe. [[Gan International Airport|Gan Airport]], on the southern atoll of [[Addu City|Addu]], also serves an international flight to [[Milan]] several times a week. [[British Airways]] offers direct flights to the Maldives around 2–3 times per week.

The country currently has [[List of mosques in the Maldives|six heritage Maldivian coral mosques]], all of which are listed as [[UNESCO]] tentative sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5812|title=Coral Stone Mosques of Maldives - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishing industry===
{{main article|Fishing industry in the Maldives}}
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Doni aux Maldives cropped.jpg|thumb|A mechanised traditional inter-island dhoni stripped of its sails]]

For many centuries the Maldivian economy was entirely dependent on fishing and other [[ocean|marine]] products. Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.

The [[mechanisation]] of the [[traditional fishing boat]] called ''[[dhoni]]'' in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on [[Felivaru]] in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. [[Fish aggregating device]]s and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.

{{As of|2010}}, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's work force. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after [[#Tourism|tourism]].

{{main article|Demographics of the Maldives}}
The largest ethnic group are [[Dhivehis]], i.e. the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India. They share the same culture and speak the [[Dhivehi language]]. They are principally an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] people, closely related to the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] and African genes in the population.

In the past there was also a small [[Tamils|Tamil]] population known as the [[Giraavaru people]]. This group have now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but were once native to the island of [[Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll)]].{{fact|date=October 2017}} This island was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.

Some social stratification exists on the islands. It is not rigid, since rank is based on varied factors, including occupation, wealth, Islamic virtue, and family ties. Instead of a complex [[caste]] system, there was merely a distinction between noble (bēfulhu) and common people in the Maldives. Members of the social elite are concentrated in Malé.

The population doubled by 1978, and the [[population growth]] rate peaked at 3.4% in 1985. At the 2006 census, the population had reached 298,968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islands by Population Size and Percentage Share of Total Population |url=http://www.planning.gov.mv/publications/census2006_island_level_tables/population/population/PP_05.htm |work=Maldives: Population and Housing Census 2006 |publisher=Ministry of Planning and National Development |accessdate=8 February 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919044405/http://www.planning.gov.mv/publications/census2006_island_level_tables/population/population/PP_05.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the census in 2000 showed that the population growth rate had declined to 1.9%. Life expectancy at birth stood at 46 years in 1978, and later rose to 72. Infant mortality has declined from 12.7% in 1977 to 1.2% today, and adult literacy reached 99%. Combined school enrolment reached the high 90s. The population was projected to have reached 317,280 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census Analysis 2006.

As of April 2008, more than 70,000 foreign employees, along with 33,000 illegal immigrants, comprised more than one third of the Maldivian population.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2013}}. There are 40,000 [[Bangladeshis in the Maldives]], making them the largest group of foreigners working in that country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent-bangladesh.com/200808018336/country/maldives-to-recruit-bangladeshi-workers.html Maldives to recruit more Bangladeshi workers, SATURDAY, 02 AUGUST 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; Other immigrants include [[Filipinos in the Maldives]] as well as various Western expatriates.

Maldivians converted to Islam by the mid-12th century. The islands have had a long history of [[Sufi]]c orders, as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs. They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried [[saint]]s. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of Maldives's [[cultural heritage]].

Other aspects of [[tassawuf]], such as ritualised [[dhikr]] ceremonies called Maulūdu ([[Mawlid]])—the [[liturgy]] of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodical tone—existed until very recent times. These Maulūdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.

According to Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named [[Abu al-Barakat]], sailing from [[Morocco]]. He is also referred to as [[Tabrizugefaanu]]. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of the Friday Mosque, or [[Malé Friday Mosque|Hukuru Miskiy]], in Malé. Built in 1656, this is the country's oldest mosque.

===Languages===
{{main article|Languages of Maldives}}
[[File:Dhivehiscript.svg|thumb|Thaana script]]
The official and common language is [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], an [[Indo-Aryan language]] having some similarities with [[Elu]], the ancient [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] language. The first known script used to write Dhivehi is [[Eveyla akuru]] script which is found in historical recording of kings ([[raadhavalhi]]). Later a script called [[Dhives akuru]] was used for a long period. The present-day script is called [[Thaana]] and is written from right to left. Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Mohamed Thakurufaanu]].

English is widely spoken by the locals of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maldives.tourism-srilanka.com/travel-tips/language.html|title=Maldives Languages – Languages of Maldives – Language Spoken In Maldives|website=maldives.tourism-srilanka.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 12th century AD there were also influences from [[Arabia]] in the language and culture of the Maldives because of the conversion to Islam and its location as a crossroads in the central Indian Ocean. This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east.
However, unlike the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka and most of the Arabs, Africans and Europeans whose influence can be seen in loanwords, material culture, and the diversity of Maldivian phenotype, Maldivians do not have the highly embedded patriarchal codes of honour, purity, corporate marriage, and sedentary private property that are typical of places where agriculture is the key form of subsistence and social relations have been built, historically, around tribute taking.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Reflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it is hypothesised, is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Anthony. 2012.

==Transportation==
[[File:TMA Terminal.JPG|thumb|TMA Terminal]]
[[Velana International Airport]] is the principal gateway to the Maldives. International travel is available on a number of major airlines. Two Maldives based airlines also operate international flights. Privately owned [[MEGA Maldives Airlines]] has Boeing 737 and 767 aircraft and operates frequent services to Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Government owned [[Island Aviation Services]] (branded as Maldivian) operates to nearly all Maldives domestic airports with several [[Bombardier Dash 8]] aircraft and one [[A320]] with international service to Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram, India, and Dhaka, Bangladesh.

In Maldives there are three main ways to travel between islands: by domestic flight, by [[seaplane]] or by boat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131218100252/http://www.elitedivingagency.com/maldives/ Maldives – Élite Diving Agency]. Elitedivingagency.com. Retrieved on 29 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For several years there were two seaplane companies operating: TMA ([[Trans Maldivian Airways]]) and [[Maldivian Air Taxi]], but these merged in 2013 under the name TMA. The seaplane fleet is entirely made up of [[DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s. There is also another airline, [[Flyme (Villa Air)|Flyme]], which operates using [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] planes to domestic airports, principally Maamagili and some others. The typical Maldivian boat is called a [[dhoni]]. Depending on the distance of the destination island from the airport, resorts organise domestic flight plus boat transfers, seaplane flights directly to the resort island jetty, or speedboat trips for their guests. There are also locally run ferries using large dhoni boats. Speedboats and seaplanes tend to be more expensive, while travel by dhoni, although slower, is relatively cheaper and convenient.

==Education==

The [[Maldives National University]] is one of the country's three institutions of higher education. Its mission statement is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To create, discover, preserve and disseminate knowledge that are necessary to enhance the lives and livelihoods of people and essential for the cultural, social and economic development of the society so that this nation shall remain free and Islamic forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnu.edu.mv/vision-mission/|title=The Maldives National University|website=mnu.edu.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1973, the Allied Health Services Training Centre (the forerunner of the Faculty of Health Sciences) was established by the Ministry of Health. The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974, providing training for mechanical and electrical trades. In 1984, the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry. In 1991, the Institute of Management and Administration was created to train staff for public and private services. In 1998, the Maldives College of Higher Education was founded. The Institute of Shar'ah and Law was founded in January 1999. In 2000 the college launched its first degree programme: Bachelor of Arts. On 17 January 2011 the Maldives National University Act was passed by the President of the Maldives; The Maldives National University was named on 15 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnu.edu.mv/history/|title=The Maldives National University|website=mnu.edu.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Romanian Studies''' (SRS), founded in 1973, is an international inter-disciplinary academic organization dedicated to [[Romania]]n studies. It draws its members – junior and senior scholars, graduate students, and government experts – primarily from North America, Romania, the [[Republic of Moldova]] and Western Europe. Through its activities, the SRS wishes to facilitate academic exchange within and across a multitude of disciplines, including history, sociology, geography, anthropology and ethnography, political science, philosophy, law and justice studies, literature and linguistics, economics and business, international affairs, religious, gender, film and media studies, art history, music and education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.society4romanianstudies.org/#!history4/crwv]&lt;/ref&gt; The society understands Romanian studies broadly to encompass political, socioeconomic and cultural developments in Romania and the Republic of Moldova, the situation of their ethnic minorities and their relations with the ethnic majority, as well as the position of Romanians and Moldovans living outside those countries.

== Activities ==
The society holds its Annual General Meeting at the annual conference of the [[Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies]] (ASEEES), organized in late November in the United States. At that time, the Society also offers an annual graduate student essay prize for an outstanding unpublished essay or thesis chapter written in English by a graduate student and a biennial bok award to the best single-authored scholarly title published in English in any social science or humanities discipline on a Romanian studies topic. SRS members also attend conferences organized by different universities and other scholarly associations.

Since 1986, the society has held seven well-attended international congresses gathering Romanian studies scholars from a variety of countries. The First International Congress was held at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris in 1986 with the help of [[Asociatia Internationala de Studii Romanesti]]. It was decided to organize these international meetings in Romania. Subsequent congresses were then held in [[Iași]] in 1993, [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] in 1997, [[Suceava]] in 2001, [[Constanța]] in 2007 and [[Sibiu]] in 2012. The seventh congress was held in [[Bucharest]] on June 17–19, 2015, hosted by the Faculty of Political Science at the [[University of Bucharest]].

In 2013, the society launched a book collection in partnership with [[Polirom]], Romania’s largest publisher of academic titles. Co-ordinated by Irina Livezeanu and Lavinia Stan, the Studii Româneşti/Romanian Studies/Études Roumaines/Rumänische Studien series publishes scholarly books in Romanian written or edited by SRS members. It considers for publication Romanian translations of scholarly monographs already published in a foreign language, original scholarly monographs written in Romanian, and edited collections of Romanian-language essays dealing with a unifying theme. Book proposals must deal with Romania and/or Moldova and the populations living on their territories or with the Romanian and Moldovan diasporas and cultures, and they must have primarily an academic profile. Contributions may have a disciplinary, interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary focus, drawing on history, political science, sociology, anthropology, law, economics, linguistics, literature, art history and other fields.

The [[American Historical Association]] and the [[American Political Science Association]] are some of the scholarly organizations with which the SRS is affiliated. The society has joint-membership arrangements with the [[South East European Studies Association]] (SEESA), as well as the [[Romanian Studies Association of America]] (RSAA). Recently,{{when|date=November 2015}} the society has welcomed the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Bucharest, the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies]], and CEPOS at the [[University of Craiova]] among its organizational members.

The '''Sofala Bank''' is [[Mozambique]]'s major shelf area covering the largest part of the [[continental shelf]], about 80 nautical miles (148&amp;nbsp;km) from the coast of [[Sofala Province|Sofala]] to the shelf break. The average depth of the Sofala Bank is about 20&amp;nbsp;m.

Most Mozambican rivers enter the sea through Sofala Bank, with an annual runoff of more than 100&amp;nbsp;km³.

The Sofala Bank is the area of the most important Mozambican [[fishery]], the shallow water [[shrimp]] fishery where the dominant species is the [[Indian prawn|Indian white shrimp]].

The '''Vietnam General Confederation of Labour''' (VGCL) is the sole [[national trade union center]] in [[Vietnam]]. It was founded July 29, 1929 as the '''Red Workers' General Union''' in Northern Vietnam, and extended into the entire country after the collapse of [[South Vietnam]] in 1975.{{fact|date=May 2014}}

[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721171935/http://www.congdoanvn.org.vn/details.asp?l=1&amp;c=36&amp;c2=36&amp;m=207 VGCL's role], as shown on the Vietnamese side of its website, includes ''"responsibility to implement the Party’s directions and policies and to contribute to the Party’s development"''. It is under the oversight of the Communist Party: ''“The Party oversights the way VGCL implements the Party’s directions and policies”''

All trade unions in Vietnam are required to affiliate to the VGCL, and the VGCL is one of the mass movements of the [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front]]. Bui Van Cuong, the VGCL president, is a member of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Central Committee]].

The VGCL is affiliated to the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]]. In 2011 VGCL President [[Bui Van Cuong]] was elected a WFTU Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.congdoanvn.org.vn/english/details.asp?l=1&amp;c=228&amp;c2=228&amp;m=553 |title=The 16th World Trade Union Congress was successfully completed |access-date=2006-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504134738/http://www.congdoanvn.org.vn/english/details.asp?l=1&amp;c=228&amp;c2=228&amp;m=553 |archive-date=2012-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

The VGCL is composed of 63 local federations of labor, representing cities and provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.congdoanvn.org.vn/english/details.asp?l=1&amp;c=238&amp;c2=238&amp;m=222 |title=Provincial and City Federations of Labour |access-date=2006-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005725/http://www.congdoanvn.org.vn/english/details.asp?l=1&amp;c=238&amp;c2=238&amp;m=222 |archive-date=2014-05-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Western European Time''' ('''WET''', [[UTC±00:00]]) is a [[time zone]] covering parts of western and northwestern [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/wet|title=WET – Western European Time (Time Zone Abbreviation)|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following countries and regions use WET in winter months:

The nominal span of the time zone is 7.5°E to 7.5°W (0° ± 7.5°), but the WET zone does not include the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[France]], [[Gibraltar]] or [[Spain]] which use [[Central European Time]] (CET), although these are mostly ([[France]]) or completely (the rest) west of 7.5°E. Conversely, Iceland and eastern Greenland are included although both are west of 7.5°W. In September 2013, a [[Spain|Spanish]] parliamentary committee recommended switching to WET.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24294157 "Spain considers time zone change to boost productivity".] ''BBC News''. 27 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilos, Paul (26 September 2013).

''The Guardian'' (London).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Caitlin (26 September 2013).

''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical uses==
A slight variation of this time zone, based until 1911 on the [[Paris Meridian]], was used in:
*[[Andorra]]: 1901–1946&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/andorra/andorra-la-vella|title=Time Zone &amp; Clock Changes in Andorra La Vella, Andorra|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/andorra/andorra-la-vella|title=Time Zone &amp; Clock Changes in Andorra La Vella, Andorra|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[Second World War]], France used WET. However, the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation]] switched France to German time, and it has remained in CET since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poulle|first=Yvonne|title=La France à l'heure allemande|journal=Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes|year=1999|volume=157|issue=2|pages=493–502|url=http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989/article_bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989.pdf|accessdate=11 January 2012|doi=10.3406/bec.1999.450989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other occupied territories, [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], did the same, and Spain also switched to CET in solidarity with Germany under the orders of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/11/30/244995264/spains-been-in-the-wrong-time-zone-for-seven-decades?t=1543530349805|title=Spain Has Been In The 'Wrong' Time Zone For 7 Decades|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, from 1940 to 1945 [[British Summer Time]] (BST=[[Central European Time|CET]]) was used in winters, and from 1941 to 1945 and again in 1947, British Double Summer Time (BDST=[[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]) was used in summers. Between 18 February 1968 and 31 October 1971, [[British Summer Time|BST]] was used all year round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/uk/london?year=1968|title=Time Zone &amp; Clock Changes 1960-1969 in London, England, United Kingdom|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/uk/london?year=1971|title=Time Zone &amp; Clock Changes 1970-1979 in London, England, United Kingdom|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, from 1940 to 1946 [[Irish Summer Time]] (IST=[[Central European Time|CET]]) was used all year round, with no 'double' summer time akin to that in the United Kingdom. Between 18 February 1968 and 31 October 1971, [[Irish Standard Time]] was used all year round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/ireland/dublin?year=1968|title=Time Zone &amp; Clock Changes 1960-1969 in Dublin, Ireland|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/ireland/dublin?year=1971|title=Time Zone &amp; Clock Changes 1970-1979 in Dublin, Ireland|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portugal, [[Central European Time|CET]] was used in the [[Mainland Portugal|mainland]] from 1966 to 1976 and from 1992 to 1996. The [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous region]] of the [[Azores]] used WET from 1992 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/1992/12/295A01/00020003.pdf Decreto Legislativo Regional n.º 29/92/A (23-12-1992)] (in Portuguese), ''Diário da República'' (''Diary of the Republic'') – 1st Series - A, nr. 295, p. 5932-(2), 23 December 1992.

The '''İzmirimkart''' is a proximity type [[smart card]] used for payment in public transport of [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]]. It gradually replaced [[İzmir Kentkart]] after Kentkart could not get the tender. Disposable variant is called '''bilet 35''' and it is possible to buy 3, 5, 10 credit forms.

==Refills==
The pay-as-you-go variant of the card operates as if it were stored-value, though it is technically a [[deposit card]]. Refills are done by [[electronic funds transfer]] via [[Vakıfbank]] using deposit accounts associated to supported POS terminals.

==Security==
The card stores data about last few transactions to prevent fraud. Transactions otherwise commence online. If data on the card about a particular transaction mismatches data on the central database, the card may be blocked.
