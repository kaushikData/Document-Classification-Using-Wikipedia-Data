==Early life and education==
Born in [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]], [[Nottinghamshire]], Titmuss grew up in [[Heckington]], [[Lincolnshire]] where her parents were [[teacher]]s. She took her [[A-level]]s at [[Kesteven and Sleaford High School]] where she played the clarinet. When she was 17, her parents divorced and her father moved to [[Argyll]], Scotland, where he remarried.

==Nursing==
Titmuss graduated from [[City University, London|City University]] in [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in 1998. She did a [[nursing]] diploma, because she "was interested in becoming a doctor, but hadn't taken A level [[Chemistry]]"&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Diaries'' p.9&lt;/ref&gt; and became a [[Nursing in the United Kingdom#Employment of nurses|staff nurse]] at London's [[University College Hospital]].

==Television and radio==
Titmuss was hired as a roving reporter on the [[Channel 4]] programme ''[[Richard &amp; Judy]]'', in late 2003, and stated at the time that the job was "an absolute dream come true".&lt;ref name=bar&gt;[http://www.freenewspos.com/news/article/a/514269/today/abi-titmuss-if-i-could-meet-john-leslie-in-that-bar-again-i-d-turn-my-back-and-walk-out "Abi Titmuss: If I could meet John Leslie in that bar again"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726192522/http://www.freenewspos.com/news/article/a/514269/today/abi-titmuss-if-i-could-meet-john-leslie-in-that-bar-again-i-d-turn-my-back-and-walk-out |date=26 July 2014 }}, FreeNewsPos, 15 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She lost her job in January 2004 following allegations of [[group sex]] with her boyfriend [[John Leslie (television presenter)|John Leslie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.standard.co.uk/news/abi-titmuss-sacked-6940664.html | title= Abi Titmuss sacked | work=London Evening Standard | location=London | date=20 January 2004 | accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[sex tape]] from four years earlier emerged, in which she had been privately filmed having sex with Leslie and aspiring female [[Model (people)|model]] Aisha Abubakar.&lt;ref name=hell&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/my-hell-over-shabby-abi-orgy-1603240 "My hell over shabby Abi orgy"], ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 7 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The footage was downloaded without permission from a private computer and made public by "[[Confidence trick|conman]]" Lanre Onabowale, subsequently convicted to serve 18 years in jail for four counts of [[rape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Perrie |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/54292/Abi-sex-vid-man-is-a-rapist.html |title=Abi sex vid man is a rapist |publisher=''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' |date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Secret Diaries"&gt;''Secret Diaries''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2257950/John-Leslie-says-false-sex-claims-ruined-TV-career-left-suicidal.html |title='I was labelled a monster and thought about killing myself': John Leslie opens up about how false rape claims ruined his life |publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=6 January 2013 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 series of ''[[Hell's Kitchen (UK TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'', she trained as a [[chef]]. In 2005, Titmuss appeared on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Friday Night Project]]'' as a regular guest, in ''Abi Titmuss: A Modern Day Morality Tale'', a fly-on-the-wall documentary for [[Channel 4]] and on [[ITV1]]'s ''[[Celebrity Love Island]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/459/Celebrity-Love-Island-Series-1 "Celebrity Love Island Series 1"], ''[[Daily Express#Sunday Express|Sunday Express]]'', 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

She starred on a celebrity edition of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' with [[Paul Ross]], [[Lesley Joseph]], [[Linda Lusardi]] and [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/come-dine-with-me/episode-guide/series-9/episode-14|title=Episode 14 - ''Celebrity Come Dine with Me'' - Abi Titmuss|publisher=Channel4|date=1 February 2009|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titmuss appeared on the [[Reality television|reality]] series ''[[Deadline (2007 TV series)|Deadline]]'' with [[Janet Street Porter]] on [[ITV2]]. The show followed a number of celebrities as they attempted to produce a celebrity-based magazine each week, published as a supplement to ''[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]]''. Titmuss was the fourth celebrity to be sacked from the show.

She has guest-presented shows on [[Virgin Radio]], [[MTV]] and [[LBC radio]].

==Glamour==
Titmuss took up presenting on [[pornography|pornographic]] channel [[Television X]], released a fitness video, put her name to an erotic novel published by Black Lace and made personal appearances in nightclubs in the UK and Ireland. An initial offer of a photo shoot over two pages of ''[[FHM]]'' morphed into a three-page spread and a cover.

In December 2004, Titmuss appeared on the front cover of ''FHM'' along with Swedish model [[Victoria Silvstedt]]. In 2004 and 2005, she made a total of 38 front-page appearances on British [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''FHM'', ''[[Nuts (magazine)|Nuts]]'', ''[[Zoo Weekly]]'', ''[[loaded (magazine)|Loaded]]'', ''[[GQ]]'' and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''. She also appeared in the ''[[Sunday Times]] Style'' section and in glamour pictures in several [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers, including ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ''[[News of the World]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The People]]'' and ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]''.

In 2005, Titmuss was ranked seventh by readers in ''FHM''{{'}}s list of [[FHM's 100 Sexiest Women (UK)|100 Sexiest Women in the World]]. She started writing a regular [[Advice column|sex advice column]] for the magazine the same year. At the height of her fame in 2004/05, Titmuss would be paid a modelling fee of up to £30,000 a day for appearing on the front page of ''Nuts'' or ''Zoo''.&lt;ref name="respect"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2103098/Abi-Titmuss-battle-self-respect-I-making-30-000-day-I-feel-lack-talent-I-wearing-it.html#ixzz361Obz9jE "Abi Titmuss on her battle for self-respect: I was making £30,000 a day but I could feel my lack of talent as though I was wearing it"], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 19 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Titmuss appeared in a [[high fashion]] shoot in ''[[Pop (fashion magazine)|Pop]]'' magazine, which commented on her status as the "face of 21st century celebrity".

In her memoir, Titmuss states how she quickly realised that she wanted more control after seeing magazines pay her for one shoot and then sell the pictures many times over. Accordingly, she started paying for and directing her own shoots, thus owning the copyright over them and selling them herself, along with her manager.&lt;ref name="Secret Diaries"/&gt;

In December 2004, Titmuss appeared on the front cover of ''FHM'' again, with Swedish model Victoria Silvstedt, "marking," as she wrote, "the first time a girl was on the FHM cover twice in one year."

After taking a break from modelling, Titmuss relaunched her glamour career in 2007, this time as a [[brunette]], with an appearance on the cover of ''[[Zoo Weekly]]'' and the sale of the official "Abi Titmuss Calendar". On 25 April that year, it was announced that Titmuss had made an appearance for a third time in ''[[FHM]]'''s annual [[FHM's 100 Sexiest Women (UK)|100 Sexiest Women in the World]] readers' poll, at number 80. She was ranked number 95 in 2004, and number 7 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-450795/The-list-FHMs-100-Sexiest-Women-World-2007.html|title=The full list of FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World 2007|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=26 April 2007|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After announcing in late 2007 that she would take a break from her glamour modelling career to concentrate on acting, Titmuss returned with a ''[[Nuts (magazine)|Nuts]]'' shoot in April 2009 to promote one more calendar.

==Acting==
Titmuss first acted during her university studies and then took part-time acting courses at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], paid for from her nursing work. After reducing her glamour model work, Titmuss took a further, short, acting course at the same establishment.

According to her memoir, the first [[West End theatre producer|theatre producer]] to audition her for a role was [[Marc Sinden]]:

{{cquote|'''25th February 2004''': Today I had my audition for Marc Sinden. Marc was really lovely and put me at my ease. Marc directed me and got me to do it a couple of times. He told me at the end that he hadn't known what to expect from me, but that I had really surprised him. I was recalled for a second audition. &lt;br&gt;'''5th March 2004''': Second audition - When I finished he sat me down and looked me in the eye and said "In my opinion Abi, you can do it. You can act. You've got that special something. I think you need someone to tell you that, don't you?" I was embarrassed to find I was crying. It was the sound of someone validating my shaky belief in my ability. I didn't get the job and he was right. I was far too raw. But I did walk out of there with my head held higher. Marc's kind words had encouraged me to follow my dream. He said that he would remember me. I wonder if he will?&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Diaries'' pp. 92, 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In March 2006, Titmuss made her London theatre acting début, playing a [[prostitute]] with a [[multiple personality disorder]] in ''Two Way Mirror'' by [[Arthur Miller]], at the Courtyard Theatre in [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]],&lt;ref name=indy&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/abi-titmuss-on-the-latest-stage-in-her-colourful-life-755322.html "Abi Titmuss on the latest stage in her colourful life"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 25 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; for which she won a Fringe Report Award for Best West End Début.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fringereport.com/07awards.php Fringe Report Awards 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Titmuss had a small role in the film ''[[Goal! 2]]'' and in 2007 appeared in the second series premiere of ''[[Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive]]'', which aired on [[BBC Three]] and as a character called Gezebelle in an episode of ''[[Katy Brand's Big Ass Show]]'', a [[sketch comedy]] series for [[ITV2]].

Between 26 February and 23 March 2008, Titmuss appeared in the [[black comedy]] ''Fat Christ'' at the [[King's Head Theatre]] in [[Islington]], [[London]].

She has been cast in small roles in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[independent film]]s ''Do Elephants Pray?'' and ''Mixed Up''. In 2008, she played the "Mysterious Girl" in the [http://www.beat24.co.uk/ Beat 24 Films] independent feature film ''Frontman''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1307920/ Frontman]'', IMDB&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Titmuss was cast in the 25th anniversary production of [[John Godber]]'s play ''[[Up 'n' Under]]'' at the newly refurbished [[Hull Truck Theatre]], Hull. Titmuss played Hazel, the fitness instructor, starring alongside [[James Crossley (bodybuilder)|James Crossley]] (formerly the  "Hunter" in ''[[Gladiators (UK TV series)|Gladiator]]'') and [[Soap opera|soap]] actor [[Lewis Linford]] ("[[Lee Naylor (Emmerdale)|Lee Naylor]]" in ''[[Emmerdale]]''). She also had a part in the BBC TV series ''[[Hotel Babylon]]'', playing a nun.

From November until December 2009, Titmuss appeared in Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'', playing the character of [[Lady Macbeth]] with the [[The Seagull (theatre)|Seagull Rep]]. The production opened at the [[The Seagull (theatre)|Seagull Theatre]] in [[Lowestoft]] before transferring to other [[East Anglia]]n venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/6521307/Abi-Titmuss-Glamour-girl-to-Lady-Macbeth.html |title=Abi Titmuss: Glamour girl to Lady Macbeth |publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' |date=8 November 2009 |accessdate=7 December 2009 | first=Paul | last=Kendall| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091111001856/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/6521307/Abi-Titmuss-Glamour-girl-to-Lady-Macbeth.html| archivedate= 11 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 February 2012, she played the role of Tara Edmonds in an episode of [[BBC]] TV's ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glennie|first1=Alasdair|title=Ten years after that sex storm, John Leslie and Abi Titmuss are singletons at opposite ends of the country|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2330632/Abi-Titmuss-Ten-years-sex-storm-model-John-Leslie-singletons-opposite-ends-country.html|accessdate=1 June 2014|agency=|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date= 24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that landing the part gave her a sense of self-esteem that she had lost doing the glamour work.&lt;ref name="respect"/&gt;

In an article published by [[The Daily Mail]] in January 2015, Titmuss announced that she had changed her name to '''Abigail Evelyn''', in the context of her relocation to [[Hollywood]], [[California]] and her attempts to establish a new career as an actress.&lt;ref name=DMail2914807&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2914807/Can-Abi-Abi-Titmuss-considered-suicide-s-changed-surname-moved-Hollywood-left-sleeze-her.html|title=Abi Titmuss has moved to Hollywood and left the sleeze behind her|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poker==
Titmuss started playing [[poker]] "seriously" around 2001.&lt;ref name=metro&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2008/07/07/abi-women-make-good-poker-players-251207/ "Abi: Women make good poker players"], ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' online, 7 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Titmuss played in the charity, side-event "Ante Up For Africa" of the [[World Series of Poker]], in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/time-for-poker-player-abi-titmuss-320202#ixzz381A370C4 "Time for "poker player" Abi Titmuss to hold 'em"], ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 24 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ladbrokes]] Poker started sponsoring her in 2005, when she appeared in the first Ladbrokes Poker European Ladies Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.pokernews.com/news/2008/04/abi-titmuss-european-ladies-championship.htm "Abi Titmuss to Play in the European Ladies Championship"], UK Poker News, 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Titmuss produced a book, co-written with Jayne Lockwood, called ''Ten Fantasies'', in which she reveals her "ten most secret sexual fantasies."

{{Libertarianism in the United States sidebar}}
'''Albert Jay Nock''' (October 13, 1870 – August 19, 1945) was an [[United States|American]] [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] author, editor first of ''[[The Freeman]]'' and then ''[[The Nation]]'', [[education]]al theorist, [[Georgist]], and [[society|social]] critic of the early and middle 20th century. He was an outspoken opponent of the [[New Deal]], and served as a fundamental inspiration for the modern libertarian and conservative movements, cited as an influence by [[William F. Buckley Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Carl T. Bogus, ''Buckley: William F. Buckley Jr. and the Rise of American Conservatism'', Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first Americans to self-identify as "libertarian". His best-known books are ''Memoirs of a Superfluous Man'' and  ''[[Our Enemy, the State]]''.

==Life and work==
Throughout his life, Nock was a deeply private man who shared few of the details of his personal life with his working partners. He was born in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], the son of Emma Sheldon Jay and Joseph Albert Nock, who was both a steelworker and an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] priest. He was raised in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/stylish-elegance-biography-albert-jay-nock&lt;/ref&gt; Nock attended St. Stephen's College (now known as [[Bard College]]) from 1884 to 1888,&lt;ref&gt;Wreszin, Michael (1972). ''The Superfluous Anarchist: Albert Jay Nock'', Brown University Press, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; where he joined [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity.

After graduation he had a brief career playing minor league [[baseball]], and then attended a theological seminary and was ordained as an Episcopal priest in 1897. Nock married Agnes Grumbine in 1900 and the couple had two children, Francis and Samuel (both of whom became college professors). In 1909, Nock left the ministry as well as his wife and children, and became a [[journalist]].&lt;ref name="Powell1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jim Powell|title=Albert Jay Nock: A Gifted Pen for Radical Individualism|journal=The Freeman|date=March 1, 1997|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/albert-jay-nock-a-gifted-pen-for-radical-individualism#axzz2mWiVt8TL|publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carnes2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark C. Carnes|title=Invisible Giants: Fifty Americans Who Shaped the Nation But Missed the History Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlPSVv2TUcUC&amp;pg=PA221|date=September 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516883-9|page=221|quote=This early, quiet career as a minister ended abruptly in 1909, when Nock left the ministry, his wife, and his children to take up journalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Nock joined the staff of ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' magazine, which was at the time supportive of [[classical liberalism|liberal]] [[capitalism]]. Nock was an acquaintance of the influential politician and orator [[William Jennings Bryan]], and in 1915 traveled to [[Europe]] on a special assignment for Bryan, who was then [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].  Nock also maintained friendships with many of the leading proponents of the [[Georgist]] movement, one of whom had been his bishop in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]].

However, while Nock was a lifelong admirer of [[Henry George]], he was frequently at odds with other [[Georgism|Georgists]] in the left-leaning movement. Further, Nock was influenced by the anti-[[collectivism|collectivist]] writings of the [[Germany|German]] sociologist [[Franz Oppenheimer]],&lt;ref&gt;Albert Jay Nock, ''Our Enemy, the State'', The Caxton Printers, 1950, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; whose most famous work, ''[[The State (book)|Der Staat]]'', was published in English translation in 1915. In his own writings, Nock would later build on Oppenheimer's claim that the pursuit of human ends can be divided into two forms: the productive or economic means, and the parasitic, political means.

Between 1920 and 1924, Nock was the co-editor of ''[[The Freeman#History|The Freeman]]''. ''The Freeman'' was initially conceived as a vehicle for the [[Land value tax|single tax]] movement. It was financed by the wealthy wife of the magazine's other editor, [[Francis Neilson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neilson | first1 = Francis | year = 1946 | title = The Story of 'The Freeman' | url = | journal = The American Journal of Economics and Sociology | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 3–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although neither Nock nor Neilson was a dedicated single taxer. Contributors to ''The Freeman'' included: [[Charles A. Beard]], [[William Henry Chamberlin]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Lincoln Steffens]], [[Louis Untermeyer]], [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[Suzanne La Follette]], the more [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]&lt;ref&gt;Presley, Sharon (1981). "Suzanne La Follette: The Freewoman," ''Libertarian Review'' (Cato Institute).&lt;/ref&gt; cousin of Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]]. Critic [[H.L. Mencken]] wrote:
{{quote|His editorials during the three brief years of the ''Freeman'' set a mark that no other man of his trade has ever quite managed to reach. They were well-informed and sometimes even learned, but there was never the slightest trace of pedantry in {{nowrap|them.}}&lt;ref name="Mencken"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mencken | first1 = H.L. | year = 1926 | title = The Immortal Democrat | url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1926sep-00123 | journal = American Mercury | volume = 9 | issue = 33| page = 123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the unprofitable ''The Freeman'' ceased publication in 1924, Nock became a freelance journalist in [[New York City]] and [[Brussels, Belgium]].

"The Myth of a Guilty Nation,"&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1922 by B. W. Huebsch, Inc. Published in 2011 by the Ludwig von Mises Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; which came out in 1922, was Albert Jay Nock's first anti-war book, a cause he backed his entire life as an essential component of a libertarian outlook.  The burden of the book is to prove American war propaganda to be false. The purpose of [[World War I]], according to Nock, was not to liberate Europe and the world from German imperialism and threats.  If there was a conspiracy, it was by the allied powers to broadcast a public message that was completely contradicted by its own diplomatic cables. Along with that came war propaganda designed to make Germany into a devil nation.

In the mid-1920s, a small group of wealthy American admirers funded Nock's literary and historical work to enable him to follow his own interests. Shortly thereafter, he published his biography of [[Thomas Jefferson]]. When ''Jefferson'' was published in 1928, Mencken praised it as "the work of a subtle and highly dexterous craftsman" which cleared "off the vast mountain of doctrinaire rubbish that has risen above Jefferson's bones and also provides a clear and comprehensive account of the Jeffersonian system," and the "essence of it is that Jefferson divided all mankind into two classes, the producers and the exploiters, and he was for the former first, last and all the time." Mencken also thought the book to be accurate, shrewd, well-ordered and charming.&lt;ref name="Mencken" /&gt;

In his two 1932 books, ''On the Disadvantages of Being Educated and Other Essays'' and ''Theory of Education in the United States'', Nock launched a scathing critique of modern government-run [[education]].

In his 1936 article "Isaiah's Job",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nock | first1 = Albert Jay | year = 1956 | title = Isaiah's Job | url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/Freeman-1956dec-00031 | journal = The Freeman | volume = 6 | issue = 12| pages = 31–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' and was reprinted in pamphlet form in July 1962 by The Foundation for Economic Education, Nock expressed his complete disillusionment with the idea of reforming the current system.  Believing that it would be impossible to persuade any large portion of the general population of the correct course and opposing any suggestion of a violent revolution, Nock instead argued that libertarians should focus on nurturing what he called "the [[Remnant (Bible)|Remnant]]".

The Remnant, according to Nock, consisted of a small minority who understood the nature of the state and society, and who would become influential only after the current dangerous course had become thoroughly and obviously untenable, a situation which might not occur until far into the future.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Michael R. (1970). ''Five Counterrevolutionists in Higher Education: Irving Babbitt, Albert Jay Nock, Abraham Flexner, Robert Maynard Hutchins, Alexander Meiklejohn'', Oregon State University Press, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Nock's philosophy of the Remnant was influenced by the deep [[pessimism]] and [[elitism]] that social critic [[Ralph Adams Cram]] expressed in a 1932 essay, "Why We Do Not Behave Like Human Beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cram | first1 = Ralph Adams | year = 1932 | title = Why We Do Not Behave Like Human Beings | url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1932sep-00041 | journal = The American Mercury | volume = 27 | issue = 105| pages = 41–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''Memoirs of a [[Superfluous Man]]'', Nock makes no secret that his educators:

{{quote|did not pretend to believe that everyone is educable, for they knew, on the contrary, that very few are educable, very few indeed.  They saw this as a fact of nature, like the fact that few are six feet tall. [...] They accepted the fact that there are practicable ranges of intellectual and spiritual experience which nature has opened to some and closed to others.}}

In 1941, Nock published a two-part essay in ''The Atlantic Monthly'' titled "The Jewish Problem in America".&lt;ref&gt;Nock, Albert Jay (1941). [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1941/06/the-jewish-problem-in-america/306268/?single_page=true "The Jewish Problem in America,"] ''The Atlantic Monthly'', June 1, pp. 699–705.&lt;/ref&gt; The article was part of a multi-author series, assembled by the editors in response to recent [[anti-Semitic]] unrest in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] and elsewhere "in the hope that a free and forthright debate will reduce the pressure, now dangerously high, and leave us with a healthier understanding of the human elements involved."

Nock's argument was that the Jews were an Oriental people, acceptable to the "intelligent Occidental" yet forever strangers to "the Occidental mass-man."&lt;ref&gt;Crunden, Robert Morse (1964). ''The Mind and Art of Albert Jay Nock'', Henry Regnery Company, pp. 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the mass-man "is inclined to be more resentful of the Oriental as a competitor than of another Occidental;" the American masses are "the great rope and lamppost artists of the world;" and in studying Jewish history, "one is struck with the fact that [[persecution]]s never have originated in an upper class movement". This innate hostility of the masses, he concluded, might be exploited by a [[scapegoating]] state to distract from "any shocks of an economic dislocation that may occur in the years ahead." He concluded, "If I keep up my family's record of longevity, I think it is not impossible that I shall live to see the [[Nuremberg laws]] reenacted in this country and enforced with vigor" and affirmed that the consequences of such a [[pogrom]] "would be as appalling in their extent and magnitude as anything seen since the [[Middle Ages]]."

The article was itself declared by some to be anti-Semitic, and Nock was never asked to write another article, effectively ending his career as a social critic. Against charges of anti-Semitism, Nock answered, "Someone asked me years ago if it were true that I disliked Jews, and I replied that it was certainly true, not at all because they are Jews but because they are folks, and I don't like folks."&lt;ref name="Nock1936"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Albert Jay Nock|title=Autobiographical Sketch (unpublished piece written for Paul Palmer, editor of the American Mercury Magazine, c. 1936)|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ckank/FultonsLair/013/nock/biography.html|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=12 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629134713/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ckank/FultonsLair/013/nock/biography.html|archivedate=June 29, 2017|date=May 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, two years before his death, Nock published his autobiography, ''Memoirs of a Superfluous Man'', the title of which expressed the degree of Nock's disillusionment and alienation from current social trends. After the publication of this autobiography, Nock became the sometime guest of oilman [[William F. Buckley, Sr.]],&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Jr., William F. (2008). ''Let Us Talk of Many Things: The Collected Speeches'', Basic Books, p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; whose son, [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], would later become an influential author and speaker.

Nock died of [[leukemia]] in 1945, at the [[Wakefield, Rhode Island]] home of his longtime friend, Ruth Robinson, the illustrator of his 1934 book, "A Journey into Rabelais' France". He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, in Wakefield.

== Thought ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Describing himself as a [[Philosophical anarchism|philosophical anarchist]],&lt;ref&gt;Wreszin, Michael (1969). "Albert Jay Nock and the Anarchist Elitist Tradition in America," ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 21, No. 2, Part 1, pp. 165–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Nock called for a radical vision of society free from the influence of the political [[Sovereign state|state]]. He described the state as that which "claims and exercises the monopoly of crime". He opposed centralization, regulation, the income tax, and mandatory education, along with what he saw as the degradation of society. He denounced in equal terms all forms of [[totalitarianism]], including "[[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]]... [[Fascism]], [[Hitlerism]], [[Marxism]], [and] [[Communism]]" but also harshly criticized [[democracy]]. Instead, Nock argued, "The practical reason for freedom is that freedom seems to be the only condition under which any kind of substantial moral fiber can be developed. Everything else has been tried, world without end. Going dead against reason and experience, we have tried law, compulsion and authoritarianism of various kinds, and the result is nothing to be proud of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nock | first1 = Albert Jay | year = 1924 | title = On Doing the Right Thing | url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1924nov-00257 | journal = American Mercury | volume = 3 | issue = 11| pages = 257–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, Nock was one of the most consistent [[Critics of the New Deal|critics]] of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] programs. In ''[[Our Enemy, the State]]'', Nock argued that the New Deal was merely a pretext for the federal government to increase its control over society. He was dismayed that the president had gathered unprecedented power in his own hands and called this development an out-and-out [[coup d'état]]. Nock criticized those who believed that the new regimentation of the economy was temporary, arguing that it would prove a permanent shift.  He believed that the inflationary monetary policy of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] administrations of the 1920s was responsible for the onset of the [[Great Depression]] and that the New Deal was responsible for perpetuating it.

Nock was also a passionate opponent of war, and what he considered the US government's aggressive foreign policy. He believed that war could bring out only the worst in society and argued that it led inevitably to [[collectivization]] and militarization and "fortified a universal faith in violence; it set in motion endless adventures in [[imperialism]], endless nationalist ambitions," while, at the same time, costing countless human lives. During the [[First World War]], Nock wrote for ''The Nation'', which was censored by the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] administration for opposing the war.

Despite his distaste for communism, Nock harshly criticized the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] following the parliamentary revolution and [[Bolshevik]] coup in that country. Before the [[Second World War]], Nock wrote a series of articles deploring what he saw as Roosevelt's gamesmanship and interventionism leading inevitably to US involvement. Nock was one of the few who maintained a principled opposition to the war throughout its course.

Despite becoming considerably more obscure in death than he had been in life, Nock was an important influence on the next generation of laissez-faire capitalist American thinkers, including [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] such as [[Murray Rothbard]], [[Frank Chodorov]],&lt;ref&gt;Nitsche, Charles G. (1981). ''Albert Jay Nock and Frank Chodorov: Case Studies in Recent American Individualist and Anti-statist Thought'', (Ph.D. Dissertation), University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Read]], and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] such as [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]. Nock's conservative view of society would help inspire the [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] movement in response to the development of [[neoconservatism]] during the [[Cold War]]. In insisting on the state itself as the root problem, Nock's thought was one of the main precursors to [[anarcho-capitalism]].

==Anti-Semitism and disillusionment with democracy==
When Albert Jay Nock started ''The Freeman'' magazine in 1920, ''The Nation'' offered its congratulations to a new voice in liberal journalism. Nock rebuffed the gesture in a letter to the magazine's owner, [[Oswald Garrison Villard|Oswald Villard]], in which he wrote, "I hate to seem ungrateful, but we haint liberal. We loathes liberalism and loathes it hard," identifying himself with [[Political radicalism|Radicalism]].&lt;ref name="Lasch1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Lasch|title=The American Liberals and the Russian Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbEqAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22seem%20ungrateful%22|year=1972|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossinow2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Charles Rossinow|title=Visions of Progress: The Left-liberal Tradition in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1OYZQs4y0UC&amp;pg=PA98|year=2008|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-4049-9|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nock professed allegiance to a detached philosophical objectivity, expressed in his Platonist credo of "seeing things as they are".&lt;ref name="NeilsonNock1921"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Francis Neilson, Albert Jay Nock|title=The Freeman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGUwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA391|volume=3|year=1921|publisher=Freeman Incorporated|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Thomist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyQUAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22seeing%20things%20as%20they%20are%22|year=1951|publisher=Thomist Press|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had decried anti-Semitism in his earlier writings, but in his sixties he began giving vent to increasingly anti-Semitic and anti-democratic sentiments,&lt;ref name="Filler1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Filler|title=American Anxieties: A Collective Portrait of The 1930s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fnke0NK7GwAC&amp;pg=PA49|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-1687-8|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading Robert Sherrill, writing years later in ''The Nation'', to call him "virulently anti-Semitic" and "anti-democratic".&lt;ref name="Sherrill1988"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Robert Sherrill|title=William F.

When Nock lamented the presence of Jews and other undesirables in what he seemed to consider his private study, the New York Public Library, he echoed the fierce resentment of the elderly Adams against the presence of Jews in places that he loved, and on boats and trains.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he died, Nock destroyed all his notes and papers, except a few letters and an autobiographical manuscript published posthumously as ''Journal of Forgotten Days'' (Nock was so secretive about the details of his personal life that ''[[Marquis Who's Who|Who's Who]]'' could not find out his birthdate).&lt;ref name="Kunitz1955"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Kunitz|title=Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature.

In ''Journal of Forgotten Days'', Nock wrote these passages about the Jews of New York City:

{{quote|20 September—The Jewish holiday Yom Kippur yesterday closed New York up as tight as a white-oak knot. One would say there was not a hundred dollars' worth of business done in all the town. It sets one's mind back on Hitler's policy. The question is not what one thinks of it as an American, but what one would think of it if one were a German in Germany, where the control of cultural agencies is so largely in the hands of Jews—the press, drama, music, education, etc.—and where there is, or was, a superb native culture essentially antithetical.

Nock took a jaundiced view of American politics and American democracy itself,&lt;ref name="Buckley2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F.

"They are all mountebanks," Mr. Nock said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted that in all his life he voted in only one presidential election, in which he cast a write-in vote for [[Jefferson Davis]].

In ''Memoirs of a Superfluous Man'' (1943), Nock had this to say about mass democracy in America:

{{quote|I could see how "democracy" might do very well in a society of saints and sages led by an Alfred or an Antoninus Pius. Short of that, I was unable to see how it could come to anything but an ochlocracy of mass-men led by a sagacious knave.

The author [[Clifton Fadiman]], reviewing ''Memoirs of a Superfluous Man'', wrote: "I have not since the days of the early Mencken read a more eloquently written blast against democracy or enjoyed more fully a display of crusted prejudice. Mr. Nock is a highly civilized man who does not like our civilization and will have no part of it."&lt;ref name="FuessBasford1947"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Claude Moore Fuess, Emory Shelvy Basford|title=Unseen Harvests: A Treasury of Teaching|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NWgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Clifton%20Fadiman%20wrote%22|year=1947|publisher=Macmillan|page=610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nock's biographer Michael Wreszin wrote concerning Nock's reaction to the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932: "Sailing to Brussels in February 1933, before Roosevelt's inauguration in March, he repeated in a journal his appreciation of Catherine Wilson's observation that the skyline of New York was the finest sight in America when viewed from the deck of an outbound steamer."&lt;ref name="Wreszin1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Wreszin|title=The Superfluous Anarchist: Albert Jay Nock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CB9bAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Jews%22|year=1972|publisher=Brown University Press|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrea Nebel''' (born '''Andrea Meyer'''), known under her artist name of '''Nebelhexë''', is a German recording artist, writer, actress and model.  

== Music career ==
{{Peacock|section|date=September 2008}}
{{unbalanced|section|date=September 2008}}

The artist describes her songs as meditative and haunting with style influences ranging from [[Cocteau Twins]] and [[Kate Bush]] to [[The Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos]]. Her style could be described as New Age with definite crossover appeal to a non-incense burning crowd.

Since 2003 she has released all her music under her artist name of Nebelhexë. She also writes film scripts, both horror and satire. She plans to make a movie called "The Neighbour". She has asked actor [[Cam Gigandet]] to co-star in the film. She met him through actor [[Jackson Rathbone]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zillo.de&lt;/ref&gt;

Her song "Skindeep", from the album ''[[Dead Waters (album)|Dead Waters]]'', was first chosen for the ''[[The Twilight Saga: New Moon (soundtrack)|Twilight Saga: New Moon]]'' soundtrack, but was then denied due to the explicit dark lyrics. The song is about [[sex]] and [[vampirism]] &lt;ref name="nebelhexe.com"&gt;Nebelhexe website http://www.nebelhexe.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and music videos==

A writer since 1995, her controversial writings, statements and comments have become quite acknowledged.&lt;ref name="myspace.com"&gt;Nebelhexë artist page on Myspace http://www.myspace.com/nebelhexe&lt;/ref&gt; She has spoken out against what she saw as the inhibiting patriarchal religions that restrict people's inner nature. She is a [[pagan]] and has written a book about Germanic spirituality and mythology, ''The Ancients Fire of Midgard''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://castleofvampiria.com/interviews.item.php?id=000005 Nebelhexë], castleofvampiria.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many of her social-critical comments have been printed in alternative magazines and also in the biggest Norwegian tabloid papers and magazines. She also writes Gothic and surreal poetry.

She is releasing a spoken word CD to her new poem book "The Dark Side of Dreaming". She also works on her biography "Walking With The Night".&lt;ref name="myspace.com"/&gt;

Her gloomy videos bear a strong message, but are often misunderstood and the cause of great discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Youtube clip of artist's song 'Torture is no Culture' and statement official website www.nebelhexe.com music section https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd-5XIt9V-w&lt;/ref&gt;

Her private life is very secluded. She has a daughter, Alva, with ex-husband [[Samoth|Tomas Haugen]] with whom she maintains a close friendship. Andrea Haugen says on her Trivia page that she loves [[Sighthound]]s, [[Arabian horse]]s and [[Oriental cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;oral history, interview Nebelhexe, myspace.com/nebelhexe_personal&lt;/ref&gt;

She has domains both in Norway and the UK, where she resides and associates with several known actors.&lt;ref&gt;Life Mag interview Nebelhexe, myspace.com/nebelhexe_personal&lt;/ref&gt;  Haugen sees her future in film, acting and film music, both horror and comedy.&lt;ref&gt;interview Nebelhexe, June '09 [[Rock Tribune]], Belgia&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrei Nikolaevich Evseev '''(born 1955 in [[Khotkovo, Moscow Oblast|Khotkovo]], [[Sergiyevo-Posadsky District]], [[RSFSR]] - 1979 in [[Moscow]]), known as the "'''Tagaransky Maniac'''", was a [[Soviet]] [[serial killer]] who operated in Moscow and the [[Moscow Oblast]] in the mid-1970s.

== Biography ==
Evseev was born in 1955. He left school after the 7th grade, and worked as a model, laboratory assistant and sailor, but always quit because he didn't like to work. In the early 1970s, Evseev was placed in a psychiatric clinic. As he later told:{{Cquote
| quote = ...I left the hospital a complete fool for all the drugs that were injected into me in the hospital. I experienced a very painful state, difficulties in brain activity. I considered people to be my first enemies...&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPcNeJGvvvc Убийца с бакенбардами]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}The first victim of the maniac was a 16-year-old schoolgirl named Marina Morozova, who was dressed in red clothes. The murder was committed by Evseev in the city of Zagorsk (now [[Sergiyev Posad]]) on August 25, 1974. The following day, Evseev killed 66-year-old chef Gennady Kuzmin, stabbing him with a knife several times near the [[Odintsovo]] railway station, then robbed the corpse and threw him into a roadside ditch. Evseev stole money and a grocery order that was scarce in Soviet times - a broiler chicken and three kilograms of [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] peaches. On suspicion of committing these crimes in the [[Kemerovo Oblast]], 19-year-old Sergei Savelyev, who [[Desertion|deserted]] on the eve of the first murder from the military unit, was arrested, but he failed to prove his involvement, despite the fact that he confessed to the murder of Morozova.

In September 1974, in Moscow, in the park of the Palace of Culture named after the [[Third International]], Evseev attacked student Vladimir Parshin, inflicting 4 knife wounds on him, but he survived. On September 24, 1974, in Moscow, in a house near the [[Dobryninskaya]] metro station, Evseev made a robbery attack on Anna Astafyeva. Despite being on the verge of life and death, she was able to describe the killer; according to her, the killer was a young man with sideburns and kind eyes. Soon after, the woman died in hospital.

On September 26, at the 43rd kilometer station in the Moscow Oblast, Evseev attacked a man and seriously injured him. When attacking, the maniac broke his knife and the blade was left stuck in the victim's back, who died later in hospital. The murdered man, who looked very similar to Evseev, was 42-year-old Nikolai Dyomin, who had spent almost 20 years in prison. As it later turned out, Evseev committed the murder with the aim of confusing the tracks by putting his clothes on the man. Initially, the investigators even thought it was Dyomin who committed all the robberies and murders.

On October 8, 1974, in the [[Tagansky District]] of Moscow, Evseev made 3 robbery attacks at once. Two of the three women robbed by him died from the knife wounds, and all of them wore red dresses. Panic began in Moscow, with people saying that the "Killer of women in red" had appeared. On October 15, in the area of the [[Akademicheskaya (Moscow Metro)|Akademicheskaya]] metro station, at intervals of 20 minutes, Evseev committed 2 more attacks on girls, one of them dying from the wounds received. On October 16, in the area of the [[Proletarskaya (Moscow Metro)|Proletarskaya]] metro station, Evseev again made a double attack, killing one of the victims. But this time both victims were not wearing red clothes (thus, the version that the maniac who hunted for women in red was not confirmed).

After this, Evseev committed a series of robberies in Moscow and the surrounding region, but all victims survived and described the killer the same way. In connection with the panic in Moscow, the leadership of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR]] decided on unprecedented measures, the Minister of Internal Affairs [[Nikolai Shchelokov]] spoke on television, warning the citizens to be cautious. This frightened Evseev, who stopped his attacks for almost 2 years.

In November 1976, Evseev committed 4 robberies in a month, 2 of which ended in murder. In the fall of 1977, Evseev hit the secretary-typist of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]] Nina Dalinjan on the head with a screwdriver, but she miraculously survived. The apotheosis of the criminal activity of the maniac was the brutal murder of Lydia Kupriyanova, the wife of famous Soviet artist Mikhail Kupriyanov. This time, for the first time, the maniac raped the victim posthumously. Two months later, on December 19, 1977, in front of dozens of people in the backyard of the "Housewares" store in the village of Sofrino, he committed another murder. He took the watch, money, jewelry and a dog collar from the murdered Lydia Schur, raping her corpse afterwards.

=== Arrest, trial and sentence ===
A witness to the last murder reported that he had seen a suspicious man in a corduroy jacket at the crime scene. The local drinking company said that with them appeared a certain Shahnov, dressed in the velvet jacket. The jacket, on which there were blood stains and a knife was in one of the pockets, was later found. However, when Shahnov was arrested, he reported that another man had given him that jacket, with subsequent examination confirming the man's testimony. Another witness said that he had seen a stranger on a train in Khotkovo, and that he was wearing a railwayman's uniform. When the database was picked up and according to it were selected suitable matches, 22-year-old criminal Andrei Evseev came up as a result.

On December 28, 1977 the maniac was arrested. On this day he had dressed the [[New Years]] tree with jewels stolen from the victims. When they came for him, he hid the jewels, and there was nothing suspicious in Evseev's apartment, except for the dog collar stolen from the last victim. He explained that he kept it hidden as a memory of his beloved dog. At first he refused to give evidence, but on December 31, on [[New Year's Eve]], while conversing with a cellmate, he dropped a strange phrase: "My mother, I suppose, already baked pies with jewels." The cellmate turned out to be an informant, and the investigators guessed that the stolen jewelry was hidden in a bag of flour. The conjecture was confirmed during the second search of Evseev's apartment.

At the interrogations, Evseev was defiant and refused to communicate with the female investigator. He agreed to testify only after he was brought salted herring, which he ate entirely with bones. Subsequently, he confessed to 9 murders, 18 attempted murders, one rape and 32 [[Brigandage|robberies]].

The [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatric]] examination recognized Evseev as sane, but at the same time called him a "[[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.murders.ru/USSR_serial_killer_history_7.html|title=«Социализм не порождает преступности…»|last=А. И. Ракитин.|date=2008-09 гг.|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67PVUYVFK?url=http://www.murders.ru/USSR_serial_killer_history_5.html|archive-date=2012-05-04|access-date=2010-9-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While waiting for the court, Evseev watched for himself, and did exercises every morning. The maniac felt no remorse for his deeds, claiming that he despised those who work and live "from salary to salary."

In 1979, the court sentenced Andrei Evseev to [[Capital punishment|death]], and he was soon [[executed by firing squad]].

(born October 27, 1940 in [[Greenville, Mississippi]], United States) is a traveling Christian preacher, most known for carrying a [[cross]] through every nation of the world.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Blessitt was born in [[Greenville, Mississippi]],&lt;ref name=thecross/&gt; and grew up in northeast [[Louisiana]], where his father managed a large cotton farm. At the age of 7 he accepted Christ at a revival meeting.&lt;ref name="Netherlands"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arthurblessitt.com/?q=netherlands.html | title=Netherlands | publisher=blessitt.com | accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[Mississippi College]] and [[Gateway Seminary|Golden Gate Baptist Seminary]] but abandoned his studies to serve as pastor in several Baptist churches across the US.&lt;ref name=Evangelicalism/&gt;

In the late 1960s Blessitt began evangelizing to the youth of Hollywood, California. There he became known as the "Minister of Sunset Strip." Blessitt preached to hippies, [[Hells Angels]], runaways, drug addicts, teen prostitutes, flower children, would-be actors, and rock stars. In March 1968, he opened a coffee house called ''His Place'' in a rented building next door to a topless go-go club. It was there that he first made a big cross to hang on the wall of the building on the inside. He started carrying the cross on Sunset Strip from time to time.

His first marriage was to Sherry Anne Simmons, whom he married within three weeks of dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20071397,00.html | author=Oliver, John A. | title=The World's Most Itinerant Preacher, Arthur Blessitt, Bears His Cross 17,000 Miles | work = People Weekly | date=July 31, 1978 | accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had six children: Gina, Joel, Joy, Joshua, Joseph and Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Netherlands"/&gt; All his sons are named Arthur, and go by their middle names.

In 1990 he married Denise. They have adopted one child, Sophia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} As of the late 2000s, he lives in [[Denver, Colorado]].

===Cross walk===
Arthur made the cross in 1968 to hang on the wall of 'His Place' on Sunset Strip, Hollywood. He made short cross-walks there. Then on Christmas morning in 1969, Blessitt began his journey with the cross, walking from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. He later said he heard the voice of [[Jesus]]  calling him to walk to every nation.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3636409/Quite-interesting.html | title=Quite interesting | publisher=Telegraph | date=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short while, he set up an evangelical outreach on New York's [[Times Square]], which was similar to his Hollywood coffeehouse.&lt;ref name=Evangelicalism&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Randall Herbert|title=Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|date=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=|isbn=9780664224097|page=72|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1971, Blessitt made his first overseas cross-walk beginning in [[Northern Ireland]].

He has carried the cross to all parts of the world including war-torn countries such as [[Lebanon]] and the world to share Jesus. During the [[Cold War]], Blessitt carried his cross into the [[Soviet Union]], through Russia, the [[Baltic States]], [[Ukraine]] and other countries. He has carried the cross through such places as [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], [[North Korea]], [[Iran]], [[Islamic State of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[China]], [[South Africa]], [[Lebanon]], [[India]], [[Antarctica]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Israel]], [[Cuba]], [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]], [[Yemen Arab Republic|Northern]] and [[Southern Yemen]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Mongolia]].

During his walk around the world, Blessitt has held audience with numerous world and religious leaders including, [[George W. Bush]], [[Billy Graham]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Yasser Arafat]] and [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] and was arrested 24 times. &lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

On part of the cross-walk through [[Beirut]], Blessitt chose to bring his son Joshua.&lt;ref name="Christianity Today"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Cross: The Arthur Blessitt Story | journal = [[Christianity Today]] | date = March 27, 2009 | first = Annie Young | last = Frisbie| id = | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/movies/reviews/2009/crossarthurblessittstory.html | accessdate = 2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed every nation and major island group on June 7, 2008 but is still walking on.

As of 2018 he is still carrying the cross in the U.S. and other nations. This is the 50th year of Arthur carrying the cross (1968-2018). Over 42,279 miles (68,042km) through 324 countries (including Island Groups and Territories), of which 54 were in open war. This is about 84.5 million steps and about 19 billion pounds carried.  He has crossed every ocean and walked on all seven continents (including [[Antarctica]]). He is known internationally as the "Pilgrim with the Cross." He is in the Guinness World Records Book 2015 on page 155 with a photo and story for Longest Around the World Ongoing Pilgrimage/Walk. His latest film documentary in 2014 is "The Cross Museum of Arthur and Denise Blessitt"; "Arthur a Pilgrim"(1988), was his first documentary feature.

Blessitt is the subject of a 2009 documentary feature, ''[[The Cross (2009 film)|The Cross: The Arthur Blessitt Story]]'', directed by [[Matthew Crouch]].&lt;ref name=thecross&gt;{{IMDb title|1385869|The Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===

He made a failed bid for the 1976 Democratic nomination for President. After, he said, "we need a born-again, soul-winning witness in the White House".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blessitt.com/historical-moments See "Blessitt for President"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evangelist Is Happy Loser In Presidential Bid" ([[Associated Press]]), as printed in the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]], 17 July 1976, p. 9.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">'''Clem Coetsee''' (c. 1939 &amp;ndash; 7 September 2006) was a [[Zimbabwe]]an [[conservation movement|conservationist]]. He developed new methods of big game conservation.

==History==
Coetsee was at the forefront of the campaign to de-horn [[rhinoceros|rhinos]] under sedation, to make them safe from [[poaching|poachers]] who kill for the horn.

He also pioneered the practice of managing [[elephant]] populations by sedating and moving entire family groups, from bulls and cows down to calves, in contrast to the practice of slaughtering the mature animals and relocating only youngsters. Moving family groups was seen as more successful in relocating the animals without ill effects, and has been repeated in several countries. In 1992 he had tracking microchips implanted under the skin of more than 40 elephants, which were being relocated from Zimbabwe's [[Gonarezhou National Park]] to [[South Africa]] because of drought. This was the first time an elephant relocation had used this technology for follow-up.

He died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 7 September 2006.

'''David Rubinstein''', also known as '''Dave Insurgent''' (September 5, 1964 – July 3, 1993), was an American singer and co-founder of the New York-based [[hardcore punk]] band [[Reagan Youth]]. Rubenstein founded the band with guitarist Paul Bakija when both were in [[Forest Hills High School (New York)|Forest Hills High School]] in [[Forest Hills, Queens]]. The band played the punk clubs of Manhattan while the members were still in high school.

==Reagan Youth==
As the [[Reagan Youth]] members attended Forest Hills High School, the band performed regularly at [[CBGB's]] and other venues on the United States' budding punk rock circuit. They never recorded a single, only some self-published tapes and an album that was turned into a seven-song EP. That EP sold more than 40,000 copies. The band also appeared on several compilations albums, including ''Live at [[CBGB's]]''. They toured cross-country twice, in 1984 and 1987, sharing bills with punk bands such as [[Dead Kennedys]], [[U.S. Chaos]], [[Agnostic Front]], [[Bad Brains]] and [[Beastie Boys]]. They were a mainstay at [[CBGB]]'s Sunday matinee concerts and performed at [[Rock Against Racism]] concerts in the early 1980s.

Reagan Youth was a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] band, often using [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Nazi Party]] imagery as political satire. In their original 1980s incarnation, they sought to address the parallels between the policies of president [[Ronald Reagan]], the [[Christian Right]] and [[conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] and the beliefs of [[hate groups]].&lt;ref name="New Red Archives bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newredarchives.com/bands/Reaganyouth/bio.htm |title=Reagan Youth : Biography |publisher=New Red Archives |date= |accessdate=2016-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904232634/http://www.newredarchives.com/bands/Reaganyouth/bio.htm |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[eponym]]ous song, "Reagan Youth", uses a [[tongue-in-cheek]] rhetoric to draw parallels between [[Young Republicans]] and the [[Hitler Youth]]. The fact that Rubinstein's parents were [[Holocaust]] survivors added to the urgency of the band's message.&lt;ref name="New Red Archives bio"/&gt;

By the late 1980s, the Reagan Youth members were frustrated and worn out from years of touring, drug use and not making money in the music industry. When Reagan left office, the band officially disbanded. Rubinstein and several other band members continued to play music together, such as in the band House of God, which never achieved the same success as Reagan Youth.

==Personal problems and suicide==
By the time Reagan Youth broke up, Rubinstein had developed a serious [[heroin]] [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and was  dealing drugs.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} During a drug deal, another drug dealer beat up Rubinstein with a baseball bat, leaving him in a coma. ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul "Cripple" Bakija |url=http://paulcripple.blogspot.com/ |title=I'm the Living Proof of Reagan's Lies |website=Paulcripple.blogspot.com |date=2014-06-04 |accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=June 2014}} While admitted at the hospital Rubinstein received a lobotomy to relieve brain trauma and save his life.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-11/entertainment/ct-ott-0412-reagan-youth-20130411_1_band-hardcore-reagan-youth |title=After unspeakable tragedies, Reagan Youth is trying again |last=Stewart |first=Alison |date=April 11, 2013 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=April 2, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170402034207/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-11/entertainment/ct-ott-0412-reagan-youth-20130411_1_band-hardcore-reagan-youth |archivedate=April 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he got out of the hospital, he returned to his parents' home. There, Rubinstein continued to use drugs, smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in his bedroom as his parents tried to help him recover. Eventually Rubinstein left his parents' home and moved back to the [[Lower East Side]]. By then, between the assault and his continued drug use, he was no longer as energetic, and had become dishevelled. Many of his friends from the punk scene no longer associated with him.

Rubinstein began dating Tiffany Bresciani, a prostitute who worked on [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston Street]] and danced in strip clubs around the city.&lt;ref name=Bresciani1&gt;Newton, Michael. [http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/rifkin/7.html "Joel David Rifkin: New York's Most Prolific Serial Killer"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110003949/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/rifkin/7.html |date=2014-01-10 }}. TruTV, accessed August 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He had told his parents that she was a dancer. Bresciani financially supported the couple and their drug habit with prostitution.

On June 24, 1993, Rubinstein and Bresciani were waiting on [[Allen Street (Manhattan)|Allen Street]] when a familiar customer pulled up in a Mazda pickup truck. Tiffany got in, telling Rubinstein that she would return in 20 minutes. She never came back. Rubinstein called the police with a description of the truck and went to the club where Tiffany danced and all the hospital emergency rooms in the city, searching for Tiffany. A few days later, on June 28, two New York state troopers were patrolling [[Long Island]]'s [[Southern State Parkway]] when they pulled over the truck after a high-speed chase, finding Bresciani's decaying body in the back. They arrested the driver, [[Joel Rifkin]], one of Long Island's most infamous [[serial killer]]s, who was later linked to killing numerous prostitutes.&lt;ref name=Bresciani1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bresciani2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasindorf, Jeanie Russell.

Depressed and alone after the unexpected loss of his girlfriend and mother, Rubinstein headed into a downward spiral, and less than a week after Bresciani's murder, on July 3, 1993, he committed suicide by a drug overdose.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;

'''Sir Donald Murdo McCallum''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society|FRAeS]] [[Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering|FREng]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology|FIET]] (6 August 1922 – 18 October 2011)&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/SciwSd3_AoeIgevB1M1IasrVQcw/appointments Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; was a Scottish [[radar]] engineer and an important industrialist.

==Early life==
Don McCallum was born in [[Edinburgh]]. His father, Roderick McCallum, was a headmaster who married Lillian McPhee. He attended [[George Watson's College|George Watson's Boys' College]]. He gained a BSc (1st) in [[Electrical engineering|Electrical Engineering]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/EEA483B3_5056_A318_A825FD4682EDACAB.pdf Page 143]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
He worked for the Navy on [[homing beacon]]s on the [[Implacable-class aircraft carrier|Implacable-class]] aircraft carriers [[HMS Indefatigable (R10)]] and [[HMS Implacable (R86)]]. From 1942-46 he worked for the [[Admiralty Signal Establishment]], later known as the [[Admiralty Research Establishment]].

From June 1944 he worked on [[Talk Between Ships]] (TBS). On the day before D-Day, he had worked on [[HMS Bulolo]], which had directed the landings off [[Gold Beach]].

==Career==
===Ferranti===
He worked for forty years at [[Ferranti Scotland]] in Edinburgh, half of those years as general manager&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1981/1981%20-%201936.html Flightglobal June 1981]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1968; the company had 8,000 employees. He joined Ferranti in 1947. The company had established itself in Edinburgh during World War II to make gyroscopic gunsights ([[gyro gunsight]]s).

Projects he oversaw included the [[Ferranti]] [[Laser Target Marker]] (LTM or FLTM) and the [[Seaspray (radar)|Seaspray radar]], and [[airborne interception radar]]s.

He was made an FIEE in 1969 and an FEng in 1982. In 1985 he won the British Gold Medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aerosociety.com/Assets/Docs/List%20of%20RAeS%20Award%20Winners%20v2.pdf British Gold Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; He became a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1986.

He retired as general manager in 1985, then as Chairman in 1987; six years later Ferranti went bankrupt. Some people believe that had he still been at the company, that bankruptcy may not have happened.

===Education===
In the early 1990s he was President of the [[Scottish Council for Development and Industry]]. He was Chairman of the Scottish Committee of the [[Universities Funding Council]], now the [[Scottish Funding Council]]. He also served on the Scottish Tertiary Education Advisory Council.

==Personal life==
He married Barbara Black in 1949, and they had a daughter in 1950, who died in 2007; his first wife died in 1971. He married again in 1974, and his second wife died in 1997. He married in 2007.

He received a CBE in the [[1976 Birthday Honours]] and a knighthood in the [[1988 New Year Honours]]. He lived in his later life from 2007 at [[Newland, Cumbria|Egton with Newland]] near [[Ulverston]] in [[South Lakeland]]. He died aged 89 in Cumbria. He was buried on Wednesday 26 October 2011 in Edinburgh. He had grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

'''Eula "Pearl" Carter Scott''' (1915–2005) became the youngest pilot in the United States on September 12, 1929, when she took her first solo flight at the age of 13.&lt;ref name="chickasaw1995"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hof.chickasaw.net/Inductees/1995/Eula-Pearl-Carter-Scott.aspx |title=Chickasaw Nation Hall of Fame - Eula Pearl Carter Scott |publisher=Hof.chickasaw.net |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was taught to fly by the notable pioneer aviator [[Wiley Post]].&lt;ref name="oksenate1"&gt;{{cite web|author=oklahoma state senate staff |url=http://www.oksenate.gov/news/press_releases/press_releases_2014/pr20140219f.htm |title=Oklahoma State Senate - News |publisher=Oksenate.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a stunt pilot.&lt;ref name="oksenate1"/&gt; In 1972 she became one of the [[Chickasaw Nation]]'s first community health representatives; her mother was an original enrollee of the Chickasaw Nation.&lt;ref name="oksenate1"/&gt; Scott was elected to the Chickasaw legislature in 1983 and served three terms there.&lt;ref name="chickasaw1995"/&gt;

==Early life==
Pearl was born to George and Lucy Carter on December 9, 1915 in [[Marlow, Oklahoma|Marlow]], [[Stephens County, Oklahoma]]. She was the youngest of three girls, and also had a younger brother named George Carter, Jr.{{efn| George Carter, Jr. was still living in Marlow when Pearl died in 2015.&lt;ref name="Deering"&gt;[http://newsok.com/article/2890477 Deering, Roy. "Love for flying helped woman make history. NewsOK. March 31, 2005.] Accessed March 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Her father was a wealthy businessman, while Lucy was an original enrollee of the [[Chickasaw Nation]]. Pearl evidently eschewed many of the traditional activities of young Chickasaw women. Instead, she acquired her own automobile when she was only eleven years old, and had learned to drive herself by the age of twelve. Pearl said late in her life that her father was blind, and that she had served as his eyes, so she accompanied him everywhere, whether in his office or collecting rents out on the farms. She also said that she spent her whole childhood talking with adults.&lt;ref name="CNHOF"&gt;[https://hof.chickasaw.net/Inductees/1995/Pearl-Carter-Scott.aspx "Pearl Carter Scott." Chickasaw Nation Hall of Fame.] Accessed 2018-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pearl in the air==
Noted pioneer aviator Wiley Post was a friend of the Carter family and visited their home from time to time. One of his visits occurred in 1928, when Pearl was twelve years old. He gave Pearl and her father their first ride in an airplane. She was totally enthralled by the experience, later saying:

&lt;Blockquote&gt;
"I knew right then, while I was in the air with Wiley that first day, that I would fly someday. I asked him a hundred questions while we were up in the air, and as soon as he set(''sic'') the plane down, I ran over and told Daddy that I wanted to learn to fly."&lt;ref name="Deering"/&gt;
&lt;/Blockquote&gt;

Post agreed to teach Pearl how to fly. After several months of lessons, her father surprised her with her own [[Curtis Robbins]] airplane. On September 12, 1929, she took off on her first solo flight, becoming the youngest person in Oklahoma at that time to accomplish this feat. Not long afterward, she began to perform as a stunt pilot.&lt;ref name="Deering"/&gt;

In 1931, Post flew into the local airstrip with another man, whom Pearl did not recognize. Moments later Post introduced her to the already world famous [[Will Rogers]].&lt;ref name="Deering"/&gt;

==Devotion to children==
Pearl married at age 16, and quickly started a family of her own. She continued to fly after her first baby, but after she bore a second, she realized that the babies would have to grow up without a mother if there were an accident. She abruptly quit flying. She apparently relented once, when Wiley Post allowed her to take to the air flying his famous "Winnie Mae," in which he had set two world records.&lt;ref name="Deering"/&gt;

==Service to Chickasaw Nation==
In 1972, Pearl began her "second career" as an active worker for the Chickasaw Nation.  After studying at the Desert Willow Indian Training Center in Tucson, Arizona, she became one of the tribe's first community health representatives. In 1983, she was elected to the Chickasaw Legislature, where she served three terms.&lt;ref name="CNHOF"/&gt;

==Recognition of her accomplishments==
She was inducted into the [[Chickasaw Nation Hall of Fame]], the [[International Women's Air &amp; Space Museum]] Hall of Fame, and the [[Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame]], and is a charter member of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] at the Smithsonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=News 12 Staff |url=http://www.kxii.com/community/headlines/Portrait-of-famous-aviator-and-Chickasaw-legislator-unveiled-at-Capitol-246362461.html |title=Portrait of famous aviator and Chickasaw legislator unveiled at Capitol |publisher=Kxii.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; All her flying experience is included in the "History of Aviation Collection on Women" at Texas University in Dallas.&lt;ref name="chickasaw1995"/&gt; She is also listed in the 1978-79 edition of ''Personalities of the South'', the 1989-90 edition of ''Outstanding Women of America'', and in the Chickasaw Historical Section of the Memphis Magazine.&lt;ref name="chickasaw1995"/&gt; In 2014 a portrait of her was unveiled in the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/09/portrait-celebrated-aviator-pearl-carter-scott-unveiled-oklahoma-153922 |title=Portrait of Celebrated Aviator Pearl Carter Scott Unveiled in Oklahoma - ICTMN.com |publisher=Indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com |date=2015-11-04 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major General]] '''Sir George Arthur French''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCMG}} (19 June 1841 – 7 July 1921) was a [[British Army]] officer who served as the first [[Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police]], from October 1873 to July 1876, and as Commandant of the colonial military forces in [[Queensland]] (1883–91) and [[New South Wales]] (1896–1902)

George Arthur French was born at [[Roscommon]], Ireland. He was educated at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], and commissioned in the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1860.

In 1871, at the request of the Canadian government, he was sent to Canada as a military inspector, eventually becoming head of the [[School of Gunnery]] at [[Kingston, Ontario]].

French was appointed to organise the [[North-West Mounted Police]] on its creation in 1873, and the next year he led the force on its famous march to the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]].

French resigned in 1876 and returned to duty in the [[British Army]], eventually attaining the rank of major general. The organizational skills developed in Canada were used to establish local defence forces in [[India]] and Australia. In September 1883 he was appointed Commandant of the Queensland Local Forces with the local rank of colonel, and arrived in the colony on 4 January 1884. Colonel French married, in 1862, Janet Clarke, daughter of the late Robert Long Innes, formerly of the 37th Regiment. Colonel French retired in 1891, and returned to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Australasia|French, Colonel George Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired from the army on 3 September 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27470|page=5685|date=2 September 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was knighted as Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the November [[1902 Birthday Honours]]. For the next 19 years much of his time was spent guarding the [[crown jewels]] in London, where he died in 1921.

'''Hetepi''' was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian official of the [[First Intermediate Period]], around 2200 BC. He is known from his stela that is now in the [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum of Florence]]. The stela was bought in 1884–1885 by [[Ernesto Schiaparelli]]. The orinal provenance was not known,&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Bosticco, ''Le stele egiziane dall'antico al nuovo regno'', Rome 1959, page. 18–19, fig. 8, (Inv. 6375)&lt;/ref&gt; but must come originally from [[Naqada]], where there was a cemetery of the First Intermediate Period. Hetepi was ''sole friend'' and ''inspector of priests''. From other sources it is known that these local inspectors of priests also had non religious functions and were therefore the local governors of their towns. [[Henry George Fischer]] showed that the cemeteries near Naqada were those of [[Qus]] on the other side of the [[Nile]]. Hetepi was therefore governor of Qus.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Fischer: ''Inscriptions from the Coptite Nome, Dynasties VI–XI'', Rome 1964, pp. 77–80, no. 26, pl. XXIII&lt;/ref&gt; On the stela is also shown his son [[Dagi (Egyptian official)|Dagi]], who bears the same titles and who was most likely the successor in office.

==Examples==
A great deal of writing has been done on the subject. The subject of the Ideal Woman has been treated humorously,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/men/article4790198.ece Sunday Times, September 28, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askmen.com/dating/curtsmith_100/119_dating_advice.html ''12 types of women you should date'', by Matthew Fitzgerald]&lt;/ref&gt; astrologically,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cafeastrology.com/articles/idealwomanforaman.html cafeastrology.com]&lt;/ref&gt; theologically,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2bvm16.htm ''The Ideal Woman is a Precious Treasure,'' by Pope John Paul II]&lt;/ref&gt; and musically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicsonglyrics.com/A/adrianbelewlyrics/adrianbelewtheidealwomanlyrics.htm ''The Ideal Woman'' by Adrian Bellew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of "ideal women" are portrayed in literature, for example:

An '''Informationist''' (or Information Specialist in Context) provides research and [[knowledge management]] services in the context of clinical care or [[biomedical research]]. 
Although there is no one educational pathway or formalized set of skills or knowledge for informationists, one way to think of the informationist is as one who possesses the knowledge and skill of a medical librarian with extensive research specialization and  some formal clinical or [[public health]] education that goes beyond on-the-job osmosis.
Medical librarians and other biomedical professional organizations have been exploring the possibilities for evaluating how informationists are being used and whether their activities supplement or replace [[medical library]] activity.

More generally, an Informationist is a professional who works with information within a particular business, analytic or scientific context to drive toward outcomes based on evidence, analysis, prediction and execution. For example, an extension of the term is increasingly emerging in financial services, life sciences and health care industries. Though still nascently in use, its adoption applies to individuals with extensive industry expertise, acute familiarity with organizational structures and processes, deep domain level information mastery and information systems technical savvy. Informationists in this context support transformational initiatives within and across functional areas of an enterprise as architects, governance experts, continuous improvement advocates and strategists.

==Background==
The term was proposed in 2000 by Davidoff &amp; Florance.&lt;ref name=Davidoff&gt;Davidoff F., Florance V. "The informationist: A new health profession?", ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]''. 2000; 132(12): 996-998.  [http://www.annals.org/content/132/12/996.extract Excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  Their editorial suggested that physicians should be delegating their information needs to informationists, just as they currently order [[Computed tomography|CT scans]] from radiologists or cardiac catheterizations from cardiologists. They conceived of an [[information professional]] who was embedded in (and indeed, supported by) the clinical departments.

Supporters of the concept see it as a means for librarians to reinvigorate connections with the faculty/clinicians, as well as provide superior service by dint of informationists' biomedical training. Critics complained that the idea is nothing new (perhaps most famously in an article entitled "So what are we? Chopped liver?"&lt;ref name="chopped liver"&gt;Kronenfeld M. 2000. "'The Informationist: a New Health Profession?' So What Are We? Chopped Liver?" ''National Network'', [[Medical Library Association]]. (Dallas, Tex.). [http://www.hls.mlanet.org/NatNet/issues/v25n2.pdf 25, no. 2.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821123232/http://www.hls.mlanet.org/NatNet/issues/v25n2.pdf |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;); librarians already provide indepth, high quality information services and clinical medical librarians have been working alongside physicians, nurses and other clinicians for years.

Large informationist programs in the U.S. exist at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and at [[Vanderbilt University]]. Welch Medical Library at [[Johns Hopkins University]] (JHU) is developing an informationist [[service model]] in which its 10 clinical and public health librarians are moving from serving as liaison librarians for assigned departments toward becoming embedded informationists within their departments.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

To prepare for the embedded informationist role, librarians are undertaking education as needed to supplement their backgrounds. For example, librarians bring experience in clinical behavior counseling, public health, nursing, and more. Informationist training can then focus upon filling gaps in [[Research|research methods]] knowledge more so than on gaining additional knowledge in the librarian's area of expertise. Courses, seminars and workshops being undertaken include those covering systematic reviews, [[evidence-based medicine]], critical appraisal, medical language, anatomy and physiology, biostatistics, and clinical research.

The term informationist is related to that of informatician – also informaticist – and many informationists do possess skills in clinical topics, bioinformatics, and [[biomedical informatics]]. [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] are examples of institutional libraries which have hired PhD-level  scientists (who may or may not have library degrees) to provide informatics support for biomedical research.

In September 2009, Wilson received international attention when he interrupted a [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|speech by U.S. President Barack Obama]] to the [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] by shouting "You lie!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/09/joe.wilson/index.html |title=CNN, Politics, retrieved 14 September 2009 |publisher=Cnn.com |date=September 10, 2009 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/09/2009916172057802997.html |title=Carter: Obama a target for racism |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident [[List of United States Representatives expelled, censured, or reprimanded#Reprimanded Representatives|resulted in a reprimand]] by the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=nyt20090915&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips |first=Kate |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/blogging-the-house-action-on-wilson/ |title=House Admonishes Wilson on Outburst|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and career==
Wilson was born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the son of Wray (née Graves) and Hugh deVeaux Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/wilsonjoe.htm |title=Joe Wilson |website=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson obtained a bachelor's degree in political science from [[Washington and Lee University]] in 1969 where he joined [[Sigma Nu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sigmanu.wlu.edu/famousalum.html |title=Sigma Nu |website=Sigmanu.wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained his [[Juris Doctor]] ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) degree from the [[University of South Carolina School of Law]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/w000795/ |title=Joe Wilson &amp;#124; Congressional votes database |publisher=Projects.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106082505/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/w000795/ |archivedate=January 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Wilson's Biography|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/3985/joe-wilson-sr#.VIdSRDHF-Tt|website=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 to 1975, Wilson served in the [[United States Army Reserve]], and then as a Staff Judge Advocate in the [[South Carolina Army National Guard]] assigned to the [[218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade|218th Mechanized Infantry Brigade]] until retiring from military service as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joewilson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=40 |title=Joe Wilson – Congressman Joe Wilson's Biography |publisher=Joewilson.house.gov |date=July 31, 1947 |accessdate=December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a real estate attorney, Wilson co-accounted (with Derek Vinyard) the law firm Kirkland, Wilson, Moore, Taylor &amp; Thomas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=3985 |title=Project Vote Smart – Representative Addison Graves 'Joe' Wilson Sr. – Biography |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=July 31, 1947 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[West Columbia, South Carolina|West Columbia]], where he practiced for over 25 years. Wilson was also a municipal judge in [[Springdale, Lexington County, South Carolina|Springdale, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="ourcampaigns"&gt;{{cite web|title=
Wilson, Addison Graves "Joe" |url= http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=2083 |date= September 10, 2009 |publisher= Our Campaigns |accessdate=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson was active in South Carolina Republican politics when the party barely existed in the state. He took part in his first Republican campaign in 1962, when he was 15 years old. He served as an aide to [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]] and to his district's Congressman, [[Floyd Spence]].

In 1981 and 1982, during the first term of the [[Reagan Administration]], Wilson served as deputy general counsel for former Governor [[James B. Edwards|Jim Edwards]] at the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]. Wilson is also a graduate of [[Morton Blackwell]]'s [[Leadership Institute]] in Arlington, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/right-goes-viral |title=The Right Goes Viral |publisher=''The Nation'' |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Carolina Senate==
Wilson was elected to the [[South Carolina Senate]] in 1984 as a Republican from [[Lexington County, South Carolina|Lexington County]]. He was re-elected four times, the last three times unopposed; Lexington County is one of the most Republican counties in the state. He never missed a regular legislative session in 17 years. After the Republicans gained control of the chamber in 1996, he became the first Republican to serve as Chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. Wilson was a member of the [[Columbia College (Columbia, South Carolina)|Columbia College]] Board of Visitors and [[Coker College]] Board of Trustees.

During his tenure in the South Carolina Senate, Wilson was the primary sponsor of bills which included the following: establishing a National Guard license plate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess113_1999-2000/bills/150.htm |title=South Carolina General Assembly Bill S0150 |publisher=Scstatehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing paid leave for state employees to perform disaster relief services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess113_1999-2000/bills/283.htm |title=South Carolina General Assembly Bill S0283 |publisher=Scstatehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and requiring men aged 18–26 to register for the [[Selective Service System]] when applying for a driver's license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess114_2001-2002/bills/634.htm |title=South Carolina General Assembly Bill S0634 |publisher=Scstatehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Wilson was one of seven senators who voted against removing the [[Confederate battle flag]] from being displayed over the state house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rep.

Like his former boss, Spence, Wilson is an ardent social and fiscal conservative, and a strong supporter of the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=BS021931 |title=Project Vote Smart – Representative Addison Graves 'Joe' Wilson Sr. – Interest Group Ratings |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=December 18, 2001 |accessdate=December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[Republican Study Committee]].

In 2003, Wilson voted for the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]], including its Section 1011 authorizing $250,000 annually of taxpayer money to reimburse hospitals for treatment of illegal immigrants. In 2009, Wilson changed to his current position opposing public funds for healthcare of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Shaw |first= Donny |title= Joe Wilson Voted to Provide Taxpayer Money for Illegal Immigrants' Healthcare |url= http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/1219-Joe-Wilson-Voted-to-Provide-Taxpayer-Money-for-Illegal-Immigrants-Healthcare |date= September 11, 2009 |publisher= OpenCongress.org |accessdate= September 12, 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090912223059/http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/1219-Joe-Wilson-Voted-to-Provide-Taxpayer-Money-for-Illegal-Immigrants-Healthcare |archivedate= September 12, 2009 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
Wilson has sponsored and co-sponsored a number of [[bill (proposed law)|bills]], concerning teacher recruitment and retention, college campus fire safety, National Guard troop levels, arming airline pilots, tax credits for adoptions, tax credits for living organ donors, and state defense forces.

As of January 2006, eight bills co-sponsored by Wilson have passed the House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=400433 |title=Addison (Joe) Wilson |date= |work=GovTrack.us |publisher= |accessdate=November 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including H.R. 1973, the [[Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005]], making safe water and sanitation an objective of U.S. assistance to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HR01973:@@@P: |title=Thomas (Library of Congress): H.R. 1973 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online [[poker]]. In 2006, he co-sponsored H.R. 4411, the [[Goodlatte]]-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411: |title=Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4411 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04777: |title=Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4777 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has cited as one of his proudest congressional achievements the Drafting Business Expensing Act of 2003{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, which allows businesses to immediately write-off fifty percent of the cost of business equipment and machinery. This bonus [[depreciation]] provision has been extended for 2008 and 2009 in two separate stimulus bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ185/content-detail.html |title=Public Law 110-185 – Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 |date=February 13, 2008 |work= |publisher=gpo.gov |accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/Public_Law-111-5.pdf |title=PUBLIC LAW 111–5— |date=February 17, 2009 |work= |publisher=whitehouse.gov |accessdate=November 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014112424/http://www.whitehouse.gov/%2fassets%2fdocuments%2fPublic_Law-111-5.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Wilson spearheaded the Drafting Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act of 2003, which offers higher education loan forgiveness to math, science and special education teachers in schools with a predominantly low income student population.&lt;ref name="statebio"&gt;James Rosen, [http://www.thestate.com/news-extras/story/936307.html "Joe Wilson Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912085107/http://www.thestate.com/news-extras/story/936307.html |date=September 12, 2009 }},

In contrast to the criticism, many others strongly supported his actions, distrusting that the bill would actually exclude illegal aliens in practice, which allowed Wilson to receive substantial political contributions and gain much notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-wilsons-you-lie-spurs-support-criticism/ |title=Joe Wilson's "You Lie!"

On a 2002 live broadcast of the [[C-SPAN]] talk show ''[[Washington Journal]]'', guests Wilson and Democratic congressman [[Bob Filner]] were discussing [[Iraq]]i [[weapons of mass destruction]]. When Filner noted that the US provided Iraq with "chemical and biological weapons" in the 1980s, Wilson stated that this idea was "made up" and commented to Filner, "This hatred of America by some people is just outrageous. And you need to get over that."

In 2003, [[Essie Mae Washington-Williams]] revealed she was the daughter of Wilson's former employer, the late Senator [[Strom Thurmond]], and Thurmond's black maid. Wilson was among those who publicly doubted her assertion that Thurmond had a child [[out of wedlock]]. Wilson said even if her story was true, she should not have revealed it because "it's a [[Smear campaign|smear]]" on Thurmond's image and was a way to "diminish" Thurmond's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Talhelm, "Most Say Revelation Won't Alter Thurmond's Legacy", ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'', December 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; After Thurmond's family acknowledged the truth of Washington-Williams' revelation, Wilson apologized, but said that he still thought that she should not have revealed that Thurmond was her father.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Talhelm and Aaron Gould Shinin, "Critics of Thurmond's Daughter Change Tune", ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'', December 19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that Representatives Wilson and [[Blaine Luetkemeyer]] made identical written statements, saying that "One of the reasons I have long supported the U.S. biotechnology industry is that it is a homegrown success story that has been an engine of job creation in this country. Unfortunately, many of the largest companies that would seek to enter the biosimilar market have made their money by outsourcing their research to foreign countries like India."

Wilson supported President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying that the order would "secure our borders and keep American families safe from terrorist attacks."&lt;ref name="Blake1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump's travel ban; here's where the rest stand|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/29/heres-where-republicans-stand-on-president-trumps-controversial-travel-ban|newspaper=Washington Post|date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson was elected in 2001 in a special election caused by the death of Floyd Spence, his former boss. Wilson once said that a dying Spence called him from his hospital bed and asked him to run.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Rucker and Ann Gerhart, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/10/AR2009091002051_pf.html "The Gentlemen From South Carolina: State Has a History of Rowdy Politics"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', September 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a crowded five-way Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—Wilson tallied 75 percent of the vote, more than enough to win the nomination outright.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7122">[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture.jpg|thumb|[[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] (1802). According to biographer Philippe Girard, there is no known portrait of Joseph Bunel.&lt;ref&gt;Girard, "Trading Races."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Joseph R. E. Bunel''' was a representative of the Haitian Revolutionary Government, who negotiated the first trade agreement between his nation and the United States, in 1799.

==Biography==
Born in France, he became a merchant and plantation manager in Cap-Français, Saint-Domingue (now [[Cap-Haïtien, Haiti]]). Although white and a slave-holder, his wife, Marie Fanchette Estève, was a free-black [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]], and he was sympathetic to the 1791 [[Haitian Revolution]] through which the former-colony won its independence from France. He served as a diplomatic and trade envoy for Governor [[Toussaint Louverture]], a self-educated former slave. He did the same for Louverture's successor, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]].&lt;ref&gt;Girard, "Trading Races."&lt;/ref&gt;

He played an important administrative role in Louverture's regime, drafting trade and non-aggression agreements between Saint-Domingue and the United States and Great Britain. Louverture trusted Bunel enough to make him the country's Paymaster General.

===United States===
In July 1798, the United States rescinded its treaties with France, beginning two years of low-level conflict known as the [[Quasi-War]]. L'Ouverture saw this breach as an opportunity.

In early-December 1798, Bunel came to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then the capital of the United States, to try to end the American trade embargo against Saint-Domingue. He met and dined with Secretary of State [[Timothy Pickering]], and was invited to meet President [[John Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander DeConde, ''The Quasi-War'' (New York: Scribner's, 1966), pp. 135-36.&lt;/ref&gt; In early-January 1799, he dined with Adams.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, "Toussaint's Clause," p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Debate in Congress over "Toussaint's Clause" focused on the consequences of legitimizing a revolutionary government run by former-slaves, and how American slave-holders would be endangered by interaction between their slaves and Saint-Dominguans. Pennsylvania Congressman [[Albert Gallatin]] appealed to racial prejudice in his notorious "Black Speech" (January 21, 1799), using Bunel (who had brought his wife with him) as an example of [[miscegenation]] taking place in Philadelphia: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The General [L'Ouverture] is black, and his agent here is married to a black woman in this city."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hart Benton, ''Abridgment of the Debates of Congress, from 1789 to 1856 Vol. 2'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1857), p. 339.[https://books.google.com/books?id=eMY4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thomas+hart+benton+Abridgement+of+the+debates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Im9gQznF80&amp;sig=hcUlUYirVYEky4mTgxLrPgdWjro&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jlycTP7-LIL7lwe8y4GICg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Congress passed "Toussaint's Clause," and the Bunels returned to Saint-Domingue in mid-February. 

The United States did not officially recognize the Haitian Revolutionary Government, but the trade agreement was announced by a June 26, 1799 presidential proclamation: [http://thelouvertureproject.org/index.php?title=Proclamation_Regarding_Commerce_with_St._Domingo U.S. Proclamation Regarding Commerce with St. Domingo (1799)].  

Following Jefferson's 1800 election as president, American support for Saint-Domingue diminished.

===French invasion===
Article 3 of L'Ouverture's [http://thelouvertureproject.org/index.php?title=Constitution_of_1801_(English) 1801 Haitian Constitution] stated: "''Slaves cannot exist on this territory; servitude is abolished forever. All men are born, live and die free and French.''" But, as the threat from [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] loomed, this provision seems to have been ignored:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Like the early rulers of Haiti who followed him, Toussaint was willing to participate in a one-way version of the slave trade in order to increase his workforce and his army. Bunel was dispatched to Jamaica to purchase ten thousand slaves from the English ... By the terms of Article 3, such arrivals would have to be freed as soon as they reached the colony, but the cloudy language about 'engagements' suggests that some form of indentured servitude was being contemplated."&lt;ref&gt;Madison Smartt Bell, ''Toussaint Louverture'' (Vintage Books, 2008), pp. 210-11.[https://books.google.com/books?id=bkTfVUdVaHYC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=joseph+bunel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DCyfRZhLc2&amp;sig=ZSeJSOp__Ls903IH_oht5e3ljlw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H9OYTLGfMcaAlAfe0oQk&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20bunel&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bonaparte's brother-in-law, General [[Charles Leclerc]], invaded Saint-Domingue in 1802. Bunel's wife was imprisoned, and he was forced to pay what was essentially a ransom.&lt;ref&gt;"Leclerc jailed the black wife of Louverture's white paymaster and diplomat Joseph Bunel, for example, to force her husband to pay an indemnity." Philippe Girard, "Rebelles with a Cause: Women in the Haitian War of Independence, 1802–04", in ''Gender and History'', 21:1 (April 2009), pp. 60-85.[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0424.2009.01535.x/full]
&lt;/ref&gt; Leclerc captured and imprisoned L'Ouverture, and deported him to France, where he died in 1803. Bunel was also deported to France. 

Bunel returned to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in 1803, where he became a major exporter of [[contraband]] goods to Saint-Domingue. He returned to Haiti during the reign of Dessalines. He, and later his wife, eventually settled permanently in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;Girard, "Trading Races."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judith Anne Stone''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 1 January 1942) is an Australian pop and country music singer.

==Early life==
Stone grew up in the Sydney suburb of [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]].&lt;ref name="Order of Aus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spicks Specks"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/tv/spicksandspecks/txt/s2362154.htm | title = Episode Thirty Four (17/09/2008) | work = [[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]] | date = 17 September 2008 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1961 Bio"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47491996 | title = Ca-rolling Stone gathers fans! | newspaper = [[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | volume = 28 | issue = 52 | date = 31 May 1961 | accessdate = 25 July 2016 | page = 11 (Teenagers' Weekly) | via = [[National Library of Australia]] }} Note: a [http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/47491996/4912458 photo] of Stone appears in the article.&lt;/ref&gt; She has two younger sisters, Joyce and Janice.&lt;ref name="Bio 2"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131332638 | title = Pretty 'Mighty atom' strikes the double | newspaper = [[The Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate|The Cumberland Argus]] | date = 9 August 1961 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 | page = 11 | via = National Library of Australia }} Note: Describes Stone as a 17-year-old: implying she was born in 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age she sang country music at home and her parents bought her a guitar, which she learned to play.&lt;ref name="1961 Bio"/&gt; 

== Career ==
In her early teens Stone entered and won a local talent contest and was noticed by an attendee, [[Reg Lindsay]]. By November 1956 she had joined his touring performance troupe, the Reg Lindsay Show, and stayed for 18 months.&lt;ref name="1961 Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reg Show 1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131386466 |title=Advertising: The Reg Lindsay Show |newspaper=[[The Cumberland Argus]] |issue=3358 |date=14 November 1956 |accessdate=26 July 2016 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1957 a reviewer of Lindsay's show in [[Cabramatta, New South Wales|Cabramatta]] for ''[[The Biz (newspaper)|The Biz]]'' wrote that "Little Judy Stone, of Granville, was very pleasing in her turn."&lt;ref name="Reg Show 2"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article189947450 | title = Reg Lindsay at Cabramatta | newspaper = [[The Biz (newspaper)|The Biz]] | date = 10 July 1957 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 | page = 6 | via = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone hired [[Kevin Jacobsen]] as her talent agent.&lt;ref name="1961 Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio 2"/&gt; She described meeting him, "I used to sing, with a heavy guitar, Western style numbers. Once I met Kevin he gave me one instruction: 'Throw that guitar out the window.' Although I did not throw it out any window, I am now singing without any of my own musical accompaniment."&lt;ref name="Bio 2"/&gt; Jacobsen's older brother, [[Col Joye]], was an established pop singer and regular performer on ''[[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]]'', a TV music show.&lt;ref name="1961 Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio 2"/&gt; Stone supported his group, Joye and the Joy Boys, on their tours of South Australia, Victoria and Queensland.&lt;ref name="1961 Bio"/&gt; Stone, as a young performer, had been billed as "The Cowgirl from Granville" but on her first appearance on ''Bandstand'' she was mistakenly announced as "The [[Callgirl]] from Granville".&lt;ref name="Spicks Specks"/&gt; By May 1961 she had also appeared on other TV music shows, ''Teen Time'' and ''[[Six O'Clock Rock]]''.&lt;ref name="1961 Bio"/&gt;

Jacobsen had Stone signed with [[Festival Records]] and in June 1961 she issued her debut single, "You're Driving Me Mad" – a cover version of the 1958 song by United States singer, [[Jo Ann Campbell]].&lt;ref name="McFarlane"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = McFarlane | first1 = Ian | authorlink1 = Ian McFarlane | title = [[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]] | chapter = Encyclopedia entry for 'Judy Stone' | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040823035443/http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=417 | chapterurl = http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=417 | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] | location = [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]] | archivedate = 23 August 2004 | isbn = 1-86508-072-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuttall 1"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/43557/20160504-1246/www.poparchives.com.au/2480/judy-stone/youre-driving-me-mad.html | url = http://www.poparchives.com.au/2480/judy-stone/youre-driving-me-mad.html | title = 'You're Driving Me Mad' – Judy Stone (1961) | work = Pop Archives – Sources of Australian Pop Records from the 50s, 60s and 70s | publisher = Lyn Nuttall | archivedate = 4 May 2016 | accessdate = 25 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the track she was backed by the Joy Boys.&lt;ref name="Kimball Fest"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/35967/20090315-0738/www.milesago.com/industry/festival-2.html | url = http://www.milesago.com/industry/festival-2.html | title = Industry – Record Labels – Festival Records | last = Kimball | first = Duncan | publisher = Milesago: Australasian Music and Popular Culture 1964–1975.

In 1963 she recorded "It Takes a Lot (To Make Me Cry)" on which the [[Bee Gees]] ([[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Robin Gibb|Robin]] and [[Maurice Gibb]]) sing backup vocals; it was released as a single in July.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/63.html | title = Gibb Songs: 1963 | author = Brennan, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her seventh single, "4,003,221 Tears from Now", was released in April 1964.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; It is a cover version of the 1963 single by US singer Kerri Downs (aka Mary Lou Kiernan).&lt;ref name="Nuttall 2"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/43557/20160504-1246/www.poparchives.com.au/245/judy-stone/4003221-tears-from-now.html | url = http://www.poparchives.com.au/245/judy-stone/4003221-tears-from-now.html | title = '4,003,221 Tears from Now' – Judy Stone (1964) | work = Pop Archives – Sources of Australian Pop Records from the 50s, 60s and 70s | publisher = Lyn Nuttall | archivedate = 4 May 2016 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], it "became Stone's most popular release of the 1960s. The heart-wrenching ballad... [which] peaked at #8 in Sydney and #7 in Melbourne."&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;

Aside from her solo releases, Stone was often teamed with Col Joye in duets for singles, extended plays and albums.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; McFarlane found their work "contained cutesy material like 'Young and Healthy', 'Angry' and 'Side by Side'."&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; In early 1965 Stone with Col Joye and the Joy Boys undertook a tour of Japan for two months.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; In September 1966 she covered "[[Sandy Posey#.22Born a Woman.22|Born a Woman]]" by US singer, Sandy Posey.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuttall 3"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/43557/20160504-1246/www.poparchives.com.au/161/judy-stone/born-a-woman.html | url = http://www.poparchives.com.au/161/judy-stone/born-a-woman.html | title = 'Born a Woman' – Judy Stone (1966) | work = Pop Archives – Sources of Australian Pop Records from the 50s, 60s and 70s | publisher = Lyn Nuttall | archivedate = 4 May 2016 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a top&amp;nbsp;10 hit in Sydney.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;

From the late 1960s and into the early 1970s Stone "consolidated on her early pop successes with regular appearances on the club and country music circuits."&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; Later singles included, "Mare Mare Mare" (January 1974), "[[Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone) (song)|Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)]]" (No.&amp;nbsp;2, June 1974),&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt; "Silver Wings and Golden Rings" (February 1975) and "[[Hasta Mañana]]" (May 1976).&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;

In January 1992 Stone was diagnosed with [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]], which was removed by surgery.&lt;ref name="Cancer diag"/&gt;

In 2007 Stone performed a duet with Scottish singer-songwriter Isla Grant on the track "What's a Girl to Do?" for Grant's album, ''Down Memory Lane''.

== Personal life ==

On 25 February 1966, Stone married fellow musician, [[Leo de Kroo]].&lt;ref name="Wedding"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105888862 | title = Pop Stars Wed | newspaper = [[The Canberra Times]] | volume = 40 | issue = 11,402 | date = 26 February 1966 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 | page = 3 | via = National Library of Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; The de Kroo brothers, Leo and Doug, were a duo who also appeared on ''Bandstand'' and other pop music shows.&lt;ref name="Manning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47249042 | title = Three boys take to the sawdust trail | last = Ward | first = Kirsten | newspaper = The Australian Women's Weekly | volume = 29 | issue = 16 | date = 20 September 1961 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 | page = 11 (''Teenagers' Weekly'') | via = National Library of Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage ended in divorce five years later, Stone reflected, "I blamed myself when it ended, then I realized something its taken a long time to learn – singing is my life... I don't have a social life – there simply isn't time – but I don't get lonely; I have my family."&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51268476 |title = Judy Stone's new single: 'The year's best kept secret' | last = Manning | first = Fiona | newspaper = The Australian Women's Weekly | volume = 48 | issue = 16 | date = 17 September 1980 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 | page = 32 (Free: ''Your TV Magazine'') | via = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1992 Stone was diagnosed with [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]], at the same time as her fellow ''Bandstand'' regular, [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]].&lt;ref name="Cancer diag"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126929837 | title = Entertainers mourn singer | newspaper = The Canberra Times | volume = 66 | issue = 20,887 | date = 20 June 1992 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 | page = 17 | via = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stone and Allen were operated on the same day by the same surgeon.&lt;ref name="Cancer diag"/&gt; In June Stone was still in recovery when she learned of Allen's death, she recalled that after the operation "He came into my room to see me because he was going back to the States and I just wanted to give him a big hug — he looked so ill."&lt;ref name="Cancer diag"/&gt;

On the Queen's Birthday Honours List of June 2006, Stone was awarded a [[Order of Australia|Member of the Order of Australia]], with the citation, "For service to the community as an entertainer at fundraising events for a range of charitable organisations, and as a singer."&lt;ref name="Order of Aus"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1132980&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true | title = Honours - Search Australian Honours: Stone, Judith Anne | publisher = It's an Honour | accessdate = 25 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 she was made [[Australia Day]] Ambassador for regional celebrations in Laurieton, Wauchope and Port Macquarie.&lt;ref name="Oz Day 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wauchopegazette.com.au/story/1998715/judy-stone-is-our-ambassador/ | title = Judy Stone is our ambassador | work = Wauchope Gazette | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | date = 2 January 2014 | accessdate = 26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karsan Devjibhai Ghavri''' {{audio|Karsan_Ghavri.ogg|pronunciation}} (born 28 February 1951, in [[Rajkot]], [[Gujarat]]) is a former [[India]]n [[cricket]]er who played in 39 [[Test cricket|Tests]] and 19 [[One Day International|ODI]]s from 1974 to 1981. He played in the 1975 and 1979 World Cups.

Ghavri was a left-arm fast-medium pace bowler, with a long run-up and a high leaping action. He could also produce quickish but accurate left-arm finger spin. Altogether he took 109 Test wickets, including four five-wicket hauls. With the bat he was usually found in the lower order but managed a couple of Test half centuries including a career best 86 against Australia in Bombay. By the time he was dismissed he had made a record eighth-wicket partnership of 127 with [[Syed Kirmani]]. His 86 came off just 99 balls which contained 12 fours and 3 huge sixes. Syed Kirmani who was sent as a night watchman remained unbeaten with 101. India went on to win that Test match and also the series against Kim Hughes' Australian team.

Despite making his debut in 1975, it was not until the season of 1976–77 that he cemented his spot in the side after series against New Zealand and England. He remained a regular member of the side until 1981. His most successful series came against the West Indies in 1978–79 with 27 wickets. One of his memorable spell came during India's tour of Australia in 1981 during second innings of the 3rd Test match of the series. On the 4th day of that match he got rid of Australia's opening batsman John Dyson and captain Greg Chappell in 2 successive deliveries which set up the stage for India's victory on the final day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63281.html |title= India vs Australia, 3rd Test, 1981 |publisher=CricInfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; India won that match by 59 runs with [[Kapil Dev]] doing rest of the damage on the final day of the match.

He was [[Kapil Dev]]'s bowling partner when the future Indian great made his debut in 1978 against Pakistan at Faisalabad.

Ghavri was eventually replaced by [[Madan Lal]] during the 1982 tour of England to India.

'''Lou Cooley''' was a [[cowboy]], and alleged [[gunfighter]] who took part in the [[Wyatt Earp|Earp]]-[[Ike Clanton|Clanton]] feud in [[Tombstone, AZ]] from 1880-1882.

==Biography==
Cooley's reputation as a gunfighter is mostly [[hearsay]]. In fact, there are no known gunfights involving Cooley. The one confirmed fact is that he was one of the suspects in the death of [[Johnny Ringo]]. Cooley was reputedly one of the few men who did not fear Ringo, or anyone else, and had the skills necessary to survive a confrontation with him. At least that is the legend as it is told. But in reality, few feared Johnny Ringo. Though he had a fearsome temper, Ringo never killed anyone aside from unarmed men, a fact since confirmed by [[historian]]s. Cooley was alleged to have been good with a gun, and this came from reliable sources, however there is nothing to indicate he ever actually put those skills to work.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

It was suggested that a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] led by [[Wyatt Earp]] located Ringo, who spotted them and grabbed his guns to run for a canyon. Cooley shot him as he ran with a rifle. Another theory was that Cooley killed him one on one. Neither version can be proven. It is confirmed that he supported the Earp faction, but he has never been mentioned as having taken active part in the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]]. He is believed to have helped fund the ride, and he is believed to have been employed as a [[stage coach]] driver for [[Wells Fargo]] at the time.

Although his personal exploits have no written proof, Cooley was a friend to Wyatt Earp, as well as [[Doc Holliday]]. Cooley was also a close friend of [[Virgil Earp]]. It is widely known that Lou Cooley sided against the "Cowboys" with Virgil Earp at a time when the confrontation between the Earps and Clantons reached a boiling point, but there are no documented accounts of him having any clashes with any of the Clanton clan, or the "Cowboys". He did have a reputation of being fast with a gun, and an excellent shot. [[Morgan Earp]], another friend of Cooley's, reported that he could shoot a [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] out of a person's hand before they could slap their hands together.

It has been suggested that it was Lou Cooley that shot and killed[[Ike Clanton]]in [[Mexico]], and he supposedly did so to end more backshooting from the cowboys against the Earps—at that point both Morgan and Virgil had been ambushed. However, that was a complete fabrication, since Ike Clanton's death was a well documented event, with him having been killed by [[Detective]] Jonas V. Brighton in [[Springerville, Arizona]]. In fact, there are no documented facts confirming Cooley having ever been involved in any gunfight.

Cooley has at times been confused with lawman/outlaw [[Scott Cooley]], but the two are not the same. Lou Cooley disappeared from public view after the end of the Earp-Clanton fighting, and evidently resumed a normal life. It is recorded that he died in [[Oak Hill, Tennessee]] at the age of 93 and is buried outside of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. His family still resides there today.

'''Mangku Muriati''' (born in 1967) is a traditional-style Balinese painter and priestess from [[Kamasan]] village near [[Klungkung]], [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]].

Mangku Muriati, born in 1967, paints in traditional Balinese form, known as Kamasan-style, where the aesthetic form and most stories relate to the ''[[wayang kulit]]'' puppet theatre. This form of painting has a very old tradition, associated with the East Javanese kingdom of [[Majapahit]], which flourished in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and helped to propagate [[Hindu]] faith across the region – now largely retained in Bali.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[Adrian Vickers, Balinese Art: Paintings and Drawings of Bali 1800 - 2010, Tuttle Publishing 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It was from the [[Kamasan]] village where artists were traditionally recruited to produce classical-style paintings on cloth (or bark cloth) for religious and ceremonial use as well as to decorate the palaces and temples.

Mangku Muriati is a daughter of Mangku Mura (1920-1999), who is considered one of the prominent artists of his generation in Kamasan-style painting [1].&lt;ref&gt;[Anthony Forge, Balinese Traditional Paintings, Australian Museum, Sydney 1978]&lt;/ref&gt;

As was common practice in artist families, Muriati used to help her father in colouring paintings from an early age, learning the craft of painting. She studied art at the [[Udayana University]] in [[Denpasar]], Bali, but after graduating, returned to the traditional style of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Vickers, Balinese Art: Paintings and Drawings of Bali 1800 - 2010, Tuttle Publishing 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siobhan Campbell, Kamasan painting at the Australian Museum and beyond, Art Monthly Australia 2011) No. 244 (Oct): 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; Working as a Kamasan artist, she joined a small number of Balinese women who work in this style, customarily dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;^ Siobhan Campbell, Collecting Balinese Art: The Forge Collection of the Balinese Paintings  at the Australian Museum in Sydney, Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Sydney 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, at the age of 32, Muriati became a priestess at her local clan temple in the ward of Banjar Siku. She considers painting and priestly duties as complementary, comparing the role of an artist to a [[dhalang]] or puppeteer, who needs an extensive knowledge of characters and stories, ultimately derived from what is considered the sacred scripture - the [[Hindu]] epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. The subjects of her paintings and related commentaries frequently refer to social and political issues in contemporary Bali. [3]&lt;ref&gt;^ Siobhan Campbell, A Balinese artist and temple priest builds on her father’s legacy, Inside Indonesia 106: Oct-Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Muriati’s paintings have been exhibited in Bali as well as internationally.

'''Mehmet Niyazi Cemali''' ({{lang-crh|script=latn|Memet Niyaziy}}; January or February 1878 - November 20, 1931) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-born [[Romania]]n and [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] poet, journalist, schoolteacher, academic, and activist for [[Tatars of Romania|ethnic Tatar]] causes. Present for part of his life in the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Crimea]]-proper, he wrote most of his works in Crimean Tatar and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. Niyazi is credited with having played a major part in keeping alive the connection between the [[Crimean Tatar diaspora]] and their land of origin, and is best known for his lyrical works depicting Crimea (''The Green Island'' and ''The Green Homeland'').&lt;ref name=glynwilliams&gt;Brian Glyn Williams, ''The Crimean Tatars'', [[Brill Publishers]], [[Leiden]], 2001, p.283-286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born into a [[Islam in Romania|Muslim]] family of [[Crimean Tatars in Romania|Crimean refugees]] in the village of [[Pecineaga|Aşçılar]], [[Northern Dobruja]], he was the second son of Ismail and Azize, two literate peasants and Ottoman subjects.&lt;ref name="tatarro"&gt;{{ro icon}} Agi-Amet Gemal, [http://tatar.officemax.com.ro/personalitati/mehmet_niyazi.php "Mehmet Niyazi", in ''Dicţionarul personalităţilor turco-tătare''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930133028/http://tatar.officemax.com.ro/personalitati/mehmet_niyazi.php |date=2007-09-30 }}, hosted by Tatar.ro&lt;/ref&gt; Niyazi's birth coincided with the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], which ended in the region's annexation by the [[Kingdom of Romania]].&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; He familiarized himself with Tatar literature and folklore during his childhood, and was taught Ottoman Turkish by his father, before completing his primary education in Aşçılar.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; It was probably during his teenage years that he first began authoring his series of literary pieces, which, overall, were noted for their reliance on elements of the Ottoman vocabulary.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt;

In 1889, the family left Romania for the Ottoman capital of [[Istanbul]], where Mehmet was enrolled in normal school.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; In subsequent years, he became influenced by the creations of [[Namık Kemal]] and [[Abdullah Hamit]], as well as achieving fluency in [[French language|French]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; In 1898 and 1899, he attempted to settle in Russian-ruled Crimea and start a career as a schoolteacher, but was expelled by the government on both occasions.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt;

After his father's death in 1904, Niyazi returned to Romania and joined the Tatar community in [[Constanţa]].&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; He married Sefika Abdulakim (also known as Sapiye); she was the sister of [[Kázím Abdulakim]] (a [[Romanian Army]] officer and [[World War I]] hero) and of the politician [[Selim Abdulakim]].&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; The couple had four daughters and two sons (two of their children died in their teens).&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt;

Niyazi was appointed a teacher at the local Tatar school in 1906, lecturing in Ottoman History, Ottoman Language, [[Ottoman poetry|Poetry]] and [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Prose]], [[Persian literature|Persian Literature]], and ''[[Kalam]]''.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; He served as the institution's headmaster between 1910 and 1914, settling with his family in [[Medgidia]] after 1916, when he was appointed headmaster of the Islamic Seminary in that town.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; In 1909, he began editing the journal ''Dobruca'', which was printed in Istanbul by the Kader publishing house.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; Other short-lived publications he started during the period include ''Tesvik'', ''Mektep ve Aile'', and, with [[Cevdet Kemal]], ''Isik''.&lt;ref name=glynwilliams/&gt;&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt;

In early 1918, when the [[Qurultay]] proclaimed a [[Crimean People's Republic]] in the wake of the [[October Revolution]] and upon the close of World War I, Niyazi left for [[Simferopol]] (''Aqmescit''), where he joined Tatar activists in their campaign, edited the ''[[Hak Ses]]'' newspaper, and for a while was employed by the Crimean Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; When the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]] troops entered Crimea (''see [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]''), he took refuge in Romania.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; From that moment on, Mehmet Niyazi concentrated on literary activities, entering the most prolific phase of his career.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; He published his works in the [[Arabic alphabet]] version of Crimean Tatar.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; As a community leader, he was an influence on a new wave of Crimean refugees who sought inspiration in the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s ''[[Prometheism|Prometheist]]'' policies.&lt;ref name=glynwilliams/&gt;

Suffering from [[tuberculosis]], he died as a result of the disease, having his last years clouded by the death of his wife Sefika.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; He was buried in Medgidia, with a ceremony that attracted a large crowd of his admirers.&lt;ref name="tatarro"/&gt; His large-scale grave (''[[mezar]]'') was argued to have been the first modern one to bear the ''[[tamgha]]'' present on the [[Crimean Khanate]]'s flag (''see [[Flag of Crimea]]'').&lt;ref name=glynwilliams/&gt; The location endured as a rallying point for the Tatar community.&lt;ref name=glynwilliams/&gt;

== Biography ==
Gvosdev received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fpri.org/contributor/nikolas-gvosdev-2/|title=Nikolas K. Gvosdev - Foreign Policy Research Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked [[executive editor]] and the [[founding editor]] of ''[[The National Interest]]''. In 2005 he appointed journal's now-defunct separate web edition, In The National Interest. Upon leaving the editorship in 2008, he was succeeded by [[Justine Rosenthal]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='The National Interest' Appoints Justine Rosenthal as New Czar |url=http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2008/05/the_national_in/ |accessdate=January 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619071032/http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2008/05/the_national_in/ |archivedate=June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he remains associated with the journal as a contributing editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/|title=The National Interest|website=The National Interest}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many articles, essays, books. He has appeared as an analyst and a commentator on television and radio likes [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], [[MSNBC]], [[National Public Radio]], [[BBC]], [[C-SPAN]]'s Washington Journal, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[Voice of America]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.usnwc.edu/NikolasGvosdev |title= U.S Naval War College;Faculty;Profile |access-date= 2015-02-03 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150203234817/https://www.usnwc.edu/NikolasGvosdev |archive-date= 2015-02-03 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gvosdev lived in [[Washington DC]] and served as Senior Fellow for strategic studies at the [[Nixon Center]], and as an Adjunct Professor at [[Georgetown University]] and [[George Washington University]] until 2007. In 2008 he moved to [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and started teaching at the [[Naval War College]]. He is married with one son.

Along with [[Dimitri K. Simes]], [[Anatol Lieven]], and [[John Hulsman]], Gvosdev is seen as one of the proponents of the "new realism" in foreign policy—one that acknowledges a greater role for values than traditional [[realpolitik]] as espoused by [[Henry Kissinger]] but nonetheless puts a stress on setting priorities. He has also been one of the strongest proponents for engagement with Russia and has tended to view [[Vladimir Putin]]'s government in a more positive light than most American commentators, characterizing his regime as "managed pluralism" rather than as an outright authoritarian state. Along with [[Ray Takeyh]], he was an early skeptic of the proposition that the [[Democracy promotion|spread of democracy]] in the Middle East would bring pro-American governments to power.

They founded the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].

==Early life and education==
Reynolds Morse was born in [[Denver, Colorado]] to Bradish P. and Anna Morse. His father ran the specialist mining and machinery concern, Morse Brothers Machinery Company. His mother was the daughter of pioneer Albert Eugene Reynolds.

Reynolds Morse graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. He then took an [[MBA]] at the [[Harvard Business School]]. For a decade after his MBA, Reynolds worked in industry before starting his own firm, Injection Molders Supply Company in 1949.

Reese Morse was the daughter of [[Cleveland]] pharmaceuticals manufacturer George Reese. After graduating from the [[Hathaway Brown School]], she earned a bachelor's degree in music from [[Rollins College]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/07/16/eleanor_morse_97_founded_museum_to_display_dalis_work/|title=Eleanor Morse, 97; founded museum to display Dali’s work|last=Grimes|first=William|date=July 16, 2010|work=|newspaper=Boston.com|access-date=2016-09-05|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=EleanorMorseObitMiHerald&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/17/1734517/helped-found-dali-museum.html|title=Eleanor R.

==Occupational life==
Reynolds Morse had many business,{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} writing and collecting interests in addition to the collection of [[Salvador Dalí]]’s paintings which he and Reese Morse built up and to running Injection Molders Supply Company. For instance, he published “Injection Molding News”; added to the rock collection of the Denver Natural History Museum where he was a trustee, and he collected [[George Elbert Burr]] manuscript materials which he donated to the [[Denver Public Library]].

Reynolds Morse also authored ''George Elbert Burr: Etcher of the American West'' and published an anthology of his own, which he called ''Some Fifty Unprofessional Poems'', as well as ''Gold Links Tailings'' in memory of his maternal grandfather. Reynolds Morse collected and wrote about the works of [[M. P. Shiel]]. Reynolds' ''[[The Works of M. P. Shiel]]'' was published in 1948; he later turned this work into a four-tome set and added ''The Quest for Redonda and The New King''. In 1989 Reynolds donated his Shiel collection to [[Olin Library]] at Rollins College.

The Morses' diligent collecting and their friendship with [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] and Salvador Dalí produced a valuable art collection that is now housed in the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. The Salvador Dalí Museum is said to be the world's most comprehensive collection of Dalí's works.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;Lubar, Robert S., ''Dalí: the Salvador Dalí Museum Collection'', Bullfinch Press, [[Little, Brown and Company]] Inc., [[Boston]], 2000, page ''v'' Dedication&lt;/ref&gt;

The year of their marriage the Morses began their long friendship with Dalí and on March 21, 1943 acquired their first Dalí work, ''[[Daddy Longlegs of the Evening - Hope!]]''; early in April 1943 they acquired ''[[The Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's "Angelus"]]''. Over time, becoming patrons of Dalí, the Morses acquired works by Dalí which they found both captivating and intriguing. Their absorption by the artist's work led Reynolds to author numerous studies of Dalí and his ''œuvre'' and Eleanor to translate from [[French language|French]] to [[English language|English]] numerous books about Dalí and his ''œuvre''. In 1969, the Morses purchased ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'', before it was completed.

From 1971 to 1980, the Morses' considerable Dalí collection was on show in [[Beachwood, Ohio]] at the Salvador Dalí Museum, which was established there in a wing of their business premises. During that time the collection grew and required larger accommodation.

The Morses began the search for a new, permanent home for their collection. After seeing an article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', "U.S. Art World Dillydallies over Dalí", St. Petersburg attorney James W. Martin persuaded local leaders to approach the Morses to choose St. Petersburg. With the financial support of the City of St. Petersburg and the [[State of Florida]], the collection was housed in the Salvador Dalí Museum, formerly a warehouse on the waterfront, which opened in March 1982. A new, larger and more storm-secure museum near the current one, opened in 1-11-11 (at 11:11 am). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sharing their knowledge and understanding of [[Salvador Dalí]] and his art has been a lifelong mission for this dedicated couple."&lt;ref name="RL" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
The Morses married in 1943. They had one son, Brad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Reynolds Morse died on August 15, 2000 in [[Seminole, Florida]] after a long illness. He was 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/21/local/me-7933|title=A.

Reese Morse died on July 1, 2010 in St. Petersburg, Florida of natural causes. She was 97.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/07/eleanor_reese_morse_dies_cleve.html|title=Eleanor Reese Morse dies, Cleveland native who collected Dali artwork|last=Navratil|first=Liz|date=July 2, 2010|website=Cleveland.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Riley Freeman''' is a character from the [[print syndication|syndicated]] [[comic strip]] [[The Boondocks (comic strip)|''The Boondocks'']] written by [[Aaron McGruder]] and its [[The Boondocks (TV series)|TV series]] adaptation.&lt;ref name=strip&gt;{{cite news|title= Strip Tease|work= [[The Guardian|Guardian]]|date=December 22, 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/dec/22/art.usa|accessdate=July 18, 2010 | location=London | first=Gary | last=Younge}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often refers to himself as "'''Riley Escobar'''," and in season two of the TV series, he also refers to himself as "'''Young Reezy'''." He is [[Huey Freeman|Huey's]] younger brother who aspires to be like the rap artists and the gangsters that he admires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Boondocks: Is Riley Oprah's Greatest Enemy?|work= [[IGN]] |date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/108/1087661p1.html |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riley, who grew up on the south Side of [[Chicago]], was moved along with his brother to the peaceful,  white suburb of Woodcrest in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] by their [[Robert Jebediah Freeman|granddad]]. Riley is eight. In some episodes, Riley and Huey would have a single storyline and in others, the two would each have their own in a single episode. Riley, like Huey, is voiced by [[Regina King]]. It is strongly suggested that Huey and Riley's birth parents are deceased.

== Personality ==
Riley Freeman is an impressionable third grader who embraces the stereotypical "gangsta" lifestyle and lives his life like his idol rappers.&lt;ref name=strip/&gt;  Influenced by rap music and television, he frequently uses poor grammar, and tends to defend his idols even when his imitations go against common sense and righteousness.  One example is his support of [[R. Kelly]] in "[[The Trial of R. Kelly]]": despite overwhelming evidence proving  R Kelly's guilt, Riley believes he should not have to miss out on his next album. This is further shown in "[[The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2]]" where he dresses in effeminate clothing  because Gangstalicious created the style. In order to be like his idols, he collects [[airsoft]] weapons and tags houses, as demonstrated in "[[The Garden Party (The Boondocks)|The Garden Party]]" and "[[Riley Wuz Here]]". He is a fan of the movie ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' in that he occasionally quotes lines from or alludes to the movie, and he has a white suit similar to the one worn by [[Tony Montana]].

Riley seems to have a fair amount of criminal aptitude, as is demonstrated when he helped coordinate the kidnapping of [[Oprah Winfrey]], and further demonstrated by his criticisms of [[Ed Wuncler III and Gin Rummy]] for their lack of criminal know-how ("[[Let's Nab Oprah]]").  Despite his pretensions to the contrary, Riley is not simpleminded: he can in fact be very resourceful and pragmatic, and "beats" Tom, a district attorney, in an argument over R. Kelly's confinement and trial. Perhaps due to idolizing the [[gangsta rap]] lifestyle he seems to have a level of [[street smarts]] possibly as great as his brother, often able to manipulate situations through lying and [[reverse psychology]], which he refers to as getting into someone's "mental mind". Despite his crude thuggish lifestyle on rare occasions he has displayed acts of compassion (giving $100 to a panhandler he previously ignored and spat at).

Riley is quite brash and abrasive and often gets into undesirable situations without considering the consequences. He is rebellious and does not listen to anyone, especially Huey and Robert. He is brutally honest to the point of being very rude.

Despite the fact that Huey is forced to act as the voice of reason towards Riley's antics, usually without any success, Riley himself does become the voice of reason for his own friends, such as Thugnificent or Ed and Rummy.

When forced to fight, he resorts to a crude and thuggish form of attack, in contrast to his brother's carefully calculated attacks. His method is simply to continue attacking, usually with concealed BB guns, and random objects, such as vases, or lamps. Riley sometimes overestimates his own crude combat abilities, such as when he tried to fight his brother in "Let's Nab Oprah". His thuggish fighting style, both with weapons and hand-to-hand, failed several times against the precision of Huey's martial arts ability. His street-fighting style has improved to a certain degree in season 3. He does seem to have some talent with airsoft guns, as he fought Huey to a tie in season two. He has a strong amount of endurance and determination and given his previous beatings by his grandfather seems to have a high threshold for pain.

Riley has, in spite of himself, shown a great degree of intelligence from time to time. It has been shown he has a great understanding of the Media world and music industry. This was shown when he tried to advise Thugnificent against starting a rap war with a much younger aspiring rap star Sgt. Gudder, knowing it would only cause unnecessary problems.

== Relationships ==
; Huey Freeman
[[Huey Freeman|Huey]] and Riley tend to have a regular brotherly relationship despite their contradictory personalities. Due to the blunders Riley makes, Huey inevitably tries to teach him the error of his ways, but often to no avail. When their granddad is not around, Huey usually will not hesitate to set Riley straight himself. In "...Or Die Trying", Riley does not have any problem at abandoning his brother to his fate, but in other episodes he seems to trust him. Despite all this, Riley often insults his brother with the repeated phrase "Nigga, you gay," usually after receiving a hug (although he just distanced himself from Huey while speaking those words in the episode "...Or Die Trying"). In the Season 3 finale however, Riley offers Huey a hug near the end without insulting him but admiring Huey when they saw him on the television instead.

; Robert Freeman 
Robert Freeman is Riley's paternal [[grandfather]]. Riley constantly disrespects Robert and Robert mainly resorts to physical punishment to keep Riley in line, but Riley seems accustomed to this kind of disciplinary action to the point where it does not influence or change his actions in any significant way. He seems to not understand his grandpa's rules and gets whipped with his belt when he makes a bad choice. They are shown to be close at times and agree on things in season two. In season three, the two are seen to have "father and son" moments, such as when they go out to try the new fried chicken in "The Fried Chicken Flu". They also attempt to go to the inauguration of Barack Obama in "It's a Black President Huey Freeman"

; Ed Wuncler III and Gin Rummy
Riley hangs out with them and refers to them as his friends. They're the closest thing to a gang that exists in Woodcrest. They have a great variety of real firearms and are free to commit any crime they wish since Ed's grandfather essentially owns the suburb. Riley sometimes accompanies them on their various misdeeds, and is not afraid to point out when their crimes are poorly-planned, or are only successful because of Ed's grandfather's status. However, Rummy dismisses Riley's reasoning and says they get away with crimes because he (Rummy) is a criminal mastermind. However, they tend to use him for their own personal gain, such as stealing his Granddad's car with knowledge that Riley will not reveal they did it, then when it was eventually returned, they stole his new bike, fitted with rims riding as they shouted: "Thank you for not snitching!...You stupid motherfucker!" Riley also contacts Ed when he needs additional muscle, such as when he tries to get his Lethal Interjection chain back from Butch Magnus or when he and Huey need to seek out the Xbox Killer.

; Dubois Family
Riley likes to make fun of the Dubois family – especially Tom. He mocks Tom's unmanliness, breaks Jazmine's beliefs, and makes fun of Sarah's cooking. He outwits Tom, an attorney, in an argument about R. Kelly's trial and makes fun of Tom's fear of being anally [[raped in prison]]. He also mocks Sarah's cooking by comparing her peach cobbler to vomit with peas in it.

; Cindy McPhearson
[[File:Cindy McPhearson in Boondocks episode The Fundraiser.jpg|right|thumb|Cindy threatens would-be competitors to Riley's "Fun-Raiser" in "The Fundraiser"]]
Cindy could be considered the white female counterpart of Riley and is initially an antagonist to Riley as seen in the season two episode Ballin'. Cindy and Riley were initially rivals on different basketball teams in the local league, but in The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2, Granddad invites her over to play with him, signifying a small amount of friendship. In the Season 3 episode The Fundraiser, Cindy became a business partner of Riley's and helped him, Jazmine, and Phil, a seldom used stereotypical ignorant kid, sell large amounts of chocolate bars in order to make money. She becomes the last remaining partner of Riley, being the only one not to bail out of the organization. Her appearance in the TV series is similar to that of Cammy from the Street Fighter series.

; Lamilton Taeshawn
Due to their gangsta-like behavior depicted in the episode, Smokin' with Cigarettes, Riley is initially shown to be friends with Lamilton Taeshawn, as they enjoy hanging out with each other and doing bad things, such as causing a car-pile up, going on a joyride on Lamilton's grandmother's car that he stole, and smoking with cigarettes. However, Lamiltion shows more of his sociopathic behavior when he enjoys movie scenes of people being murdered, as well as murdering a dog while trespassing into his owner's property, and even assaulted his grandmother when she refused to buy him chicken. These events start to disturb Riley greatly, and ever since then, Riley finds Lamilton to be so disturbing and sick in nature and refuses to hang out with him again, and Lamilton would often try to kill Riley in return, resulting the two kids to have a brawl in the school rooftop. Despite his enmity with Lamilton, Riley cannot bear to kill him as he tried his best to prevent Lamilton from falling off the school rooftop, though Lamilton did fall (thanks to his former psychologist Dr. Doomis forcing RIley to let him go), but survived.

; Thugnificent

Thugnificent(Otis Jenkins) is Riley's favorite rap artist and neighbor. What can best be described as a "Professional Buffoon", Thugnificent was leader of the group Lethal interjection Crew. He had taken a liking to Riley and allowed to join. (After irresponsibly having Riley perform several reckless and dangerous stunts.) Riley and Thugnificent remained friends even after the downfall of Thugnificent's career.

'''Robert Rowe Gilruth''' (October 8, 1913 – August 17, 2000) was an American aerospace engineer and an aviation/space pioneer who was the first director of [[NASA]]'s [[Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]], later renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/history/gilruth/gilruth_obit.html |title=Former Manned Spacecraft Center Director Dies |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked for the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] from 1937 to 1958 and its successor NASA, until his retirement in 1973. He was involved with early research into supersonic flight and rocket-powered aircraft, and then with the United States manned space program, including the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] programs.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gilruth was born October 8, 1913, in [[Nashwauk, Minnesota]], and moved to [[Duluth]] when he was nine years old. He graduated  in 1931 from [[Duluth Central High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duluthaviationinstitute.org/Godfather_to_the_Astronauts.htm |title=Robert Gilruth Inducted into the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame |website=Duluth Aviation Institute |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Gilruth was fascinated by aeronautics and spent time building model airplanes. He was inspired to pursue a career in the field after reading about NACA’s [[Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]] in Virginia.&lt;ref name="chaikin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chaikin |first=Andrew |title=Bob Gilruth, the Quiet Force Behind Apollo |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/quiet-force-behind-apollo-180957788/?webSyncID=c5e04de7-b1c9-64e3-4d19-8a824988ea62&amp;no-ist |accessdate=27 July 2016 |journal=[[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]] |issn=0886-2257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilruth received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1935, and received his [[Master of Science]] degree in 1936.  While there he was a member of the Professional Engineering Fraternity [[Theta Tau]], of which he was later inducted as a Hall of Fame Alumnus.

===Flight test career===

In January 1937 Gilruth was hired at NACA’s [[Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]], where he performed flight research. His research led to the NACA Report R755, ''Requirements for Satisfactory Flying Qualities of an Airplane'', published in 1941, in which he defined a set of requirements for the handling characteristics of an aircraft. Until this point, no set of guidelines for pilots and aircraft designers existed.&lt;ref name=chaikin /&gt;

Gilruth also pioneered the recording of data from instruments during flight test, to be later correlated with the pilot's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph12/ch4.htm |title=Monographs in Aerospace History: Flying Qualities |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would go on to become the standard operating procedure.

=== NASA career ===
Gilruth had been working on [[hypersonic]] missile rockets as the assistant director of the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division of NACA. He and his team pushed their superiors to pursue a program to launch satellites into space, but he was rebuffed by administrators. The dynamic quickly changed after the Soviets succeeded in launching Sputnik, and Gilruth became involved in the transition of NACA into NASA.
When NASA was created, Gilruth became head of the [[Space Task Group]], tasked with putting a man in space before the [[Soviet Union]].

When [[President John F. Kennedy]] announced that America would put a man on the Moon before the end of the decade in 1961, Gilruth was "aghast" and unsure that such a goal could be accomplished. He was integral to the creation of the [[Gemini program]], which he advocated as a means for NASA to learn more about operating in space before attempting a lunar landing.&lt;ref name=chaikin /&gt;

Soon the [[Apollo program]] was born, and Gilruth was made head of the NASA center which ran it, the new Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) (now the [[Johnson Space Center]]). Gilruth was inducted into the [[International Space Hall of Fame]] in 1969 and served as director of the MSC until his retirement in 1972.  He oversaw a total of 25 manned space flights, from [[Mercury-Redstone 3]] to [[Apollo 15]].

Gilruth died in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the age of 86.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/18/us/robert-gilruth-86-dies-was-crucial-player-at-nasa.html |title=Robert Gilruth, 86, Dies; Was Crucial Player at NASA |first=John Noble |last=Wilford |authorlink=John Noble Wilford |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Gilruth was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

'''Roy Anthony Cousins''' (born 1949 in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]])&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=David |title=Solid Foundation - An Oral History of Reggae |year= 2003 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=0-7475-6847-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Jamaican reggae [[singer]], [[record producer|producer]], and [[record label]] owner, known for being lead singer and co creator of [[The Royals (group)|The Royals]], his productions of artists such as [[Charlie Chaplin (singer)|Charlie Chaplin]], [[Prince Far I]], and [[Cornell Campbell]], and his record labels,Tamoki-Wambesi/Tamoki Wambesi Dove.

==Biography==
Cousins worked for the Jamaican Post Office for many years after he left school, and had formed his first vocal group in 1962, to attend the Junior Festival Competition.&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt; In 1965 he formed a vocal group, initially known as The Tempests, and later as The Royals. Frustrated with his dealings with record labels, he started his own  Uhuru label in 1971.&lt;ref name="westbury"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://194.154.164.100/~westbury@westburymusicltd.co.uk/4artisttrackdb/showarticle.php?id=129 |title=Roy Cousins Biography |accessdate=2007-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This soon folded, but he returned with the Tamoki label in 1972 and the Wambesi label in 1974.&lt;ref name="westbury" /&gt; He also began producing other artists, including [[Gregory Isaacs]]' "Way of Life" in 1974, which established the singer as a star.&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Larkin  |first=Colin |title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae |year= 1998 |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=0-7535-0242-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 1977, Cousins left his Post Office job to concentrate full-time on music, resulting in 1978's ''[[Pick Up the Pieces (album)|Pick Up The Pieces]]'' album, a collection of tracks from Royals 1970s singles, which is now considered one of the great reggae albums.&lt;ref name="R100"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrow  |first=Steve |author2=Dalton, Peter |title=Reggae: 100 Essential CDs - The Rough Guide |year=1999 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=1-85828-567-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success led to a contract with [[Ballistic Records]], licensed to [[United Artists]], with two further Royals albums following.&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt; Cousins-produced [[dub music|dub]] albums also appeared (''Freedom Fighters Dub'' and ''Liberated Dub''). 

In 1979, [[cataract]]s almost led to Cousins losing his sight, and after recovering, he began to concentrate on production, introducing the [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejay]] Charlie Chaplin with a series of LPs, and producing artists such as Cornell Campbell, [[Earl 16]], [[Naggo Morris]], and [[The Meditations]].&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt; Cousins produced Prince Far I's final album in 1983, ''Umkhonto We Sizwe'', the chanter being fatally shot before it was finished. This prompted Cousins to emigrate to [[Liverpool]], [[England]],&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt; where he set up a record shop, Cousins Cove, and continues to release records on his Tamoki-Wambesi and Dove labels, both from his back-catalogue, and new recordings of visiting Jamaican artists.&lt;ref name="westbury" /&gt;&lt;ref name="R100" /&gt; Another classic Cousins-produced track from this era is "Skanky Producer" which features the DJ Charlie Chaplin and Black Uhuru singers Don Carlos and Junior Reid.

'''Samuel "Sam" Wesley Hall''' (March 10, 1937 &amp;ndash; August 11, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[silver medal]]ist diver and member of the [[Ohio House of Representatives]]. He was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], where his father [[Dave Hall (mayor of Dayton, Ohio)|Dave]] was [[List of mayors of Dayton, Ohio|mayor]]. His brother was Ambassador [[Tony P. Hall]]. During his last years he resided in [[Florida]], working in real estate.

==Olympics 1960==
Sam Hall's extraordinary athletic career began at [[Kettering, Ohio|Kettering]]-[[Fairmont High School (Ohio)|Fairmont High School]]; he was a two-time letterwinner in track and field. During his senior season (1955), Sam established a school record in the pole vault (11-3). His record setting performance came at the Miami Valley League Championships, helping propel Fairmont to the MVL team title; the first in school history. While attending Fairmont, Sam also competed in springboard diving; a sport he pursued at the club level.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;
 
In the fall of 1955, Hall enrolled at the Ohio State University; while attending O.S.U, Sam lettered in four sports – gymnastics, soccer, track and diving. As a trackman, Hall competed in the pole vault and javelin; his success in those events led to a crossroads: should he pursue a berth on the US Olympic track and field team, or concentrate on diving. Ultimately, Sam chose diving; he was rewarded with international acclaim.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

During 1959-1960, Sam won two Big-Ten Conference championships, three NCAA championships, and three U.S. Amateur Athletic Union titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/swimming/2005/2005_m_swimming_champ_record.pdf |title=Swimming and Diving |accessdate=2007-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704223147/http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/swimming/2005/2005_m_swimming_champ_record.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-04 |publisher=ncaa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pinnacle of Sam Hall's diving career was his silver medal performance at both the 1959 Pan American Games and [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HALLSAM01 Sam Hall Olympic medals and stats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216145626/http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HALLSAM01 |date=2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1960 Olympics Hall served with the U.S. Air Force and competed in athletics for them, eventually retiring due to a knee injury.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

==Ohio politics==
In 1965, Hall served in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, William (December 17, 1986) "Sam Hall: Flag-waver or just an egomaniac?". ''The Lakeland Ledger'' (Lakeland, Florida), pp. 1A, 11A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iacsp.s2institute.com/instructor.php?instid=hall Sam Hall]. IACSP&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counterterrorist==
Hall later worked as an unpaid "volunteer counterterrorist," as Hall described himself,&lt;ref&gt;Smolowe, Jill (December 29, 1986) [http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963128-2,00.html Nicaragua an Ordeal Ends, Another Begins]. ''Time''.&lt;/ref&gt; going to [[Central America]] to fight on the side of [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] forces as an advisor to the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Contras]]. He reentered the national spotlight again in late 1986 when he was captured by [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] forces, which announced the capture of a "spy". Hall was freed after less than two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6113DF932A35751C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=HEADLINERS; Out of Nicaragua | date=February 1, 1987 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall died in Florida on August 11, 2014, aged 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whio.com/news/news/local/dayton-native-olympian-sam-hall-has-died/ng2S8/ |title=Dayton native, Olympian Sam Hall has died |date=2014-08-13|author=Stewart, Chris |publisher=WHIO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814021900/http://www.whio.com/news/news/local/dayton-native-olympian-sam-hall-has-died/ng2S8/ |archivedate=2014-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11528">The '''Savanna Pastoral Neolithic''' or SPN (formerly known as the '''Stone Bowl Culture''') is a collection of ancient societies that appeared in the [[East African Rift|Rift Valley]] of [[East Africa]] and surrounding areas during a time period known as the [[Pastoral Neolithic]]. Through archaeology, historical linguistics and archaeogenetics, they conventionally have been identified with the area's first [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking settlers. Archaeological dating of livestock bones and burial cairns has also established the cultural complex as the earliest center of [[pastoralism]] (cattle, goats and sheep) and stone construction in the region.

The makers of the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture are believed to have arrived in the Rift Valley sometime during the Pastoral Neolithic period (c. 3,000 BCE-700 CE). Through a series of migrations from [[Horn of Africa]], these early [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]-speaking pastoralists brought [[cattle]] and caprines southward from the [[Sudan]] and/or [[Ethiopia]] into northern [[Kenya]], probably using [[donkey]]s for transportation.&lt;ref name="Crowther"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alison Crowther, Mary E. Prendergast, Dorian Q. Fuller, Nicole Boivin|title=Subsistence mosaics, forager-farmer interactions, and the transition to food production in eastern Africa|journal=Quaternary International|date=2017|volume=xxx|page=5|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618216302890|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material, they first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between 5,200 and 3,300 ybp, a phase referred to as the ''Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic''. They subsequently spread to the highlands of Kenya and [[Tanzania]] around 3,300 ybp, which is consequently known as the ''Highland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic'' phase.&lt;ref name="Ambrose220"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ambrose|first1=Stanley H.|title=From Hunters to Farmers: The Causes and Consequences of Food Production in Africa - "The Introduction of Pastoral Adaptations to the Highlands of East Africa"|date=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520045742|pages=220|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dftPHu1o2s8C|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehret140"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christopher Ehret, Merrick Posnansky (ed.)|title=The Archaeological and Linguistic Reconstruction of African History|date=1982|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520045939|page=140|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=kJMFMpoHuVgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in the area indicate that the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic peoples were primarily cattle pastoralists.&lt;ref name="Ambrose220"/&gt; They milked this livestock, and also possessed [[goat]]s,  [[sheep]], and donkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grillo|first=Katherine|last2=Prendergast|first2=Mary et al.|date=2018|title=Pastoral Neolithic settlement at Luxmanda, Tanzania|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2018.1431476?src=recsys|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|volume=43|pages=102-120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically buried their deceased in [[cairn]]s.

[[Sonia Mary Cole]] (1954) indicates that certain pestles and grindstones that she excavated from ochreous levels were stained with [[ochre]], while others from the carbonized layers were not. She consequently suggests that the latter were instead used for grinding [[grain]].&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Sonia Mary|title=The Prehistory of East Africa|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|date=1964|page=237|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued that there is no direct archaeological evidence that SPN peoples cultivated grains or other plant domesticates.&lt;ref name="pastoralism consequences"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gifford-Gonzalez, Diane|editor1-last=Stahl|editor1-first=Ann|title=African Archaeology: A Critical Introduction|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=1-4051-0156-3|pages=187–224|chapter=Pastoralism and Its Consequences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although detailed information on this segment of African [[prehistory]] is not abundant, data so far available reveal a succession of cultural transformations within the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic. The transformations seem to have been fostered by both environmental change and population movements.&lt;ref&gt;Bower, John. The Pastoral Neolithic of East Africa, Journal of World Prehistory, Vol, 5, No.1, 1991 p. 49 [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00974732#page-1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Among these changes was the apparent abandonment of the stone bowls at around 1,300 years before present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ambrose|first1=Stanley H.|title=From Hunters to Farmers: The Causes and Consequences of Food Production in Africa - "The Introduction of Pastoral Adaptations to the Highlands of East Africa"|date=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520045742|pages=234 &amp; 223|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dftPHu1o2s8C|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient DNA]] analysis of a Savanna Pastoral Neolithic bone excavated at the [[Luxmanda]] site in Tanzania found that the specimen carried a large proportion of ancestry related to the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] culture of the [[Levant]], similar to that borne by modern [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations inhabiting the [[Horn of Africa]]. This suggests that the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture bearers may have been [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] speakers.&lt;ref name="Skoglund"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skoglund|first=Pontus|last2=Thompson|first2=Jessica C.|last3=Prendergast|first3=Mary E.|last4=Mittnik|first4=Alissa|last5=Sirak|first5=Kendra|last6=Hajdinjak|first6=Mateja|last7=Salie|first7=Tasneem|last8=Rohland|first8=Nadin|last9=Mallick|first9=Swapan|date=2017-09-21|title=Reconstructing Prehistoric African Population Structure|url=http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(17)31008-5|journal=Cell|language=English|volume=171|issue=1|pages=59–71.e21|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.08.049|issn=0092-8674|pmid=28938123|pmc=5679310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Given the similarity of their material culture and funerary customs with those of Cushitic-speaking populations that inhabited [[Ethiopia]] to the north, SPN peoples are believed to have spoken languages from the Cushitic branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]].&lt;ref name="Edwards54"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=Eh7gNrJKASkC|title=Ngecha: A Kenyan Village in a Time of Rapid Social Change|last1=Carolyn P. Edwards, Beatrice Blyth Whiting (ed.)|date=2004|publisher=University of Nebraska|isbn=0803248091|page=54|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christopher Ehret]], linguistic research suggests that these Savanna Pastoral Neolithic populations were the first Afroasiatic speakers to settle in the Central Rift Valley and surrounding areas. The region was at the time of their arrival inhabited by [[Khoisan]] hunter-gatherers who spoke [[Khoisan languages]] and practiced an [[Eburran industry|Eburran]] blade industry.&lt;ref name="Ehret140"/&gt; Early [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] settlers, who are thought to have spoken [[Southern Nilotic languages]] and been responsible for the pastoralist [[Elmenteitan]] culture, are also believed to have lived in the Rift Valley during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christopher Ehret, Merrick Posnansky (ed.)|title=The Archaeological and Linguistic Reconstruction of African History|date=1982|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520045939|page=141|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=kJMFMpoHuVgC&amp;q=141|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic chronology of the historic population movements into the Central Rift Valley as well as the present and past distribution of Afro-Asiatic speakers further suggests that SPN peoples likely spoke [[South Cushitic languages]].&lt;ref name="Ambrose220"/&gt; Ehret (1998) proposes that among these idioms were the now extinct Tale and Bisha languages, which were identified on the basis of [[loanword]]s.&lt;ref name="Mous"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roland Kießling, Maarten Mous &amp; Derek Nurse|title=The Tanzanian Rift Valley area|url=https://www.academia.edu/825370/The_Tanzanian_Rift_Valley_area|publisher=Maarten Mous|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early Cushitic speakers in the region largely disappeared following the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu Expansion]].&lt;ref name="Crowther"/&gt;

==Distribution==
The Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture was initially distributed at elevations below 1,100 m in lowland northern Kenya (Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic). Its range later extended to the highlands between central Kenya and northern [[Tanzania]], at elevations above 1,500 m (Highland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic). The preferred settlement location for SPN sites was open wooded grassland on well-drained, gentle slopes of between 1,500 m to 2,050 m.&lt;ref name="Ambrose220"/&gt;

==Material culture==
The Savanna Pastoral Neolithic makers' characteristic stone bowls have been recovered from both their occupation sites and burial cairns.&lt;ref name="Ambrose220"/&gt;

Their material culture was typified by several pottery styles, up to three of which may be found at a single site. Nderit pottery (previously known as Gumban A) was produced by early SPN herders in the Turkana Basin. The most diagnostic SPN pottery farther south is [[Narosura]] pottery, and some scholars group Akira (TIP), Maringishu (trellis motif), and herringbone-motif wares in with the SPN as well.&lt;ref name="Ambrose220"/&gt;

In terms of funerary tradition, the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic peoples erected stone cairns in open spaces, rock shelters, crevices or against walls. The deceased were buried with a number of items, including stone bowls, pestle rubbers and ochre palettes. Large [[obsidian]] blades and other tools were also occasionally among the mortuary objects. [[Incisor]] removal was not a common feature of this population.&lt;ref name="Ambrose220"/&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Sleez is an alien from the planet of [[Apokolips]], born in the Sewers. There he originally serves as the companion of young Prince Uxas ([[Darkseid]]) the future ruler of Apokolips. Uxas banishes Sleez to Earth after he grew tired of his depravities, first using the Omega Effect, and the creature took up residence in the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. There he seeks out a living in the sewers of [[Suicide Slum]]. He runs afoul of [[Superman]] on several occasions. This includes a failed attempt to produce a [[pornographic film]] starring a psionically dominated Superman and [[Big Barda]], he hoped to use the money he made from this to create an army to fight Darkseid.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Action Comics]]'' #593&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleez kidnaps children in an amusement park serving as a front for [[Intergang]] but later seemingly dies in an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #475&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007 series ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'', Sleez is revealed to have survived and is active in Suicide Slum once again. He is killed by an unknown entity (later revealed to be [[Infinity-Man]]) while attempting to tell [[Jimmy Olsen]] the secret to killing Darkseid.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #46&lt;/ref&gt;
===DC Rebirth===

==Powers and abilities==

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Enter the Outsiders", '''Slug''' (voiced by [[Alexander Polinsky]]) is based on Sleez. Here, he is presented as the leader of an underground (literally, within a sewer) ring of teenagers whom he has convinced that they are outsiders to society. He comes into conflict with [[Batman]] and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] when he manipulates teen versions of [[Black Lightning]], [[Metamorpho]], and [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] into venting their frustrations on popular social outlets by using their superpowers to destroy a mall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3047">'''Joseph Vernon Fougère''' (May 20, 1943 – June 18, 2013) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[prelate]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He was the 12th [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlottetown|Bishop of Charlottetown]].

Born in [[Petit-de-Grat, Nova Scotia|Petit-de-Grat]], [[Nova Scotia]], Fougère attended [[Saint Francis Xavier University]] for his undergraduate education and completed his theological studies at the [[Grand Séminaire de Montréal]] where he was awarded a [[Doctor of Divinity]]. He was ordained a priest for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Antigonish|Diocese of Antigonish]] in 1969. Fougère served seven years with the Diocesan Mission in [[Honduras]] while still in the priesthood in Nova Scotia.

While in [[Latin America]], Fougère served on the Council of Priests for the [[Archdiocese of Tegucigalpa]] and carried out extensive work forming ''Delegados de la Palabra'' (Ministers of the Word). Following further education at the Jesuit Theological Union at the [[University of California]], Fougère returned to Nova Scotia where he served in a number of parishes before being appointed [[Vicar General]] and Director of Pastoral Services for the Diocese of Antigonish in 1988. Fougère also served as Chair of the Council of Priests for the Diocese of Antigonish and served on the [[Board of Governors]] for Saint Francis Xavier University.

On December 11, 1991, [[Pope John Paul II]] appointed Father Fougère the twelfth Bishop of Charlottetown. Fougère was [[consecrated]] and installed as Bishop of Charlottetown at [[St. Dunstan's Basilica]] on March 19, 1992.  As Bishop of Charlottetown, Fougère served as a member of the National Council of the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace and was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Catholic Mission in Canada for the year 2000.

Bishop Fougère resigned his post on July 11, 2009 citing health reasons, becoming Bishop Emeritus. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] appointed Bishop [[Richard John Grecco]] as his replacement.

'''Yitzhak Gruenbaum''' ({{lang-pl|Izaak Grünbaum}}, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]]: יצחק גרינבוים, born 1879 died 1970) was a noted leader of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement among [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewry]] in the [[interwar period]] and of the [[Yishuv]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Gruenbaum was the first [[Interior Minister of Israel|Interior Minister]] of the [[State of Israel]].

==Biography==
Yitzhak ("Itche") Gruenbaum was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Vistula Land|Poland]]. While a student of [[jurisprudence]], he began activities on behalf of the Zionist movement and engaged in [[journalism]]. He served as editor of several periodicals widely circulated among Polish Jewry, including the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''[[Ha-Tsefirah|Ha-Zefirah]]'' and the Hebrew weekly ''Ha-Olam.'' Under his editorship, the [[Yiddish]] daily, ''Haynt,'' took on a pro-Zionist slant.

In Poland, Gruenbaum headed the Radical Zionist faction, initially known in Poland as ''Al Hamishmar''.&lt;ref name="Medoff"&gt;{{cite book |editors=edited by Rafael Medoff, Chaim I. Waxman |year=2000 |title=Historical Dictionary of Zionism |location= |publisher=Routledge |pages=66–67, 163 |isbn=978-1-57958-286-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYW0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 |quote=Gruenbaum was the leader of the Radical Zionists, known in Poland as Al Hamishmar |accessdate=20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he was elected to the [[Sejm]] (Polish parliament), where, together with [[Apolinary Hartglas]], he organized a "Jewish bloc" that united most of the Jewish parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/life/books/1.5276939 Kapo - or Hero? [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the moving force in forming a collaboration with other minority parties represented in the Sejm, including [[German people|Germans]], [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]], and others, to form a [[Bloc of National Minorities]] alliance in 1922, that acted to represent the rights of minority populations in Poland. His efforts brought about an increase of Jewish representation in the Sejm, which was accompanied by a rise of the political Zionism. Gruenbaum was known for his courageous and militant stance against his opponents and on behalf of minorities' interests, while equally critical of the [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-orthodox]] party ''[[Agudat Israel]]'' and Jewish [[lobbying]].

After moving to Paris in 1932, Gruenbaum [[aliyah|immigrated to]] [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1933 after being elected to the [[Jewish Agency]] Executive (the Board of Directors), during the Eighteenth Congress&lt;ref name="Medoff"/&gt; of the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]].

During [[the Holocaust]], he served on the "Committee of Four" chosen at the outbreak of [[World War II]] to maintain contact with Polish Jewry and aid in their rescue. In 1942, when word reached the [[Yishuv]] of the mass extermination by the German occupying forces taking place in Eastern Europe, Gruenbaum was chosen to head a 12-member Rescue Committee comprising representatives of the various parties. Due to circumstances prevailing at the time, their rescue efforts failed to accomplish much.

At the war's end, he endured a personal crisis involving his son, [[Eliezer Gruenbaum]]. The latter, a Holocaust survivor, was accused in [[Paris]] by two other Jewish Holocaust survivors of having served as a ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]]'' and acting with cruelty towards Jewish prisoners. During his son's detention and trial, Gruenbaum remained at his side. Yitzhak helped his son move to Palestine after the war, but there his son has been subject to "attacks by right-wing and religious groups eager, among other things, to discredit his father." The matter was eventually closed; not long afterwards, Eliezer Gruenbaum fell in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glasner-Heled|first=Galia|last2=Bar-On|first2=Dan|date=2009|title=Displaced: The Memoir of Eliezer Gruenbaum, Kapo at Birkenau—Translation and Commentary|jstor=42944445|journal=Shofar|volume=27|issue=2|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polonsky|first=Antony|date=2016-04-01|title=Tuvia Friling.A Jewish Kapo in Auschwitz: History, Memory, and the Politics of Survival.|url=https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/121/2/672/2582215|journal=The American Historical Review|language=en|volume=121|issue=2|pages=672–673|doi=10.1093/ahr/121.2.672|issn=0002-8762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Gruenbaum was among the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] directors arrested by the British and interned in a detention camp at [[Latrun]].

He spent his later years on [[Kibbutz]] [[Gan Shmuel]], and died in 1970.

==Political career==
Gruenbaum was among a group of 13 leaders forming the [[provisional government of Israel|provisional government]] of the emerging State, and, as a member of [[Provisional State Council]] (Moetzet HaAm), signed its [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|declaration of independence]]. Between 1948 and 1949 he served as a member of the Provisional State Council and was the first [[Interior Minister of Israel|Minister of the Interior]] in that formative period. His initial stance was with the [[General Zionists]], but as time went on moved leftward. He became an adherent of the [[Mapam]] [[socialist]]-[[Zionist]] party, and was known as a declared secularist. Gruenbaum headed an independent list in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|elections for the first Knesset]], but failed to obtain the minimum number of votes to secure a seat.

He was later a candidate for [[President of Israel|President]] in the [[Israeli presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]] alongside [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] of [[Mapai]], [[Peretz Bernstein]] of the [[General Zionists]] and [[Mordechai Nurock]] of [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrachi]]. However, he was  beaten by Ben-Zvi.

==Journalism and literary career==
He served as editor of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''[[Ha-Tsefirah|Ha-Zefirah]]'', the Hebrew weekly ''Ha-Olam'' and the [[Yiddish]] daily, ''Haynt.''
 
Gruenbaum was the editor of the Encyclopedia of Diaspora Communities, ''The Zionist Movement and its Development'' and many other books.
==Commemoration==
[[Alonei Yitzhak]], an Israeli [[youth village]] near [[Binyamina]] in northern Israel, is named for him.

==Quotes==
''One cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Europe.''&lt;ref&gt;The Middle East, Abstracts and Index, page 407&lt;/ref&gt;

''I think it is necessary to state here – Zionism is above everything. I will not demand that the Jewish Agency allocate a sum of 300,000 or 100,000 pounds sterling to help European Jewry. And I think that whoever demands such things is performing an anti-Zionist act.''&lt;ref&gt;Tom Segev, The Seventh Million&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zhumabay Shayakhmetovich Shayakhmetov''', ({{lang-ru|Жумабай Шаяхметов}}), (30 August 1902 – 17 October 1966) was a [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Communist]] [[political figure]].  From 1946 through 1954, he was First Secretary of the [[Communist Party]] of the [[Kazakh SSR]]. 

He was born to a poor peasant family in a small village in Borisov County ([[okrug]]), which in 1924 was incorporated as one of the nine rural areas in the [[Sherbakulsky District]] of the [[Omsk Oblast]].  In 1915, he went to the two-year Kazakh-Russian school in what is now the Poltava Raion, graduating in 1917. He attended the Narimanov Institute in [[Moscow]], but did not complete his first year.  In 1919, he got a job as a school teacher in a rural school, but the school closed due to the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and he returned to his home.

From 1919 to 1926, Shayakhmetov was the secretary of the Turkoman Rural District executive committee of the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]]. By 1923, he was already a first-rate agent, solving crimes in the [[Cherlaksky District|Cherlaksky District, Omsk Oblast]]. From 1926 to 1928, Shayakhmetov taught office management (official documentation) as the political instructor in a rural organization called "Koschi" in the [[Petropavl]] Okrug. From 1928 to 1938, he worked for the [[NKVD]], first as Deputy Department Chief for the [[North Kazakhstan Province|North Kazakhstan Oblast]], then as the Deputy Department Chief for the [[Almaty Province|Alma Ata Oblast]].

From 1938 to 1946, Shayakhmetov worked his way up from Third Secretary to First Secretary of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party]] of the Kazakh SSR. He was the first ethnic Kazakh to hold that post.&lt;ref&gt;Zardykhan, Zharmukhamed (2004) "Russians in Kazakhstan and demographic change: imperial legacy and the Kazakh way of nation building" ''Asian Ethnicity'' 5(1): pp. 61–79, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1954, Shayakhmetov was replaced as First Secretary by [[Panteleimon Ponomarenko|Panteleimon Kondratyevich Ponomarenko]], a Russian, as part of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev's]] post-Stalin reorganization. For about a year, well into 1955, he was the First Secretary of the [[South Kazakhstan Province|South Kazakhstan provincial]] committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, before he was removed from that post as well.

He served as [[Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities]] (1950–1954).
