'''"Angel"''' was the [[Malta|Maltese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Chiara Siracusa|Chiara]].

In contrast to the up-tempo styles dominating the Contest, the song is a solo love ballad. Chiara sings to her lover that, no matter what, she will be "your angel". The chorus culminates with the line "I'm always here for you".

In keeping with the lyrical simplicity of the song, Chiara performed solo onstage with a simple musical score backing her.

As Malta had finished the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Contest]] in the top 12, the song was pre-qualified for the final. Here, it was performed third, following the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Javine Hylton|Javine]] with "[[Touch My Fire]]" and preceding [[Romania]]'s [[Luminiţa Anghel]] &amp; [[Sistem]] with "[[Let Me Try (Luminiţa Anghel and Sistem song)|Let Me Try]]". At the close of voting, it had received 192 points placing 2nd in a field of 24 and pre-qualifying Malta for the final at the next Contest. In the voting, Malta received only one 12-point set, from Russia, a low number for a Eurovision runner-up.

The result was also Malta's best in Contest history, equalling [[Ira Losco]]'s second place with "[[7th Wonder]]" but exceeding that song's score of 164 points (and indeed Chiara's own score of 165 with "[[The One That I Love]]"). "Angel" managed to peak at #95 on the German Singles Chart Top 100.

The song appeared as a "favourite" on the CD and DVD sets produced to commemorate the [[Congratulations (Eurovision)|Congratulations]] special in late 2005.

It was succeeded as [[Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest|Maltese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 Contest]] by [[Fabrizio Faniello]] with "[[I Do (Fabrizio Faniello song)|I Do]]".

==Covers==
The song has gained popularity in many countries. The South African singer [[Tobi Jooste]] recorded the song as "Engel"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gNL73q6SwE] in [[Afrikaans language]] on his album ''Onthou Jy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogae.esckaz.com/south_africa_covers.htm OGAE Rest of the World presents South African Eurovision Covers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Avanton Gold Cone''''' or '''''Avanton Cone''''' ({{lang-fr|Cône d'Or d'Avanton}} or {{lang-fr|Cône d'Avanton}}) is a late [[Bronze Age]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]], belonging to the group of [[Golden hats]], only four of which are known so far. 

The Avanton Cone was the second such object to be discovered (after the [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt]]). It was found in 1844 in a field near the village of [[Avanton]], about 12 km north of [[Poitiers]], [[France]]. The object was damaged; comparison with other finds suggests that a part (the brim) is missing. The remaining part of the Avanton cone is 55 cm long and weighs 285 g. Originally dated to the Middle Bronze and suggested to be a [[phallic symbol|fertility symbol]], it now appears to be of later date and more complex function (see [[Golden hats]]).

The Avanton Cone is on display in the [[Musée d'Archéologie Nationale]] at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], near [[Paris]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">'''BBC Local Video''' (originally Local TV) was a pilot project operating in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region serving  [[Birmingham]], the [[Black Country]], [[Coventry]] &amp; [[Warwickshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Shropshire]] and [[Hereford]] &amp; [[Worcester]], [[England]].

Teams of video [[journalist]]s at six centres (sharing local radio offices) began broadcasts on digital [[satellite television]] (accessed via the [[BBC Red Button]] from any [[BBC]] channel on page 1700) and via the BBC's local websites on 1 December 2005. The service ran as a 9-month trial until the Summer of 2006.

The [[BBC Trust]] and regulator [[Ofcom]] reviewed the trial and undertook research into potential effects the service may have on competition, in particular the impact on newspaper sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7471154.stm BBC video service put to the test] BBC News: 24 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090204054340/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/features/bbcmia BBC Local Video services would have negative market impact] Ofcom: 21 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism came from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and a section of the local newspaper industry as an unfair encroachment on established commercial interests in local media.

The Trust ruled in November 2008 that the service would not be value for money and called instead for more improvements to be made to the existing  programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7741244.stm BBC local video scheme rejected] BBC News: 21 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/speeches/ml_statement.html Press conference - opening statement by Sir Michael Lyons, Chairman of the BBC Trust] BBC Trust: 21 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beriev Be-112''' is a proposed [[amphibian aircraft]] with two propeller engines, projected to carry 27 passengers. The [[Beriev]] firm currently lacks a production amphibian aircraft in this size.

Intended purposes of the Be-112 include passenger and cargo carriage, ambulance missions, surveillance, and search-and-rescue missions. Beriev also explored a version of the Be-112 with wing-mounted turboprop engines&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Yefim; Komissarov, Sergey (2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2537">'''Caroline Overdrive''' was a programming strand which ran on [[Radio Caroline]] in 1986&amp;ndash;1987.

==Background==

After Caroline's return to the air in 1983 from the ''MV [[Ross Revenge]]'', the station played an eclectic mixture of chart hits, album tracks and golden oldies, but by 1985 the station faced competition from the aggressively commercial [[Laser 558]]. Caroline began transmitting a second service on 576&amp;nbsp;kHz, close to Laser's frequency, broadcasting a more conventional singles-oriented format, while its main frequency of 963&amp;nbsp;kHz carried the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] station [[Radio Monique]] by day and sponsored religious programming in the evening under the name "Viewpoint 963". After Laser closed in November 1985 Caroline took over the 558&amp;nbsp;kHz slot.

During 1985 the 963&amp;nbsp;kHz transmitter had been used for some nighttime music shows after the end of Viewpoint, most notably Jamming 963, a short run of [[reggae]] programmes.

==Overdrive==

On January 1, 1986 DJ Tom Anderson, who had been heavily involved with the station's 1983 relaunch, began Caroline Overdrive on the 963&amp;nbsp;kHz transmitter after the end of Viewpoint. Overdrive carried a wide selection of "alternative" music, the only apparent rule being that it should provide an alternative to the mainstream programming on 558. Presentation was uncluttered, with a minimum of DJ chatter and few [[jingle]]s. One critic described the service as being similar to a [[John Peel]] show except that it ran all night.

Increases in the number of religious programmes meant that as the year progressed the start of Overdrive was pushed back from 8 p.m. to 9 and later 9:30.

Towards the end of 1986 a combination of transmitter maintenance and lack of direct involvement by Anderson meant that Overdrive was frequently off the air. The last Overdrive programme was broadcast in February 1987 under the title "Testing 963", [[parody]]ing the newly relaunched Laser's test broadcasts. After this no further alternative programming was heard on 963.

[[File:Cscc1.jpg|thumb|The Civil Society Coalition on Climate Change]]
The '''Civil Society Coalition on Climate Change (or CSCCC)''' is an entity that maintains a website and describes itself as a global group of [[non-profit organization]]s with a mission of "seek[ing] to educate the public about the science and economics of [[climate change]] in an impartial manner." The Coalition identifies its membership as including 60 independent nonprofit organisations from 40 countries "who share a commitment to improving public understanding about a range of public policy issues."&lt;ref&gt;http://csccc.info/about/&lt;/ref&gt; It calls itself "a free-market alternative to mainstream environmentalism."&lt;ref&gt;http://csccc.info/2007/11/ [2]&lt;/ref&gt; An [[India]]n news media report states that it was founded by the [[International Policy Network]], a [[London]]-based organization that receives support from [[Exxon Mobil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/225756 Climate change deniers spreading misinformation: Environmental groups], Newstrack India, June 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The group publishes background papers and opinion editorials on the science and economics of climate change and maintains a blog.  Its ''Civil Society Report on Climate Change'' was published in 2007, shortly before the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] conference in [[Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.challengingclimate.org/story.aspx?id=2876&amp;pubid=2796 Civil Society Report on Climate Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328064045/http://www.challengingclimate.org/story.aspx?id=2876&amp;pubid=2796 |date=2012-03-28 }}, ChallengingClimate.org website&lt;/ref&gt;   CSCCC experts make media appearances, such as [[Julian Morris (economist)|Julian Morris]]'s 2007 feature on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and his televised debate in 2008 with [[IPCC]] head [[Rajendra Pachauri]].
&lt;!-- 
The International Policy Network (IPN) names itself as "one of the 41 organisations who published the report."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policynetwork.net/es/environment/publication/civil-society-report-climate-change The Civil Society Report on Climate Change], International Policy Network website, November 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

This IPN in the UK has Julian Morris as Executive Director.  It is actually a part of the Atlas Group/Network (aka Atlas Economic Research Institute) which was founded by UK factory-chicken king, Sir Antony Fisher (one of PM Margaret Thatcher's economic gurus) and American Loctite millionaire Richard Krieble.  They had funding support from Krieble, Richard Mellon Scaife, and Philip Morris. [http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/jmi97g00/pdf]  Fisher is reputed to have had a primary hand in establishing up to 150 libertarian think-tanks around the world.

Fisher's daughter, Linda Whetstone, now works for the (Fisher-founded) Adam Smith Institute. She is also the chairperson of the International Policy Network, and is on the Boards of Directors of the Mont Pelerin Society, the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Atlas Group in the USA. [http://atlasnetwork.org/blog/2010/01/board-members/]  Coalitions and networks of this kind a common with Atlas Group think-tanks, and many of their key staff and directors serve on many different organisations. This faux-multiplicity amplifies the apparent strength of the public attacks on climate-change science.

The '''World Summit on Sustainable Development''' ('''WSSD'''), or the '''ONG Earth Summit 2002''', took place in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002. It was convened to discuss [[sustainable development]] by the United Nations. WSSD gathered a number of leaders from business and non-governmental organizations, 10 years after the first [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro. (It was therefore also informally nicknamed "Rio+10".)

==Declarations==
The [[Johannesburg Declaration]] was the main outcome of the Summit; however, there were several other international agreements.

It laid out the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation as an action plan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/WSSD_POI_PD/English/POIToc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreements==
Johannesburg, 27 August: agreement was made to restore the world's depleted fisheries for 2015. It was agreed to by negotiators at the World Summit. 

Instead of new agreements between governments, the Earth Summit was organized mostly around almost 300 "partnership initiatives" known as [[Type II Partnerships|Type II]], as opposed to Type I Partnerships which are the more classic outcome of international treaties.  These were to be the key means to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]].  These are kept in a database of Partnerships for Sustainable Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapps01.un.org/dsd/partnerships/public/welcome.do|title=United Nations Maintenance Page|author=|date=|website=webapps01.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. participation==
The absence of the United States rendered the summit partially impotent. [[George W. Bush]] boycotted the summit and did not attend. Except for a brief appearance by [[Colin Powell]], who hurriedly addressed the closing stages of the conference while his airplane taxied on the runway of Johannesburg International, the US government did not send a delegation, earning Bush praise in a letter from conservative organizations such as [[Americans for Tax Reform]], [[American Enterprise Institute]], and [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brainerd Dispatch, citing AP|title=Conservatives praise Bush for opting out of U.N. Earth Summit|url=http://brainerddispatch.com/stories/081502/nne_0815020004.shtml|accessdate=21 June 2011|agency=Associated Press|date=15 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWSD Info News|url=http://www.iisd.ca/wssd/infonews9.html|work=IISD|publisher=IISD.ca|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The United Nations [[Conference on the Human Environment]], was first held in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in June 1972, and marked the emergence of international environmental law. The Declaration on the Human Environment also known as the Stockholm Declaration set out the principles for various international environmental issues, including human rights, natural resource management, pollution prevention and the relationship between the environment and development. The conference also led to the creation of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].

The [[Brundtland Commission]] set up by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], the pioneer of [[sustainable development]], provided the momentum for first [[Earth Summit]] 1992 &amp;ndash; the United Nations Conference on Environmental Development (UNCED), that was also headed by Maurice Strong, who had been a prominent member of the Brundtland Commission &amp;ndash; and also for [[Agenda 21]].

South Africa's first [[South African National Conference on Environment and Development|National Conference on Environment and Development]] entitled, "Ecologise Politics, Politicise Ecology" was held at the [[University of the Western Cape]] in conjunction with the [[Cape Town Ecology Group]] and the Western Cape Branch of the [[World Conference on Religion and Peace]] in 1991. Prominent persons involved in this conference were [[Ebrahim Rasool]], [[Cheryl Carolus]], Faried Esack, and Julia Martin.

The initial informal discussions on a possible new Summit in 2002 were held in February 1998 and hosted by Derek Osborn who co-chaired the preparatory meetings for Rio+5 and [[Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future]]. A set of 10 governments started working informally to start putting together the possible agenda for a Summit. the non-papers produced in 1998 and 1999 ensured that when the UN Commission met in 2000 it could agree to host another Summit in 2002.

'''Fairbanks International Airport''' {{Airport codes|FAI|PAFA|FAI}} is a state-owned public-use airport located three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of the central business district of [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], a city in the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska|Fairbanks North Star Borough]] of the [[United States]] state of [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=FAA /&gt; Fairbanks is the smallest city in the United States with non-stop service to Europe, as [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] offers weekly flights to [[Frankfurt]] during the summer tourist season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/International_Transporation.pdf International Transportation Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708201007/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/International_Transporation.pdf |date=2008-07-08 }}, [[State of Alaska]] Governor's Office of International Trade&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Air North]] is another international airline with flights (to Canada) and [[Antonov Airlines]] offers cargo flights to [[South Korea]].

==History==

===Early years===
The airport opened in 1951 and took over existing scheduled airline traffic to Fairbanks, which had previously used [[Ladd Army Airfield]].&lt;ref name="dot"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Fairbanks International Airport |work=Fairbanks International Airport |publisher=Alaska Department of Transportation &amp; Public Facilities |date=2011 |url=http://dot.alaska.gov/faiiap/history.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alaska Airlines]] used Fairbanks as its main hub in the 1950s, with service to Seattle and Portland as well as intrastate service to Anchorage, Nome and other destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alaska Airlines system schedule |work=Timetable Images |date=June 7, 1953 |url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/as53/as53-1.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967, however, the airline shifted its [[Alaska]] hub to Anchorage; its Anchorage-Fairbanks service continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alaska Airlines system schedule |work=Timetable Images |date=June 1, 1967 |url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/as67/as67-1.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, following the development of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]], [[Alaska Airlines]] and [[Braniff International]] offered "interchange service" between Fairbanks and Houston via Anchorage, Seattle and Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alaska Airlines System Wide Routes |work=Departed Flights |date=February 1, 1975 |url=http://www.departedflights.com/AS020175.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, following airline deregulation, [[Alaska Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] began a similar interchange service using [[Boeing 727]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of American Airlines |publisher=American Airlines |date=June 2015 |url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/amrcorp/corporateInformation/facts/history.jsp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526202629/http://www.aa.com/i18n/amrcorp/corporateInformation/facts/history.jsp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pan American World Airways]] had also served Fairbanks since 1932. The station was originally opened after the acquisition of Pacific International Airways and used for short-haul services to Juneau, Seattle, Ketchikan, Whitehorse and other destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pan Am to stop Alaska flights, closes chapter in aviation history |work=Ellensburg Daily Record |date=September 19, 1978 |agency=UPI |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6YRUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MI8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5757%2C5583123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pan Am intended to use Fairbanks as a stop for service to Asia as early as 1931, but initial difficulty in negotiating landing rights with the Soviet Union, followed by the outbreak of [[World War II]], delayed these plans until decades later. Pan Am service to Fairbanks continued through the opening of FAI until 1965, when the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] terminated Pan Am's rights to serve Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pan Am: Once Ketchikan's Link to the Outside World |first=Dave |last=Kiffer |work=Stories in the News |date=December 29, 2006 |location=Ketchican, Alaska |url=http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/PanAm/122906_Pan_Am_Airways.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pan American World Airways]] eventually used Fairbanks as a stopover for transpacific service from New York and Seattle to Tokyo starting in September 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pan Am introduces the first nonstop service from Fairbanks to Tokyo |work=Fairbanks Daily News-Miner |date=August 5, 1969 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/11889938/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title=Pan Am route map |work=Departed Flights |date=February 1, 1972 |url=http://www.departedflights.com/PA020172.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title=Pan Am World Routes |work=Departed Flights |date=April 29, 1973 |url=http://www.departedflights.com/PA042973.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Pan Am agreed to transfer its Fairbanks-Seattle service to [[Western Airlines]], and requested that the CAB allow its New York-Tokyo service to be suspended from April 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pan Am route sale to Western okayed by CAB |work=Eugene Register-Guard |date=February 14, 1975 |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nqNVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ldkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5112%2C3245004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other carriers such as [[Japan Airlines]] and [[Korean Air]] began to use Fairbanks as a technical stop for transpacific cargo flights in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;

===Development since the 2000s===
On October 11, 2009, the airport constructed a new terminal and demolished the old terminal which was built in 1948. The new terminal is built around the modern [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] standards. In addition to architectural design and better security, the main terminal now has six jet-bridges (up from the former five).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai-terminal-project.com/pdf/Terminal_Timeline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121182835/http://www.fai-terminal-project.com/pdf/Terminal_Timeline.pdf |archivedate=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2,700m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of custom unitised curtain wall was designed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong. The special design incorporated double [[Low emissivity|low-''e'']] triple glazing. The new building's footprint is smaller than the old building.

For the 12-month period ending February 28, 2018, the airport had 119,898 aircraft operations, an average of 328 per day: 58% [[general aviation]], 31% [[air taxi]], 9% [[airline|scheduled commercial]], and 2% [[military aviation|military]]. At that time there were 569 aircraft based at this airport: 91% single-[[aircraft engine|engine]], 8% multi-engine, &lt;1% jet and &lt;1% [[helicopter]].&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt;

===Terminal===
The terminal building, situated on the southwest side of the airport, contains seven gates: two for commuter carriers and five for larger carriers.

===Runways===
Fairbanks International Airport covers an area of 3,470 acres (1,404 [[hectare|ha]]) at an elevation of 439 feet (134 m) above [[mean sea level]]. It has four [[runway]]s:&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt;
* Runway 2L/20R: 11,800 by 150&amp;nbsp;feet (3,597 x 46 m), Surface: Asphalt
* Runway 2R/20L: 6,501 by 100&amp;nbsp;feet (1,981 x 30 m), Surface: Asphalt

==Accidents and incidents==
* In September 2013 there were two incidents of vehicular trespass onto its taxiway and runways, by users unknowingly following [[Apple Maps|Apple Map's]] errant directions to Fairbanks International Airport. The directions indicated access to the Main Terminal via Taxiway B, which connects the East Ramp to the passenger terminal on the West Ramp. No one was injured nor were any flights were delayed. The Airport has since complained to [[Apple Inc]], through the local attorney office and erected barricades along the final stretch of the runway to prevent future occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24246646 |title=Apple Maps flaw results in drivers crossing airport runway | work=BBC News | date=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flag of the [[Nordic Council]]''' is blue ([[Pantone|PMS]] 300 U), with a stylised circular motif of a [[white]] [[swan]]. The swan symbol was chosen to represent the Nordic Council, and the Nordic Council of Ministers, in 1984. It is also designed to symbolise wider [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] cooperation. The current version was designed by [[Kontrapunkt]] in 2016.

Before 2016, the flag was white, with a stylised circular motif of a white [[swan]] upon a blue ([[Pantone]] Reflex Blue C) disk. The Swan had enough [[Flight feather|wing feathers]] standing for the eight members and territories of the Council: [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Åland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]]. The flag was designed by Kyösti Varis, an artist from Finland.

The full members of the Nordic council all use a [[Nordic Cross Flag]]. The Nordic Cross was also use in the [[Flag of the Kalmar Union]]. The [[Kalmar Union]] was the only time when all Nordic countries were under a single state - hence it has traditionally been a sign of unity before the Nordic Council adopted the swan flag.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

'''HDMS ''Havfruen''''' was a frigate of the [[Royal Danish Navy]].

==Construction==
HDMS ''Havfruen'' was built at the [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Royal Dock Yard]] in [[Copenhagen]] to a design by Andreas Schifter. She was launched on 6 October 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navalhistory.dk/Danish/Skibene/H/Havfruen(1832).htm|title=HAVFRUEN (1832-1864)|language=Danish|website=navalhistory.dk|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of four frigates in the same class. The others were HDMS ''Freya'' (1824-1853)
{{HDMS|Bellona|1830|6}} (1835-1862) and HDMS ''Toia'' (1838-1863).

==Royal Danish Navy ervice==
[[File:HDMS Havfruen (1825).jpg|thumb|left|''HDMS Havfruen'']]
She served the Royal Danish Navy from 6 October 1825. She was under command of captain C. Lütken and accompanied by HDMS ''Nymfen'' from 28 April 1832 to  22 June 1832

Later captains were J. R. Petersen (26 April 1848- 18 August 1848), J. Christmas (18 August 1848
- 14 October 1848), J. R. Petersen (17 March 1849 - 28 September 1849) and J. A. Meyer (24 May 1850 - 18 October 1850).

She was used as a navel training ship from 1 May 1853 to 1 October 1853. She was under command of captain [[Peter Frederik Wulff]] from 1 June 1853 to 7 October 1853 and then

She was from 1 October 1853 used as a barracks ship under the command of captain-lieutenant E. W. Holst and again in 1854 and 1856.

==Civilian service==
She was decommissioned from the navy on 5 September 1864. On 13 March  1865, she was sold in auction at the Royal Dock Yard. The buyer was Det Kjøbenhavnske Skibsrhederi, a subsidiary of [[Hans Puggaard|H. Puggaard &amp; Co.]]. She was adapted for use as a merchant ship under the supervision of P. Brandt at the Royal Naval Dockyard in 1865-1866.

In her time as a merchant ship, ''Havfruen'' was commanded by captain J.P. Sørensen, captain A.F. Andrea, captain J.C. Trolle and captain A.J. Bang (1880-1881).

On 27 March  1882, she was sold to Johan Ingemanson, Elleholm, Blekinge, Sweden, with captain Daniel Petterson as partner. She wrecked in 1882 at Griffin Cove, Gaspe, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmarcussen.dk/maritim/skibsliste/side.php?id=9826|title=Detaljerede oplysninger om skibet: Havfruen|language=Danish|website=jmarcussen.dk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judiciary of Poland''' is a responsibility, as defined by the [[constitution of Poland]], of a four-tier [[court]] system: the [[Supreme Court of Poland]], the [[common court]]s, [[administrative court]]s (including the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Poland]]) and [[military court]]s. Therefore, [[tribunal]]s (such as the [[Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]] and [[State Tribunal of the Republic of Poland|State Tribunal]]) are, in a strict definition, not part of Polish judiciary, but in a broad definition, they are included in it.

The common courts, divided into [[appellate court]]s, [[district court]]s and [[regional court]]s, have the competency in criminal, civil, economic, labor and family law.

Court judges in Poland are nominated by the [[National Council of the Judiciary|Krajowa Rada Sądownictwa]] (National Council of the Judiciary) and are appointed for life by the [[president of Poland]].

[[Prosecution in Poland]] is formed by the [[Public Prosecutor General (Poland)|Public Prosecutor General]], the [[National Public Prosecutor's Office]], regional, district and appellate prosecutions, military prosecutors, and the prosecutors of the [[Institute of National Remembrance]].

The [[European Commission]] invokes the Article 7 of the [[Treaty on European Union|European Treaty]] against [[European Union|E.U.]] member [[Poland]], denouncing recent judiciary reforms putting it under the political control of the [[Law and Justice party|ruling majority]] and citing ''"serious risk [to] the [[rule of law|independence of the judiciary]] and the [[separation of powers]]"''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2017/12/20/l-europe-declenche-une-procedure-sans-precedent-contre-le-gouvernement-polonais_5232406_3214.html |title=L’Europe déclenche une procédure sans précédent contre le gouvernement polonais |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=20 December 2017 |website=[[LeMonde.fr]] |access-date=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Poland Overhauls Judiciary, Escalating Clash With E.U. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/world/europe/eu-poland-law.html | website = nytimes.com | date = 20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Poland cries foul as EU triggers 'nuclear option' over judicial independence | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/eu-process-poland-voting-rights | website = theguardian.com | date = 20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{nihongo|'''Kikuin Sōi'''|菊隠 宗意|extra=? &amp;ndash; 1620}} was a [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] [[Japanese Zen|Zen]] [[Buddhist monk]] of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].

Kikuin was ordained as a [[Bhikkhu]] (full monk) at the [[Enkaku-ji (Okinawa)|Enkaku-ji]] temple ({{lang|ja|円覚寺}}) in Shuri. Later, he travelled to Japan to study Zen for over ten years. After he returned to Ryukyu, he was appointed [[Abbot (Buddhism)|abbot]] of [[Tennō-ji (Okinawa)|Tennō-ji]] temple ({{lang|ja|天王寺}}). Kikuin was fluent in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]; he was friends of [[Shimazu Yoshihisa]], [[Shimazu Yoshihiro]] and [[Shimazu Tadatsune|Shimazu Iehisa]]. He led missions to [[Satsuma Domain]] multiple times.

In the spring of 1609, [[invasion of Ryukyu|Satsuma invaded Ryukyu]] and captured the strategically important [[Nakijin Castle]]. Kikuin went there to request a peace negotiation together with a Japanese tea master named [[Kian (tea master)|Kian]], but they were arrested by Satsuma troops. After the war, he was taken to [[Kagoshima Castle]] together with King [[Shō Nei]] and a number of high officials by Satsuma troops. After ''[[sessei]]'' [[Gushichan Chōsei]] died at [[Sunpu Castle]], he served as acting ''sessei''.

{{NSA surveillance|1}}
'''MARINA''' is an [[NSA]] database and analysis toolset for intercepted [[Internet]] [[metadata]] (DNI in NSA terminology). The database stores metadata up to a year. According to documents leaked by [[Edward Snowden]]: "The Marina metadata application tracks a user's browser experience, gathers contact information/content and develops summaries of target" and "[o]f the more distinguishing features, Marina has the ability to look back on the last 365 days' worth of DNI metadata seen by the [[Sigint]] collection system, ''regardless'' whether or not it was tasked for collection." [Emphasis in original NSA document.] The stored metadata is mainly used for [[pattern-of-life analysis]]. [[US person]]s are not exempt because metadata is not considered data by US law (section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act]]).&lt;ref name="theguardian-nsa-marina"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/nsa-americans-metadata-year-documents |title=NSA stores metadata of millions of web users for up to a year, secret files show |author=James Ball |work=The Guardian |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHXfxip7?url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/nsa-americans-metadata-year-documents |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manas Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|Manas's kümböz, the alleged burial site of Manas]]

'''Manas Ordo''' ({{lang-ky|Манас Ордо}}, {{IPA-ky|mɑnɑs ordó|}}) is a modern historical park (with a museum) built around '''Manas's Kümböz''' ({{lang-ky|Манастын күмбөзү}}, {{IPA-ky|mɑnɑstɯn kymbœzy|}}), a [[Karakhanid]]-era [[mausoleum]] most likely built around 1334 thought to be the final resting place of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] epic hero [[Epic of Manas|Manas]].  Among the Kyrgyz, the site has status as a ''[[Mazar (mausoleum)|mazar]]''.

== Background ==
The [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] epic hero [[Epic of Manas|Manas]] is said to have been buried in the [[Talas Ala-Too Range|Ala-Too mountains]] in [[Talas Province]], in northwestern [[Kyrgyzstan]].  The [[mausoleum]] 12&amp;nbsp;km east of the town of [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]] is believed to house his remains and is a popular destination for Kyrgyz travelers.  Traditional Kyrgyz horsemanship games are held there every summer since 1995.  An inscription on the mausoleum states, however, that it is dedicated to "...the most famous of women, Kenizek-Khatun, the daughter of the emir Abuka".  Legend has it that Kanikey, Manas' widow, ordered this inscription in an effort to confuse her husband's enemies and prevent a defiling of his grave.

'''Operation Klipklop''' occurred during the [[South African Border War]] between the [[Republic of South Africa]] and [[SWAPO]]. The operation began at first light on the 30 July 1980 when South African forces attacked SWAPO facilities in [[Angola]].&lt;ref name=Steenkamp&gt;{{cite book|last=Steenkamp|first=Willem|title=South Africa's border war, 1966-1989|year=1989|publisher=Ashanti Pub.|location=Gibraltar|isbn=0620139676}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}} The objective was a [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia|PLAN]] logistics base at the town of Chitado, 5&amp;nbsp;km from the Namibian border and 35&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Ruacana]], with the aim of disrupting mortar attacks on the Ruacana hydro-electric scheme.&lt;ref name=Steenkamp/&gt;{{rp|94}} 

Supported by [[Aérospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] attack helicopters, 80 men were dropped by helicopters close to the town. Twenty seven defenders, possibly PLAN or MPLA soldiers, died in the attack that followed with the SADF destroying the [[MPLA]] base in the town on their withdrawal.&lt;ref name=Steenkamp/&gt;{{rp|94}} This operation followed [[Operation Sceptic]] and preceded [[Operation Protea]].

'''P. Box''' (which stood for the name Pandora's Box) is a Hungarian hard rock band formed by two ex-[[P. Mobil]] members: Sándor Bencsik and [[István Cserháti]] in 1980.
The band disbanded in 1986 due to Cserháti's settling in Debrecen, which is 220&amp;nbsp;km from the capital city Budapest.
The band was revived in 2001 by Cserháti, with the members of Szfinx and Aberra.
On August 21, 2005, Cserháti died in cancer. He was 51 years old.
In November 2005, the band changed the official name to Pandora's Box.&lt;br/&gt;
The band broke up in 2006, giving their last concerts on 3 November 2006, in Debrecen and on 11 November 2006, in Budapest. They returned on the Summer of 2009. Meanwhile, two ex-members, József Sáfár and István Szabó formed another band with the same name.

'''''Pražský dobrodruh, podivuhodná historie Hanuše Adama Löwenmachta''''' (''Prague Adventurer: the marvelous story of Hans Adam Löwenmacht''), originally published in German as ''Hans Adam Löwenmacht, phantastischer Roman aus der Barockzeit'', is an adventure novel, described as a "[[Baroque]] novel", by [[Rudolf Slawitschek]], a [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] writer who wrote in [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.databazeknih.cz/knihy/prazsky-dobrodruh-podivuhodna-historie-h-a-lowenmachta-199610|title=Pražský dobrodruh - Podivuhodná historie H.A.Löwenmachta - Rudolf Slawitschek |work= Databáze knih|access-date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the author's best-known work and won the [[Prague City Prize]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kohoutikriz.org/data/w_slawi.php|title=Rudolf Slawitschek: životopis jednoho spisovatele z Čech |first1=Robert N. |last=Bloch|work=Kohoutí kříž|editor-last1=Mareš|editor-first1=Jan|editor-last2=Kareš|editor-first2=Ivo|language=cs|access-date=2018-08-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The adventure novel takes place in the historical city of Prague.

The first German edition was published by [[Rudolf M. Rohrer Verlag]] in 1939 
A [[Czech language|Czech-language]] version was first published in 1942 by [[Josef R. Vilímek]] publishing house, translated by [[S. Möcklová]]. The cover illustration of the novel was created by [[Zdeněk Guth]].

The second Czech edition of the novel in 1943 was affected by the linguistic regulations of the occupation administration. The most significant manifestation was the ban on the translation of German city names into Czech.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">A '''press subsidy''' ({{lang-lb|Staatlech Pressehëllef}}) is given by the government to newspapers in [[Luxembourg]] under the Law of 13 August 1998 on the Promotion of the Printed Press.  They are awarded automatically to all general-interest newspapers appearing at least once a week that have full-time staffs of at least five journalists and of which advertisements constitute less than 50% of the newspaper.&lt;ref name="Press Subsidies in Europe"&gt;{{cite book |title=Press Subsidies in Europe |last=Fernández Alonso |first=Isabel |author2=de Moragas, Miquel |author3=Blasco Gil, José Joaquín |author4=Almiron, Núria |year=2006 |publisher=Generalitat of Catalonia |location=Barcelona |isbn=978-84-393-7269-1 |url=http://www.portalcomunicacio.es/opc/download/press_eng.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total programme amounted to €7,754,499 in 2009.  One-third of the total subsidy is spread evenly between qualifying newspapers, with the other two-thirds being proportional to the number of pages.  All newspapers except the dominant ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]'' depend on the press subsidy for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch (2004), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, newspapers received indirect subsidy by a preferential postal rate, a ceiling on television and radio advertising, and a reduced [[value added tax]] rate of 3%.&lt;ref name="Press Subsidies in Europe" /&gt;

'''Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.''', doing business as '''Sirius XM Satellite Radio''', is a [[broadcasting]] company headquartered in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]] that provides three [[satellite radio]] and [[online radio]] services operating in the United States: [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], [[XM Satellite Radio]], and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a minor interest in [[SiriusXM Canada]], an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in [[Canada]]. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/SIRI/3358511009x0x741176/DECE4582-303F-41DC-8F2A-AE1F048739E9/SiriusXM_Annual_Report_and_Proxy_2013.pdf|title=SiriusXM Annual Report and Proxy 2013|date=2013|accessdate=July 27, 2014|website=shareholder.com|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104133240/http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/SIRI/3358511009x0x741176/DECE4582-303F-41DC-8F2A-AE1F048739E9/SiriusXM_Annual_Report_and_Proxy_2013.pdf|archivedate=January 4, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger.&lt;ref name="reuters080729"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSN2926292520080730?sp=true |title=Sirius completes acquisition of XM Satellite|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.&lt;ref name="reuters080729" /&gt; The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt.&lt;ref name="khart"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hart, Kim |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/25/AR2008072503026.html?hpid=topnews |title=Satellite Radio Merger Approved|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Q2 2017, SiriusXM has more than 32 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.siriusxm.com/investor-overview/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/SiriusXM-Reports-Second-Quarter-2017-Results/default.aspx|title=SiriusXM Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results|website=investor.siriusxm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.&lt;ref name="khart" /&gt;

In September 2018, the company agreed to purchase the competing streaming music service, [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/sirius-xm-is-buying-pandora-1537788241|title=Sirius XM to Buy Pandora in Bet on Streaming Music|last=Steele|first=Anne|date=2018-09-24|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-09-25|last2=Prang|first2=Allison|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sirius Satellite Radio]] was founded by [[Martine Rothblatt]], [[David Margolese]], and [[Robert Briskman]].&lt;ref name="mherper"&gt;{{cite news|author=Herper, Matthew |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0510/second-acts-pharmaceuticals-orphan-drugs-pah-deep-breaths.html |title=From Satellites to Pharmaceuticals|work=[[Forbes]]|date=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swarren"&gt;{{cite book|author=Warren, Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s0jSxLqs-TwC&amp;pg=PT181&amp;lpg=PT181&amp;dq=cd+radio+david+margolese |title=Radio: The Book|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|date=2004|page=166|isbn=978-0-240-80696-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="mherper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eandrews"&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrews, Edmund L. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/08/business/fcc-plan-for-radio-by-satellite.html |title=F.C.C.

===Early days of XM===
{{Main|XM Satellite Radio}}
The origin of [[XM Satellite Radio]] was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio [[Martine Rothblatt]], to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite [[Digital Audio Radio Service]] (SDARS).&lt;ref name="Federal Communications Commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1997-03-11/html/97-6064.htm |title=Digital Audio Service in the 2310–2360 MHZ Frequency Band |website=Federal Communications Commission |date=March 11, 1997 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E.

==Merger==
{{Wikinews|In depth: XM and Sirius merger}}

===Announcement===
After years of speculation (the ''[[New York Post]]'' first reported on a potential merger in January 2005)&lt;ref name="tarango" /&gt; and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007.&lt;ref name="siklossorkin"&gt;{{cite news|authors=Siklos, Richard &amp; Sorkin, Andrew Ross |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/business/media/20radio.html?pagewanted=all |title=Merger Would End Satellite Radio's Rivalry|work=The New York Times|date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion.&lt;ref name="rbeschizza" /&gt; Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kharif, Olga |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2005-07-13/xm-and-sirius-should-join-bands |title=XM and Sirius Should Join Bands|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=July 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO [[Mel Karmazin]] ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.&lt;ref name="siklossorkin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smoritz"&gt;{{cite news|author=Moritz, Scott |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/24/technology/xm_sirius.fortune/index.htm |title=Justice Department approves XM-Sirius deal|work=Fortune|date=March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approval===
After a 57-week review process, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets.&lt;ref name="smoritz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pshenon"&gt;{{cite news|author=Shenon, Philip |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/business/25radio.html?_r=0 |title=Justice Dept. Approves XM Merger With Sirius|work=The New York Times|date=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman [[Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin]] stated, "The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices."

The biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kharif, Olga|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-07-25/the-fcc-approves-the-xm-sirius-mergerbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |title=The FCC Approves the XM-Sirius Merger|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smusil"&gt;{{cite news|author=Musil, Steven|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10000241-94.html |title=FCC approves Sirius-XM satellite radio merger|work=[[CNET]]|date=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosoff, Matt|url=http://news.cnet.com/sirius-xm-channel-merge-begins-next-week/ |title=Sirius-XM channel merge begins next week|publisher=CNET|date=November 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Ellis, David &amp; La Monica, Paul R. |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/19/news/companies/xm_sirius/ |title=XM, Sirius announcer merger|publisher=CNN Money|date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for [[Howard Stern]], and [[Martha Stewart]]; live [[NBA]] and [[NFL]] games; and live [[NASCAR]] races. XM's programming included channels for [[Willie Nelson]], [[Opie and Anthony]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Oprah Winfrey]]; and live [[Major League Baseball]] games.&lt;ref name="pshenon" /&gt;

===Opposition===
The [[National Association of Broadcasters]] was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly.&lt;ref name="siklossorkin" /&gt; Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, [[attorneys general]] from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rowley, James Rowley|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=auQ19XwOps1M&amp;refer=us |title=States Urge FCC to Limit XM Satellite, Sirius Merger|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=March 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] for allowing it to go through.&lt;ref name="pshenon" /&gt;

==Post-merger==

===Resurgence and growth===
After coming close to filing for [[Chapter 11]] only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Van Buskirk, Eliot|url=https://www.wired.com/business/2009/02/surprise-surpri/ |title=Surprise, Surprise... Sirius XM Already Talking Bankruptcy|website=Wired|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from [[Liberty Media]] in February 2009, which [[Mel Karmazin]] negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.&lt;ref name="nyt022510"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/technology/26radio.html?hpw&amp;_r=0 |title=Sirius XM Posts Profit, Its First Since Merger|work=The New York Times|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jbercovici"&gt;{{cite news |author=Bercovici, Jeff |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/04/03/sirius-xms-mel-karmazin-im-one-of-the-most-underpaid-executives-in-the-history-of-executive-payment/ |title=Sirius XM's Mel Karmazin: 'I'm One of the Most Underpaid Executives in the History of Executive Payment' |work=Forbes |date=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers.&lt;ref name="nyt022510" /&gt; By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host [[Howard Stern]]'s contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.&lt;ref name="jbercovici" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trefisteam"&gt;{{cite news|author=Team, Trefis |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/04/12/can-sirius-xm-tune-in-big-subscriber-growth-this-year/ |title=Can Sirius XM Tune In Big Subscriber Growth This Year?|work=Forbes|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Sirius XM had approximately a 75% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 75%, approximately 40% become subscribers. SiriusXM is available in vehicles from every major car company as well as in assorted trucks, boats and aircraft. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then offers customers a variety of subscription options. There are more than 100 million cars on the road with SiriusXM radios installed.

After trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]]. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place [[repeater]]s in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marcucci, Carl|url=http://rbr.com/sirius-xm-moving-to-offer-service-in-alaska-hawaii/ |title=Sirius XM moving to offer service in Alaska, Hawaii|website=rbr.com|date=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/908937/000095012311014617/y88211e10vk.htm |title=2010 Form 10-K, Sirius XM Radio, Inc.|publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 11, 2011, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in [[SiriusXM Canada]].&lt;ref name="crtc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-240.htm |title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-240|website=CRTC.GC.CA| accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as "Sirius subscribers" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gardner, Eriq|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/howard-stern-loses-bid-revive-437810 |title=Howard Stern Loses Bid to Revive $300 Million Sirius XM Lawsuit|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Probasco, Jim|url=http://money.msn.com/top-stocks/post.aspx?post=761d794f-604c-4efd-ac50-ba97695cc7ed&amp;ref=bfv |title=Is Stern's loss a win for Sirius XM?|publisher=[[MSN Money]]|date=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, SiriusXM surpassed 32 million subscribers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

On September 24, 2018, Sirius XM announced its intent to acquire [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] for $3.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17895332/siriusxm-pandora-acquisition-music-streaming|title=SiriusXM buys Pandora for $3.5 billion|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option.&lt;ref name="msaltzman1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Saltzman, Marc |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/04/16/sirius-xm-app-music-radio/2088305/ |title=MySXM: SiriusXM app adds more personalization features|work=[[USA Today]]|date=April 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include [[iHeartRadio]], [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]], and [[Spotify]].&lt;ref name="jbercovici" /&gt;

In August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience. MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels.

The internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. SiriusXM apps also include an extensive lineup of archived programming on SiriusXM On Demand.

On June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]], allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices.

As part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.sirius.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=535956 |title=Howard Stern Signs New Five-Year Contract With SIRIUS XM|publisher=PRNewswire|date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, SiriusXM unveiled a new look for both the desktop web player and the mobile apps. The MySXM feature, including all the custom mixes that listeners saved overtime, was removed. SiriusXM claims that they're working on a more personalized feature that will release in the upcoming months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/cfbchuck/status/998215986607255554|title=Chuck on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber).&lt;ref name="rbeschizza" /&gt; After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Woodruff, Cathy|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Sirius-XM-merger-leaves-users-with-serious-mess-1006251.php |title=Sirius XM merger leaves users with serious mess|work=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]|location=Albany, NY|date=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siriusbuzz.com/what-happens-with-that-sirius-lifetime-subscription.php |title=What Happens With That Sirius Lifetime Subscription?|website=Sirius Buzz|date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian counterparts==
{{Main|SiriusXM Canada}}
In [[Canada]], [[Sirius Canada]] and [[XM Canada]] were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in [[joint venture]]s with Canadian companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jay, Paul|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2008/07/30/xm-sirius-conflict.html |title=XM, Sirius merger in U.S. raises competition concerns in Canada|work=[[CBC News]]| date=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.&lt;ref name="evlessing"&gt;{{cite news|author=Vlessing|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/xm-sirius-merger-not-replicated-116510 |title=XM-Sirius merger not replicated in Canada|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.&lt;ref name=evlessing /&gt;

On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Protalinski, Emil|url=http://www.techspot.com/news/41302-xm-and-sirius-to-finally-merge-in-canada.html |title=XM and Sirius to finally merge in Canada|website=techspot.com|date=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into [[SiriusXM Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/89975/crtc-approves-sirius-xm-merger-in-canada |title=CRTC Approves Sirius XM Merger In Canada|website=All Access|date=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bitove]]'s Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while [[Slaight Communications]] and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%.&lt;ref name="crtc" /&gt; The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/sirius-canada-and-xm-canada-complete-merger/1000486539/ |title=Sirius Canada and XM Canada Complete Merger|work=Broadcaster|date=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical==

===Receivers===
XM and Sirius use different [[Data compression|compression]] and [[conditional access]] systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year.&lt;ref name="smusil" /&gt; The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Melanson, Donald|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/08/sirius-xm-rolls-out-interoperable-mirge-satellite-radio/ |title=Sirius XM rolls out interoperable MiRGE satellite radio|website=Engadget|date=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. {{As of|2016|02}}, Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radios|url=http://shop.siriusxm.com/edealinv/servlet/ExecMacro?nurl=control/CategoryHome.vm&amp;ctl_nbr=10600&amp;catParentID=49759|publisher=Sirius XM|accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SiriusXM Marine is graphical weather and fishing info for boaters. The service works with most major marine-electronics hardware companies, such as Raymarine, Furuno, Simrad and Garmin.&lt;ref name="siriusxm.com1"/&gt; The Marine Offshore package includes graphical weather radar; cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning; high-resolution coastal and offshore wave heights, direction and intervals; high-resolution sea-surface temperatures; pressure isobars; buoy data, etc.

SiriusXM Aviation provides satellite-based graphical weather info for pilots, which provides better signal coverage and faster data refresh rate than land-based [[Automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast|ADS-B]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.siriusxm.com/sxmaviation|title=SiriusXM Aviation Weather|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed info can be found in SiriusXM Aviation Weather vs ADS-B(FIS-B weather) page. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://siriusxmcommunications.com/sxmaviation/daretocompare.html|title=SiriusXM Aviation Weather vs ADS-B(FIS-B) Weather}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2020 FAA Mandate does not require pilots to equip with ADS‑B/FIS‑B weather. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2011-title14-vol2/CFR-2011-title14-vol2-sec91-225|title=2020 FAA Mandate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SiriusXM Aviation receiver Model # SXAR1 and Garmin GDL51/GDL52 enables pilots to use an iPad or iPhone with the Foreflight Mobile App, via Bluetooth, to view the SiriusXM Aviation in-flight weather and data delivered via satellite to monitor storm fronts, track lightning strikes, TAFs, METARs, winds and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shop.siriusxm.com/siriusxm-aviation-receiver.html|title=SiriusXM Aviation Receiver - Shop SiriusXM|website=shop.siriusxm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ipadpilotnews.com/2018/09/foreflight-adds-support-for-garmin-gdl-50-51-and-52/ | title= ForeFlight adds support for Garmin GDL 50, 51, and 52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellites===
{{As of|2017|05}}, there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare.&lt;ref name="siriusbuzz100712"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siriusbuzz.com/siriusxm-satellites-and-repeaters.php |title=SiriusXM – Satellites and Repeaters|website=Sirius Buzz|date=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a [[disposal orbit]]. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton]] from [[Kazakhstan]], on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clark, Stephen |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/proton/siriusxm5/launch/ |title=Sirius CM Radio satellite launched by Russian rocket|website=Spaceflight Now|date=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=782032|title=Application for Modification|publisher=Federal Communications Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

Sirius satellites broadcast within the [[S band]] frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325&amp;nbsp;GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/satradiofreq.html |title=Satellite S Band Radio Frequency Table|website=CSG Network|date=August 15, 2011|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=810002|title=FM-6 Technical Description|publisher=Federal Communications Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tatsfield Receiving Station''' was a [[Radio propagation|radio]] [[Signals intelligence|signal listening]] post on the eastern edge of [[Surrey]], England, on the [[North Downs]] and [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Greenwich Meridian]], near Kent, run by the BBC during the Cold War.

==History==
It was established in September 1929, to conduct work with the [[International Radio and Television Organisation]] or ''Union Internationale de Radiodiffusion''. During the Second World War it monitored propaganda broadcasts coming from mainland (German-occupied) Europe, serving the same role as the USA's [[Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service]].

===Rocket launches===
In the mid-1950s engineers at the station were involved with the first trans-Atlantic television broadcasts by the BBC. In 1957 the station was one of only two UK sites to pick up broadcasts from early Soviet rocket launches. In July 1958 it picked up radio signals from the American [[Explorer 4]], launched by a [[Juno I|Jupiter-C]] rocket.

==Structure==
On the Ordnance Survey maps it was listed as a ''WT Sta'' or Wireless Station. It was off the B269, north-east of the roundabout with the B2024, to the east of Pitchers Wood,&lt;ref name="ordnancesurvey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getoutside/local/pitchers-wood-tandridge|title=Pitchers Wood, Tandridge - area information, map, walks and more|website=ordnancesurvey.co.uk|accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; around one mile north of the [[M25 motorway|M25]].

==Function==
It listened in to [[Shortwave radio|short-wave transmissions]], but to largely establish the frequencies of these broadcasts only.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Listening on the Short Waves, 1945 to Today|author=Berg, J.S.|date=2008|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated Publishers|isbn=9780786451999|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZjP978PYo0MC&amp;pg=PA185|page=185|accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It calibrated [[Co-channel interference|interference]] from transmitters from mainland Europe, such as the [[Mühlacker radio transmitter]] in Germany which broadcast on 833&amp;nbsp;kHz, so interfering with the [[BBC Regional Programme|London Regional]] station on 842&amp;nbsp;kHz in 1931. On Sunday 14 January 1934 at 11pm, new [[Radio resource management|radio frequencies]] came into operation in the [[Lucerne Plan]] undertaken by the [[International Broadcasting Union]].

It monitored overseas BBC broadcasts to see which were being jammed, mainly by the Soviet Union, who also jammed the [[Voice of America]].&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=London Calling: Britain, the BBC World Service and the Cold War|author=Webb, A.|date=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781472515018|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=khr5BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209|page=209|accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of [[radio jamming]] - [[skywave]] and [[Surface wave|groundwave]], and the station could monitor skywave jamming.

In 1959 it carried out work into interference of television broadcasts in Northern Ireland and north-east Scotland. From 1960 it began to pick up unauthorised broadcasts from new [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]] stations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2230">'''The legal foundation for the [[Egypt]]ian state’s control of church property''' was the Ottoman [[Hamayouni Decree]] of 1856. This decree sought to eliminate discrimination between citizens of different ethnicities and religions. Amongst other things, it gave Christians the right to construct places of worship by requiring them to submit a request to the Sultan.

After Egypt gained its independence, the Hamayouni Decree was modified in 1934 by the Deputy Minister of the Interior, [[Al-Ezabi Pacha]] in the Al-Ezabi Decree. This comprised a set of 10 conditions which had to be met before any application was
presented to the President for approval. These vague criteria include taking into account objections from local Muslims, the distance between the proposed church and the nearest mosque, the number of Christians in the area and whether or not the
proposed church is near the Nile, public utility or railway. Human rights monitors have stated that the conditions of the decree are in contradiction with the 1971 constitution. The Al-Ezabi "amplification" has, in reality, served to hinder Christians and other religious minorities from maintaining and building places of worship.

Regarding repairs to church property, progress has been made over the past few years following considerable national and international criticism of the decree. In January 1998, an amendment was made which delegated presidential authority to issue permits for church renovation to the country’s 26 provincial governors. On {{#dateformat:December 28 1999}}, [[President Mubarak]] decreed that church repairs no longer required a presidential, governor's or federal ministry permit. Instead, the repair of all places of worship was to be subject to a 1976 civil construction code, symbolically placing the repair of mosques and churches on equal footing before the law.

The '''World's Longest Cricket Marathon''', now officially known as the '''Longest Marathon Playing Cricket''',&lt;ref name="gwr1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Longest marathon playing cricket|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/longest-marathon-playing-cricket/|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[world record]] of the longest time continuously playing the game of [[Cricket]] between two teams.

It is held by Loughborough University Staff Cricket Club from Leicestershire, England. In June 2012, Loughborough University Staff Cricket Club broke the World Record by playing continuous cricket for  150 hours and 14 minutes.&lt;ref name="gwr1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lufbrabbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cricket match in Loughborough sets longest world record|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-18657842|publisher=BBC Online|date=1 July 2012|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lufbraespn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-stop cricket world record|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/blogs/content/story/621620.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=18 March 2014|authorlink=ESPNcricinfo|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt took place from 24 June to 30 June 2012 at the Loughborough College Rubber Crumb. The attempt raised money for a local cancer charity, Harley Staples Cancer Trust. Guinness World records ratified the attempt on 19 February 2014.

It was previously held by Blunham Cricket Club from Bedfordshire in England.&lt;ref name="blunhambbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blunham cricketers set new world record|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/threecounties/hi/front_page/newsid_8956000/8956231.stm|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=18 March 2014|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The club played for 105 hours from 10am Thursday 26 August 2010 until stumps were drawn at 7pm on Monday 30 August 2010.  Guinness World records ratified the attempt on 8 April 2011.  The club played in pink and purple to highlight cancer charities for both men and women.
