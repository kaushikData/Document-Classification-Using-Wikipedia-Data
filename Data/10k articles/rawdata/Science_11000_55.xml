      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2924">In [[archaeology]], a '''biofact''' (or '''ecofact''') is organic material found at an [[archaeological site]] that carries archaeological significance. Biofacts are natural objects found alongside [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] or [[feature (archaeology)|feature]]s,&lt;ref name= Algeo&amp;Algeo&gt;Algeo J. &amp; Algeo A.(Winter, 1988) ''American Speech'' Vol. 63, No. 4 , pp. 345-352&lt;/ref&gt; such as animal bones, charcoal, plants, and pollen.&lt;ref name=Kelly&amp;Thomas&gt;Kelly&amp;Thomas (2011). ''Archaeology: down to earth'' (4th ed.).

Biofacts reveal how people respond to their surroundings.&lt;ref name=Algeo&amp;Algeo/&gt;

A common type of biofact is a [plant] [seed]. Plant remains, often referred to as macrobotanicals, provide a variety of information ranging from diet to medicine to textile production.&lt;ref name=Artifacts&amp;Features&gt;[http://www.southwestlearning.org/topics/artifacts-and-features Artifacts&amp;Features].

Another type of biofact is [[wood]]. Wood is made up [[cellulose]], [[carbohydrates]], and [[lignin]].&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;Wagner, G. A. (1998).

Wood that has been altered by humans is properly an artifact, not a biofact.

The '''Bunyamwera virus''' ('''BUNV''') is a [[Negative-sense ssRNA virus|negative-sense, single-stranded]] [[Viral envelope|enveloped]] [[RNA virus]]. It is the [[type species]] of the ''[[Orthobunyavirus]]'' [[genus]], in the ''[[Bunyavirales]]'' [[order (biology)|order]].

Bunyamwera virus can infect both humans and ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' (yellow fever mosquito).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/35304 | title=Bunyamwera virus (BUNV)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is named for Bunyamwera, a town in western [[Uganda]], where the type species was isolated in 1943. [[Reassortment|Reassortant]] viruses derived from Bunyamwera virus, such as ''Ngari virus'', which has been associated with large outbreaks of [[Viral hemorrhagic fever|viral haemorrhagic fever]] in [[Kenya]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ngari virus is a Bunyamwera virus reassortant that can be associated with large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in Africa|vauthors = Gerrard SR, Li L, Barrett AD, Nichol ST|date = 2004|journal = J Virol |doi = 10.1128/JVI.78.16.8922-8926.2004|pmid = 15280501|pmc = 479050|access-date =|volume=78|issue = 16|pages=8922–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genome sequence analysis of in vitro and in vivo phenotypes of Bunyamwera and Ngari virus isolates from northern Kenya|vauthors = Odhiambo C, Venter M, Limbaso K, Swanepoel R, Sang R|date = 2014|journal = PLOS ONE |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0105446|pmid = 25153316|access-date =|pmc=4143288|volume=9|issue = 8|pages=e105446|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9j5446O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briese|first1=T.|last2=Bird|first2=B.|last3=Kapoor|first3=V.|last4=Nichol|first4=S.

== Molecular biology ==
The genetic structure of ''Bunyamwera virus'' is typical for ''[[Bunyavirales]]'' viruses, which are a family of enveloped [[Negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus|negative-sense, single-stranded]] [[RNA]] viruses with a [[genome]] split into three parts—Small (S), Middle (M), and Large (L). The L RNA segment encodes an RNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] (L protein), the M RNA segment encodes two surface [[glycoprotein]]s (Gc and Gn) and a [[Viral nonstructural protein|nonstructural protein]] (NSm), while the S RNA segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N) and, in an alternative overlapping [[reading frame]], a second nonstructural protein (NSs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bunyaviridae: molecular and cellular biology|last=Plyusnin|first=Alexander|last2=Elliott|first2=Richard M|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn=9781904455905|location=Norfolk, UK|language=English|oclc = 711044654}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genomic RNA segments are encapsidated by copies of the N protein in the form of [[ribonucleoprotein]] (RNP) complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ariza|first=Antonio|last2=Tanner|first2=Sian J.|last3=Walter|first3=Cheryl T.|last4=Dent|first4=Kyle C.|last5=Shepherd|first5=Dale A.|last6=Wu|first6=Weining|last7=Matthews|first7=Susan V.|last8=Hiscox|first8=Julian A.|last9=Green|first9=Todd J.|date=2013-06-01|title=Nucleocapsid protein structures from orthobunyaviruses reveal insight into ribonucleoprotein architecture and RNA polymerization|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/41/11/5912/2411397/Nucleocapsid-protein-structures-from|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=41|issue=11|pages=5912–5926|doi=10.1093/nar/gkt268|issn=0305-1048|pmc=3675483|pmid=23595147|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The N protein is the most abundant protein in virus particles and infected cells and, therefore, the main target in many serological and molecular diagnostics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bilk|first=S.|last2=Schulze|first2=C.|last3=Fischer|first3=M.|last4=Beer|first4=M.|last5=Hlinak|first5=A.|last6=Hoffmann|first6=B.|date=2012-09-14|title=Organ distribution of Schmallenberg virus RNA in malformed newborns|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512002027|journal=Veterinary Microbiology|volume=159|issue=1–2|pages=236–238|doi=10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.03.035|pmid=22516190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bréard|first=Emmanuel|last2=Lara|first2=Estelle|last3=Comtet|first3=Loïc|last4=Viarouge|first4=Cyril|last5=Doceul|first5=Virginie|last6=Desprat|first6=Alexandra|last7=Vitour|first7=Damien|last8=Pozzi|first8=Nathalie|last9=Cay|first9=Ann Brigitte|date=2013-01-15|title=Validation of a Commercially Available Indirect Elisa Using a Nucleocapside Recombinant Protein for Detection of Schmallenberg Virus Antibodies|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e53446|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053446|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3546048|pmid=23335964|bibcode=2013PLoSO...853446B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], '''cell theory''' is the historic [[scientific theory]], now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells, also known as [[cell biology]]. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. However, many other scientists like [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from [[spontaneous generation]].

The three [[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]s to the cell theory are as described below:
# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.

The first of these tenets is disputed, as [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Luis P. (August 8, 2008) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-viruses-alive-2004/ Are Viruses Alive?] ''Scientific American''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microscopes==

[[File:Leeuwenhoek Microscope.png|thumb|Anton van Leeuwenhoek's microscope from the 17th century with a magnification of 300x.

[[File:Hooke-microscope.png|thumb|Robert Hooke's microscope]]
The discovery of the cell was made possible through the invention of the microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the [[glass]]. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D’Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscope]]s ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification.&lt;ref&gt;Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554&lt;/ref&gt; [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscope]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392&lt;/ref&gt; In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

Extensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His were a single lens simple microscope, rather than a [[compound microscope]]. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress for the microscopes until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"/&gt;

Optical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]]. Later in the 1920s, the [[electron microscope]] was developed, making it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again, changing the possibilities in science.&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt;

== Discovery of cells ==
[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|Drawing of the structure of [[Cork cambium|cork]] by [[Robert Hooke]] that appeared in ''[[Micrographia]]''.]]

The cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book [[Micrographia]]. In this book, he gave 60 ‘observations’ in detail of various objects under a coarse, compound microscope.&lt;ref name=Gest&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork. Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named "cells". This came from the Latin word Cella, meaning ‘a small room’ like monks lived in and also Cellulae, which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Inwood, Stephen |title=The man who knew too much: the strange and inventive life of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703 |publisher=Pan |location=London |year=2003 |page=72 |isbn=0-330-48829-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
What Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the "cellulae" were alive.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Becker, Wayne M. |author2=Kleinsmith, Lewis J. |author3=Hardin, Jeff |page=1|title=The World of the Cell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UA8OAAAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8053-4854-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cell observations gave no indication of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other [[organelle]]s found in most living cells. In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe “seeds” that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian theory]] still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] later discovers generation is achieved otherwise.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects almost 300-fold, or 270x.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"/&gt; Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to [[The Royal Society]] on October 9, 1676, he states that [[motility]] is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of [[microorganisms]]. Leeuwenhoek named these “animalcules,” which included [[protozoa]] and other unicellular organisms, like [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt; Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study "pepper water" in 1676. He also found for the first time the [[sperm cells]] of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

The cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.&lt;ref name="History of Biology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Richard|title=History of Biology: Cell Theory and Cell Structure|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Gr-Hi/History-of-Biology-Cell-Theory-and-Cell-Structure.html#b|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conclusion was not made until [[Henri Dutrochet]]. Besides stating “the cell is the fundamental element of organization”,&lt;ref&gt;Dutrochet, Henri (1824) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA166,M1 "Recherches anatomiques et physiologiques sur la structure intime des animaux et des vegetaux, et sur leur motilite, par M.H. Dutrochet, avec deux planches"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutrochet also claimed that cells were not just a structural unit, but also a physiological unit.

In 1804, [[Karl Rudolphi]] and [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link|J.H.F. Link]] were awarded the prize for "solving the problem of the nature of cells", meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent [[cell walls]] by the [[University of Göttingen|Königliche Societät der Wissenschaft]] (Royal Society of Science), Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathnat.uni-rostock.de/geschichte/kalenderblatt/kalenderblatt-dezember-2013/ Kalenderblatt Dezember 2013 – Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Fakultät – Universität Rostock]. Mathnat.uni-rostock.de (2013-11-28). Retrieved on 2015-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way.

[[File:PSM V22 D156 Matthias Jacob Schleiden.jpg|thumb|PSM V22 D156 Matthias Jacob Schleiden| [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] (1804–1881)]]
[[File:Schwann Theodore.jpg|thumb|Schwann Theodore| [[Theodor Schwann]] (1810–1882)]]
Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=L. W. |year=1921 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocy032473mbp |title=Introduction To Cytology |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory, he is not as credited for his attributions toward it. In 1839, Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schleiden, M. J. |year=1839|title= Beiträge zur Phytogenesis|journal=Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin|pages=137–176|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/49861#page/347/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not an original idea of Schleiden. He claimed this theory as his own, though [[Barthelemy Charles Joseph Dumortier|Barthelemy Dumortier]] had stated it years before him. This crystallization process is no longer accepted with [[#Modern interpretation|modern cell theory]]. In 1839, [[Theodor Schwann]] states that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schwann, T. |year=1839|title=Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen|publisher=Sander|place= Berlin|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/schwann_mikroskopische_1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;

1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells

2. The cell is the most basic unit of life

Schleiden's theory of free cell formation through crystallization was refuted in the 1850s by [[Robert Remak]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], and [[Albert Kolliker]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/8964| pmid = 10559875| year = 1999| last1 = Mazzarello| first1 = P.| journal = Nature Cell Biology| volume = 1| issue = 1| url = http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| pages = E13–5| title = A unifying concept: the history of cell theory| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603062810/http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| archivedate = 2015-06-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added the third tenet to cell theory. In Latin, this tenet states ''Omnis cellula e cellula''.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;  This translated to:

3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells

However, the idea that all cells come from pre-existing cells had in fact already been proposed by Robert Remak; it has been suggested that Virchow plagiarized Remak and did not give him credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silver|year=1987|title=Virchow, the heroic model in medicine: health policy by accolade|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=77|issue=1|pmid=3538915|pmc=1646803|doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.1.82|first1=GA|pages=82–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remak published observations in 1852 on cell division, claiming Schleiden and Schawnn were incorrect about generation schemes. He instead said that [[binary fission]], which was first introduced by Dumortier, was how reproduction of new animal cells were made. Once this tenet was added, the classical cell theory was complete.

== Modern interpretation ==
The generally accepted parts of modern cell theory include:

# All known living things are made up of one or more cells&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe&lt;/ref&gt;
# All living cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. 
# The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
# The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Energy flow ([[metabolism]] and [[biochemistry]]) occurs within cells.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;
# Cells contain [[DNA]] which is found specifically in the chromosome and [[RNA]] found in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
# All cells are basically the same in chemical composition in organisms of similar species.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Modern version ==
The modern version of the cell theory includes the ideas that:
*Energy flow occurs within cells.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biology.about.com/od/biologydictionary/g/celltheory.htm | title=The modern version of the Cell Theory | accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Heredity information ([[DNA]]) is passed on from cell to cell.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;
*All cells have the same basic chemical composition.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Opposing concepts in cell theory: history and background ==

The cell was  first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 using a microscope. The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].
The idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn’t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.

===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===

Two opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.
The [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33–59|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle &amp; Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.
Over the same time period, it was shown (Procter &amp; Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. [[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form—the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water—and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.
By the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks &amp; Brooks published a monograph, "The Permeability of Living Cells", which rejects the bulk phase theories.

===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===

With the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, [[Karl Lohmann]] discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.
The tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.
 
The modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.
These major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact—there are, however, a few dissenters.[citation needed]
===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===

In 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.

In 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.

Cells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:

# ''[[Prokaryote]]s'': Prokaryotes are relatively small cells surrounded by the plasma membrane, with a characteristic cell wall that may differ in composition depending on the particular organism.&lt;ref name=w11&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt; Prokaryotes lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they do have circular or linear [[DNA]]) and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (though they do contain [[ribosome]]s). The [[protoplasm]] of a prokaryote contains the chromosomal region that appears as [[fibrous]] deposits under the microscope, and the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref name=w11/&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] are the  two [[domain (biology)|domains]] of prokaryotes.
# ''[[Eukaryote]]s'': Eukaryotic cells are also surrounded by the plasma membrane, but  on the other hand, they  have distinct nuclei bound by a [[nuclear membrane]] or envelope. Eukaryotic cells also contain membrane-bound organelles, such as  ([[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[lysosomes]], rough and smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[vacuoles]]).&lt;ref name=w13&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they possess organized chromosomes which store genetic material.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a [[multicellular]] body (100–150 different cell types), compared
with 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protoctista.&lt;ref&gt;Margulis, L. &amp; Chapman, M.J. (2009). Kingdoms and Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth ([4th ed.]. ed.). Amsterdam: Academic Press/Elsevier. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles H. Holbrow''' (born September 23, 1935) is an American [[physicist]].

==Early life and education==
Charles Howard Holbrow was born in [[Melrose, Massachusetts]] to parents Frederick Holbrow and Florence Louisa (Gile) Holbrow.&lt;ref name=ww /&gt; His earliest memory of interest in physics dates from about age 13, when he saved the money he earned delivering newspapers to buy a book by [[Robert Andrews Millikan]], ''Electrons (+And -) Protons Photons Neutrons Mesotrons and Cosmic Rays''. "I read about two pages, and it made no sense to me whatsoever," he said. "But I still have the book, and now it makes lots of sense."&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

In 1951, at age 15, he enrolled at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] as a [[Ford Foundation]] Pre-Induction Fellow.&lt;ref name=waa /&gt; Despite his early interest and intention to major in physics, he found physics coursework so challenging that he changed his major and, in 1955, earned a BA in history instead, then pursued graduate study in history at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; In 1956, he married Mary Louise Ross, with whom he has five daughters: [[Gwendolyn Holbrow]], Elizabeth, Alice, Katherine and Martha.&lt;ref name=ww /&gt; In 1957, he earned a master's degree in history and Russian studies from Columbia with a master's essay titled ''Lenin's views of the United States''.&lt;ref name=master /&gt; Inspired by the [[Sputnik]] launch,&lt;ref name=dean /&gt; Holbrow then returned to study physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where his doctoral advisor was [[Henry H. Barschall]] ("Heinz" Barschall). Holbrow earned his MS in physics in 1960 and PhD in physics in 1963,&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt; with the dissertation ''Neutrons from protons on nickel, rhodium, tantalum, and gold''.&lt;ref name=dissert /&gt;

==Career==
After earning his doctorate, Holbrow taught for three years at [[Haverford College]] and two years at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], then served as assistant editor at [[Physics Today]].&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; In 1967, he became an associate professor of physics at [[Colgate University]], where he remained for 36 years until his retirement in 2003.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; In addition to teaching and research, Holbrow was instrumental in establishing first the Colgate Computer Center and later the Department of Computer Science.&lt;ref name=perspect /&gt; He became associate director of the Colgate Computer Center and then, in 1968, its director.&lt;ref name=perspect /&gt; He was promoted to full professor in 1975 and named [[Charles A. Dana (philanthropist)|Charles A. Dana]] Professor of Physics in 1986.&lt;ref name=okeefe /&gt; Holbrow also served as chairman of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, director of Institutional Research, and director of the Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt;

During his years at Colgate, Holbrow frequently joined other academic institutions temporarily as a visiting professor and researcher, including [[SUNY Stony Brook]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Cornell University]], [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], [[SRI International]], [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], [[University of Vienna]], and the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]].&lt;ref name=ww /&gt;&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt; He spent a sabbatical year in 1969-70 at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator]], and another at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1975-76, working in the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; During the summer of 1975, Holbrow was a [[NASA]]-ASEE Summer Faculty Fellow at Stanford University and [[Ames Research Center]], where he participated in a NASA project to develop colonies in space, culminating in the report Space Settlements: A Design Study,&lt;ref name=space /&gt; and featured in an article by [[Isaac Asimov]] in the July, 1976, issue of [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]].&lt;ref name=ia /&gt;

Throughout his physics career, Holbrow maintained his interest in reading and writing about history. His fascination and feeling of kinship with Danish-born Caltech physicist [[Charles Christian Lauritsen]] led to a biographical article, "Charles C. Lauritsen: A Reasonable Man in an Unreasonable World," in [[Physics in Perspective]].&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;&lt;ref name=ccl /&gt; During a second stay at Caltech, he wrote a short history of [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] and the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory titled "The giant cancer tube and the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory," published in [[Physics Today]].&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;&lt;ref name=kellogg /&gt;

In addition to physics and history, Holbrow is interested in physics pedagogy.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; In 1998, he and colleagues at Colgate published a new introductory physics textbook, ''Modern Introductory Physics'', which reversed the usual introductory physics sequence by presenting [[Special relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] before mechanics and electromagnetism.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; A second edition appeared in 2010. He has also served as president of the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]], and was awarded the 2012 [[Oersted Medal]] for his major contributions to physics education and research.&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt;

Since Holbrow's retirement from Colgate University in 2003, he has been a visiting professor of physics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he works on developing physics [[MOOC]]s,&lt;ref name=mooc /&gt; and a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]], where he won an award for excellence in teaching.&lt;ref name=okeefe/&gt;

==Research==
Holbrow's research has included studying the properties of unstable ytterbium atoms produced in a particle accelerator, and using lead ions with only one electron, which share traits with hydrogen, to study relativistic effects.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;

'''''Combinatio nova''''', [[abbreviated]] '''''comb. nov.''''' (sometimes '''''n. comb.'''''), is [[Latin]] for "new combination". It is used in [[life sciences]] literature when a new name is introduced based on a pre-existing name. The term should not to be confused with ''{{lang|la|[[species nova]]}}'', used for a previously unnamed species.

There are three situations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turland, N.|year=2013|volume=Regnum Vegetabile Volume 155|title=The Code Decoded: A user's guide to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books|isbn=978-3-87429-433-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[taxon]] is moved to a different genus
* an infraspecific taxon is moved to a different species
* the rank of the taxon is changed.

==Examples==
When an earlier named species is assigned to a different genus, the new genus name is combined with  of said species, e.g. when ''Calymmatobacterium granulomatis'' was renamed ''[[Klebsiella granulomatis]]'', it was referred to as ''Klebsiella granulomatis comb. nov.'' to denote it is a new combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Farrell N |title=Donovanosis |journal=Sex Transm Infect |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=452–7 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12473810 |pmc=1758360 |doi= 10.1136/sti.78.6.452|url=http://sti.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12473810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''D'Aveni's 7S framework''' is [[Richard D'Aveni]]'s approach to directing a firm in a high velocity or '''[[Hypercompetition|Hypercompetitive markets]]'''. it is designed to enable firms sustain the momentum of their competitiveness through a series of initiatives that are poised to give temporary advantages rather than just structuring the firm to achieve internal or external fit aimed at maintaining equilibrium that are designed to sustain unsustainable [[competitive advantage]]s. Based on factors such as:
# Stakeholder satisfaction.
# Strategic soothsaying.
# Positioning for speed.
# Positioning for surprise.
# Shifting the rule of the game.
# Signaling the strategic intent.
# Simultaneous and sequential strategic thrust.
All of these factors address the Four Arenas of Competition referred to in his book, [[Hypercompetition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1513">'''Daryabar Fossa''' is an east-west trending [[Trough (geology)|trough]] on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Daryabar Fossa was first seen in ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images, though a small section was see at much higher resolution by ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]''.  It is centered at 9.7° North [[Latitude]], 359.1° West [[Longitude]] and is approximately 201 kilometers long.  Based on limb profiles of ''Voyager 2'' images, Daryabar Fossa was determined to be a 400-meter deep and 4 kilometers wide (Kargel and Pozio 1996).  Daryabar Fossa runs perpendicular to the scarp [[Isbanir Fossa]] and is right-laterally offset 15–20&amp;nbsp;km by the scarp, suggesting [[Isbanir]] is a [[Geologic fault#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] or [[transform fault]] (Rothery 1999).

[[Daryabar]] Fossa is named for the land from which Princess Daryabar came in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. The word Daryabar is [[Persian language|Persian]] دریابار and means "Seaside".

==Effect==
When the [[mean free path]] of an atom is much smaller than the [[wavelength]] of the [[Atomic_spectral_line|radiative transition]], the atom changes [[velocity]] and direction many times during the [[emission spectrum|emission]] or [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of a [[photon]]. This causes an averaging over different Doppler states and results in an atomic linewidth that is narrower than the Doppler width.

In [[information theory]], the '''error exponent''' of a [[channel capacity|channel code]] or [[data compression|source code]] over the block length of the code is the logarithm of the error probability.  For example, if the probability of error of a [[Codec|decoder]] drops as ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''α&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the block length, the error exponent is α. Many of the [[information theory|information-theoretic]] theorems are of asymptotic nature, for example, the [[noisy channel coding theorem|channel coding theorem]] states that for any [[information theory#Rate|rate]] less than the channel capacity, the probability of the error of the channel code can be made to go to zero as the block length goes to infinity. In practical situations, there are limitations to the delay of the communication and the block length must be finite. Therefore, it is important to study how the probability of error drops as the block length go to infinity.

The [[noisy channel coding theorem|channel coding theorem]] states that for any ε &gt; 0 and for any [[information theory#Rate|rate]] less than the channel capacity, there is an encoding and decoding scheme that can be used to ensure that the probability of block error is less than ε &gt; 0 for sufficiently long message block ''X''. Also, for any [[information theory#Rate|rate]] greater than the channel capacity, the probability of block error at the receiver goes to one as the block length goes to infinity.

Assuming a channel coding setup as follows: the channel can transmit any of &lt;math&gt; M = 2^{nR} \;&lt;/math&gt; messages, by transmitting the corresponding codeword (which is of length ''n''). Each component in the codebook is drawn [[i.i.d.]] according to some probability distribution with [[probability mass function]] ''Q''. At the decoding end, maximum likelihood decoding is done.

Let &lt;math&gt;X_i^n&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th random codeword in the codebook, where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; goes from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose the first message is selected, so codeword &lt;math&gt;X_1^n&lt;/math&gt; is transmitted. Given that &lt;math&gt;y_1^n&lt;/math&gt; is received, the probability that the codeword is incorrectly detected as &lt;math&gt;X_2^n&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{error}\ 1\to 2} = \sum_{x_2^n} Q(x_2^n)1(p(y_1^n\mid x_2^n) &gt; p(y_1^n \mid x_1^n)).&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt; 1(p(y_1^n\mid x_2^n)&gt;p(y_1^n\mid x_1^n)) &lt;/math&gt; has upper bound

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{p(y_1^n\mid x_2^n)}{p(y_1^n\mid x_1^n)}\right)^s&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; s &gt; 0 \;&lt;/math&gt; Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{error}\ 1\to 2} \le \sum_{x_2^n} Q(x_2^n) \left(\frac{p(y_1^n\mid x_2^n)}{p(y_1^n\mid x_1^n)}\right)^s. &lt;/math&gt;

Since there are a total of ''M'' messages, and the entries in the codebook are i.i.d., the probability that &lt;math&gt;X_1^n&lt;/math&gt; is confused with any other message is &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; times the above expression. Using the Hokey union bound, the probability of confusing &lt;math&gt;X_1^n&lt;/math&gt; with any message is bounded by:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{error}\ 1\to \mathrm{any}} \le M^\rho \left( \sum_{x_1^n} Q(x_1^n) \left(\frac{p(y_1^n\mid x_2^n)}{p(y_1^n\mid x_1^n)}\right)^{s}\right)^{\rho} &lt;/math&gt;

for any &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\rho&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Averaging over all combinations of &lt;math&gt; x_1^n, y_1^n &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{error}\ 1\to \mathrm{any}} \le M^\rho \sum_{y_1^n} \left(\sum_{x_1^n} Q(x_1^n)[p(y_1^n\mid x_1^n)]^{1-s\rho} \right) \left(\sum_{x_1^n} Q(x_2^n)[p(y_1^n\mid x_2^n)]^s\right)^{\rho}.&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing &lt;math&gt;s = 1-s\rho&lt;/math&gt; and combining the two sums over &lt;math&gt;x_1^n &lt;/math&gt; in the above formula:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{error}\ 1\to\mathrm{any}} \le M^\rho \sum_{y_1^n} \left(\sum_{x_1^n} Q(x_1^n)[p(y_1^n\mid x_1^n)]^{\frac{1}{1+\rho}}\right)^{1+\rho}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the independence nature of the elements of the codeword, and the discrete memoryless nature of the channel:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{error}\ 1\to\mathrm{any}} \le M^\rho \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{y_i} \left(\sum_{x_i} Q_i(x_i)[p_i(y_i\mid x_i)]^{\frac{1}{1+\rho}}\right)^{1+\rho} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that each element of codeword is identically distributed and thus stationary:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{error}\ 1\to\mathrm{any}} \le M^\rho \left(\sum_y \left(\sum_x Q(x)[p(y\mid x)]^{\frac{1}{1+\rho}}\right)^{1+\rho}\right)^n. &lt;/math&gt;

Replacing ''M'' by 2&lt;sup&gt;''nR''&lt;/sup&gt; and defining

:&lt;math&gt;E_o(\rho,Q)= -\ln\left(\sum_{y} \left(\sum_{x} Q(x)[p(y\mid x)]^{1/(1+\rho)} \right)^{1+\rho}\right), &lt;/math&gt;

probability of error becomes

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{error} \le \exp(-n(E_o(\rho,Q) - \rho R)). &lt;/math&gt;

''Q'' and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; should be chosen so that the bound is tighest. Thus, the error exponent can be defined as

:&lt;math&gt; E_{r}(R) = \max_Q \max_{\rho \varepsilon [0,1]} E_{o}(\rho,Q) - \rho R. \;&lt;/math&gt;

== Error exponent in source coding ==

=== For time invariant discrete memoryless sources ===

The [[source coding]] theorem states that for any &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; and any discrete-time i.i.d. source such as &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; and for any [[information theory#Rate|rate]] less than the [[entropy]] of the source, there is large enough &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; and an encoder that takes &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; i.i.d. repetition of the source, &lt;math&gt; X^{1:n} &lt;/math&gt;, and maps it to &lt;math&gt; n.(H(X)+\varepsilon) &lt;/math&gt; binary bits such that the source symbols &lt;math&gt; X^{1:n} &lt;/math&gt; are recoverable from the binary bits with probability at least &lt;math&gt; 1 - \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt; M=e^{nR}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be the total number of possible messages. Next map each of the possible source output sequences to one of the messages randomly using a uniform distribution and independently from everything else. When a source is generated the corresponding message &lt;math&gt; M=m \, &lt;/math&gt; is then transmitted to the destination. The message gets decoded to one of the possible source strings. In order to minimize the probability of error the decoder will decode to the source sequence &lt;math&gt; X_1^n &lt;/math&gt; that maximizes &lt;math&gt; P(X_1^n\mid A_m) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; A_m\, &lt;/math&gt; denotes the event that message &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; was transmitted. This rule is equivalent to finding the source sequence &lt;math&gt; X_1^n &lt;/math&gt; among the set of source sequences that map to message &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; that maximizes &lt;math&gt; P(X_1^n) &lt;/math&gt;. This reduction follows from the fact that the messages were assigned randomly and independently of everything else.

Thus, as an example of when an error occurs, supposed that the source sequence &lt;math&gt;X_1^n(1)&lt;/math&gt; was mapped to message &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; as was the source sequence &lt;math&gt;X_1^n(2)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;X_1^n(1) \, &lt;/math&gt; was generated at the source, but &lt;math&gt;P(X_1^n(2)) &gt; P(X_1^n(1))&lt;/math&gt; then an error occurs.

Let &lt;math&gt; S_i \, &lt;/math&gt; denote the event that the source sequence &lt;math&gt; X_1^n(i) &lt;/math&gt; was generated at the source, so that &lt;math&gt; P(S_i) = P(X_1^n(i)) \,. &lt;/math&gt; Then the probability of error can be broken down as &lt;math&gt; P(E) = \sum_i P(E\mid S_i) P(S_i)\, . &lt;/math&gt; Thus, attention can be focused on finding an upper bound to the &lt;math&gt; P(E\mid S_i)\, &lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt; A_{i'} \, &lt;/math&gt; denote the event that the source sequence &lt;math&gt; X_1^n(i') &lt;/math&gt; was mapped to the same message as the source sequence &lt;math&gt; X_1^n(i) &lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt; P(X_1^n(i')) \geq P(X_1^n(i)) &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, letting &lt;math&gt; X_{i,i'}\, &lt;/math&gt; denote the event that the two source sequences &lt;math&gt; i \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i' \, &lt;/math&gt; map to the same message, we have that

:&lt;math&gt; P(A_{i'}) = P\left(X_{i,i'} \bigcap P(X_1^n(i')\right) \geq P(X_1^n(i)))\,&lt;/math&gt;

and using the fact that &lt;math&gt; P(X_{i,i'}) = \frac{1}{M}\, &lt;/math&gt; and is independent of everything else have that

:&lt;math&gt; P(A_{i'}) = \frac{1}{M} P(P(X_1^n(i')) \geq P(X_1^n(i)))\, . &lt;/math&gt;

A simple upper bound for the term on the left can be established as

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ P(P(X_1^n(i')) \geq P(X_1^n(i))) \right ] \leq \left ( \frac{P(X_1^n(i'))}{P(X_1^n(i))} \right ) ^s \, &lt;/math&gt;

for some arbitrary real number &lt;math&gt; s&gt;0 \,. &lt;/math&gt; This upper bound can be verified by noting that &lt;math&gt; P(P(X_1^n(i')) &gt; P(X_1^n(i))) \, &lt;/math&gt; either equals &lt;math&gt; 1 \, &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; 0 \, &lt;/math&gt; because the probabilities of a given input sequence are completely deterministic. Thus, if &lt;math&gt; P(X_1^n(i')) \geq P(X_1^n(i)) \, ,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \frac{P(X_1^n(i'))}{P(X_1^n(i))} \geq 1 \, &lt;/math&gt; so that the inequality holds in that case. The inequality holds in the other case as well because

:&lt;math&gt; \left ( \frac{P(X_1^n(i'))}{P(X_1^n(i))} \right ) ^s \geq 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all possible source strings. Thus, combining everything and introducing some &lt;math&gt; \rho \in [0,1] \, &lt;/math&gt;, have that

:&lt;math&gt; P(E\mid S_i) \leq P(\bigcup_{i \neq i'} A_{i'}) \leq \left ( \sum_{i \neq i'} P(A_{i'}) \right ) ^ \rho \leq \left ( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i \neq i'} \left ( \frac{P(X_1^n(i'))}{P(X_1^n(i))} \right ) ^s \right ) ^ \rho \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Where the inequalities follow from a variation on the Union Bound. Finally applying this upper bound to the summation for &lt;math&gt; P(E) \, &lt;/math&gt; have that:

:&lt;math&gt; P(E) = \sum_i P(E\mid S_i) P(S_i) \leq \sum_i P(X_1^n(i)) \left ( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i'} \left ( \frac{P(X_1^n(i'))}{P(X_1^n(i))} \right ) ^s \right ) ^ \rho \, . &lt;/math&gt;

Where the sum can now be taken over all &lt;math&gt; i' \, &lt;/math&gt; because that will only increase the bound. Ultimately yielding that

:&lt;math&gt; P(E) \leq \frac{1}{M^\rho} \sum_i P(X_1^n(i))^{1-s \rho} \left ( \sum_{i'} P(X_1^n(i'))^s \right ) ^\rho \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Now for simplicity let &lt;math&gt; 1-s \rho = s \, &lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt; s= \frac{1}{1+\rho} \, .&lt;/math&gt; Substituting this new value of &lt;math&gt; s \, &lt;/math&gt; into the above bound on the probability of error and using the fact that &lt;math&gt; i' \, &lt;/math&gt; is just a dummy variable in the sum gives the following as an upper bound on the probability of error:

:&lt;math&gt; P(E) \leq \frac{1}{M^\rho} \left ( \sum_i P(X_1^n(i))^{\frac{1}{1+ \rho}} \right ) ^ {1+ \rho}  \, .&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; M=e^{nR}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and each of the components of &lt;math&gt; X_1^n(i) \, &lt;/math&gt; are independent. Thus, simplifying the above equation yields

:&lt;math&gt; P(E) \leq \exp \left( -n \left[ \rho R - \ln \left( \sum_{x_i} P(x_i)^{\frac{1}{1+ \rho}} \right)(1+\rho) \right] \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The term in the exponent should be maximized over &lt;math&gt; \rho \, &lt;/math&gt; in order to achieve the tightest upper bound on the probability of error.

Letting &lt;math&gt; E_0( \rho) = \ln \left( \sum_{x_i} P(x_i)^{\frac{1}{1+ \rho}} \right)(1+\rho) \, ,&lt;/math&gt; see that the error exponent for the source coding case is:

:&lt;math&gt; E_r(R) = \max_{\rho \in [0,1]} \left[ \rho R - E_0(\rho) \right]. \, &lt;/math&gt;

'''Gravitational compression''' is a phenomenon in which [[gravity]], acting on the [[mass]] of an object, compresses it, reducing its size and increases the object's [[density]]. 
 
[[File:Stellar core.gif|thumb|In the [[Solar core|core]] of a star such as the [[Sun]], [[gravitational]] [[pressure]] is balanced by the outward thermal pressure from [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reactions]], temporarily halting gravitational compression.]]
At the center of a [[planet]] or [[star]], gravitational compression produces [[heat]] by the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]]. This is the mechanism that explains how [[Jupiter]] continues to [[radiation|radiate]] heat produced by its gravitational compression.&lt;ref name=SRI1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iki.rssi.ru/nineplanets/jupiter.html | title = Jupiter | publisher = Space Research Institute,Russian Academy of Sciences |accessdate = 2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common reference to gravitational compression is [[stellar evolution]]. The [[Sun]] and other [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars are produced by the initial [[gravitational collapse]] of a [[molecular cloud]]. Assuming the mass of the material is large enough, gravitational compression reduces the size of the core, increasing its [[temperature]] until [[hydrogen fusion]] can begin. This [[hydrogen]]-to-[[helium]] [[fusion reaction]] releases [[energy]] that balances the inward gravitational [[pressure]] and the star becomes stable for millions of years. No further gravitational compression occurs until the hydrogen is nearly used up, reducing the thermal pressure of the fusion reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/star_formation_010116.html | title = How a Star is Born: Clouds Lift on Missing Link  | date = 16 January 2001 | author = R.R. Britt | accessdate = 2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Sun's life, gravitational compression will turn it into a [[white dwarf]].&lt;ref&gt;

At the other end of the scale are [[Stellar evolution#Massive stars|massive stars]]. These stars burn their fuel very quickly, ending their lives as [[supernova]]e. After which further gravitational compression will produce either a [[neutron star]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the remnants.

For planets and [[natural satellite|moons]], equilibrium is reached when the [[compression (physical)|compression]] is balanced by a pressure gradient. This is due to gravity. This pressure gradient is in the opposite direction due to the strength of the material, at which point gravitational compression ceases.

'''Indian Public Health Association''' shortly '''IPHA''' is a professional [[health organization]] working for the cause of [[Public Health]] in India since 1956. It is registered under [[Societies Registration Act]] XXI of 1860.

The mission is to protect and promote the health of the people of India by facilitating the exchange of information, experience, and research, and advocating for policies, programs and practices that improve public health.

The Idea of establishing an association of Public Health was first mooted out at the [[All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health]], Calcutta, in 1935. The permission of Government was necessary to create such an association. Most of the health staff then was working under government or municipalities. Hence permission was denied until the Indian Independence. After 1948, Dr. Ganguly and Dr. S. C. Seal revived the movement. The Association was inaugurated on 29 September 1956 by Smt. [[Rajkumari Amrit Kaur]], the then Union Health Minister, [[Government of India]]. The Public Health personalities responsible for the success of the association were Dr. [[B. C. Roy]], Chief Minister of West Bengal, Lt. Col. C. K. Lakshmanan, Director of All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Dr. K. C. K. E. Raja, Director General of Health Services, Government of India, Dr. B. C. Dasgupta, Director of Health Services, West Bengal and Dr. T. Lakshminarayanan of Madras. The association has grown over the years and now has a strength of nearly 4,000 members. The body has 22 branches in India. In [[Chandigarh]], IPHA has celebrated [[World AIDS day|World's AIDS day]] 2014 in [[Tagore Theatre]], where they have invited Snehil Sharma's dance group Adi Shakti Nrityashala and other theater groups for the cultural show.

==Annual National Conference==
The association holds a National Conference for its members every year since 1956 in different regions of the country.
* The 43rd Annual Conference was held in 1999 with the theme "Environment and Health: Challenges for the Twenty-first Century."
* The 51st Annual Conference was held in 2007 at [[Calcutta]].
* The 52nd Annual Conference was held in 2008 at [[Maulana Azad Medical College]], [[New Delhi]].
* The 54th Annual Conference was held in 2010 at [[Andhra Medical College]], [[Visakhapatnam]].

==Indian Journal of Public Health==
Indian Journal of Public Health is their Official Publication. The Association started the Journal from the day of its birth in September 1956. Original articles, results of investigation and research, special articles, short communications, National Health Program reports, Reviews, Notes and News of the association are published in the journal. An annual prize in the memory of Late Dr. R. N. Roy, is given to the authors for the best article of the year. The journal is circulated to more than 4,500 members and 250 subscribers throughout the country and abroad.

The '''Intel ISEF Finalist Medal''' is given to about 1800 students from 75 countries each year, which are participating at the [[Intel International Science and Engineering Fair]], which is owned and administered by the [[Society for Science and the Public]], a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] based in Washington, DC.

==Finalist==

Each year about 7 million students participate in different regional, district and state ISEF affiliated fairs. Some of the winners of these affiliated fairs, which exist in over 75 countries, get the chance to take part at the Intel ISEF as a finalist, and each of them is awarded the Intel ISEF Finalist Medal. In 2013 there were 1611 finalists at the Intel ISEF in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

==Appearance==
The medal has a diameter of 48&amp;nbsp;mm and is golden galvanized. The obverse shows the official logo of the Intel ISEF, the reverse shows the year of participating and the location of that year's Intel ISEF.

The ribbon bar is blue with a width of 40mm and has a golden romanic 1 in the middle.

The '''''Journal of Social, Political, and Economic Studies''''' ({{ISSN|0278-839X}}) is a quarterly journal published by [[Scott-Townsend Publishers]], the publishing arm of the Council for Social and Economic Studies. It was founded in 1976 by anthropologist [[Roger Pearson (anthropologist)|Roger Pearson]], and was originally published by his [[Council for American Affairs]], an American representative in the [[World Anti Communist League]]. It is now published by the Council for Social and Economic Studies, of which Pearson was the president as of 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winston|first=Andrew S.|title=The Context of Correctness: A Comment on Rushton|journal=Journal of Social Distress and the Homeless|publisher=Human Sciences Press|volume= 5|issue= 2 |year=1996|pages=231–250|url=http://www.psychology.uoguelph.ca/faculty/winston/papers/rushton.html|accessdate=2008-12-10|doi=10.1007/BF02088001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBsHSzmkYHkC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=%22Journal+of+Social,+Political,+and+Economic+Studies%22+right-wing&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JWWlTtiHLaTa0QHQwr2RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Science and Politics of Racial ... - William H.

{{technical|date=June 2012}}
In [[petroleum engineering]], the '''Leverett ''J''-function''' is a dimensionless function of [[water saturation]] describing the [[capillary pressure]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|author=M.C. Leverett|title=Capillary behaviour in porous solids|journal=Transactions of the AIME|issue=142|pages=159–172|year=1941}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;J(S_w) = \frac{p_c(S_w) \sqrt{k/\phi}}{\gamma \cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the water saturation measured as a fraction, &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[capillary pressure]] (in [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]), &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] (measured in [[Square metre|m²]]), &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[porosity]] (0-1), &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface tension]] (in N/m) and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[contact angle]].  The function is important in that it is constant for a given saturation within a reservoir, thus relating reservoir properties for neighboring beds.

The Leverett ''J''-function is an attempt at extrapolating capillary pressure data for a given rock to rocks that are similar but with differing permeability, porosity and wetting properties. It assumes that the porous rock can be modelled as a bundle of non-connecting capillary tubes, where the factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{k/\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic length of the capillaries' radii.

This function is also widely used in modeling two-phase flow of [[Proton exchange membrane fuel cell|proton-exchange membrane fuel cells]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M. LaManna, J. V. Bothe Jr., F. Y. Zhang, and M. M. Mench, ''[[J. Power Sources]]'' '''271''', 180 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A large degree of hydration is needed for good proton conductivity while large liquid water saturation in pores of catalyst layer or diffusion media will impede gas transport in the cathode.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18572">This page contains a '''list of tripoints of English counties'''. A [[tripoint]] is the point at which three geographical regions meet.

==Ceremonial county tripoints==

The table contains a list of the 68 tripoints for the [[ceremonial counties of England]] as per the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]] as subsequently amended. Also included are the four points at which two counties meet the borders with [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. For each tripoint the counties are ordered with the first alphabetically given first, and the counties listed anti-clockwise around the point from there.

In addition as a result of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], between 1974 and 1996 the counties of [[Avon (county)|Avon]] and [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]] resulted in three further tripoints that are no longer in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/images/userImages/misc/outlinemaps/1995.gif|title=County boundary mapping from 1995|publisher=Ordnance Survey|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209044832/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/images/userImages/misc/outlinemaps/1995.gif|archivedate=2008-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic county tripoints==

The table contains a list of the 58 principal tripoints for the [[historic counties of England]] prior to 1800. &lt;ref&gt;''Ordnance Survey: First Edition'', 1806&lt;/ref&gt; As the English county boundaries had remained essentially unchanged since the eleventh century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Americana|author=Encyclopedia Americana Corp.|date=1918|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; the list can thus be seen to represent the "original" locations of the English county tripoints.

During the nineteenth century a number of laws, most notably the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties Act of 1844]], resulted in the relocation of some sections of historic boundaries, principally to remove detached portions of counties. With the notable exception of the creation of the metropolitan counties in 1974, the majority of the boundaries have remained unchanged since then. For comparison the locations of the tripoints in 1890 are also listed in the table, by which time the majority of the localised changes had been made. The handful of additional tripoints that were formed by detached parts of counties are not listed in the table (e.g. Devon(detached)-Dorset-Somerset, Staffordshire-Shropshire(detached)-Worcestershire(detached)).

The symbol (†) indicates that the original point still exists unchanged as a tripoint of the current ceremonial counties. (Many of the other points still exist as the meeting of three administrative districts.) For each tripoint the counties are ordered with the first alphabetically given first, and the counties listed anti-clockwise around the point from there.

'''Marcey Lynn Waters''' is a chemical biologist and Vice Chair for Education at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]]. She studies [[peptide]] folding and supramolecular systems of biomolecules. Waters has received multiple awards, distinguished professorships, fellowships, and serves as the 2018 President of the American Peptide Society.

== Education ==
Waters graduated from the [[University of California, San Diego]] with a degree in chemistry. While an undergraduate, she worked with Prof. Charles L. Perrin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alumni.ucsd.edu/s/1170/index.aspx?sid=1170&amp;gid=1&amp;sitebuilder=1&amp;pgid=4288&amp;content_id=6379|title=Charles Perrin Symposium|website=www.alumni.ucsd.edu|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 1H NMR spectroscopy of organic molecules. Waters entered the [[University of Chicago]] for her doctoral degree in chemistry, working with Prof. [[William Wulff|William D. Wulff]] on the physical chemistry of [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] alkyne systems, yielding [[Transition metal carbene complex|Fischer carbene complexes.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waters |first1=Marcey L. |last2=Bos |first2=Mary E. |last3=Wulff |first3=William |title=Mechanistic Studies on the Reaction of Fischer Carbene Complex with Alkynes: Does the Alkyne Insertion Intermediate Form Irreversibly? |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=July 1999 |volume=121 |issue=27 |pages=6403–6413 |doi=10.1021/ja983101u }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism for the [[Wulff–Dötz reaction|Wulff-Dotz benzannulation reaction]] is still under discussion.

'''Michael James "Mike" Adams''' (May 5, 1930 – November 15, 1967), ([[Major (United States)|Maj]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]]), was an American [[Pilot (aeronautics)|aviator]], [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]], and USAF [[astronaut]].&lt;ref name="Evans2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michelle Evans|title=The X-15 Rocket Plane: Flying the First Wings Into Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jW8pDwAAQBAJ|date=June 2013|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-2840-5|page=362–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first American [[List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents#Astronaut fatalities|space mission fatality]], according to [[Kármán line#Alternatives to the definition|the United States definition]].

==Background==
===Early life and military experience===
Adams was born May 5, 1930, in [[Sacramento, California]]. He graduated from [[Sacramento Junior College]]. He enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] in 1950, and earned his [[United States Aviator Badge|pilot wings]] and commission in 1952 at [[Webb Air Force Base]], [[Texas]]. He served as a [[fighter-bomber]] pilot during the [[Korean War]], where he flew 49 [[Aerial warfare|combat missions]]. This was followed by 30 months with the [[613th Tactical Fighter Squadron|613th Fighter-Bomber Squadron]] at [[England Air Force Base]], [[Louisiana]], and six months rotational duty at [[Quartier Général d'Aboville|Chaumont Air Base]] in France.

===Education and flight experience===
In 1958, Adams received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aerospace engineering|Aeronautical Engineering]] from the [[University of Oklahoma]] and, after 18 months of [[astronautics]] study at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], was selected in 1962 for the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]]. Here, he won the A.B. Honts Trophy as the best scholar and pilot in his class. Adams subsequently attended the [[Aerospace Research Pilot School]] (ARPS), graduating with honors in December 1963. He was one of four Edwards aerospace research pilots to participate in a five-month series of [[NASA]] [[Moon landing]] practice tests at the [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin Company]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. In November 1965 he was selected to be an astronaut in the [[United States Air Force]] [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program.  In July 1966, [[Major (United States)|Major]] Adams came to the [[North American X-15]] program, a joint USAF/NASA project. He made his first X-15 flight on 6 October 1966.

===Death===
[[File:Michael Adams X-15 crash site.jpg|thumb|Firefighters survey the wreckage of Adams' X-15]]
Adams' seventh X-15 flight, [[X-15 Flight 3-65-97|Flight 3-65-97]], took place on 15 November 1967.&lt;ref name="Thompson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton O. Thompson|title=At the Edge of Space: The X-15 Flight Program|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKZqBgAAQBAJ|date=6 August 2013|publisher=Smithsonian|isbn=978-1-58834-386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JenkinsDana2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dennis R. Jenkins|author2=William H. Dana|title=X-15: Extending the Frontiers of Flight|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGa2MAEACAAJ|date=8 December 2010|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1-4700-2585-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached a peak altitude of {{convert|266000|ft|km}}; the nose of the aircraft was off heading by 15 degrees to the right. While descending, at {{convert|230000|ft|km}} the aircraft encountered rapidly increasing [[Max Q|aerodynamic pressure]] which impinged on the airframe, causing the X-15 to enter a violent [[Mach number|Mach 5]] spin. As the X-15 neared {{convert|65000|ft|km}}, it was diving at Mach 3.93 and experiencing more than 15 ''[[g-force|g]]'' vertically (positive and negative), and 8 g laterally, which inevitably exceeded the design limits of the aircraft. The aircraft broke up 10 minutes and 35 seconds after launch, killing Adams. The United States Air Force posthumously awarded him [[Astronaut badge#U.S. Air Force astronauts|Astronaut Wings]] for his last flight.

An excerpt from NASA's biography page on Mike Adams discusses findings from the crash investigation:

:Ground parties scoured the countryside looking for wreckage; critical to the investigation was the film from the cockpit camera. The weekend after the accident, an unofficial FRC search party found the camera; disappointingly, the film cartridge was nowhere in sight. Engineers theorized that the film cassette, being lighter than the camera, might be further away, blown north by winds at altitude. FRC engineer Victor Horton organized a search and on 29 November, during the first pass over the area, Willard E. Dives found the cassette. Most puzzling was Adams' complete lack of awareness of major heading deviations in spite of accurately functioning cockpit instrumentation. The accident board concluded that he had allowed the aircraft to deviate as the result of a combination of distraction, misinterpretation of his instrumentation display, and possible vertigo. The electrical disturbance early in the flight degraded the overall effectiveness of the aircraft's control system and further added to pilot workload. The MH-96 adaptive control system then caused the airplane to break up during reentry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/x15/adams.html|title=X-15 – Biography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
During his military career he was awarded: 
*[[Astronaut badge#U.S. Air Force astronauts|Astronaut Wings]], posthumously
*[[Air Medal]]
*[[Commendation Medal#Air Force|Air Force Commendation Medal]]
*[[Korean Service Medal]]
*[[United Nations Korea Medal|United Nations Service Medal for Korea]]
*[[National Defense Service Medal]] with 1 [[Service star|Bronze Service Star]]
*[[Air Force Longevity Service Award]] with 4 [[Oak leaf cluster|cluster]]s
*[[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Air Force Good Conduct Medal]]
*A.B. Honts Trophy

==Adams remembered==
In 1991, Adams' name was added to the [[Space Mirror Memorial]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Florida]].

On June 8, 2004, a memorial monument to Adams was erected near the crash site, northwest of [[Randsburg, California]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4521">[[Image:Minicircles.png|thumb|right|Minicircle preparation from a parental plasmid. The parental plasmid contains two recombinase target sites (black half arrows). Recombination between these sites generates the desired minicircle (bottom right) together with the  miniplasmid (bottom left). The hook on the red minicircle-insert stands for a scaffold-matrix attachment region ([[S/MAR | S/MAR-Element]]), which allows for autonomous replication in the recipient cell.]]

'''Minicircles''' are small (~4kb) circular [[plasmid]] derivatives that have been freed from all [[prokaryotic]] [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] parts. They have been applied as [[transgene]] carriers for the [[genetic modification]] of mammalian cells, with the advantage that, since they contain no bacterial [[DNA]] sequences, they are less likely to be perceived as foreign and destroyed. (Typical transgene delivery methods involve plasmids, which contain foreign DNA.) The smaller size of minicircles also extends their [[cloning]] capacity and facilitates their delivery into cells.

Their preparation usually follows a two-step procedure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehlsen|first=K., Broll S., Bode, J. |year=2006 |title=Replicating minicircles: Generation of nonviral episomes for the efficient modification of dividing cells| journal=Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. | volume=10|pages= 233–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=M.A., He, C.-Y, Chen, Z.-H.|year=2010 |title=A robust system for production of minicircle DNA vectors| journal=Nature Biotechnology | volume=28|pages= 1287–1289|doi=10.1038/nbt.1708|pmid=21102455|pmc=4144359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* production of a 'parental plasmid' (bacterial plasmid with [[eukaryotic]] inserts) in ''[[E. coli]]''
* induction of a [[site-specific recombinase technology|site-specific recombinase]] at the end of this process but still in bacteria. These steps are followed by the
** excision of prokaryotic vector parts via two [[recombinase]]-target sequences at both ends of the insert
** recovery of the resulting minicircle (vehicle for the highly efficient modification of the recipient cell) and the miniplasmid by [[Capillary electrophoresis|capillary gel electrophoresis]] (CGE)

The purified minicircle can be transferred into the recipient cell by [[transfection]] or [[lipofection]] and into a differentiated tissue by, for instance, [[Jet injector|jet injection]].

Conventional minicircles lack an [[origin of replication]], so they do not replicate within the target cells and the encoded genes will disappear as the cell divides (which can be either an advantage or disadvantage depending on whether the application demands persistent or transient expression). A novel addition to the field are nonviral '''[[self-replicating]]''' minicircles, which owe this property to the presence of a [[S/MAR|S/MAR-Element]]. Self-replicating minicircles hold great promise for the systematic modification of stem cells and will significantly extend the potential of their plasmidal precursor forms ("parental plasmids"), the more as the principal feasibility of such an approach has amply been demonstrated for their plasmidal precursor forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broll|first=S., Oumard A., Hahn K., Schambach A, Bode, J. .|year=2010 |title=Minicircle Performance Depending on S/MAR-Nuclear Matrix Interactions| journal=J.

Scientists miscalculated and the 15&amp;nbsp;[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] (Mt) nuclear explosion far exceeded the expected yield of 4 to 8&amp;nbsp;Mt (6&amp;nbsp;Mt predicted),&lt;ref name="nuclearweaponarchive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Castle.html|title=Operation Castle|date=17 May 2006|accessdate=Oct 8, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927145851/http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Castle.html|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was about 1,000 times more powerful than each of the atomic bombs [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/02/27/castle-bravo-the-largest-u-s-nuclear-explosion/|title=Castle Bravo: The Largest U.S. Nuclear Explosion|first=Ariana|last=Rowberry|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220130743/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/02/27/castle-bravo-the-largest-u-s-nuclear-explosion/|archivedate=2016-12-20|df=|date=2001-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientists and military authorities were shocked by the size of the explosion and many of the instruments they had put in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the device were destroyed.&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt;

The military authorities and scientists had promised the Bikini Atoll's native residents that they would be able to return home after the nuclear tests. A majority of the island's family heads agreed to leave the [[Bikini Atoll|island]], and most of the residents were moved to the [[Rongerik Atoll]] and later to [[Kili Island]]. Both locations proved unsuitable to sustaining life, resulting in starvation and requiring the residents to receive ongoing aid.

Despite the promises made by authorities, this and further nuclear tests ([[Operation Redwing|Redwing]] in 1956 and [[Operation Hardtack I|Hardtack]] in 1958) rendered Bikini unfit for habitation, contaminating the soil and water, making [[subsistence farming]] and [[fishing]] too dangerous. The United States later paid the islanders and their descendants $125 million in compensation for damage caused by the nuclear testing program and their displacement from their home island.&lt;ref name="nuclearclaimstribunal.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nuclearclaimstribunal.com/ | title = Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal |accessdate=22 July 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070613031306/http://www.nuclearclaimstribunal.com/| archivedate= 13 June 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, it may be technically possible for the former residents and their descendants to live on the atoll's islands, but virtually none of those alive today have ever lived on the atoll and very few want to move there.

In February 1946, the United States government asked the 167 [[Micronesia]]n inhabitants of the atoll to "temporarily" relocate, so the United States government could begin testing atomic bombs for "the good of mankind and to end all world wars."&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt; After "confused and sorrowful deliberation" among the Bikinians, their leader, King Juda, agreed to the U.S. relocation request, announcing "We will go believing that everything is in the hands of God."&lt;ref name="Niedenthal"/&gt; Nine of the eleven family heads, or ''alaps'', chose Rongerik as their new home.&lt;ref name=crossroads&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/operationcrossro00unit |title=Operation Crossroads - The Official Pictorial Record |year=1946 |publisher=W.

On March 7, 1946, the residents gathered their personal belongings and saved building supplies. They were transported {{cvt|125|mi|km}} eastward on U.S. Navy [[Landing Ship, Tank|landing craft]] 1108 and LST 861 to the uninhabited [[Rongerik Atoll]],&lt;ref name=crossroads/&gt; which was one-sixth the size of Bikini Atoll.&lt;ref name=crossroads/&gt; No one lived on Rongerik because it had an inadequate water and food supply and due to deep-rooted traditional beliefs that the island was haunted by the ''Demon Girls of Ujae''.

To conduct the tests, the [[United States]] assembled a support fleet of more than 242 ships that provided quarters, experimental stations, and workshops for more than 42,000 personnel.

=== Operation Crossroads===
[[File:Crossroads baker explosion.jpg|thumb|The [[Wilson cloud]] from test Baker, situated just offshore from Bikini Island at top of the picture. ]]
{{main|Operation Crossroads}}
Crossroads consisted of two detonations, each with a yield of {{cvt|23|ktonTNT|lk=on}}. Able was detonated over Bikini on July 1, 1946 and exploded at an altitude of {{cvt|520|ft|m}} but was dropped by aircraft about {{cvt|1500|to|2000|ft|m}} off target.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; It sank only five of the ships in the lagoon. The second, Baker, was detonated underwater at a depth of {{cvt|90|ft|m}} on July 25, sinking eight ships.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; The second underwater blast created a large condensation cloud and contaminated the ships with more [[radioactive contamination|radioactive]] water than was expected. Many of the surviving ships were too contaminated to be used again for testing and were sunk. The air-borne nuclear detonation raised the surface seawater temperature by {{cvt|55000|°C|°F}}, created blast waves with speeds of up to {{cvt|8|m/s|ft/s}}, and shock and surface waves up to {{cvt|30|m|ft}} high. Blast columns reached the floor of the lagoon which is approximately {{cvt|70|m|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name=richards/&gt; The Bikini Island King visited Bikini Atoll in July after the second atomic bomb test code-named Baker and found it apparently in good condition.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

A third burst, ''Charlie'', planned for 1947, was canceled primarily because of the [[United States Navy]]'s inability to decontaminate the [[target ship]]s after the ''Baker'' test. ''Charlie'' was rescheduled as [[Operation Wigwam]], a deep water shot conducted in 1955 off the California coast.

=== Castle Bravo test ===
{{main|Castle Bravo}}

The United States was in a [[Cold War]] [[Nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]] to build bigger and better bombs.&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt; The next series of tests over Bikini Atoll was [[code name]]d [[Operation Castle]]. The first test of that series was [[Castle Bravo]], a new design utilizing a dry fuel [[Nuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] [[hydrogen bomb]]. It was detonated at dawn on March 1, 1954.

The 15&amp;nbsp;[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] (Mt) nuclear explosion far exceeded the expected yield of 4 to 8&amp;nbsp;Mt (6&amp;nbsp;Mt predicted),&lt;ref name="nuclearweaponarchive.org" /&gt; and was about 1,000 times more powerful than each of the atomic bombs [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]]. The [[nuclear weapon]] was the most powerful device ever detonated by the United States (and just under one-third the energy of the [[Tsar Bomba]], the largest ever tested). The scientists and military authorities were shocked by the size of the explosion and many of the instruments they had put in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the device were destroyed.&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt;

=== Castle Bravo contamination ===

The unexpectedly large yield, combined with other factors, led to the most significant accidental [[radioactive contamination|radiological contamination]] caused by the United States. A few minutes after the detonation, [[Nuclear fallout|blast debris]] began to fall on Eneu/Enyu Island on Bikini Atoll where the U.S crew that triggered the device were located. When their [[geiger counter]]s detected the unexpected fallout, they were forced to [[shelter in place]] indoors for a number of hours before it was safe enough for an [[airlift]] rescue operation to be carried out.&lt;ref name="Dr. John C. Clark as told to Robert Cahn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicbomb.com/content/atomic/docs/trapped_by_radioactive_fallout.pdf|author= John C. Clark as told to Robert Cahn|title= Trapped by Radioactive Fallout, ''Saturday Evening Post''|date= July 1957}} accessed Feb 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

After impacting Eneu, the fallout continued to spread across the inhabited islands of the [[Rongelap Atoll|Rongelap]], [[Rongerik Atoll|Rongerik]], and Utrik Atolls. The inhabitants of Rongelap and Rongerik Atolls were evacuated by US servicemen two days after the detonation, but the residents of the more distant Utrik Atoll weren't evacuated for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2009/06/22/les-cobayes-du-dr-folamour_1209927_3244.html |title=Les cobayes du Dr Folamour|language=French|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|date=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuclear Issues"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rmiembassyus.org/Nuclear%20Issues.htm| title=Nuclear Issues| accessdate=2006-03-26| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424042410/http://www.rmiembassyus.org/Nuclear%20Issues.htm| archivedate=2016-04-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the inhabitants soon began to show symptoms of [[acute radiation syndrome]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The fallout gradually dispersed around the globe, depositing traces of radioactive material in Australia, India and Japan, and parts of the United States and Europe. Though organized as a secret test, Castle Bravo quickly became an international incident, prompting calls for a ban on the atmospheric testing of thermonuclear devices.&lt;ref name="DeGroot 2004, pp. 196-198"/&gt;

=== Local populations affected ===

The [[Rongelap Atoll]] was coated with up to {{cvt|2|cm|in}} of snow-like irradiated calcium debris and ash over the entire island. Virtually all the inhabitants experienced severe radiation sickness, including itchiness, sore skin, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. Their symptoms also included burning eyes and swelling of the neck, arms, and legs.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;&lt;ref name=gid&gt;{{cite book|first1=Isobelle |last1=Gidley |first2=Richard |last2=Shears |year=1986 |title=The Rainbow Warrior Affair |publisher=Unwin |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants were forced to abandon the islands, leaving all their belongings, three days after the test.

Six days after the Castle Bravo test, the U.S government set up a secret [[Project 4.1|project]] to study the medical effects of the weapon on the residents of the [[Marshall Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=James Reeves to Frank D.

The United States was subsequently accused of using the inhabitants as medical research subjects, without obtaining their consent, to study the effects of nuclear exposure.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/about/history/mejato/ |title=The evacuation of Rongelap |accessdate=21 September 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916100156/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/about/history/mejato/ |archivedate=16 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time, the United States [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] had given little thought to the potential impact of widespread fallout contamination and health and ecological impacts beyond the formally designated boundary of the test site.

=== Japanese fishermen contaminated ===
{{main|Daigo Fukuryū Maru}}
[[File:The head of the crew of Daigo Fukuryu-maru.JPG|thumb|The head of one of the crew members of [[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]], showing radiation burns caused by fallout that collected in his hair. Dated on 7 April 1954, 38 days after the nuclear test.]]
Ninety minutes after the detonation, 23 crew members of the Japanese fishing boat the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]]'' ("Lucky Dragon No. 5")&lt;ref name=brit&gt;Lorna Arnold and Mark Smith. (2006). [[Britain, Australia and the Bomb]], Palgrave Press, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; also were contaminated by the snow-like irradiated debris and ash. They had no idea what the explosion they'd seen meant nor any inkling of the nature of the deadly debris that rained down on them like snow. But they all soon became ill with the effects of acute [[radiation sickness|radiation poisoning]]. One fisherman died almost a half year later while under doctor supervision in late September, with his cause of death regarded to have been due to underlying [[liver cirrhosis]] compounded by an [[hepatitis C|infection]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rhodes|Rhodes, Richard]] (1995). Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-684-80400-X}}. pg 542&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2014}} The majority of medical experts believe that the crew members were infected with [[hepatitis C]] through [[blood transfusions]] during part of their [[Acute radiation syndrome]] treatment.&lt;ref name="mainichi.jp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/perspectives/news/20140517p2a00m0na005000c.html |title=As I See It: Gov't must delve deeper into radiation exposure from Bikini Atoll incident|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524051201/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/perspectives/news/20140517p2a00m0na005000c.html|archive-date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Teller]], one of the driving minds behind the development of the hydrogen bomb, and architect of the Marshall Island tests, upon learning of the death of the fisherman through the mass media which painted his death as an [[anti-nuclear]] [[casus belli]], commented, "It's unreasonable to make such a big deal over the death of a fisherman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Michael|title=Forgotten atrocity of the atomic age|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2011/08/28/culture/forgotten-atrocity-of-the-atomic-age/|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=8 August 2013|date=8 August 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113192759/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2011/08/28/culture/forgotten-atrocity-of-the-atomic-age/|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later tests ===
{{Main|Operation Redwing|Operation Hardtack I}}

The seventeen-shot [[Operation Redwing|Redwing]] series followed—eleven tests at [[Enewetak Atoll]] and six at Bikini. The island residents who had been promised they would be able to return home to Bikini was thwarted indefinitely by the U.S. decision to resume nuclear testing at Bikini in 1954. During 1954, 1956, and 1958, twenty-one more nuclear bombs were detonated at Bikini, yielding a total of {{cvt|75|MtonTNT|lk=on}}, equivalent to more than three thousand ''Baker'' bombs. Only one was an air burst, the 3.8&amp;nbsp;Mt [[Operation Redwing|Redwing ''Cherokee'']] test. Air bursts distribute fallout in a large area, but surface bursts produce intense local fallout.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=154, Vol VII, Table A-1}} These tests were followed by the 33-shot [[Operation Hardtack I|Hardtack]] tests which began in late April 1958.&lt;ref name="kattenburg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kattenburg|first=David|title=Stranded on Bikini|url=http://www.greenplanetmonitor.net/news/2010/12/stranded-on-bikini/|publisher=Green Planet Monitor|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830013643/http://www.greenplanetmonitor.net/news/2010/12/stranded-on-bikini/|archivedate=30 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of ten tests were detonated on Bikini Atoll on 22 July 1958.&lt;ref name=kattenburg/&gt;

== Relocation issues ==

=== Strategic Trust Territory ===

{{main|Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands}}
In 1947, the United States convinced the United Nations to designate the islands of Micronesia a United Nations [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands|Strategic Trust Territory]]. This was the only trust ever granted by the U.N.&lt;ref name="kattenburg"/&gt; The [[United States Navy]] controlled the Trust from a headquarters in [[Guam]] until 1951, when the [[United States Department of the Interior]] took over control, administering the territory from a base in [[Saipan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/ttp/ttpi.html | title=Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands | publisher=University of Hawaii | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130101809/http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/ttp/ttpi.html | archivedate=2016-01-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive to which the United States agreed stipulated that it would "promote the economic advancement and self-sufficiency of the inhabitants, and to this end shall... protect the inhabitants against the loss of their lands and resources..."&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt;

Despite the promise to "protect the inhabitants," from July 1946 through July 1947 the residents of Bikini Atoll were left alone on Rongerik Atoll. In January 1948, Dr. [[Leonard E. Mason]], an anthropologist from the University of Hawaii, visited the temporary home of the relocated islanders on Rongerik Atoll and was horrified when he found the people were starving.&lt;ref name="guyer"/&gt; A team of U.S. investigators concluded in late 1947 that the islanders must be moved immediately. Press from around the world harshly criticized the U.S. Navy for ignoring the people. [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]], a syndicated columnist, wrote "The natives are actually and literally starving to death."&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt;

The Navy then selected [[Ujelang Atoll]] for their temporary home and some young men from the Bikini Atoll population went ahead to begin constructing living accommodations. But U.S. Trust Authorities changed their mind. They decided to use [[Enewetak Atoll]] as a second nuclear weapons test site and relocated that atoll's residents to Ujelang Atoll instead and to the homes built for the Bikini Islanders.&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt;

In March 1948, 184 malnourished Bikini islanders were temporarily relocated again to [[Kwajalein Atoll]].&lt;ref name=kattenburg/&gt; In June 1948 the Bikini residents chose [[Kili Island]] as a long-term home.&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt; The small, {{convert|200|acre}} ({{convert|.036|sqmi}}) island, one of the smallest islands in the Marshall Island chain, was uninhabited and wasn't ruled by a paramount ''iroij'', or king. In November 1948, the residents, now totaling 184 individuals, moved there.&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt; Living on Kili Island effectively destroyed their culture that had been based on fishing and island-hopping canoe voyages to various islets around the Bikini Atoll.&lt;ref name=guyer/&gt; Kili does not provide enough food for the transplanted residents.

=== Return to Bikini Island ===

In June 1968, based on scientific advice that the radiation levels were sufficiently reduced, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] promised the 540 Bikini Atoll families living on Kili and other islands that they would be able to return to their home. But the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] learned that the [[coconut crab]]s, an essential food source, retained high levels of radioactivity and could not be eaten. The Bikini Council voted to delay a return the island as a result.&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt;

In 1987, a few Bikini elders returned to the island to reestablish old property lines. Construction crews began building a hotel on Bikini, and installed generators, desalinators, and power lines. A packed coral and sand runway still exists on Enyu Island. Three extended families, eventually totaling about 100 people, moved back to their home island in 1972 despite the risk. But 10 years later a team of French scientists found some wells were too radioactive for use and determined that the pandanus and breadfruit were also dangerous for human consumption. Women were experiencing [[miscarriage]]s, [[stillbirth]]s, and genetic abnormalities in their children.&lt;ref name="bik12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/558769/Survivors-of-nuke-testing-seek-justice.html?nav=10 |title=Survivors of nuke testing seek justice: Marshall Islanders on Maui rally to share nation's story |author=Chris Hamilton |date=March 4, 2012 |work=Maui News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523212532/http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/558769/Survivors-of-nuke-testing-seek-justice.html?nav=10 |archivedate=May 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ratical.org/radiation/NAvictims.html | title = Victims of the Nuclear Age |accessdate=22 July 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070809213904/http://www.ratical.org/radiation/NAvictims.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S.-administered [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands|Strategic Trust Territory]] decided that the islanders had to be evacuated from the atoll a second time.&lt;ref name="ghostfleet"/&gt;

=== Second evacuation ===

Following their evacuation from the island, an 11-year-old boy, born on Bikini in 1971, died from cancer that was linked to radiation exposure he received while living on Bikini. The records obtained by the Marshallese [[Nuclear Claims Tribunal]] later revealed that Dr. Robert Conard, head of [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]'s medical team in the Marshall Islands, understated the risk of returning to the atoll.&lt;ref name=maier&gt;{{cite news|last=Maier|first=Thomas|title=Brookhaven team minimized risks in return to Bikini|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/brookhaven-team-minimized-risks-in-return-to-bikini-1.1385267?print=true|accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=Newsday|date=21 August 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118161707/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/brookhaven-team-minimized-risks-in-return-to-bikini-1.1385267?print=true|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Konrad Kotrady was contracted by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to treat the Marshall Island residents. In 1977, he wrote a 14-page report to BNL that raised serious questions about the residents' return to Bikini and questioned the accuracy of Brookhaven's prior work on the islands.&lt;ref name=maier/&gt; After they were promised their home was safe, and then being removed after this was found to be wrong, the Bikini Atoll islanders grew to distrust the official reports of the U.S. scientists.&lt;ref name=maier/&gt;

The special [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) Bikini Advisory Group determined in 1997 that "It is safe to walk on all of the islands ... although the residual radioactivity on islands in Bikini Atoll is still higher than on other atolls in the Marshall Islands, it is not hazardous to health at the levels measured ... The main radiation risk would be from the food: eating locally grown produce, such as fruit, could add significant radioactivity to the body...Eating [[coconut]]s or [[breadfruit]] from Bikini Island occasionally would be no cause for concern. Eating many over a long period of time without having taken remedial measures, however, might result in radiation doses higher than internationally agreed safety levels." IAEA estimated that living in the atoll and consuming local food would result in an effective dose of about 15 [[Sievert|mSv]]/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-ns.iaea.org/appraisals/bikini-atoll.htm |title=IAEA Bikini Advisory Group Report |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130120204/http://www-ns.iaea.org/appraisals/bikini-atoll.htm/ |archivedate=2016-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the aborted resettlement in 1978, the leaders of the Bikini community have insisted since the early 1980s that the top {{convert|15|in|cm}} of soil be excavated from the entire island. Scientists reply that while removing the soil would rid the island of [[cesium-137]], it would also severely damage the environment, turning the atoll into a virtual wasteland of windswept sand. The Bikini Council has repeatedly contended that removing the topsoil is the only way to guarantee future generations safe living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Steve|title=Researchers explore ways to rid islands of lingering radiation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19880522&amp;id=oNMzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cuYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6693,5428251&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 June 2016|work=Lawrence Journal-World|issue=Vol. 130, No. 143|publisher=The Associated Press|date=May 22, 1988|page=7A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, researchers found that the dose received from background radiation on the island was between 2.4 mSv/year—the same as natural [[background radiation]]—and 4.5 mSv/year, assuming that residents consumed a diet of imported foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robison |first=WL |author2=Noshkin VE |author3=Conrado CL |author4=Eagle RJ |author5=Brunk JL |author6=Jokela TA |author7=Mount ME |author8=Phillips WA |author9=Stoker AC |author10=Stuart ML |author11=Wong KM |year=1997 |title= The Northern Marshall Islands Radiological Survey: Data and Dose Assessments |journal=Health Physics |volume=73 |pages=37–48 |issue=1|doi=10.1097/00004032-199707000-00004|pmid=9199217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the local food supply is still irradiated, the group did not recommend resettling the island. A 1998 [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] report found that Bikini is still not safe for habitation because of dangerous levels of radiation.&lt;ref name="bik12"/&gt;

A 2002 survey found that the coral inside the Bravo Crater has partially recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V6N-4RJJRR5-2/1/d7261df3400d52522f768f4d8daf5dbb |title=Bikini Atoll coral biodiversity resilience five decades after nuclear testing | doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2007.11.018 | pmid=18187160 |volume=56 |issue=3 |date=Mar 2008 |journal=Mar Pollut Bull |pages=503–15|author1=Richards |first1=Z.

=== Compensation and reparations ===

In 1975 the islanders, who had returned to Bikini Atoll and later learned that it wasn't safe, sued the United States for the first time. They demanded a radiological study of the northern islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despite High Court Denial, Battle Over Bikini Atoll Bombing Endures|url=http://bikiniatoll.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/despite-high-court-denial-battle-over-bikini-atoll-bombing-endures/|publisher=Bikini Island Local Government|accessdate=20 August 2013|date=26 April 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024061225/http://bikiniatoll.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/despite-high-court-denial-battle-over-bikini-atoll-bombing-endures/|archivedate=24 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the United States set up ''The Hawaiian Trust Fund for the People of Bikini'', totaling $3 million. When the islanders were removed from the island in 1978, the U.S. added $3 million to the fund. The U.S. created a second trust fund, ''The Resettlement Trust Fund for the People of Bikini'', containing $20 million in 1982. The U.S. added another $90 million to that fund to pay to clean up, reconstruct homes and facilities, and resettle the islanders on Bikini and Eneu islands.&lt;ref name=reparations&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Reparations for Damages|url=http://www.bikiniatoll.com/repar.html|publisher=Bikini Atoll|accessdate=12 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016002504/http://www.bikiniatoll.com/repar.html|archivedate=16 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the U.S. and the Marshall islanders signed the [[Compact of Free Association]], which gave the Marshall Islands independence. The Compact became effective in 1986 and was subsequently modified by the Amended Compact that became effective in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Relations With Marshall Island|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26551.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=14 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824073239/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26551.htm|archivedate=24 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also established the Nuclear Claims Tribunal, which was given the task of adjudicating compensation for victims and families affected by the nuclear testing program. Section 177 of the compact provided for reparations to the Bikini islanders and other northern atolls for damages. It included $75 million to be paid over 15 years.&lt;ref name=reparations/&gt; On March 5, 2001, the Nuclear Claims Tribunal ruled against the United States for damages done to the islands and its people.&lt;ref name=Niedenthal/&gt;

The payments began in 1987 with $2.4 million paid annually to entire Bikini population, while the remaining $2.6 million is paid into ''The Bikini Claims Trust Fund''. This trust is intended to exist in perpetuity and to provide the islanders a 5% payment from the trust annually.&lt;ref name=reparations/&gt;

The United States provided $150 million in compensation for damage caused by the nuclear testing program and their displacement from their home island.&lt;ref name="nuclearclaimstribunal.com"/&gt;

By 2001, of the original 167 residents who were relocated, 70 were still alive, and the entire population has grown to 2800.&lt;ref name=guyer/&gt; Most of the islanders and their descendants live on Kili, in Majuro, or in the United States. The opportunity for some Bikini islanders to potentially relocate back to their home island creates a dilemma. Only a few living islanders were born there. Most of the younger generation have never lived there or even visited and do not have a desire to return. Unemployment in the Marshall Islands was as of 2013 at about 40 percent. The population is growing at a four percent growth rate, so increasing numbers are taking advantage of terms in the Marshall Islands' Compact of Free Association that allow them to obtain jobs in the United States.&lt;ref name=gwynne/&gt;

== Recovery of marine ecosystem ==

== Health impacts ==
The inhabitants of the [[Marshall Islands]], particularly those closest to [[Bikini Atoll]], were exposed to high levels of [[Radiation damage|radiation]]. The highest levels of radiation exposure were found in the areas of local fallout. The fallout produced from nuclear tests can affect the human populations internally or externally. External irradiation is from penetrating gamma rays that come from particles on the ground. The levels of external radiation exposure can be reduced if one was indoors because buildings act as a shield. Inhalation of radioactive fallout and epidermal absorption are the primary means of irradiation. However most exposure is from consumption of food that has been contaminated through fallout. The people of the islands would consume meat or products from animals that had been irradiated, therefore irradiating the consumer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1966-01-01|title=Fallout Radiation And Growth|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=5496|pages=1132|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5496.1132-a|pmc=1844058|jstor=25407693}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2018}} Food shipped into the islands was also affected by contamination through contaminated cooking utensils. Many dairy products, such as milk and yogurt, were contaminated as a result of radionuclides landing on pastures. Iodine-131, a highly radioactive isotope, was ingested or inhaled by many through various forms. The [[iodine-131]] consumed would become concentrated in one's thyroid.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Steven L.|last2=Bouville|first2=André|last3=Land|first3=Charles E.|date=2006-01-01|title=Fallout from Nuclear Weapons Tests and Cancer Risks: Exposures 50 years ago still have health implications today that will continue into the future|journal=American Scientist|volume=94|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1511/2006.57.982|jstor=27858707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Marshall Islands, the detonation of [[Castle Bravo]] was the cause of most of the radiation exposure to the surrounding populations. The fallout levels attributed to the Castle Bravo test are the highest in history.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The exposure to fallout has been linked to increase the likelihood of several types of cancer such as leukemia and thyroid cancer.&lt;ref name = StrangeGlow /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The relationship between I-131 levels and thyroid cancer is continuing to be researched. There are also correlations between fallout exposure levels and diseases such as thyroid disease like [[hypothyroidism]]. Populations of the Marshall Islands that received significant exposure to radionuclides have a much greater risk of developing cancer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Castle Bravo test detonation produced an explosion of approximately 15 megatons, which is about three times its predicted value. Populations neighboring the test site were exposed to high levels of radiation resulting in mild radiation sickness of many (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Several weeks later, many people began suffering from alopecia (hair loss) and skin lesions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1955-01-01|title=Radioactive Fallout in the Marshall Islands|journal=Science|volume=122|issue=3181|pages=1178–1179|doi=10.1126/science.122.3181.1178|pmid=17807268|jstor=1749478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female population of the Marshall Islands have a sixty times greater cervical cancer mortality than a comparable mainland United States population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauerman|first=John F.|last2=Reuther|first2=Christopher|date=1997-01-01|title=Trouble in Paradise|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=105|issue=9|pages=914–919|doi=10.2307/3433870|jstor=3433870}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=August 2018}} The Islands populations also have a five time greater likelihood of breast or gastrointestinal mortality, and lung cancer mortality is three times higher than the mainland population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{better source needed|date=August 2018}} The male population on the Marshall Islands lung cancer mortality is four times greater than the overall United States rates, and the oral cancer rates are ten times greater.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{better source needed|date=August 2018}}

A '''Paperless society''' is a society in which paper communication (written documents, mail, letters, etc.) is replaced by electronic communication and storage.  The concept originated by [[Frederick Wilfrid Lancaster]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Towards paperless information systems|url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/236468|website = CERN Document Server|access-date = 2016-02-10|publisher = Academic Press|date = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, libraries would no longer be needed to handle printed documents. "Librarians will, in time, become information specialists in a deinstitutionalized setting" (Lancaster &amp; Smith, 1980). Lancaster also stated that both computers and libraries will not always give us the information that other people and living life will.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4497">A '''parlour boarder''' is an archaic term for a privileged category of pupil at a [[boarding school]]. Parlour boarders are described by a modern historian as paying more than the other pupils, in return for which they got a room of their own&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Skedd|authorlink1=Susan|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Hannah|editor1-link=Women Teachers and the Expansion of Girls' Schooling in England, c. 1760-1820|title=Gender in eighteenth-century England : roles, representations and responsibilities|date=1997|publisher=Longman|location=London|isbn=9780582278264|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[parlour]] was a small reception room, from the French "parler", implying a place for quiet conversation; "board" means meals, as in the expression [[room and board]]. The term is mostly historic in [[British English]].

In 18th and 19th century England, there were a profusion of small schools, always single-sex, with the number of pupils ranging from fewer than a dozen to a few score, on a much more domestic scale than the so-called public schools such as [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]]. Many of these small schools were operated on a family basis, often by a married couple (for boys), or by sisters or female friends (for girls). They would accept day pupils, common boarders, and parlour boarders.

==18-19th centuries==
[[Elizabeth Lachlan]] was at school in London when its owner, a Miss Shepherd, impulsively decided to move her school from [[Percy Street]] to France during the [[Peace of Amiens]] in 1802. She set out on this venture with "thirty to forty girls of respectable families, and ten or twelve ladies as parlour boarders".&lt;ref&gt;cited in Skedd, footnote 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Reynolds (United Irishmen)#Rebellion|Thomas Reynolds]] (1771–1836), the Irish informer, son of a wealthy textile manufacturer, was sent at eight years old as a parlour boarder to the school of Rev. Archibald Crawford at [[Chiswick]], then a village on the outskirts of London.
:The school was composed of eight parlour-boarders, and about sixty other lads. The parlour-boarders lived entirely at the Doctor's table, and joined in all his society as part of his family. In their walks they were usually accompanied by the Doctor himself, who rarely intrusted that responsibility to an usher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Thomas|title=The Life of Thomas Reynolds, Esq: Formerly of Kilkea Castle, in the County of Kildare|date=1838|publisher=Milliken and Sons|location=Dublin|page=57|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GatCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=parlour+boarder&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin0KKvlK7QAhVIbBoKHb6lDPoQ6AEISzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=parlour%20boarder&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
The Indian diplomat [[Venkata Siddharthacharry]] was largely educated in England, and entitled a chapter of his memoir "Parlour Boarder". He defines it as a situation that allows access "to both the family dining room and the family drawing room", "a great privilege naturally, paid for sumptuously". One much-valued benefit was the fire, which was lit from mid-autumn "right up to the end of spring", in contrast to the frigid dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siddharthacharry|first1=Venkata|title=Brāhmanic Vignettes: Diplomat's Nostalgia|date=2013|publisher=Partridge Publishing|page=29|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit school named after [[Francis de Sales]] in [[Nagpur]], India, even in the mid 20th century:
:ran a three tier system of boarding. Parlour boarders, ordinary boarders, and charity boarders. The Parlour boarders were treated like residents of a five star hotel, Ordinary like two star residents, and Charity like poor relations, only a little better off than the orphan children described in the novels of Charles Dickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faithful|first1=Elizabeth|title=Anglo-Indians : a life lived through six British monarchs : biography of Dolly Dudman|date=2003|publisher=Originals|location=Delhi|isbn=8188629006|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One [[Anglo-Indian]] family sent the light-skinned son as a parlour boarder, while his darker brothers were merely ordinary boarders.&lt;ref&gt;page 106 above&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pioneer Venus Orbiter''', also known as '''Pioneer Venus 1''' or '''Pioneer 12''', was a mission to [[Venus]] conducted by the United States as part of the [[Pioneer Venus project]]. Launched in May 1978 atop an [[Atlas-Centaur]] rocket, the spacecraft was inserted into an elliptical orbit around Venus on December 4, 1978. It returned data on Venus until October 1992.&lt;ref name="SC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pv1" /&gt;

==Launch and arrival at Venus==
[[File:Pioneer Venus 1 orbit attitude.gif|thumb|left|Orbit attitude of Pioneer Venus 1 between 1978–1980 and 1992]]
The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was launched by an [[Atlas-Centaur|Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D1AR]] rocket, which flew from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 36|Launch Complex 36A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. The launch occurred at 13:13:00 on May 20, 1978, and deployed the Orbiter into [[heliocentric orbit]] for its coast to Venus. Venus orbit insertion occurred on December 4, 1978.

==Spacecraft==
[[File:Pioneer Venus 1 at KSC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pioneer Venus 1 at [[Kennedy Space Center|KSC]].]]
Manufactured by [[Hughes Aircraft Company]], the Pioneer Venus Orbiter was based on the HS-507 [[spacecraft bus|bus]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/pioneer-12.htm | title=Pioneer 12 (Pioneer Venus Orbiter, PVO) | first=Gunter | last=Krebs | work=Gunter's Space Page | deadurl=no | archivedate=2005-01-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050112064044/http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/pioneer-12.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft was a flat cylinder, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter and {{convert|1.2|m|ft|sp=us}} long. All instruments and spacecraft subsystems were mounted on the forward end of the cylinder, except the [[magnetometer]], which was at the end of a {{convert|4.7|m|ft|sp=us}} boom. A [[Photovoltaic module|solar array]] extended around the circumference of the cylinder. A {{convert|1.09|m}} despun dish [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] provided [[S band|S]] and [[X band]] communication with [[Earth]]. A [[Star-24]] [[solid rocket motor]] was integrated into the spacecraft to provide the thrust to enter orbit around Venus.&lt;ref name="GSP" /&gt;

From Venus orbit insertion to July 1980, [[periapsis]] was held between {{convert|142|and|253|km|mi}} (at 17 degrees north latitude) to facilitate radar and ionospheric measurements. The spacecraft was in a 24-hour orbit with an [[apoapsis]] of {{convert|66900|km|mi|sp=us}}. Thereafter, the periapsis was allowed to rise to a maximum of {{convert|2290|km}} and then fall, to conserve fuel.

In 1991, the Radar Mapper was reactivated to investigate previously inaccessible southern portions of the planet, in conjunction with the recently arrived [[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]] spacecraft. In May 1992, Pioneer Venus began the final phase of its mission, in which the periapsis was held between {{convert|150|and|250|km|mi}}, until the spacecraft's propellant was exhausted, after which the orbit [[orbital decay|decayed]] naturally. The spacecraft continued to return data until 8 October 1992, with the last signals being received at 19:22 UTC.&lt;ref name="pv1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Venus&amp;MCode=Pioneer_Venus_01&amp;Display=ReadMore | title=Pioneer Venus 1 | publisher=NASA | work=Solar System Exploration | deadurl=no | archivedate=2006-10-04 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004114707/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Venus&amp;MCode=Pioneer_Venus_01&amp;Display=ReadMore }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pioneer Venus Orbiter disintegrated upon [[atmospheric entry|entering]] the [[atmosphere of Venus]] on October 22, 1992.&lt;ref name="SC" /&gt;

==Experiments==

The spacecraft conducted [[radar altimetry]] observations allowing the first global topographic map of the Venusian surface to be constructed.

== Observations of Halley's Comet ==
From its orbit of Venus, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter was able to observe [[Halley's Comet]] when it was unobservable from Earth due to its proximity to the sun during February 1986. UV spectrometer observations monitored the loss of water from the comet's nucleus at perihelion on February 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/pioneerVenus_conjunct.pdf | format=PDF | title=Pioneer Venus Observations during Comet Halley's Inferior Conjunction | first=C.T. | last=Russell | first2=J.G. | last2=Luhmann | first3=F.L. | last3=Scarf | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles | date=1985 | deadurl=no | archivedate=2009-02-27 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227202025/http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/pioneerVenus_conjunct.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3869">A '''practical engineer''' (Senior Technician)({{lang-he|הנדסאי}}) is a professional degree awarded by [[List of Israeli universities and colleges#Colleges|technological college]]s in [[Israel]] and validated by the National Institute for Technological Training of the [[Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry|Ministry of Industry, Trade &amp; Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moital.gov.il/NR/exeres/B0B48981-357D-446F-AFAC-91A358E93C87.htm Ministry of Industry, Trade &amp; Labor (State of Israel)] Retrieved on 15 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It is a unique qualification that combines theoretical study with practical training, and is currently available only in Israel. It normally takes up to 3 academic years to obtain a Practical Engineer's degree, depending on the taught discipline.

== Professional regulation ==
Practical Engineers are used to mediate between professional engineers and engineering technicians.  While most of the decision making process is performed by professional engineers and most of the practical work is done by technicians, practical engineers are taught to be able to follow instructions and re-adapt concepts designed by professional engineers.

In Israel, practical engineers are an integral part of the [[hi-tech]] industry and form an important work-force.

Practical Engineers are licensed to lead and hold responsible for engineering projects up to a certain level. For example, in Israel, architectural practical engineers are permitted to design constructions of up to four stories high with 2 dimensional static scheme and spans up to 6 meters, while for larger scale projects a full engineering degree is required.

== Education, training &amp; skills ==
Practical engineers receive formal education that meets with criteria published by the National Institute for Technological Training.
In sum over 2100 frontal academic hours are taught over a period of two to three years.

From an academic point of view, the main things differentiating engineers from practical engineers are the level and magnitude of foundation subjects, such as mathematics and physics.

Practical Engineers are taught foundations but only to the extent required by their profession, hence making their study shorter and more focused.

As part of the certification process, practical engineers are also required to undertake national certification tests, and to complete and defend a final project in their field of study or to participate in an [[internship]] program.

== Equivalent qualifications ==
There are some international qualifications equivalent to the Practical Engineer's degree. In Spain, the title of Ingeniero Técnico (Spanish for Technical Engineer) bears many similarities to its Israeli equivalent. Also, although not exactly the same, Practical Engineers are often thought of as [[Engineering Technician|Engineering technicians]], [[Associate degree|Associate Engineers]] or Jr. Engineers in some English speaking countries. The French [[Brevet de Technicien Supérieur]] is similar.

Although not an academic degree in its traditional sense, practical engineers are normally awarded some academic credit when pursuing further study at a [[Bachelor's degree]]

The '''S-IC''' (pronounced "ess one see") was the first [[Multistage rocket|stage]] of the American [[Saturn V]] rocket. The S-IC stage was built by the [[Boeing]] Company. Like the first stages of most [[rocket]]s, most of its mass of more than 2,000 [[tonne]]s at launch was propellant, in this case [[RP-1]] rocket fuel and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) [[oxidizer]]. It was 42 meters tall and 10 meters in diameter, and provided 33,000&amp;nbsp;kN of thrust to get the rocket through the first 61 kilometers of ascent. The stage had five [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1 engines]] in a [[quincunx]] arrangement. The center engine was fixed in position, while the four outer engines could be [[hydraulic]]ally [[gimbal]]led to control the rocket.

==Manufacturing==
The [[Boeing]] Co. was awarded the contract to manufacture the S-IC on December 15, 1961. By this time the general design of the stage had been decided on by the engineers at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC). The main place of manufacture was the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]], New Orleans. Wind tunnel testing took place in [[Seattle]] and the machining of the tools needed to build the stages at [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]].

MSFC built the first three test stages (S-IC-T, the S-IC-S, and the S-IC-F) and the first two flight models (S-IC-1 and -2). They were built using tools produced in Wichita.

It took roughly seven to nine months to build the tanks and 14 months to complete a stage. The first stage built by Boeing was S-IC-D, a test model.

==Components==
The largest and heaviest single component of the S-IC was the thrust structure, with a mass of 21 tonnes. It was designed to support the thrust of the five engines and redistribute it evenly across the base of the rocket. There were four anchors which held down the rocket as it built thrust. These were among the largest aluminum forgings produced in the U.S. at the time, 4.3 meters long and 816 kilograms in weight. The four stabilizing fins withstood a temperature of 1100&amp;nbsp;°C.

Above the thrust structure was the fuel tank, containing 770,000 liters of RP-1 fuel. The tank itself had a mass of 11 tonnes dry and could release 7300 liters per second. [[Nitrogen]] was bubbled through the tank before launch to keep the fuel mixed. During flight the fuel was pressurized using [[helium]], that was stored in tanks in the liquid oxygen tank above.

Between the fuel and liquid oxygen tanks was the intertank.

The liquid oxygen tank held 1,305,000 liters of LOX. It raised special issues for the designer. The lines through which the LOX ran to the engine had to be straight and therefore had to pass through the fuel tank. This meant insulating these lines inside a tunnel to stop fuel freezing to the outside and also meant five extra holes in the top of the fuel tank.

Two solid motor retrorockets were located inside each of the four conical engine fairings. At separation of the S-IC from the flight vehicle, the eight retrorockets fired, blowing off removable sections of the fairings forward of the fins, and backing the S-IC away from the flight vehicle as the engines on the S-II stage were ignited.

It also carried the [[ODOP]] transponder to track the flight after takeoff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2260">The '''safety valve theory''' was a theory about how to deal with [[unemployment]] which gave rise to the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862 in the United States. Given the concentration of immigrants (and population) on the Eastern coast, it was hypothesized that making free land available in the West would relieve the pressure for employment in the East. By analogy with steam pressure (= the need for work), the enactment of a free land law, it was believed, would act as a safety valve. This theory meant that if the East started filling up with immigrants, you could always go West until they reached a point where they could not move any farther.

A distinction has to be made between (1) the safety valve theory as an ideal and (2) the safety valve theory as embodied in the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862.

There is a dispute whether and to what extent the Homestead Act did or did not succeed as a safety valve in ameliorating the problem of unemployment in the East.

Opposition to giving away free land came from employers, who anticipated either a shortage of employees or conditions favorable to employees.

Its use is recommended - e.g. in the European Commission Impact assessment guidelines &lt;ref name=IA /&gt; - when a [[sensitivity analysis]] (SA) of a model-based study is meant to demonstrate the robustness of the evidence provided by the model, but in a context where the inference feeds into a policy or decision-making process.&lt;ref name="Latinorum"&gt;Saltelli, A., van der Sluijs, J., Guimarães Pereira, Â., 2013, Funtowiz, S.O., What do I make of your Latinorum? Sensitivity auditing of mathematical modelling, International Journal Foresight and Innovation Policy, 9 (2/3/4), 213–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
In these cases, the framing of the analysis itself, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become highly relevant, and a pure SA - with its focus on parametric (i.e. quantified) uncertainty - may be insufficient. The emphasis on the framing may, among other things, derive from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about `what the problem is' and foremost about `who is telling the story'. Most often the framing includes implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant).

In order to take these concerns into due consideration, sensitivity auditing extends the instruments of [[sensitivity analysis]] to provide an assessment of the entire knowledge- and model-generating process. It takes inspiration from [[NUSAP]],&lt;ref name="NUSAP"&gt;Van der Sluijs JP, Craye M, Funtowicz S, Kloprogge P, Ravetz J, Risbey J (2005) Combining quantitative and qualitative measures of uncertainty in model based environmental assessment: the NUSAP system. Risk Analysis 25(2):481-492&lt;/ref&gt; a method used to qualify the worth (quality) of quantitative information with the generation of `Pedigrees' of numbers. Likewise, sensitivity auditing has been developed to provide pedigrees of models and model-based inferences.&lt;ref name="Latinorum" /&gt; Sensitivity auditing is especially suitable in an adversarial context, where not only the nature of the evidence, but also the degree of certainty and uncertainty associated to the evidence, is the subject of partisan interests. These are the settings considered in [[Post-normal science]] &lt;ref name="F&amp;R1993"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. &amp; Ravetz, J. R. 1993. Science for the post-normal age. Futures, 25(7), 739–755.&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[Mode 2]]&lt;ref name="Gibbons1993"&gt;Gibbons, Michael; Camille Limoges; Helga Nowotny; Simon Schwartzman; Peter Scott; Martin Trow (1994). The new production of knowledge: the dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies. London: Sage. {{ISBN|0-8039-7794-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; science. [[Post-normal science]] (PNS) is a concept developed by [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome Ravetz]],&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1991"&gt;Funtowicz, S.O. and Jerome R. Ravetz (1991). "A New Scientific Methodology for Global Environmental Issues." In Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability. Ed. Robert Costanza. New York: Columbia University Press: 137–152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1992"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O., &amp; Ravetz, J. R. 1992. Three types of risk assessment and the emergence of postnormal science. In S. Krimsky &amp; D. Golding (Eds.), Social theories of risk (pp. 251–273). Westport, CT: Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes a methodology of inquiry that is appropriate when “facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent” (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1992:&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1992" /&gt; 251–273). [[Mode 2]] Science, coined in 1994 by Gibbons et al., refers to a mode of production of scientific knowledge that is context-driven, problem-focused and interdisciplinary. Carrozza (2015)&lt;ref name="Carrozza2015"&gt;Carrozza, C., 2015. “Democratizing Expertise and Environmental Governance: Different Approaches to the Politics of Science and their Relevance for Policy Analysis”, Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning, 17(1), 108-126.&lt;/ref&gt; offers a discussion of these concepts and approaches.

Sensitivity auditing is recommended by the [[European Commission]] for use in [[impact assessment]]s in order to improve the quality of model-based evidence used to support policy decisions.&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;European Commission. (2015). Guidelines on Impact Assessment - European Commission [http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/guidelines/tool_56_en.htm European Commission Better Regulation Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rules==
Sensitivity auditing is summarised by seven rules or guiding principles:
# Check against the rhetorical use of mathematical modeling. Question addressed: is the model being used to elucidate or to obfuscate?;
# Adopt an `assumption hunting' attitude. Question addressed: what was `assumed out'? What are the tacit, pre-analytical, possibly normative assumptions underlying the analysis?;
# Detect Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO). Issue addressed: artificial deflation of uncertainty operated in order to achieve a desired inference at a desired level of confidence. It also works on the reverse practice, the artificial inflation of uncertainties, e.g. to deter regulation;
# Find sensitive assumptions before they find you. Issue addressed: anticipate criticism by doing careful homework via sensitivity and uncertainty analyses before publishing results.
# Aim for transparency. Issue addressed: stakeholders should be able to make sense of, and possibly replicate, the results of the analysis;
# Do the right sums, which is more important than `Do the sums right'. Issue addressed: is the viewpoint of a relevant stakeholder being neglected? Who decided that there was a problem and what the problem was?
# Focus the analysis on the key question answered by the model, exploring the entire space of the assumptions holistically. Issue addressed: don't perform perfunctory analyses that just `scratch the surface' of the system's potential uncertainties.

The first rule looks at the instrumental use of mathematical modeling to advance one's agenda. This use is called rhetorical, or strategic, like the use of Latin to confuse or obfuscate an interlocutor.

The second rule about `assumption hunting' is a reminder to look for what was assumed when the model was originally framed. Modes are full of [[ceteris paribus]] assumptions. For example, in economics, the model can predict the result of a shock to a given set of equations, assuming that all the rest - all other input variables and inputs - remain equal, but in real life "ceteris" are never "paribus", meaning that variables tend to be linked with one another, so they cannot realistically change independently of one another.

Rule three is about artificially exaggerating or playing down uncertainties wherever convenient. The tobacco lobbies exaggerated the uncertainties about the health effects of smoking according to Oreskes and Conway,&lt;ref name="Merchant"&gt;Oreskes N, Conway EM (2010) Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming. Bloomsbury Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; while advocates of the death penalty played down the uncertainties in the negative relations between capital punishment and crime rate.&lt;ref name="Leamer"&gt;Leamer EE (2010) Tantalus on the road to asymptopia. Journal of Economic Perspectives 4(2):31-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly the latter wanted the policy, in this case the death penalty, and were interested in showing that the supporting evidence was robust. In the former case the lobbies did not want regulation (e.g. bans on tobacco smoking in public places) and were hence interested in amplifying the uncertainty in the smoking-health effect causality relationship.

Rule four is about `confessing' uncertainties before going public with the analysis. This rule is also one of the commandments of applied econometrics according to
Kennedy:&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;Kennedy, P. (2007) A Guide to Econometrics, 5th ed., p.396, Blackwell Publishing, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; `Thou shall confess in the presence of sensitivity. Corollary: Thou shall anticipate criticism'. According to this rule, a [[sensitivity analysis]] should be performed before the results of a modeling study are published. There are many good reasons for doing this, one being that a carefully performed [[sensitivity analysis]] often uncovers plain coding mistakes or model inadequacies. The other is that, more often than not, the analysis reveals uncertainties that are larger than those anticipated by the model developers.

Rule five is about presenting the results of the modeling study in a transparent fashion. Both rules originate from the practice of impact assessment, where a modeling study presented without a proper SA, or as originating from a model which is in fact a black box, may end up being rejected by stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Issues"&gt;Saltelli, A., Funtowicz, S., 2014, When all models are wrong: More stringent quality criteria are needed for models used at the science-policy interface, Issues in Science and Technology, Winter 2014, 79-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Both rules four and five suggest that reproducibility may be a condition for transparency and that this latter may be a condition for legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Cartesian"&gt;Saltelli, A., Funtowicz, S., 2015 Evidence-based policy at the end of the Cartesian Dream: The case of mathematical modelling, in "The end of the Cartesian dream", Edited by Ângela Guimarães Pereira, and Silvio Funtowicz, Routledge, p. 147-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rule six, about doing the right sum, is not far from the `assumption-hunting' rule; it is just more general. It deals with the fact that often an analyst is set to work on an analysis arbitrarily framed to the advantage of a party. Sometime this comes via the choice of the discipline selected to do the analysis. Thus an environmental impact problem may be framed through the lenses of economics, and presented as a cost benefit or risk analysis, while the issue has little to do with costs or benefits or risks and a lot to do with profits, controls, and norms. An example is in Marris et al.&lt;ref name="Marris"&gt;Marris, C., Wynne, B., Simmons, P., and Weldon, Sue. 2001. Final Report of the PABE Research Project Funded by the Commission of European Communities, Contract number: FAIR CT98-3844 DG12-SSMI) Dec, Lancaster: University of Lancaster.
&lt;/ref&gt; on the issue of GMOs, mostly presented in the public discourse as a food safety issue while the spectrum of concerns of GMO opponents - including lay citizens - appears broader.

Rule seven is about avoiding a perfunctory [[sensitivity analysis]]. A SA where each uncertain input is moved at a time while leaving all other inputs fixed is perfunctory.&lt;ref name="OAT"&gt;Saltelli, A., Annoni, P., 2010, How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis, Environmental Modeling and Software, 25, 1508-1517&lt;/ref&gt; A true SA should make an honest effort at exploring all uncertainties simultaneously, leaving the model free to display its full nonlinear and possibly non-additive behaviour. A similar point is made in Sam L. Savage's book `The flaw of averages'.&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;Savage SL (2009) The Flaw of Averages: Why We Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Questions addressed by sensitivity auditing ==

In conclusion, these rules are meant to help an analyst to anticipate criticism, in particular relating to model-based inference feeding into an impact assessment. What questions and objections may be received by the modeler? Here is a possible list:
* You treated X as a constant when we know it is uncertain by at least 30%
* It would be sufficient for a 5% error in X to make your statement about Z fragile
* Your model is but one of the plausible models - you neglected model uncertainty
* You have instrumentally maximized your level of confidence in the results
* Your model is a [[black box]] - why should I trust your results?
* You have artificially inflated the uncertainty
* Your framing is not socially robust
* You are answering the wrong question

== Sensitivity auditing in the European Commission Guidelines ==

Sensitivity auditing is described in the European Commission Guidelines for impact assessment &lt;ref name=IA /&gt;. Relevants excerpts are (pp. 392): 

:"[… ]where there is a major disagreement among stakeholders about the nature of the problem, … then sensitivity auditing is more suitable but sensitivity analysis is still advisable as one of the steps of sensitivity auditing."

:"Sensitivity auditing, […] is a wider consideration of the effect of all types of uncertainty, including structural assumptions embedded in the model, and subjective decisions taken in the framing of the problem." 

:"The ultimate aim is to communicate openly and honestly the extent to which particular models can be used to support policy decisions and what their limitations are."
 
:"In general sensitivity auditing stresses the idea of honestly communicating the extent to which model results can be trusted, taking into account as much as possible all forms of potential uncertainty, and to anticipate criticism by third parties."

The '''All-Earth Ecobot Challenge''' (or Ecobots) is a competition that occurs yearly for students throughout [[Texas]] in grades 5-8 that started in 2009. It encourages students to be creative, learn more about [[robots]], learn about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and how to help protect it, and prepares them for future jobs. The Ecobot Challenge uses various [[Lego]] pieces, [[Lego NXT|Lego NXT sets]], and [[PowerPoint]].

The All Earth Ecobot Challenge happens once a year for students in Texas. It started in 2009 and is for grades 5-8 It helps students learn about the environment, robots, creativity, and preparation for their future careers.

==Preparation==
Usually, a teacher from each school helps coaches teams that come before and/or after school to prepare by programming their [[Lego NXT|NXT]] and sometimes creating their Marketing Presentation(which could also be done at home, but not the [[Lego NXT|NXT]] programming)  in that teacher's classroom. Usually, the team starts to program and make their presentation in early March of earlier.

==Competition==
The competition held yearly consists of two sections: the Robotics section and the Marketing section. They are two separate parts to the competition. The competition is usually help around mid-April. The robot in the competition is only allowed to be touched in "Home". Home is where the robot starts and ends when completing challenges.

===Robotics===
This section requires students to program a [[Lego NXT]] to complete various tasks that change each year. The more tasks students complete, the more points they get (for a maximum of 300 points). To complete the various tasks, students build [[Lego]] attachments usually attached to the motors included in the  Lego NXT kit.

===Marketing===
This section requires students to think of and to make a PowerPoint presentation about an imaginary [[robot]] that will help the Earth environmentally. They present their presentation to judges who score them.

===Sponsors===
The Lego NXT sets and the competition is costly. Ecobots rely on [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] to fund the competition. For a list of sponsors, go to their [http://www.ecobotchallenge.com/sponsors.shtml sponsor list page].

'''''The Art of Computer Programming''''' (sometimes known by its initials '''''TAOCP''''') is a comprehensive [[monograph]] written by [[Donald Knuth]] that covers many kinds of [[Computer programming|programming]] [[algorithm]]s and [[analysis of algorithms|their analysis]].

Knuth began the project, originally conceived as a single book with twelve chapters, in 1962. The first three volumes of what was then expected to be a seven-volume set were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. The first published installment of Volume 4 appeared in paperback as [[Fascicle (book)|Fascicle]] 2 in 2005.
The hardback Volume 4A, combining Volume 4, Fascicles 0–4, was published in 2011. Volume 4, Fascicle 6 ("Satisfiability") was released in December 2015, to be followed by Volume 4, Fascicle 5 ("Mathematical Preliminaries Redux; Backtracking; Dancing Links") in December 2018. Fascicles 5 and 6 are expected to comprise the first two thirds of Volume 4B.

==History==
[[File:KnuthAtOpenContentAlliance.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Donald Knuth in 2005]]

After winning a Westinghouse Talent Search scholarship, Knuth enrolled at the Case Institute of Technology (now [[Case Western Reserve University]]), where his performance was so outstanding that the faculty voted to award him a master of science upon his completion of the baccalaureate degree. During his summer vacations, Knuth was hired by the [[Burroughs Corporation]] to write [[compiler]]s, earning more in his summer months than full professors did for an entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/107413 |hdl=11299/107413 |title=An Interview with Donald E. Knuth |author-first=Philip L. |author-last=Frana |date=2001-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such exploits made Knuth a topic of discussion among the mathematics department, which included [[Richard S. Varga]].

Knuth started to write a book about compiler design in 1962, and soon realized that the scope of the book needed to be much larger. In June 1965, Knuth finished the first draft of what was originally planned to be a single volume of twelve chapters. His hand-written first-draft manuscript (completed in 1966) was {{val|3000}} pages long: he had assumed that about five hand-written pages would translate into one printed page, but his publisher said instead that about 1½ hand-written pages translated to one printed page. This meant the book would be approximately {{val|2000}} pages in length. The publisher was nervous about accepting such a project from a graduate student. At this point, Knuth received support from Richard S. Varga, who was the scientific adviser to the publisher. Varga was visiting [[Olga Taussky-Todd]] and [[John Todd (computer scientist)|John Todd]] at [[Caltech]]. With Varga's enthusiastic endorsement, the publisher accepted Knuth's expanded plans. In its expanded version, the book would be published in seven volumes, each with just one or two chapters.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book |chapter=Donald Knuth |author-first=Donald J. |author-last=Albers |title=Mathematical People: Profiles and Interviews |publisher=A K Peters |edition=2 |date=2008 |isbn=1-56881-340-6 |editor-first1=Donald J. |editor-last1=Albers |editor-first2=Gerald L. |editor-last2=Alexanderson |editor-link2=Gerald L. Alexanderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the growth in the material, the plan for Volume 4 has since expanded to include Volumes 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and possibly more.

In 1976, Knuth prepared a second edition of Volume 2, requiring it to be [[typesetting|typeset]] again, but the style of type used in the first edition (called [[Hot metal typesetting|hot type]]) was no longer available. In 1977, he decided to spend some time creating something more suitable. Eight years later, he returned with [[TeX|T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X]], which is currently used for all volumes.

The offer of a so-called [[Knuth reward check]] worth "one hexadecimal dollar" (100&lt;sub&gt;[[Hexadecimal|HEX]]&lt;/sub&gt; [[hexadecimal|base 16]] cents, in [[decimal]], is $2.56) for any errors found, and the correction of these errors in subsequent printings, has contributed to the highly polished and still-authoritative nature of the work, long after its first publication. Another characteristic of the volumes is the variation in the difficulty of the exercises. The level of difficulty ranges from "warm-up" exercises to unsolved research problems. 

Knuth's dedication reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This series of books is affectionately dedicated&lt;br&gt;to the [[IBM 650|Type 650 computer]] once installed at&lt;br&gt;[[Case Institute of Technology]],&lt;br&gt;with whom I have spent many pleasant evenings.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;The dedication was worded slightly differently in the first edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Assembly language in the book==
All examples in the books use a language called "MIX assembly language", which runs on the hypothetical [[MIX]] computer. Currently, the MIX computer is being replaced by the [[MMIX]] computer, which is a [[RISC]] version. Software such as [[GNU MDK]] exists to provide emulation of the MIX architecture.  Knuth considers the use of [[assembly language]] necessary for the speed and memory usage of algorithms to be judged.

==Critical response==
Knuth was awarded the 1974 [[Turing Award]] "for his major contributions to the [[analysis of algorithms]] […], and in particular for his contributions to the 'art of computer programming' through his well-known books in a continuous series by this title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/knuth_1013846.cfm |title=Donald E. Knuth – A. M. Turing Award Winner |website=AM Turing |access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[American Scientist]]'' has included this work among "100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science", referring to the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-first1=Philip |author-last1=Morrison |author-link1=Philip Morrison |author-first2=Phylis |author-last2=Morrison |url=https://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030403/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science |archive-date=2008-08-20 |title=100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science |volume=87 |issue=6 |journal=American Scientist |date=November–December 1999 |publisher=Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society |access-date=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within the computer science community it is regarded as the first and still the best comprehensive treatment of its subject. Covers of the third edition of Volume 1 quote [[Bill Gates]] as saying, "If you think you're a really good programmer… read (Knuth's) ''Art of Computer Programming''… You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-loves-donald-knuth-the-art-of-computer-programming-2016-4 |title=Bill Gates once said 'definitely send me a résumé' if you finish this fiendishly difficult book |author-first=Matt |author-last=Weinberger |website=Business Insider |access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to [[folklore.org]], [[Steve Jobs]] actually made the incredible claim.

In [[zoological nomenclature]], a '''type species'''  (''species typica'') is the [[species]] name with which the name of a [[genus]] or subgenus is considered to be permanently taxonomically associated, i.e., the species that contains the biological [[Type (biology)|type]] specimen(s).&lt;ref name=ICN67&gt;{{cite web |publisher=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |date=1999 |title= International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Fourth Edition, adopted by the International Union of Biological Sciences  |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/}} Article 67.1&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept is used for suprageneric groups called a [[type genus]].

In [[botanical nomenclature]], these terms have no formal standing under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|code of nomenclature]], but are sometimes borrowed from zoological nomenclature. In botany, the type of a genus name is a specimen (or, rarely, an illustration) which is also the type of a species name. The species name that has that type can also be referred to as the type of the genus name. Names of genus and family ranks, the various subdivisions of those ranks, and some higher-rank names based on genus names, have such types.&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;[http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php? ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (ICN)] articles 7 through 10 (Melbourne Code, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacteriology]], a type species is assigned for each genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8808/#A247 |title=International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria: Bacteriological Code, 1990 Revision |chapter=Chapter 3: Rules of Nomenclature with Recommendations; Section 4. Nomenclatural Types and Their Designation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every named genus or subgenus in zoology, whether or not currently recognized as [[valid name (zoology)|valid]], is theoretically associated with a type species. In practice, however, there is a backlog of untypified names defined in older publications when it was not required to specify a type.

== Use in zoology ==
{{see also|Types in zoology}}
A type species is both a concept and a practical system that is used in the [[Biological classification|classification]] and nomenclature (naming) of animals. The "type species" represents the reference species and thus "definition" for a particular genus name. Whenever a taxon containing multiple species must be divided into more than one genus, the type species automatically assigns the name of the original taxon to one of the resulting new taxa, the one that includes the type species.

The term "type species" is regulated in [[zoological nomenclature]] by article 42.3 of the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'', which defines a type species as the [[name-bearing type]] of the name of a genus or subgenus (a "[[rank (zoology)|genus-group name]]"). In the Glossary, type species is defined as

{{quote|The nominal species that is the name-bearing type of a nominal genus or subgenus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary ICZN Code Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The type species permanently attaches a formal name (the generic name) to a [[genus (biology)|genus]] by providing just one [[species]] within that genus to which the genus name is permanently linked (i.e. the genus must include that species if it is to bear the name). The species name in turn is fixed, in theory, to a type specimen.

For example, the type species for the [[land snail]] genus ''[[Monacha]]'' is ''Helix cartusiana'', the name under which the species was first described, known as ''[[Monacha cartusiana]]'' when placed in the genus ''Monacha''. That genus is currently placed within the family [[Hygromiidae]]. The type genus for that family is the genus ''[[Hygromia]]''.

The concept of the type species in zoology was introduced by [[Pierre André Latreille]].&lt;ref name="Dupuis"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Claude Dupuis |year=1974 |title=Pierre André Latreille (1762–1833): the foremost entomologist of his time |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |volume=19 |pages=1–14 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.en.19.010174.000245 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.19.010174.000245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citing==
The ''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature'' states that the original name (binomen) of the type species should always be cited. It gives an example in Article 67.1. ''Astacus marinus'' {{small|Fabricius, 1775}} was later designated as the type species of the genus ''Homarus'', thus giving it the name ''Homarus marinus'' {{small|(Fabricius, 1775)}}. However, the type species of ''Homarus'' should always be cited using its original name, i.e. ''Astacus marinus'' {{small|Fabricius, 1775}}.&lt;ref name=ICN67/&gt;

Although the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' does not contain the same explicit statement, examples make it clear that the original name is used, so that the "type species" of a genus name need not have a name within that genus. Thus in Article 10, Ex. 3, the type of the genus name ''Elodes'' is quoted as the type of the species name ''[[Hypericum aegypticum]]'', not as the type of the species name ''Elodes aegyptica''.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; (''Elodes'' is not now considered distinct from ''[[Hypericum]]''.)

'''Understory''' (founded in 2012 as WInstruments)&lt;ref name=IB&gt;[http://www.ibmadison.com/In-Business-Madison/April-2013/Madisons-WInstruments-allows-weather-watchers-to-go-inside-the-storm/ “Madison’s WInstruments allows weather watchers to go inside the storm.”] In Business Madison. April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; is a company that forecasts weather and collects data using a grid of weather-sensing hardware that tracks weather from the ground level.
 
==History==
 
Although originally known as WInstruments, founder and CEO Alex Kubicek changed the company name to Subsidence and joined Gener8tor, a group in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] that provides funding to startups.&lt;ref name=McCarty&gt;McCarty, Brad. [https://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/08/23/meet-7-startups-milwaukee-wisconsins-gener8tor-accelerator/#gref “Meet the 7 Startups from Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s Gener8tor Accelerator.”] The Next Web. Aug. 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  After receiving funding from Gener8tor, the company moved to Boston to the Bolt hardware accelerator.&lt;ref name=Darrow&gt;Darrow, Barb. [https://gigaom.com/2013/07/31/bolt-to-nurture-startups-that-want-to-build-the-things-for-the-internet-of-things/ “Bolt to nurture startups that want to build the things for the internet of things.”] GigaOm. July 31, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Kubicek soon renamed the company “Understory,” and combined funding from Gener8tor and Bolt came to $68,000.&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;Levine, Barry [https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/30/understory-scores-1-9m-to-generate-better-weather-data-from-the-ground/ “Understory scores $1.9M to generate better weather data from the ground.”] Venture Beat. April 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  After raising $1.9 million in seed funding led by True Ventures, with participation by RRE Ventures, Vegas Tech Fund, SK Ventures, and Andrew C. Payne, the company moved from Madison to Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Levine /&gt;&lt;ref name=Subbaraman&gt;Subbaraman, Nidhi. [http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/05/18/weather-startup-understory-helps-city-of-somerville-plan-for-climate-change/?p1=Main_Headline “Weather startup Understory helps City of Somerville plan for climate change.”] The Boston Globe. May 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Headquarters was set up in Somerville at the clean tech incubator, Greentown Labs, and the company set up pilot tests in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[Dallas, Texas]], and [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=Castellanos&gt;Castellanos, Sara. [http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/startups/2016/02/weather-tech-startup-moves-hq-from-somerville-to.html “Weather tech startup moves HQ from Somerville to Wisconsin.”] Boston Business Journal. Feb. 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Subbaraman /&gt;
Series A funding resulted in another $7.5 million for the company, co-led by 4490 Ventures and Monsanto Growth Ventures and joined by CSA Partners, True Ventures, RRE Ventures, and SK Ventures.&lt;ref name=Primack&gt;Primack, Dan. [http://fortune.com/2016/02/22/term-sheet-monday-february-22/ “Term Sheet: Monday, February 22”] Fortune. February 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The company then announced a plan to move back to Madison, Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=Castellanos /&gt;
 
The company’s first customer was [[American Family Insurance]], which uses weather data to adjust claims.&lt;ref name=Etherington&gt;Etherington, Darrell. [https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/30/understory-raises-1-9m-to-deploy-its-network-of-hyper-local-ground-level-weather-stations/ “Understory raises $1.9M to Deploy Its Network of Hyper-Local, Ground-Level, Weather Stations.”] Tech Crunch. April 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Device==
 
Understory makes solar-powered weather stations that detect three-dimensional rain, hail, wind and other weather in real-time at the ground level, instead of using atmospheric data like traditional weather detectors.&lt;ref name=Castellanos /&gt;  Each weather station is about 1 foot wide and 2 feet tall, and connects in a grid through cellular connections.&lt;ref name=Levine /&gt;  The stations can collect up to 3,000 data points per minute.&lt;ref name=Subbaraman /&gt;

'''WARFT''' or WAran Research FoundaTion is a [[nonprofit]] organization promoting interdisciplinary research among undergraduate students in the city of [[Chennai]], [[India]]. Professor N. Venkateswaran founded the group in 2000 and continues to manage it as of 2011. The aim of WARFT is to understand and model the brain to enable [[drug discovery]] so that [[spastic]] children can live a normal life.

Since its inception, WARFT has researched brain modeling, [[Supercomputer|supercomputing]] and associated areas. The goal of WARFT is to unravel the connectivity of the human brain regions through the MMINi-DASS project. Biologically accurate [[Brain simulation|brain simulations]] require massive computational power and thus another research initiative at WARFT is the MIP Project directed towards evolving a design method for the development of a tera-operations supercomputing cluster.

Undergraduate research trainees at WARFT engage themselves in the areas of [[neuroscience]], supercomputing architectures, processor design towards deep sub-micrometre, power-aware computing, low power issues, mixed signal design, fault tolerance and testing, digital signal processing. WARFT conducts Dhi Yantra, a workshop on brain modeling and supercomputing every year.

== Aims ==
WARFT's mission is twofold. Firstly to promote [[innovation]] and research awareness in the minds of young [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate students]]. In this respect, WARFT conducts a two-year part-time Research Awareness Programme and Training (RAPT) for undergraduate students. Secondly to solve the mysteries of the brain and to hasten the discovery of drugs that can cure [[Central nervous system disease|brain diseases]].

== Undergraduate research initiatives ==
There are two main inter-disciplinary research initiatives at WARFT :
=== The Multi Million Neuron interconnectivity - Dendrite Axon Soma and Synapse ===
The MMINi-DASS project is a large-scale brain simulation carried out to predict interconnectivity of a specific [[List of regions in the human brain|brain region]] and makes use of [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] BOLD response of brain regions. This results in understanding of brain dynamics from the most fundamental level to cognitive and behavioral aspects. Modeling individual brain entities is a challenging task. Predicting their interconnectivity through simulation requires enormous computing power and thus, the project banks on the exponentially increasing computing power and its decreasing cost.

=== The Memory In Processor SuperComputer On Chip (MIP SCOC) and the Silicon Operating System (SILICOS) ===
The immense computational demand imposed by the MMINi-DASS PROJECT has given rise to the novel supercomputer design known as the MIP SCOC. The MIP approach incorporates the memory within the logic, reminiscent of [[The Berkeley IRAM Project]]. In the MIP SCOC architecture, memory is physically and logically integrated with the functional units of the processor. This bit-level integration of processing logic and memory has led to a tremendous increase in functionality of a single MIP SCOC node. 

The MIP SCOC architecture includes powerful ALFU (Algorithm Level Functional units) like chain matrix adders, multipliers, sorters, multiple operand adders and graph theoretic units like Depth-First-Search, Breadth-First-Search. This introduces a higher level of abstraction through the [[algorithm]]-level instructions (ALISA). A single ALISA is equivalent to multiple parallel VLIW. The MIP SCOC architecture includes an on-chip compiler (Compiler-On-Silicon) to generate the required instructions to feed the ALFUs of the MIP node. The Primary COS (PCOS) partitions the incoming problem according to the algorithms involved. Each SCOS generates the instructions corresponding to that column. A distributed control design is employed specific to ALFU population type (forming different heterogeneous cores) enabling parallel operation of a very large number of ALFUs.

== Groups ==
WARFT is divided into seven research groups:
* '''CHARAKA''': the [[Neurosciences]] Group
* '''VISHWAKARMA''': the [[Computer Architecture]] Group
* '''MARCONI''': the Mixed Signal Group
* '''BHASKARA''': Power Aware Design for [[Nanotech]] [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] Architectures Group
* '''NAREN''': Testing and Fault Tolerant Group
* '''RAMANUJAN''': Nanotech Design Methodologies Group
* '''HARDY''': Low Power Architectures for Matrix Algorithm Group 

According to WARFT's website, it has published 50 [[Academic publishing|research papers]] as of 2008.[http://www.warftindia.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=56]

== Dhi Yantra ==
Dhi Yantra is a workshop on brain modeling and supercomputing organized by WARFT every year. Three editions of this workshop, featuring scientists and researchers from various fields and geography, have been held. The fourth workshop was held in [[Chennai|Chennai, India]] on July 10, 11 and  12, 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1529">'''Willem Hendrik van den Bos''' (25 September 1896, [[Rotterdam]] – 30 March 1974) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]–[[South Africa]]n [[astronomer]].  At least one source refers to him as '''Van der Bos''', but this seems to be an error.

He initially worked at [[Leiden Observatory]] in the [[Netherlands]], but came to [[Union Observatory]] in [[South Africa]] in 1925, becoming director in 1941.

He discovered thousands of [[double star]]s and recorded tens of thousands of [[micrometer]] measurements of such stars, calculating the orbits of a number of [[binary star]]s.

He was president of the Astronomical Society of South Africa in 1943 and 1955.

Some biographical sources say he discovered more than a hundred [[asteroid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} However, the [[Minor Planet Center]] does not credit him with any asteroid discoveries.

The asteroid [[1663 van den Bos]] is named after him, as is the lunar crater [[Van den Bos (crater)|van den Bos]].
