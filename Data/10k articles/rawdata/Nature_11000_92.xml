      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17510">'''Acousto-optics''' is a branch of [[physics]] that studies the interactions between sound waves and light waves, especially the [[diffraction]] of [[laser]] [[light]] by [[ultrasound]] (or [[sound]] in general) through an [[ultrasonic grating]].

&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the acousto-optic effect has had a relatively short history, beginning with [[Léon Brillouin|Brillouin]] predicting the [[diffraction of light]] by an acoustic wave, being propagated in a medium of interaction, in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The particular case of diffraction on the first order, under a certain [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]], (also predicted by Brillouin), has been observed by Rytow in 1935. [[C. V. Raman|Raman]] and Nath (1937) have designed a general ideal model of interaction taking into account several orders. This model was developed by Phariseau (1956) for diffraction including only one diffraction order.

In general, acousto-optic effects are based on the change of the [[refractive index]] of a medium due to the presence of sound waves in that medium. Sound waves produce a refractive index grating in the material, and it is this grating that is "seen" by the light wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

The acousto-optic effect is extensively used in the measurement and study of ultrasonic waves.  However, the growing principal area of interest is in acousto-optical devices for the deflection, [[modulation]], [[signal processing]] and frequency shifting of light beams.  This is due to the increasing availability and performance of [[laser]]s, which have made the acousto-optic effect easier to observe and measure. Technical progress in both [[crystal growth]] and high frequency [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[transducer]]s has brought valuable benefits to acousto-optic components' improvements.

Along with the current applications, acousto-optics presents interesting possible application.  It can be used in [[nondestructive testing]], [[structural health monitoring]] and [[biomedical]] applications, where optically generated and optical measurements of ultrasound gives a non-contact method of imaging.

== Acousto-optic effect ==
The acousto-optic effect is a specific case of [[photoelasticity]], where there is a change of a material's [[permittivity]], &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, due to a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  Photoelasticity is the variation of the optical indicatrix coefficients &lt;math&gt;B_i&lt;/math&gt; caused by the strain &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; given by,&lt;ref name="Acousto-optic effect"&gt;{{cite web
  | title =Acousto-optic effect
  | url =http://www.mt-berlin.com/frames_ao/descriptions/ao_effect.htm
  | accessdate = 2007-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(1) \ \Delta B_i = p_{ij} a_j, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the photoelastic [[tensor]] with components, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; = 1,2,…,6.

Specifically in the acousto-optic effect, the strains &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; are a result of the acoustic wave which has been excited within a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] medium.  This then gives rise to the variation of the refractive index. For a plane acoustic wave propagating along the z axis, the change in the refractive index can be expressed as,&lt;ref name="Acousto-optic effect"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(2) \ n(z,t)=n_0+\Delta n \cos (\Omega t - Kz), \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; is the undisturbed refractive index, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]], &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavenumber]] of the acoustic wave, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta n&lt;/math&gt; is the amplitude of variation in the refractive index generated by the acoustic wave, and is given as,&lt;ref name="Acousto-optic effect"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(3) \ \Delta n = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_j n_0^3p_{zj} a_j,&lt;/math&gt;

The generated refractive index, (2), gives a [[diffraction grating]] moving with the [[velocity]] given by the speed of the sound wave in the medium.  Light which then passes through the transparent material, is diffracted due to this generated refraction index, forming a prominent [[diffraction pattern]].  This diffraction pattern corresponds with a conventional diffraction grating at angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_n&lt;/math&gt; from the original direction, and is given by,&lt;ref name="Scruby"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(4) \ \Lambda \sin (\theta_m) = m\lambda,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of the optical wave, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of the acoustic wave and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the integer order maximum.

Light diffracted by an acoustic wave of a single [[frequency]] produces two distinct diffraction types.  These are [[Raman-Nath diffraction]] and [[Bragg diffraction]].

Raman-Nath diffraction is observed with relatively low acoustic frequencies, typically less than 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, and with a small acousto-optic interaction length, ℓ, which is typically less than 1&amp;nbsp;cm. This type of diffraction occurs at an arbitrary angle of incidence, &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;.

In contrast, Bragg diffraction occurs at higher acoustic frequencies, usually exceeding 100&amp;nbsp;MHz. The observed diffraction pattern generally consists of two diffraction maxima; these are the zeroth and the first orders. However, even these two maxima only appear at definite incidence angles close to the Bragg angle, &lt;math&gt;\theta_B&lt;/math&gt;.  The first order maximum or the Bragg maximum is formed due to a selective reflection of the light from the wave fronts of ultrasonic wave. The Bragg angle is given by the expression,&lt;ref name="Acousto-optic effect"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(5) \ \sin \theta_B = - \frac{\lambda f}{2 n_i \nu}\left[ 1+\frac{\nu^2}{\lambda^2 f^2 } \left( n_i^2 - n_d^2 \right) \right],&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of the incident light wave (in a vacuum), &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the acoustic frequency, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the acoustic wave, &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the refractive index for the incident optical wave, and &lt;math&gt;n_d&lt;/math&gt; is the refractive index for the diffracted optical waves.

In general, there is no point at which [[Bragg diffraction]] takes over from Raman-Nath diffraction.  It is simply a fact that as the acoustic frequency increases, the number of observed maxima is gradually reduced due to the angular selectivity of the acousto-optic interaction. Traditionally, the type of diffraction, Bragg or Raman-Nath, is determined by the conditions ''Q'' &gt;&gt; 1 and ''Q'' &lt;&lt; 1 respectively, where Q is given by,&lt;ref name="Acousto-optic effect"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(6) \ Q = \frac{2\pi\lambda \ell f^2}{n \nu^2},&lt;/math&gt;

which is known as the Klein-Cook parameter. Since, in general, only the first order diffraction maximum is used in acousto-optic devices, [[Bragg diffraction]] is preferable due to the lower optical losses. However, the acousto-optic requirements for [[Bragg diffraction]] limit the frequency range of acousto-optic interaction.  As a consequence, the speed of operation of acousto-optic devices is also limited.

==Acousto-optic devices==

Three categories of acousto-optic devices will be discussed.  They include the acousto-optic modulator, filter and deflector.

===Acousto-optic modulator===
[[Image:Acousto-optic Modulator.png|thumb|180px|right|An acousto-optic modulator]]
By varying the parameters of the acoustic wave, including the [[amplitude]], [[Phase (waves)|phase]], frequency and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], properties of the optical wave may be modulated. The acousto-optic interaction also makes it possible to modulate the optical beam by both temporal and spatial modulation.

A simple method of modulating the optical beam travelling through the acousto-optic device is done by switching the acoustic field on and off.  When off the light beam is undiverted, the intensity of light directed at the Bragg diffraction angle is zero.  When switched on and Bragg diffraction occurs, the intensity at the Bragg angle increases.  So the acousto-optic device is modulating the output along the Bragg diffraction angle, switching it on and off.  The device is operated as a modulator by keeping the acoustic wavelength (frequency) fixed and varying the drive power to vary the amount of light in the deflected beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several limitations associated with the design and performance of acousto-optic modulators.  The acousto-optic medium must be designed carefully to provide maximum light intensity in a single diffracted beam.  The time taken for the acoustic wave to travel across the diameter of the light beam gives a limitation on the switching speed, and hence limits the modulation bandwidth.  The finite velocity of the acoustic wave means the light cannot be fully switched on or off until the acoustic wave has traveled across the light beam.  So to increase the bandwidth the light must be focused to a small diameter at the location of the acousto-optic interaction.  This minimum focused size of the beam represents the limit for the bandwidth.

===Acousto-optic filter===

The principle behind the operation of acousto-optic filters is based on the wavelength of the diffracted light being dependent on the acoustic frequency.  By tuning the frequency of the acoustic wave, the desired wavelength of the optical wave can be diffracted acousto-optically.

There are two types of the acousto-optic filters, the collinear and non-collinear filters.  The type of filter depends on geometry of acousto-optic interaction.

The polarization of the incident light can be either ordinary or extraordinary. For the definition, we assume ordinary polarization. Here the following list of symbols is used,&lt;ref name="filter"&gt;{{cite web
  | title =Acousto-optic effect: Filters
  | url =http://www.mt-berlin.com/frames_ao/descriptions/ao_filters.htm
  | accessdate = 2007-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;: the angle between the acoustic wave vector and the crystallographic axis ''z'' of the crystal;

&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;: the wedge angle between the input and output faces of the filter cell (the wedge angle is necessary for eliminating the angular shift of the diffracted beam caused by frequency changing);

&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;: the angle between the incident light wave vector and [110] axis of the crystal;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_\ell&lt;/math&gt;: the angle between the input face of the cell and acoustic wave vector;

&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;: the angle between deflected and non-deflected light at the central frequency;

&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;: the transducer length. 
   
The incidence angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and the central frequency &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; of the filter are defined by the following set of equations,&lt;ref name="filter"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(7) \ n_\varphi = \frac{n_0 n_e}{\sqrt{n_0^2 \cos \varphi + n_e^2 \sin^2 \varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(8) \ f_i(\varphi)=\frac{\nu}{\lambda}\left[n_\varphi\cos(\varphi+\alpha)\pm\sqrt{n_0^2 - n_\varphi^2(\varphi)\sin^2(\varphi+\alpha)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Refractive indices of the ordinary (&lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt;) and extraordinary (&lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;) polarized beams are determined by taking into account their dispersive dependence.

The sound velocity, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, depends on the angle α, such that,&lt;ref name="filter"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(9) \ \nu (\alpha) = \nu_{110} \sqrt{\cos^2\alpha + \left(\frac{\nu_{001}}{\nu_{110}}\right)^2 \sin^2\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_{110}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{001}&lt;/math&gt; are the sound velocities along the axes [110] and [001], consecutively. The value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the angles &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="filter"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(10) \ \alpha_\ell = \varphi + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

The angle &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; between the diffracted and non-diffracted beams defines the view field of the filter; it can be calculated from the formula,&lt;ref name="filter"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(11) \ \beta = \arcsin \left( \frac{\lambda f_0}{n_0 \nu} \sin \alpha + \varphi \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Input light need not be polarized for a non-collinear design. Unpolarized input light is scattered into orthogonally polarized beams separated by the scattering angle for the particular design and wavelength. If the optical design provides an appropriate beam block for the unscattered light, then two beams (images) are formed in an optical passband that is nearly equivalent in both orthogonally linearly polarized output beams (differing by the Stokes and Anti-Stokes scattering parameter). Because of dispersion, these beams move slightly with scanning rf frequency.

===Acousto-optic deflectors===

An acousto-optic deflector spatially controls the optical beam.  In the operation of an acousto-optic deflector the power driving the acoustic transducer is kept on, at a constant level, while the acoustic frequency is varied to deflect the beam to different angular positions.  The acousto-optic deflector makes use of the acoustic frequency dependent diffraction angle, where a change in the angle &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta_d&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the change in frequency &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is given as,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title =Acousto-optic effect: Deflector
  | url =http://www.mt-berlin.com/frames_ao/descriptions/ao_deflectors.htm
  | accessdate = 2007-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; (12) \ \Delta \theta_d = \frac{\lambda}{\nu}\Delta f&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the optical wavelength of the beam and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the acoustic wave.

AOD technology has made practical the [[Bose–Einstein condensation]] for which the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to Eric A. Cornell, Wolfgang Ketterle and Carl E. Wieman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/illpres/ The Nobel Prize in Physics 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another application of acoustic-optical deflection is optical trapping of small molecules.

AODs are essentially the same as [[acousto-optic modulator]]s (AOMs).  In an AOM, only the amplitude of the sound wave is modulated (to modulate the intensity of the diffracted laser beam), whereas in an AOD, both the amplitude and frequency are adjusted, making the engineering requirements tighter for an AOD than an AOM.

==Materials==
Some materials displaying acousto-optic effect include [[fused silica]],lithium niobate, [[arsenic trisulfide]], [[tellurium dioxide]] and [[tellurite]] glasses, [[lead silicate]], [[germanium-arsenic-sulfide|Ge&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[mercury(I) chloride]], [[lead(II) bromide]], and other materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7050">'''Aesthetics of nature''' is a sub-field of [[ethics|philosophical ethics]], and refers to the study of natural objects from their [[aesthetics|aesthetical]] perspective.

==History==
Aesthetics of nature developed as a sub-field of philosophical ethics. In the 18th and 19th century, the aesthetics of nature advanced the concepts of disinterestedness, the pictures, and the introduction of the idea of positive aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Carlson2012&gt;
{{cite book

  |accessdate=2 October 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major developments of nature occurred in the 18th century. The concept of disinterestedness had been explained by many thinkers. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper]] introduced the concept as a way of characterizing the notion of the aesthetic, later magnified by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who expanded it to exclude personal and utilitarianism interests and associations of a more general nature from aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961&gt;
{{cite journal

  |year=1961
  |title=Of the Origins of ‘Aesthetic Disinterestedness’
  |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism
  |volume=20|pages=131–143
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept was further developed by [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] who referred it to a particular state of mind.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961/&gt;

==Theories==
The theory of disinterestedness opened doors for a better understanding of the aesthetics dimensions of nature in terms of three conceptualizations: 
# The idea of beautiful: this applied to tamed and cultivated European gardens and landscapes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The idea of the sublime: this explained the threatening and terrifying side of nature such as mountains and wilderness; however, when it is viewed through the disinterestedness perspective, it can be aesthetically appreciated rather than feared or neglected&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The notion of the picturesque: the term "picturesque" means "picture-like", where the natural world is experienced as if it is divided into art-like scenes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;

Objects experienced as beautiful tend to be small, smooth, and fair in color.&lt;ref name=Conron2000&gt;

Cognitive and non-cognitive approaches of nature have directed their focus from natural environments to the consideration of human and human influenced environments and developed aesthetic investigations of everyday life.(Carlson and Lintott, 2007; Parsons 2008a; Carlson 2010){{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Human Perspectives and Relationship with Nature==
People may be mistaken by the [[objet d'art|art object]] analogy. For instance, a [[sandhill crane]] is not an art object; an art object is not a sandhill crane. In fact, an art object should be called an ''artifact''.&lt;ref name=Rolston2002&gt;

In elaboration, the crane lives through various ecosystems such as Yellowstone. Nature is a living system which includes animals, plants, and Eco-systems. In contrast, an art object has no regeneration, evolutionary history, or metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;

An '''anticyclonic storm''' is a weather [[storm]] where winds around the storm flow in the direction opposite to that of the flow about a [[Low pressure area|region of low pressure]]. 

==Description==
In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], anticyclonic storms involve clockwise wind flow; in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], they involve counterclockwise wind flow.

[[Anticyclonic]] storms usually form around [[pressure system|high-pressure systems]]. These do not "contradict" the [[Coriolis effect]]; it predicts such anticyclonic flow about high-pressure regions. Anticyclonic storms, as high-pressure systems, usually accompany cold weather and are frequently a factor in large [[snowstorm]]s. [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] [[Great Red Spot]] is a well-known non-terrestrial example of an anticyclonic system.

[[Anticyclonic tornado]]es often occur;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jack. ''The Weather Book''. New York: Vintage Books, 1992. Pages 118,122.&lt;/ref&gt; while tornadoes' [[vortex|vortices]] are low-pressure regions, this occurs because tornadoes occur on a small enough scale such that the Coriolis effect is negligible.

==Examples==
* 25 February 2018 – 4 March: [[2017–18_European_windstorm_season#The_Beast_from_the_East_cold_wave|Hartmut]], an exceptionally strong anticyclone whose winds peaked at 187 km/h (116 mph) and whose central pressure peaked at 1056 hPa, both in Scandinavia. This anticyclonic storm with hurricane-force maximum gusts channeled freezing air from a Siberian airmass all over Europe, triggering the ''Beast from the East'', a deadly [[cold wave]] with historical significance. Having dropped large amounts of snow in some European areas, Hartmut was a rare instance of an "anticyclonic blizzard". The interaction of Anticyclone Hartmut and [[2017–18_Western_Europe_windstorm_season#Emma|Cyclone Emma]] intensified the wind and snowfall threat in Western Europe, particularly on the [[British Isles]].

'''''Araucaria bidwillii''''', the '''bunya pine''', is a large [[evergreen]] [[conifer]]ous tree in the plant family [[Araucariaceae]]. It is found naturally in south-east [[Queensland]] Australia and two small disjunct populations in [[Queensland tropical rain forests|north eastern Queensland's]] [[Wet Tropics of Queensland|World Heritage listed Wet Tropics]]. There are many old planted specimens in [[New South Wales]], and around the [[Perth, Western Australia]] metropolitan area. They can grow up to {{convert|30-45|m|abbr=on}}.  The tallest presently living is one in Bunya Mountains National Park, Queensland which was reported by Robert Van Pelt in January 2003 to be {{convert|169|ft|sigfig=3}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conifers.org/ar/Araucaria_bidwillii.php|title=Araucaria bidwillii (Bunya pine) description|website=www.conifers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bunya pine is the last surviving species of the Section ''Bunya'' of the genus ''Araucaria''. This section was diverse and widespread during the [[Mesozoic]] with some species having cone morphology similar to ''A. bidwillii'', which appeared during the [[Jurassic]]. [[Fossil]]s of Section ''Bunya'' are found in South America and Europe. The scientific name honours the botanist [[John Carne Bidwill]], who came across it in 1842 and sent the first specimens to [[William Jackson Hooker|Sir William Hooker]] in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=London Journal of Botany|year=1843|volume=II|pages=498–506|title=Figure and Description of a new species of Araucaria, from Moreton Bay, New Holland, detected by J. T. Bidwill, Esq.|url=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753002435102#page/498/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Native in Queensland, historically trees were found in populations recorded as abundant and widespread in suitable habitats of [[South East Queensland]] and [[Wide Bay-Burnett]] ([[Regions of Queensland|regions]]). In these regions of Queensland the natural ecosystems growing Bunya Pines have sustained European agricultural occupation and have been fragmented now into the areas of the [[Blackall Range]], [[Bunya Mountains]], upper [[Brisbane River]] reaches and upper [[Mary River (Queensland)|Mary River]] valley. Natural ecosystems having Bunya pines are found again approximately {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north, in the wet tropics region of north eastern Queensland. There the species natural populations are rare and restricted. Two outlying restricted populations are known in the Cannabullen Falls and Mt. Lewis areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conifer Database in Catalogue of Life|url=http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2009/show_species_details.php?record_id=5647836|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RFK6.1&gt;{{RFK6.1 |url= http://keys.trin.org.au:8080/key-server/data/0e0f0504-0103-430d-8004-060d07080d04/media/Html/taxon/Araucaria_bidwillii.htm |accessdate= 12 Mar 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A. bidwillii'' has a limited distribution within Australia in part because of the drying out of Australia with loss of rainforest and poor seed dispersal. The remnant sites at the [[Bunya Mountains]] and Mount Lewis in Queensland have genetic diversity. The cones are large, soft-shelled and nutritious and fall intact to the ground beneath the tree before dehiscing. The suggestion that extinct large animals – perhaps dinosaurs and later, large mammals – may have been dispersers for the Bunya is reasonable, given the seeds' size and energy content, but difficult to confirm given the incompleteness of the fossil record for [[coprolites]].

At the start of European occupation, ''A. bidwillii'' occurred in great abundance in southern Queensland, to the extent that a Bunya Bunya Reserve was declared in 1840 to protect its habitat. The tree once grew as large groves or sprinkled regularly as an emergent species throughout other forest types on the Upper [[Stanley River (Queensland)|Stanley]] and [[Brisbane River]]s, Sunshine Coast hinterland (especially the [[Blackall Range]] near [[Montville, Queensland|Montville]] and [[Maleny, Queensland|Maleny]]), and also towards and on the Bunya Mountains. Today, the species is usually encountered as very small groves or single trees in its former range, except on and near the Bunya Mountains, where it is still fairly prolific.

==Ecology==
[[File:Araucaria bidwillii single cone.JPG|thumb|Whole cone]]
''A. bidwillii'' has unusual cryptogeal seed germination in which the seeds develop to form an underground tuber from which the aerial shoot later emerges. The actual emergence of the seed is then known to occur over several years presumably as a strategy to allow the seedlings to emerge under optimum climatic conditions or, it has been suggested, to avoid fire. This erratic germination has been one of the main problems in [[silviculture]] of the species.

The [[conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|20|–|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and can weigh as much as 18&amp;nbsp;kg (40&amp;nbsp;lb)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/10/13/man-severely-hurt-by-massive-pine-cone-in-san-francisco-sues-government-park-service/|title=Man severely hurt by massive pine cone in San Francisco sues government and park service|publisher=CBS San Francisco|date=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are opened by large birds, such as [[cockatoo]]s, or disintegrate when mature to release the large {{convert|3|–|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[seed]]s or nuts.

Although there are no reported dispersal agents for the seeds of ''A.&amp;nbsp;bidwillii'', macropods and various species of rats are known as predators of the seeds and tubers. The bush rat (''[[Rattus fuscipes]]'') was observed caching bunya seeds some distance uphill from parent trees, possibly allowing ridge-top germination. [[Brushtail possums]] (''Trichosurus spp.)'' were mentioned as carrying the seeds up trees. In a study in 2006, the short-eared possum (''[[Trichosurus caninus]]'') was shown to disperse the seed of ''A.&amp;nbsp;bidwillii''.

Natural populations of this species have been reduced in extent and abundance through exploitation for its timber, the construction of dams and historical clearing. Most populations are now protected in formal reserves and national parks.

A recent problem in small forestry plantations of ''A.&amp;nbsp;bidwilli'' in Southeast Queensland is the introduction of red deer (''[[Cervus elaphus]]''). Red deer, unlike possums and rodents, eat bunya cones while still intact, preventing their dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;Smith I.R (2007) Feral deer in south-east Queensland: a right royal nuisance. ''Newsletter of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland'' (WPSQ) Summer Quarterly No. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
The ''bunya'', ''bonye'', ''bunyi'' or ''bunya-bunya'' in various [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] was colloquially named the Bunya Pine by Europeans. However, ''Araucaria bidwillii'' is not a pine tree (of the genus ''[[Pinus]]''). It belongs to the same genus as the monkey puzzle tree (''[[Araucaria araucana]]'') and is commonly referred to as the "false monkey puzzle".

The Bunya tree grows to a height of 30–45 metres, and the cones, which contain the edible kernels, are the size of footballs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anpsa.org.au/a-bid.html|title=Araucaria bidwillii|website=anpsa.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ripe cones fall to the ground. Each segment contains a kernel in a tough protective shell, which will split when boiled or put in a fire. The flavour of the kernel is similar to a chestnut.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

A Bunya festival was recorded by [[Thomas Petrie|Thomas (Tom) Petrie]] (1831–1910), who went with the Aboriginal people of Brisbane at the age of 14 to the festival at the Bunya Range (now the Blackall Range in the hinterland area of the Sunshine Coast). His daughter, Constance Petrie, put down his stories in which he said that the trees fruited at three-year intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anpsa.org.au/APOL8/dec97-3.html|title=Bunya Feast|accessdate=16 February 2012|website=anpsa.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-year interval may not be correct. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] wrote in 1844 of his expedition to the Bunya feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ludwig Leichhardt (on the bushfood trail) |journal=Australian Bushfoods Magazine |year=1997 |issue=1 |url=http://www.ausbushfoods.com/backissues/Issue1/issue_1_13.htm |accessdate=30 October 2012 |issn=1447-0489 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105202527/http://www.ausbushfoods.com/backissues/Issue1/issue_1_13.htm |archivedate=5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia' records that "The cones shed their seeds, which are two to two and a-half inches long by three-quarters of an inch broad ; they are sweet before being perfectly ripe, and after that resemble roasted chestnuts in taste. They are plentiful once in three years, and when the ripening season arrives, which is generally in the month of January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=J. H. Maiden | year=1889 | title=The useful native plants of Australia : Including Tasmania | publisher= Turner and Henderson, Sydney | url=https://primo-slnsw.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=SLNSW_ALMA21105097830002626&amp;context=L&amp;vid=SLNSW&amp;search_scope=EEA&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Bunya trees pollinate in South East Queensland in September, October and the cones fall seventeen to eighteen months later in late January to early March from the coast to the current [[Bunya Mountains]]. When there is heavy rainfall or drought, pollination may vary. The large festival harvests may vary between two and seven years. When the fruit was ripe, the people of the region would set aside differences and gather in the Bon-yi Mountains (Bunya Mountains) to feast on the kernels.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

As the fruit ripened, locals, who were bound by custodial obligations and rights, sent
out messengers to invite people from hundreds of kilometres to meet at specific sites. The meetings involved ceremonies, dispute settlements and fights, marriage arrangements and the trading of goods. The Aborigines' fierce protection of the trees and recognition of the value of the timber, led to colonial authorities prohibiting settlers from cutting the trees in the 1842. The resource was too valuable, and the aboriginals were driven out of the forests along with the ability to run the festivals. The forests were felled for timber and cleared to make way for cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/environhist/links/publications/anzfh/anzfh2haebich.pdf Assimilating the bunya forests Anna Haebich Centre for Public Culture and Ideas, Griffith University, Queensland (viewed 16 February 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In what was probably Australia's largest indigenous event, diverse tribes – up to thousands of people – once travelled great distances (from as far as Charleville, Dubbo, Bundaberg and Grafton) to the gatherings. They stayed for months, to celebrate and feast on the bunya nut. The bunya gatherings were an armistice accompanied by much trade exchange, and discussions and negotiations over marriage and regional issues. Due to the sacred status of the bunyas, some tribes would not camp amongst these trees. Also in some regions, the tree was never to be cut.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, P., 2002.

Indigenous groups such as the [[Wakka Wakka|Wakawaka]], [[Githabul]], [[Kabi Kabi]], [[Jarowair]], [[Goreng goreng]], [[Butchulla]], [[Quandamooka]], [[Baruŋgam]] , [[Yiman]] and [[Wulili]]  have continued cultural and spiritual connections to the Bunya Mountains to this day, a number of strategies including the use of traditional ecological knowledge have been incorporated into the current management practices of the national park and conservation reserves with the Bunya Murri Ranger project currently operating in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Markwell Consulting, 2010.

[[File:A Bunya Araucaria bidwillii cone.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A comparison on how large the cones can grow]]
[[Indigenous Australians]] eat the nut of the bunya tree both raw and cooked (roasted, and in more recent times boiled), and also in its immature form. Traditionally, the nuts were additionally ground and made into a paste, which was eaten directly or cooked in hot coals to make [[Bush bread|bread]]. The nuts were also stored in the mud of running creeks, and eaten in a fermented state. This was considered a delicacy.

Apart from consuming the nuts, indigenous Australians ate bunya shoots, and utilised the tree's bark as kindling.

Bunya nuts are still sold as a regular food item in grocery stalls and street-side stalls around rural southern Queensland. Some farmers in the Wide Bay/ Sunshine Coast regions have experimented with growing bunya trees commercially for their nuts and timber.

Since the mid-1990s, the Australian company [[Maton]] has used bunya for the soundboards of its BG808CL Performer acoustic guitars. The [[Cole Clark]] company (also Australian) uses bunya for the majority of its acoustic guitar soundboards. The timber is valued by cabinet makers and woodworkers, and has been used for that purpose for over a century.

However, its most popular use is as a '[[bushfood]]' by indigenous foods enthusiasts. A huge variety of home-invented recipes now exists for the bunya nut; from pancakes, biscuits and breads, to casseroles, to 'bunya nut pesto' or hoummus. The nut is considered nutritious, with a unique flavour similar to starchy potato and chestnut.

When the nuts are boiled in water, the water turns red, making a flavoursome tea.

The nutritional content of the bunya nut is: 40% water, 40% complex carbohydrates, 9% protein, 2% fat, 0.2% potassium, 0.06% magnesium.&lt;ref name="ausbush"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ausbushfoods.com/old/Resources/Bunya_components.htm |title=Composition of the Bunya nut |publisher=Australian Bushfoods magazine |accessdate=24 January 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also gluten free, making bunya nut flour a substitute for people with gluten intolerance.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Araucaria bidwillii cultivation.jpg|thumb|A pair of bunya seedlings showing the change in leaf colour. The [[cotyledon]]s are [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]], remaining below the ground.]]
Bunya nuts are slow to germinate. A set of 12 seeds sown in Melbourne took an average of about six months to germinate (with the first germinating in 3 months) and only developed roots after 1 year. The first leaves form a rosette and are dark brown. The leaves only turn green once the first stem branch occurs. Unlike the mature leaves, the young leaves are relatively soft. As the leaves age they become very hard and sharp. [[Cuttings (plants)|Cuttings]] can be successful, though they must be taken from erect growing shoots, as cuttings from side shoots will not grow upright.

In the highly variable Australian climate, the spread of actual emergence of the bunya maximises the possibility of at least successful replacement of the parent tree.

[[File:Ciudad E 1.jpg|thumb|right|A mushroom rock, Ciudad Encantada.]]
The '''Ciudad Encantada''' (English: Enchanted City) is a geological site near the city of [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], in the autonomous community of [[Castilla-La Mancha]], [[Spain]] in which the [[erosion|erosive forces]] of weather and the waters of the nearby [[Júcar|Júcar river]] have formed rocks into distinctive and memorable shapes.&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=100|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was declared a Natural Site of National Interest on 11 June 1929.

==Origin of the formations==
The rock formations of Ciudad Encantada are [[karst]] formations made of [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]], which date back to the [[Cretaceous]] period, approximately 90 million years ago.&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; Rain falling on the original limestone plateau wore down the porous limestone, leaving behind the more resistant dolomite. Because the dolomite was not always distributed evenly in the original rock, the result was the irregularly eroded shapes that form the Ciudad Encantada.&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt;

==Shapes of rocks==
The rock formations that have been named include:

{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Mushroom rocks]] ''Seta'' ('Mushroom')
* ''Puente'' ('Bridge')
* ''Cara'' ('Face')
* ''Convento'' ('Convent')
* ''El mar de piedra'' (The stone sea)
* ''Teatro'' ('Theatre')
* ''Hipopótamos'' ('Hippopotami')
* ''Amantes'' ('Lovers')
* ''La foca'' (The seal)
* ''La tortuga'' (the turtle)
* ''Los osos'' (the bears)
}}

==In film and television==
Ciudad Encantada appears as a location in the following films:

* ''[[The Colossus of Rhodes (film)|The Colossus of Rhodes]]'', 1962
* ''[[A Professional Gun]]'', 1968.
* ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'', 1969.
* ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'', 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3151">The '''cold drop''' ({{lang-es|gota fría}}) is a weather phenomenon often occurring in the Spanish autumn. It is experienced particularly along the western Mediterranean and as such, most frequently affects the east coast of Spain. It is a closed upper-level low which has become completely displaced ([[Block_(meteorology)#Cut-off highs and lows|cut off]]) from basic westerly current, and moves independently of that current. Cutoff lows may remain nearly stationary for days, or on occasion may move westward opposite to the prevailing flow aloft (i.e., retrogression).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=cutoff%20low |title=NOAA's National Weather Service - Glossary |publisher=Forecast.weather.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe the meteorological phenomenon associated. In Spain, it appears when a front of very cold polar air, a [[jet stream]], advances slowly over Western Europe, at high altitude (normally 5–9&amp;nbsp;km or 3–5.5&amp;nbsp;mi).

==Spanish case==

If a sudden cut off in the stream takes place, caused by various reasons, like the effect of the high pressures, a pocket of cold air detaches from the main jet stream, penetrating to the south over the [[Pyrenees]] into the warm air in [[Spain]], causing its most dramatic effects in the Southeast of Spain, particularly along the Spanish [[Mediterranean]] coast, especially in the [[Valencian Community]].

This phenomenon is associated with extremely violent downpours and storms, with speeds of 100–200&amp;nbsp;km (60–120&amp;nbsp;mi)/hour, but not always accompanied by significant rainfall. For this it is necessary that the high atmospheric torrential rain instability in the lower air layers to combine with a significant amount of water vapors. Such a combination causes the masses of cold air to rapidly discharge up to 500&amp;nbsp;liters per square meter in extremely rapid rain episodes. This phenomenon usually lasts a very short time, (from a few hours to a maximum of four days) as it exhausts its water reserves without receiving a new supply.

The clouds are formed in the Atlantic Ocean. The more extreme the difference in temperature, the more water is stored in the clouds. The Cold Drop can produce snow or hail.

This way a great mass of cold air rotates and floats like a drop over a warm area.

The torrential rain caused by cold drop can result in devastation caused by torrents and [[flash floods]]. For instance, the [[1957 Valencia flood|great Valencia flood of 1957]] was the result of a 3-day-long cold drop.

===In fiction===
A sudden rain over [[Valencia]] is a plot element in the 2016 Spanish thriller ''[[Cien años de perdón]]''.

The '''cubic mile of oil''' ('''CMO''') is a [[units of energy|unit of energy]]. It was created by  [[Hewitt Crane|Hew Crane]] of [[SRI International]] to aid in public understanding of global-scale energy consumption and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crane|first=Hewitt|authorlink=Hewitt Crane |author2=Edwin Kinderman |author3=Ripudaman Malhotra |title=A Cubic Mile of Oil|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|date=June 2010|isbn=978-0-19-532554-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant sources of energy include oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and biomass (primarily the burning of wood). Other energy sources include geothermal, wind, photovoltaic, and solar thermal. The various energy units commonly used to measure these sources (e.g., [[joule]]s, [[BTU]]s, [[kilowatt hour]]s, [[therm]]s) are only somewhat familiar to the general public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhacd.org/docs/welcome_energy_basics.pdf|title="Energy and the Environment" - The Basics|work=2007 New Hampshire Envirothon|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their relationships can be confusing.&lt;ref&gt;"The mixture of terms for essentially one entity (energy) leads to confusion, especially among citizens who need to be aware, now more than ever, of energy consumption patterns." http://www.justjoules.org/&lt;/ref&gt; These common energy units are sized for everyday activities (a joule is the energy required to lift a small apple one metre vertically). For regional, national, and global scales, larger energy units, such as the [[exajoule]], the [[Barrel of oil equivalent|billion barrels of oil equivalent]] (BBOE) and the [[Quad (energy)|quad]] are used. Derived by multiplying the small common units by large [[scientific notation|powers of ten]] these larger units pose additional conceptual difficulties for many citizens.&lt;ref name=BigNumbers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/quantskills/methods/quantlit/BigNumbers.html|title=Big Numbers and Scientific Notation|last=Wenner|first=Jennifer M.|work=Teaching Quantitative Skills in the Geosciences|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crane intended the cubic mile of oil to provide a visualizable scale for comparing the contributions of these diverse energy components as a percentage of total worldwide, energy use.

The global economy consumes approximately 30 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[Barrel#For storage of oil|barrels of oil]] (1.26 [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] U.S. gallons or 4.75 trillion litres) each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Energy Bulletin
 |last=Aleklett
 |first=Kjell
 |date=   25 April 2005
 |accessdate=2008-12-06
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers of this magnitude are difficult to conceive by most people.&lt;ref name=BigNumbers /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Innumeracy (book)|Innumeracy]] |last=Paulos |first=John allen |authorlink= |year=1988 |publisher=[[Hill and Wang]] |location=New York |isbn=0-8090-7447-8 |pages=135 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume occupied by one trillion U.S. gallons is about one cubic mile. Crane felt that a cubic mile would be an easier concept for the general public than a trillion gallons.

==Definition and energy equivalents==
The CMO is &lt;!--an approximation of --?--&gt;the energy released by burning a [[cubic mile]] of oil. Conversions to other units may be calculated based on the [[barrel of oil equivalent]] (BOE), an approximation of the energy released by burning one 42-US-gallon barrel of crude oil. Since one BOE is about {{val|5.8|e=6|u=BTU}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-99-18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and one cubic mile is about {{val|2.62|e=10|u=barrels}}:&lt;ref&gt;

[[Oil reserves|Proved oil reserves]] are those that can be extracted with reasonable certainty under existing conditions using existing technology. Global proved oil reserves are estimated at approximately {{convert|1300|Goilbbl}}.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to roughly 43 cubic miles, or 43 CMO. At the current rate of use, this would last about 40 years. Technological advances, new discoveries, and political changes will likely lead to additional proved oil reserves in the future. Concurrently, the [[International Energy Agency]] predicted in its 2005 [[World Energy Outlook]] that the annual consumption will increase by 50% by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Coal and natural gas currently provide 1.42 CMO of energy per year.  Global reserves of these fossil resources are as follows:
* Natural gas reserves total 42 CMOs (69 years at current consumption)
* Coal reserves total 121 CMOs (150 years at current consumption)
* Additionally, there are large, albeit uncertain, amounts of tar sands, shale gas, and other unconventional fossil sources

==Replacement of oil by alternative sources==
While oil has many other important uses (lubrication, plastics, roadways, roofing) this section considers only its use as an energy source.

The CMO is a powerful means of understanding the difficulty of replacing oil energy by other sources. SRI International chemist [[Ripudaman Malhotra]], working with Crane and colleague [[Ed Kinderman]], used it to describe the [[Energy crisis#Catastrophe|looming energy crisis]] in sobering terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jan07/4820 Joules, BTUs, Quads-Let's Call the Whole Thing Off - IEEE Spectrum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Malhotra illustrates the problem of producing one CMO energy that we currently derive from oil each year from five different alternative sources. Installing capacity to produce 1 CMO per year requires long and significant development.

Allowing fifty years to develop the requisite capacity, 1 CMO of energy per year could be produced by any one of these developments:
* 4 [[Three Gorges Dam]]s,&lt;ref&gt;at rated 18 gigawatts&lt;/ref&gt; developed each year for 50 years, ''or''
* 52 [[nuclear power plant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;at 1.1 gigawatts, such as the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]]&lt;/ref&gt; developed each year for 50 years, ''or''
* 104 [[fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]],&lt;ref&gt;at 500 megawatts&lt;/ref&gt; developed each year for 50 years, ''or''
* 32,850 [[wind turbine]]s,&lt;ref&gt;A large turbine with 70-100 meter blade span, rated at 1.65 MW.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/wind_turbines/index.jsp General Electric Wind Turbines]&lt;/ref&gt; developed each year for 50 years, ''or''
* 91,250,000 rooftop [[Photovoltaic module|solar photovoltaic panels]]&lt;ref&gt;a typical 2.1 kW panel&lt;/ref&gt; developed each year for 50 years
The [[energy]] produced is the [[Power (physics)|power]] rating of the source multiplied by the duration it is operational. These comparisons take into account the variability of available power (solar panels work only during the day, turbines work only when the wind blows). Also, whereas 1 kWh is equivalent to 3412 BTU of primary energy, in practice it takes closer to 10,000 BTU to produce 1 kWh of electricity from coal and other fossil sources. Thus, when considering sources such as wind and solar which directly produce electricity, the required installed capacity was calculated by using 1 kWh as equivalent to 10,000 BTU.

The environmental, social, and financial costs of such development projects are immense:
*The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest, flooding 632&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, displacing 1.25 million people, and costing roughly US$30 billion.
*A conventional nuclear power plant produces hazardous [[radioactive waste]], raises fears of [[radiation]] or [[nuclear proliferation]], requires 10 years to construct for a 40-year lifetime, occupies about 4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and may cost upwards of US$5 billion.
* A 500 MW coal-fired power plant may contribute to [[acid rain]], [[global warming]], and [[air pollution]], occupies about 2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, may obtain its fuel via controversial methods such as [[mountaintop removal]], and costs about US$650 million.
* A large wind turbine requires a location with an abundance of steady wind, may be [[Environmental effects of wind power#Aesthetics|visually obtrusive]], can interfere with aviation, needs about 0.16&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to avoid interfering with adjacent turbines, and costs about US$2 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunjournal.com/story/226451-3/Business/Wind_turbine_shortage_continues_costs_rising/&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2.1&amp;nbsp;kW rooftop solar array requires [[Electrician|technical skills]] for installation, needs a sunny location, presents few aesthetic or environmental problems, covers about 14 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but costs around US$15,000.

For comparison, US$3.2 trillion is the approximate [[gross domestic product]] of Germany, China, or the United Kingdom. The total land area of New Zealand is approximately {{convert|270000|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Facts|url=http://www.ace.net.nz/larryogden/facts.html|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 2008 market price of US$120 per barrel (US$750/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the cost of one CMO was about US$3 trillion. So for the cost of about one year's global oil consumption at 2008 market prices, enough wind turbines could be built to generate the same energy for 40 years, assuming sites are available.

==Replacement of oil by speculative alternative sources==

[[Space-based solar power]] offers one way [[StratoSolar]] offers another.  At ~5 TW per CMO/yr, it would take about 1000 five GW power satellites to replace a CMO.  To compete with coal, the maximum cost for space based solar power plants would be $2.4 B/GW. At that, the cost would be ~$2.4 T for one CMO or ~$7.2 T to replace the entire fossil fuel use of humans.  There is room in GEO for more than ten times the current energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stine|first=G. Harry|authorlink=G. Harry Stine |title=Space Power|publisher=National Space Society USA|date=1981}}[http://www.nss.org:8080/settlement/ssp/spacepower/spacepower06.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  At a peak production of 315 new power satellites per year, it would take less than a decade to get off fossil fuels.

StratoSolar has the advantage that solar can be tapped at 20&amp;nbsp;km regardless of the local weather.

In both cases, a huge energy flow to carbon neutral synthetic fuel plants would be required to replace the oil used for transportation.  The technology for making synthetic transport fuels is well understood.  See [[Oryx GTL]]

'''Cultural evolution''' is an [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] of [[social change]]. It follows from the definition of [[culture]] as "information capable of affecting individuals' behavior that they acquire from other members of their species through teaching, imitation and other forms of social transmission".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54806438|title=Not by genes alone : how culture transformed human evolution|last=J.|first=Richerson, Peter|date=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Boyd, Robert, 1948-|isbn=0226712842|location=Chicago|oclc=54806438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural evolution is the change of this information over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://culturalevolutionsociety.org/story/What_is_Cultural_Evolution|title=What is Cultural Evolution|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural evolution, historically also known as [[sociocultural evolution]], was originally developed in the 19th century by anthropologists stemming from [[Charles Darwin]]'s research on [[evolution]]. Today, cultural evolution has become the basis for a growing field of scientific research in the social sciences, including anthropology, economics, psychology and organizational studies. Previously, it was believed that social change resulted from biological [[adaptation]]s, but anthropologists now commonly accept that social changes arise in consequence of a combination of social, evolutionary and biological influences.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/cultural-evolution|title=cultural evolution {{!}} social science|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-cultural-evolution-170546|title=Cultural Evolution Theory Definition|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of different approaches to the study of cultural evolution, including [[dual inheritance theory]], [[sociocultural evolution]], [[memetics]], [[cultural evolutionism]] and other variants on [[cultural selection theory]]. The approaches differ not just in the history of their development and discipline of origin but in how they conceptualize the process of cultural evolution and the assumptions, theories and methods that they apply to its study. In recent years, there has been a convergence of the cluster of related theories towards seeing cultural evolution as a unified discipline in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mesoudi|first=Alex|last2=Whiten|first2=Andrew|last3=Laland|first3=Kevin N.|date=2006-08-01|title=Towards a unified science of cultural evolution|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=29|issue=4|pages=329–347; discussion 347–383|doi=10.1017/S0140525X06009083|issn=0140-525X|pmid=17094820}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Evolution: How Darwinian theory can explain human culture and synthesize the social sciences|last=Mesoudi|first=Alex|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2011|isbn=9780226520445|location=Chicago, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|Sociocultural evolution}}
[[Aristotle]] thought that development of cultural form (such as poetry) stops when it reaches its maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=7jzHK-bfxyIC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=Aristotle+and+His+Philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage|title=Aristotle and His Philosophy|first=Abraham|last=Edel|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Transaction Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=9781412817462}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873 in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]'', it was written: "By the principle which Darwin describes as natural selection short words are gaining the advantage over long words, direct forms of expression are gaining the advantage over indirect, words of precise meaning the advantage of the ambiguous, and local idioms are everywhere in disadvantage".&lt;ref&gt;''The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood'', by James Gleic, 2012, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural evolution, in the Darwinian sense of variation and selective inheritance, could be said to trace back to Darwin himself.&lt;ref name="Richerson&amp;Boyd 2010"&gt;Richerson, P.J. and Boyd. R. (2010) The Darwinian theory of human cultural evolution and gene-culture coevolution. Chapter 20 in ''Evolution Since Darwin: The First 150 Years''. M.A. Bell, D.J. Futuyma, W.F. Eanes, and J.S. Levinton, (eds.) Sinauer, pp. 561-588.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued for both customs (1874 p. 239) and "inherited habits" as contributing to human evolution, grounding both in the innate capacity for acquiring language.{{sfn |Darwin |1871 |p=74}}&lt;ref name="Richerson&amp;Boyd 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, I. (2012b) Organizational Ecologies and Declared Realities, In K. Alexander and I. Price (eds.) Managing Organizational Ecologies: Space, Management and Organization. New York, Routledge, 11-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's ideas, along with those of such as [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] and [[Quetelet]], influenced a number of what would now be called social scientists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Hodgson and Knudsen&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, G.M. and Knudsen, T. (2010). ''Darwin's Conjecture: The Search for General Principles of Social and Economic Evolution''. Chicago, University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; single out [[David George Ritchie]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]], crediting the former with anticipating both dual inheritance theory and universal Darwinism. Despite the stereotypical image of [[social Darwinism]] that developed later in the century, neither Ritchie nor Veblen were on the political right.

The early years of the 20th century and particularly the First World War saw biological concepts and metaphors shunned by most social sciences. Even uttering the word ''evolution'' carried "serious risk to one's intellectual reputation." Darwinian ideas were also in decline following the rediscovery of Mendelian genetics but were revived, especially by [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]], [[Haldane]] and [[Wright]], who developed the first population genetic models and as it became known the modern synthesis.

Cultural evolutionary concepts, or even metaphors, revived more slowly. If there was one influential individual in the revival it was probably [[Donald T. Campbell]]. In 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = D. T. | year = 1960 | title = Blind variation and selective retention in creative thought as in other knowledge processes | doi = 10.1037/h0040373 | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 67 | issue = 6| pages = 380–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; he drew on Wright to draw a parallel between genetic evolution and the "blind variation and selective retention" of creative ideas; work that was developed into a full theory of "socio-cultural evolution" in 1965&lt;ref name="Campbell, D. T. 1965"&gt;Campbell, D. T. (1965). "Variation and selective retention in socio-cultural evolution". Social Change in Developing Areas, a Reinterpretation of Evolutionary Theory.&lt;/ref&gt; (a work that includes references to other works in the then current revival of interest in the field. Campbell (1965 26) was clear that he understood cultural evolution not as an analogy "from organic evolution per se, but rather from a general model for quasiteleological processes for which organic evolution is but one instance".

Others pursued more specific analogies notably the anthropologist F. T. (Ted) Cloak who argued in 1975&lt;ref&gt;Cloak, F. T. (1975). "Is a Cultural Ethology Possible?". Human Ecology 3(3) 161–182.&lt;/ref&gt; for the existence of learnt cultural instructions (cultural corpuscles or i-culture) resulting in material artefacts (m-culture) such as wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Cloak, F. T. (1968). "Cultural Darwinism: Natural selection of the spoked wheel"&lt;/ref&gt; The argument thereby introduced as to whether cultural evolution requires neurological instructions continues to the present day {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}.

=== Unilinear theory ===
In the 19th century cultural evolution was thought to follow a unilineal pattern whereby all cultures progressively develop over time. The underlying assumption being that Cultural Evolution itself led to the growth and development of civilization &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unilinear cultural evolution - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803110706530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/anthropology/main-approaches-to-the-study-of-society-and-culture/cultural-evolutionism.php|title=Cultural Evolutionism, Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, Definition of Anthropology, Anthropology Definition, Physical Anthropology, Sociology Guide|website=www.sociologyguide.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] in the 17th Century declared indigenous culture to have "no arts, no letters, no society" and he described facing life as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." He, like other scholars of his time, reasoned that everything positive and esteemed resulted from the slow development away from this poor lowly state of being.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Under the theory of unilinear Cultural Evolution, all societies and cultures develop on the same path. The first to present a general unilineal theory was [[Herbert Spencer]]. Spencer suggested that humans develop into more complex beings as culture progresses, where people originally lived in "undifferentiated hordes" culture progresses and develops to the point where civilization develops hierarchies. The concept behind unilinear theory is that the steady accumulation of knowledge and culture leads to the separation of the various modern day sciences and the build-up of cultural norms present in modern-day society &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[Lewis H. Morgan]]'s book ''[[Ancient Society]]'' (1877), Morgan labels seven differing stages of human culture: lower, middle, and upper savagery; lower, middle, and upper barbarism; and civilization. He justifies this staging classification by referencing societies whose cultural traits resembled those of each of his stage classifications of the cultural progression. Morgan gave no example of lower savagery, as even at the time of writing few examples remained of this cultural type.  At the time of expounding his theory, Morgan's work was highly respected and became a foundation for much of anthropological study that was to follow.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Cultural particularism ====
There began a widespread condemnation of unilinear theory in the late 19th century. Unilinear cultural evolution implicitly assumes that culture was borne out of the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]]. That was seen by many to be racist, as it assumed that some individuals and cultures were more evolved than others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Franz Boas]], a German-born anthropologist, was the instigator of the movement known as 'cultural particularism' in which the emphasis shifted to a multilinear approach to cultural evolution. That differed to the unilinear approach that used to be favoured in the sense that cultures were no longer compared, but they were assessed uniquely. Boas, along with several of his pupils, notably [[Alfred L. Kroeber|A.L. Kroeber]], [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Margaret Mead]], changed the focus of anthropological research to the effect that instead of generalizing cultures, the attention was now on collecting empirical evidence of how individual cultures change and develop.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== Multilinear theory =====
Cultural particularism dominated popular thought for the first half of the 20th century before American anthropologists, including [[Leslie White|Leslie A. White]], [[Julian Steward|Julian H. Steward]], [[Marshall Sahlins|Marshall D. Sahlins]], and [[Elman Service|Elman R. Service]], revived the debate on cultural evolution. These theorists were the first to introduce the idea of multilinear cultural evolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Under multilinear theory, there are no fixed stages (as in unilinear theory) towards cultural development. Instead, there are several stages of differing lengths and forms. Although, individual cultures develop differently and cultural evolution occurs differently, multilinear theory acknowledges that cultures and societies do tend to develop and move forward.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=multilinear cultural evolution - oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100215750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leslie White|Leslie A. White]] focused on the idea that different cultures had differing amounts of 'energy', White argued that with greater energy societies could possess greater levels of social differentiation. He rejected separation of modern societies from primitive societies. In contrast, Steward argued, much like Darwin's theory of evolution, that culture adapts to its surroundings. 'Evolution and Culture' by Sahlins and Service is an attempt to condense the views of White and Steward into a universal theory of multilinear evolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Memetics===
{{Main article|Memetics}}
[[Richard Dawkins]]' 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' proposed the concept of the "[[meme]]", which is analogous to that of the gene. A meme is an idea-replicator that can reproduce itself, by jumping from mind to mind via the process of one human learning from another via imitation. Along with the "virus of the mind" image, the meme might be thought of as a "unit of culture" (an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour, etc.), which spreads among the individuals of a population. The variation and selection in the copying process enables Darwinian evolution among memeplexes and therefore is a candidate for a mechanism of cultural evolution. As memes are "selfish" in that they are "interested" only in their own success, they could well be in conflict with their biological host's genetic interests. Consequently, a "meme's eye" view might account for certain evolved cultural traits, such as suicide terrorism, that are successful at spreading meme of martyrdom, but fatal to their hosts and often other people.

===Evolutionary epistemology===
{{Main article|Evolutionary epistemology}}

"Evolutionary epistemology" can also refer to a theory that applies the concepts of biological evolution to the growth of human knowledge and argues that units of knowledge themselves, particularly scientific theories, evolve according to selection. In that case, a theory, like the [[germ theory of disease]], becomes more or less credible according to changes in the body of knowledge surrounding it.

Evolutionary epistemology is a naturalistic approach to epistemology, which emphasizes the importance of natural selection in two primary roles. In the first role, selection is the generator and maintainer of the reliability of our senses and cognitive mechanisms, as well as the "fit" between those mechanisms and the world. In the second role, trial and error learning and the evolution of scientific theories are construed as selection processes.

One of the hallmarks of evolutionary epistemology is the notion that empirical testing alone does not justify the pragmatic value of scientific theories but rather that social and methodological processes select those theories with the closest "fit" to a given problem. The mere fact that a theory has survived the most rigorous empirical tests available does not, in the calculus of probability, predict its ability to survive future testing. [[Karl Popper]] used [[Newtonian Physics|Newtonian physics]] as an example of a body of theories so thoroughly confirmed by testing as to be considered unassailable but were nevertheless overturned by [[Einstein]]'s bold insights into the nature of space-time. For the evolutionary epistemologist, all theories are true only provisionally, regardless of the degree of empirical testing they have survived.

Popper is considered by many to have given evolutionary epistemology its first comprehensive treatment, bur Donald T. Campbell had coined the phrase in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;(Schilpp, 1974)Schilpp, P. A., ed. The Philosophy of Karl R. Popper. LaSalle, IL. Open Court. 1974. See Campbell's essay, "Evolutionary Epistemology" on pp.&amp;nbsp;412–463.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dual Inheritance Theory ===
{{Main|Dual Inheritance Theory}}Taken from the main page:

'''Dual inheritance theory''' ('''DIT'''), also known as '''gene–culture coevolution''' or '''biocultural evolution''', was developed in the 1960s through early 1980s to explain how [[human behavior]] is a product of two different and interacting [[Evolution|evolutionary]] processes: [[genetic evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]]. Genes and culture continually interact in a feedback loop, changes in genes can lead to changes in culture which can then influence genetic selection, and vice versa. One of the theory's central claims is that culture evolves partly through a Darwinian selection process, which dual inheritance theorists often describe by analogy to genetic evolution."

== Criticism and controversy ==
As a relatively new and growing scientific field, cultural evolution is undergoing much formative debate. Some of the prominent conversations are revolving around [[Universal Darwinism]],&lt;ref name="Campbell, D. T. 1965"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cziko, Gary (1995) Without Miracles: Universal Selection Theory and the Second Darwinian Revolution (MIT Press)&lt;/ref&gt; dual inheritance theory,&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Wilson, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, New York, Knopf, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and memetics.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1989). The Selfish Gene (2nd ed.). United Kingdom: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-286092-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, Susan (1999) The Meme Machine (1st ed.).

More recently, cultural evolution has drawn conversations from multi-disciplinary sources with movement towards a unified view between the natural and social sciences. There remains some accusation of biological reductionism, as opposed to cultural naturalism, and scientific efforts are often mistakenly associated with [[Social Darwinism]]. However, some useful parallels between biological and social evolution still appear to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/36551094/On_Similarities_between_Biological_and_Social_Evolutionary_Mechanisms_Mathematical_Modeling Grinin, L., Markov, A., &amp; Korotayev, A. (2013). On similarities between biological and social evolutionary mechanisms: Mathematical modeling. Cliodynamics, 4(2).]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of historic approaches to Cultural Evolution: ===


Cultural evolution has been criticized over the past two centuries that it has advanced its development into the form it holds today. Morgan's theory of evolution implies that all cultures follow the same basic pattern. Human culture is not linear, different cultures develop in different directions and at differing paces, and it is not satisfactory or productive to assume cultures develop in the same way.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthrotheory.pbworks.com/w/page/29531638/Cultural%20Evolution#Critiques|title=Theory + Anthropology [licensed for non-commercial use only] / Cultural Evolution|website=anthrotheory.pbworks.com|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further key critique of cultural evolutionism is what is known as "armchair anthropology". The name results from the fact that many of the anthropologists advancing theories had not seen first hand the cultures they were studying. The research and data collected was carried out by explorers and missionaries as opposed to the anthropologists themselves. [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] was the epitome of that and did very little of his own research.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/24708|title=Disciplines and Institutions. What is Armchair Anthropology? – CRASSH|website=www.crassh.cam.ac.uk|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;Cultural evolution is also criticized for being [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]], cultures are still seen to be attempting to emulate western civilization. Under ethnocentricity, primitive societies are said to be not yet at the cultural levels of other western societies&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capesociology.org/evolutionary-theories-of-social-change|title=Evolutionary Theories of Social Change {{!}} Cape Sociology|website=capesociology.org|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the criticism aimed at cultural evolution is focused on the unilinear approach to social change. Broadly speaking in the second half of the 20th century the criticisms of cultural evolution have been answered by the [[Multilineal evolution|multilinear theory]]. Ethnocentricity, for example, is more prevalent under the unilinear theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Some recent approaches, such as Dual Inheritance Theory, make use of empirical methods including psychological and animal studies, field site research, and computational models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mesoudi|first=Alex|last2=Whiten|first2=Andrew|last3=Laland|first3=Kevin N.|date=2006/08|title=Towards a unified science of cultural evolution|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/towards-a-unified-science-of-cultural-evolution/1C5D36A6CCF1CA66A301A6693FEF4442|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=329–347|doi=10.1017/S0140525X06009083|issn=1469-1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In External Beam [[Radiotherapy]], transverse and longitudinal '''dose measurements''' are taken by a radiation detector in order to characterise the radiation beams from medical [[linear accelerators]]. Typically, an [[ionisation chamber]] and water phantom are used to create these radiation dose profiles. [[Water]] is used due to its tissue equivalence. 

[[Image:dose profile 15MV.gif|Central Axis Dose profile for 15MV photon beam incident on water phantom. Here the linear accelerator collimation projects a 1x1 cm2 field at isocentre i.e. 100 cm SSD]]

Transverse dose measurements are performed in the x (crossplane) or y (inplane) directions perpendicular to the radiation beam, and at a given depth (z) in the phantom. These are known dose profiles.
Dose measurements taken along the z direction create radiation dose distribution known as a depth-dose curve.

The [[Noon Universe]] is the setting of a series of [[Science fiction|science-fiction]] books written by [[Boris and Arkady Strugatsky]]. '''Earth''' is one of the planets populated by [[humans (Noon Universe)|humans]] in this setting, and is implied to be their origin. "Noon" Earth is identical in concept to real-life [[Earth]], but set in an alternate future, with the story taking place in the 22nd century. Earth is described in detail in ''[[Noon: 22nd Century]]'', which serves as the first in the ''Noon Universe'' series.

== Inhabitants ==

While humans also inhabit other planets in the Noon Universe, the humans of Earth and make up the most scientifically advanced [[Prisoners of Power#Book setting|civilization]] in the known universe. A single governing body called the [[#World Council|World Council]], composed of Earth's brightest scientists, philosophers, historians and strategists governs all the citizens of Earth. Many aspects of this governing system resemble the [[idealistic]] vision of [[communism]], which is strongly implied by the humans of Earth, who often refer to themselves as "communars."

== History ==
Earth in the Noon Universe is set in an alternate future, where the [[Soviet Union]] has managed to realize the ideals of communism proclaimed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] in the second half of 20th century, and spread these ideals peacefully over the planet. Soon afterwards the entire planet was united, all wars ceased and a (seemingly) [[utopian]] future began.

First of all, it was marked by extensive exploration of Earth's own secrets such as those the [[ocean]] and deep underground. However, more fascinating were the studies of [[space]]. At the beginning they were limited to exploration of the [[Solar System]] (see ''[[The Land of Crimson Clouds]]''), but with the invention of the [[#Interstellar Transport|photon engine]], inter-stellar flights became possible (see [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Ruzhena|Ruzhena]]). Simultaneously, due to various technological advances in other fields, by the end of the 21st century Earth was capable of satisfying all material needs of its citizens including [[spaceships]] for amateur exploration of the galaxy.

For more information about 22nd century, see [[Noon Universe Chronology]].

== Technology ==

The Earth's humans are the most technologically advanced civilization in the Noon Universe (except for [[Wanderers (Noon Universe)|Wanderers]] and maybe [[Tagorians]]). Some of their technologies utilize the well-known principles of [[physics]] while the others are rather of [[sci-fi]] nature.

=== Interstellar Transport ===

* '''Photon engine''' has replaced the normal &lt;!--liquid-fuel -- impulse atomic?--&gt;spaceship engines by the end of 20th and the beginning of 21st century. It utilizes energy of thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen-tritium plasma &lt;!--(the design also allows to use elementary [[matter]]-[[antimatter]] reactions) --&gt;combined with s.c. ''absolute reflector'', a material&lt;ref&gt;Absolute reflector is a product of mesoatomic chemistry, the science dealing with [[Muon#Muonic atoms|artificial atoms]], electron orbitals of which are replaced with [[muon]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting any (!) electromagnetic waves without loss, to create a propelling force capable of accelerating a spaceship up to [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] sub-light speeds. See ''[[The Land of Crimson Clouds]]'' for more info.
* '''Subspace jump''' has replaced the photon engine in the 21st century. This technology is based on the ''subspace physics'' and uses the "wrapping" of traditional space in order to achieve a condition in which a material body, e.g. a spaceship, is "stretched" between two points in space for a short time. This has nothing to do with traditional space travelling and is much more like teleportation but unlike ''null-T'' (see below) it is not applicable on a planet surface because of some technical restrictions. See ''[[Escape Attempt]]'' for more info.

=== Intraplanetar Transport ===

* '''Self-moving roads''' are much more a symbol of over-abundance on Earth in the beginning of 22nd century than a real transportation device. The principles of this technology are unknown, but visually they resemble 8-meter wide horizontal [[escalators]] crossing the continents of the planet in all directions. Apart from the main function, they are known for somehow purifying the environment of unwanted emissions and pollution. See ''[[Noon: 22nd Century]]'' for more info.
* '''Gliders''' and '''fliers''' are a very common in Noon Universe ''semi-living mechanisms'' (see below) capable of flying above the ground at a considerable speed, probably, utilizing some kind of anti-grav technology. They were commonly used even after the invention of ''null-T''.
* '''Zero-transport''' (often '''Zero-t''' or '''null-T''') is a sort of [[teleportation]] used in the Noon Universe. It was developed in the 2150s and widely applied on Earth in the second half of 22nd century. Zero-t is based on the so-called ''puncture of the Riemannian fold'' and actually goes against everything proclaimed by traditional theories of absolute space, [[time-space continuum]] and ''kappa-space''.&lt;br /&gt;In real life it is very simple: there are two ''zero-t booths'', a person steps into one of them, dials the code of the other one and in an instant he or she is in the second cabin, no matter how large the distance between them (in 2177, for example, progressors used zero-t to travel between Earth and [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Giganda|Giganda]]). It isn't mentioned anywhere in the books how the ''Wave'' problem, that devastated [[Rainbow (Noon Universe)|Rainbow]] in 2156, was solved. See ''[[Far Rainbow]]'' for more info.

Apart from these there are also more conventional transport means used on Earth like [[submarines]] and [[helicopters]], that probably remained from older times, but were, of course, modernized to match the safety requirements.

=== Synthesis ===

* '''Material synthesis''' is a technology that changes the elementary structure of matter in order to create new objects, e.g. golden coins out of wooden sawdust, virtually solving the [[philosopher's stone]] mystery. This includes duplicating objects (after a sample object) and creating objects of specific structure given by a program. Apparently, this is also the solution for [[pollution]] problems in the Noon Universe.
* '''Semi-living mechanisms''' are mechanisms utilizing advanced [[bionics]] technologies to function. They are grown out of eggs/[[embryos]] following a certain program assigned to them: "cleaning droid", "glider", "spaceship" etc. Once grown up they can regenerate and gather energy from the environment themselves acting as living organisms. They are often used on unexplored planets because embryonic eggs are very compact and easy to transport.

=== Medicine ===

* '''Bioblockade''' is one of the most brilliant inventions of the Noon Universe. "Bioblockade" is a common used word for ''foucamization'', a procedure that activates the full power of human [[immune system]], making those who underwent it nearly invulnerable towards all kinds of physical, chemical and biological harmful factors, as well as nuclear [[radiation]]. This technology became possible only after ''Dr. Mboga'' discovered the "bacterium of life" on [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Pandora|Pandora]] in 2119 AD.
* '''[[Pharmacology]]''' is what helps the people of Earth when the ''bioblockade'' is just not enough. [[Progressors]] are especially fond of them because they usually take much more damage while on duty than other humans do. Two of the most popular remedies are ''kasparamid'' (used to remove any effects of [[alcohol]] consumption from a human organism) and ''sporamin'' (used to temporarily restore maximal physical abilities to an exhausted or battered human body). See ''[[Hard to Be a God]]'' for more info on these two.
* Other medical technologies include: '''quasi-biological [[colloid]] mass''' used for treating serious wounds; '''psy-massage''' and '''psy-surgery''' (healing wounds with one's own mental energy); '''cyber-diagnosts''', devices, capable of inspecting human body for possible health problems and scanning human mind for emotions.

=== Information technology ===

* '''Great Allplanetary Informatorium''' ('''GAI''') is a huge database containing all information and knowledge ever obtained by a human. GAI is accessible from every computer on Earth and on its colonies although some topics are classified. The name probably derives from ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]''. Apart from scientific knowledge, there is also some information on each human born on Earth or its colonies stored in the Informatorium.
* '''Collector Of Dispersed Data''' ('''CODD''') is a colossal [[supercomputer]] capable of gathering information about the past and the present of its environment simply by inspecting it. CODD was built and launched in 2120 AD and, apart from its main purpose, used to solve various physical and even psychological problems.
* '''The Great Encoding''' of 2121 AD was the first attempt to record a human's identity onto an electronic medium. The experiment subject was [[oceanology|oceanologist]] ''Dr. Okada'' who nearly perished in a submarine accident. The scientists led by ''Dr. Kasparo'' tried to save him by "recording" him but at the 98% Dr. Okada died because of multiple injuries he suffered in the accident. The experiment required complete shutdown of all electronic devices save for those used for encoding. Also, clouds and rain were generated to limit solar radiation. Dr. Okada's identity was being recorded on large amounts of biomass stored in specially-designed containers. Had the attempt succeeded, Dr. Okada's mind would exist in an area the size of a small town.
* '''"The Devil's Dozen"''' were 13 scientists-enthusiasts who voluntarily merged themselves with the machines becoming [[cyborgs]]. Technically the project was a success, but eventually all participants self-destructed because of ''the cyborg psychological crisis''. The last of the Devil's Dozen was Camill, last spotted on Rainbow shortly before the catastrophe.
* '''Communication technologies''' used by Earth of Noon Universe are so sophisticated that they capable of transferring any amount of information onto any distance in no time, including live video communication. Presumably, ''null-T'' is somehow utilized to transfer information across the galaxy faster than the [[speed of light]].
* Other successes in [[information technology|IT]] field include: programmable ''semi-living mechanisms'' (see above);  [[Android (robot)|androids]]; a probably sentient [[artificial intelligence]] (s.c. ''"Massachusetts Machine"'').

== Organizations ==
=== World Council ===

'''The World Council''' is the main governing body on Earth as well as on its colonies all over the Noon Universe. However, each of the colonies has its own World Council to handle local problems, while the Earth's one usually only suggests the overall [[policy]]. On Earth, the Council determines the distribution of energy and other resources between various institutions like institutes, laboratories and universities. Famous members of the World Council include: [[Minor personalities of the Noon Universe#Bader, August-Iogann-Maria|August-Iogann-Maria Bader]], [[Leonid Gorbovsky]], [[Gennady Komov]] and [[Rudolf Sikorski]].

=== Independent Reconnaissance Unit ===

IRU (or '''FSG''' - ''Free Search Group'') was a label for all non-professional explorers who went into space to discover and study new planets and stars. According to the authors of "The time of the disciples" (Время учеников), a collection of stories by authors other than the Strugatsky brothers set in the Noon Universe, the IRU existed during the period between 2114 and 2193 AD.  To become a member of IRU one needed mere a piloting license and a flight registration issued by COMCON. After that, one was free to visit the planet he decided to and study it, unless there was a native civilization on it in which case he or she was supposed to leave the planet immediately after destroying all traces of one's presence.

=== COMCON ===

'''Committee for Contacts with Other Civilizations''' (ComCon or COMCON) is an organization that directs the diplomatic negotiations between Earth and alien civilizations as well as the progressors' actions towards human ones. Officially, the Earth World Council makes all decisions, but usually it's up to COMCON to decide which actions should be discussed there and which not.

=== COMCON-2 ===

'''Committee for Control of Scientific Achievements''' was founded in 2137 AD to ensure the safety of the human civilization on Earth. Unlike COMCON-1, '''COMCON-2''' is surrounded by much more mystery, which inevitably leads to a certain suspicion from the general public of Earth and even casual comparisons with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]]. The first COMCON-2 chief was ''Rudolf Sikorski'' (until 2178 AD) and after that - his apprentice, [[Maxim Kammerer]].

=== Galactic Security Council ===

'''GSC''' is a security organization like COMCON-2 founded in 2142 AD. While COMCON-2 deals with extraterrestrial threats to Earth and mankind, GSC deals with civilizations that were potentially influenced by Wanderers, such as [[Saraksh]] or [[Saula (fictional planet)|Saula]]. Following the events of ''[[Prisoners of Power]]'', GSC made the Land of Fathers its protectorate.

=== Institute of Space Physics ===

Founded in 2110s on [[Kotlin Island]] ([[Gulf of Finland]]) '''ISP''' always concentrated on the most difficult and nearly unsolvable problems of modern physics. Some of these include: gravitation problems, deritrinitration, theory of discrete space, etc. The latter problem was the leading one in 2130s when the scientists tried to prove ''the theory of intersecting universes'' with the help from the ''"readers"'', a handful of people who were able to read others' thoughts. See ''[[Noon: 22nd Century]]'' for more info.

=== Institute of Experimental History ===

After half a century of idle, importance of '''IEH''' rose drastically with the discovery of Saula and other human planets. The specialization of this Institute is the history of human civilizations and means to speed it up (to "progress" it). The field agents of IEH are therefore referred to as "[[progressors]]". In the middle of the 22nd century IEH studies were considered to be the most important ones (along with ''null-physics'') on Earth. See ''[[Hard to Be a God]]'' for more info.

== Earth and other civilizations ==

A brief summary of Earth's relationships with other civilizations:

=== Relationships with alien races ===

* [[Ark Megaforms]] - despite numerous attempts by COMCON, no official contact was ever established
* [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Garrota|Garrotian Snails]] - n/a; it is known, however, that the Snails consider humans mere a product of their own imagination, therefore an official contact is highly improbable
* [[Golovans]] - a full-scaled contact was established in 2160 AD and the Golovans had a permanent [[embassy]] on Earth
* [[Leoniders]] - a diplomatic contact was established in 2133 AD, but because of great differences between them and humans no considerable technology exchange was possible
* [[Tagorians]] - a full-scaled diplomatic contact established in 2124 AD and followed by a considerable technology exchange has been cancelled by Tagora shortly after the initiation of the "[[Stepchildren Case]]"
* [[Wanderers (Noon Universe)|Wanderers]] - no official contact was ever established, although, apparently, Wanderers have been progressing humanity for a long time

=== Relationships with human civilizations ===

* [[Arkanar]] - no official contact established, although 250 agents of [[#Institute of Experimental History|IEH]] are "progressing" the civilization since 2141 AD
* [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Giganda|Giganda]] - Earth's progressors played a significant role in putting an end to the war between ''Alai Duchy'' and ''the Empire''
* [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Hope|Hope]] - during the unsuccessful "Dead World" operation progressors tried to rescue the remnant population of the planet but were fiercely opposed by them
* [[Ludens (Noon Universe)|Ludens]] - an official contact established at "The Great Revelation" in 2199 by Maxim Kammerer and others, although Ludens had operated on Earth in secret for decades
* [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Pant|Pant]] - during the "Ark Project" progressors attempted to rescue the entire population the planet to a safe solar system
* [[Saraksh]] - a small group of progressors, including ''Rudolf Sikorski'', desperately attempted to maintain control over the situation on the planet since 2148 but their entire efforts were undone by ''Maxim Kammerer'' in 2157 AD
* [[Saula (fictional planet)|Saula]] - n/a; but since ''Institute of Experimental History'' was reactivated after the discovery of Saula in 2141 AD it is logical to suggest that progressors have been working on the planet ever since that

'''Echigo-jofu''' ({{nihongo|越後上布}}) is a fabric of [[Echigo]], Japan on national [[Important Cultural Property (Japan)|Important Cultural Properties]] listing in 1955,&lt;ref name=tobunken/&gt;&lt;ref name=Google/&gt; and UNESCO's [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] list since 2009.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; It is made from fine [[bast fiber]] from the [[ramie]] plant (''Boehmeria nivea''), also called hemp, although not directly related to ''cannabis'' hemp.{{efn|See ''Morphological Differences Between Ramie and Hemp: How These Characteristics Developed Different Procedures in Bast Fiber Producing Industry'';&lt;ref name=Hwang2010/&gt; also see [[:wikt:麻布]]}} After it is woven on a ''jibata'' [[backstrap loom]] ({{nihongo|地機}}), the fabric is spread on snowfields (''yuki-zarashi'') where ultraviolet light from the sun creates ozone and bleaches it white.&lt;ref name=IHCSA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamada/&gt; The fabric is used to make summer [[kimonos]] and other traditional garments, cushions and bed linens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dyeing &amp; weaving – Echigo jofu, ojiya chijimi|publisher=Cultural foundation for promoting the national costume of Japan

[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|200px|A steam turbine used to provide electric power]]

An '''electric power system''' is a network of electrical components deployed to supply, transfer, and use electric power. An example of an electric power system is ''[[electrical grid|the grid]]'' that provides power to an extended area.  An electrical grid power system can be broadly divided into the [[Electric generator|generators]] that supply the power, the [[electric power transmission|transmission system]] that carries the power from the generating centres to the load centres, and the [[electric power distribution|distribution system]] that feeds the power to nearby homes and industries. Smaller power systems are also found in industry, hospitals, commercial buildings and homes. The majority of these systems rely upon [[three-phase electric power|three-phase AC power]]—the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world. Specialised power systems that do not always rely upon three-phase AC power are found in aircraft, electric rail systems, ocean liners and automobiles.

==History==
[[File:PearlStreetStation.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|A sketch of the Pearl Street Station]]
In 1881, two electricians built the world's first power system at [[Godalming]] in England. It was powered by two waterwheels and produced an alternating current that in turn supplied seven Siemens [[arc lamp]]s at 250 volts and 34 [[incandescent lamp]]s at 40 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=744 | title=Godalming Power Station | publisher=Engineering Timelines | accessdate=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, supply to the lamps was intermittent and in 1882 [[Thomas Edison]] and his company, The Edison Electric Light Company, developed the first steam-powered electric power station on Pearl Street in New York City. The [[Pearl Street Station]] initially powered around 3,000 lamps for 59 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jasmin | last=Williams | title = Edison Lights The City | publisher = New York Post | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/11302007/news/cextra/edison_lights_the_city_514905.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | date=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Casey | last = Grant | title = The Birth of NFPA | publisher = National Fire Protection Association | url = http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us/History&amp;cookie%5Ftest=1 | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228104759/http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us%2FHistory&amp;cookie_test=1 | archivedate = 28 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The power station generated [[direct current]] and operated at a single voltage. Direct current power could not be transformed easily or efficiently to the higher voltages necessary to minimise power loss during long-distance transmission, so the maximum economic distance between the generators and load was limited to around half a mile (800 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Bulk Electricity Grid Beginnings  | publisher=New York Independent System Operator |url=http://www.pearlstreetinc.com/NYISO_bulk_elect_beginnings.pdf | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year in London, [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] demonstrated the "secondary generator", namely the first transformer suitable for use in a real power system.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=Who Invented the Transformer?|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=4|pages=56-59|doi=10.1109/MIE.2013.2283834|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practical value of Gaulard and Gibbs' transformer was demonstrated in 1884 at [[Turin]] where the transformer was used to light up forty kilometres (25 miles) of railway from a single [[alternating current]] generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html | title=Lucien Gaulard | first=Evgeny | last=Katz | date=2007-04-08 | accessdate=2008-05-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072336/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the success of the system, the pair made some fundamental mistakes. Perhaps the most serious was connecting the primaries of the transformers in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] so that active lamps would affect the brightness of other lamps further down the line.

In 1885, Ottó Titusz Bláthy (1860–1939) of  Ganz &amp; Co.(Budapest) perfected the secondary generator of Gaulard and Gibbs, providing it with a closed iron core, and thus obtained the first true power transformer, which he dubbed with its present name.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=The Beginning of Electric Energy Transmission: Part One|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=1|pages=57-60|doi=10.1109/MIE.2012.2236484|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Bláthy and two other engineers of the company set up the ZBD system (from their initials) by implementing the parallel AC distribution proposed by British scientist R. Kennedy in 1883, in which several power transformers have their primary windings fed in parallel from a high-voltage distribution line. The system was presented at the 1885 National General Exhibition of Budapest.

In 1885 [[George Westinghouse]], an American entrepreneur, obtained the patent rights to the Gaulard-Gibbs transformer and imported a number of them along with a [[Siemens]] generator, and set his engineers to experimenting with them in hopes of improving them for use in a commercial power system. In 1886, one of Westinghouse's engineers, [[William Stanley, Jr.|William Stanley]], also recognised the problem with connecting transformers in series as opposed to [[series and parallel circuits|parallel]] and also realised that making the iron core of a transformer a fully enclosed loop would improve the [[voltage regulation]] of the secondary winding.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=The Beginning of Electric Energy Transmission: Part Two|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=2|pages=52-59|doi=10.1109/MIE.2013.2256297|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this knowledge he built the first practical transformer-based alternating-current power system at [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/stanley.html | title=Alternating Current Electrification, 1886 | publisher=IEEE | first=Thomas | last=Blalock | date=2004-10-02 | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Westinghouse would begin installing multi-voltage AC transformer systems in competition with the Edison company later that year. In 1888 Westinghouse also licensed [[Nikola Tesla]]'s US patents for a polyphase AC induction motor and transformer designs and hired Tesla for one year to be a consultant at the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company's]] [[Pittsburgh]] labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=tesla+hired+by+westinghouse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KDI0aTz0EK&amp;sig=oct2jnPyWkQ3qvUR-JmstK9F0FI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jRwxUKK3LtS80QHjxoGYAg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla+hired+by+westinghouse&amp;f=false|title=Icons of Invention: The Makers of the Modern World from Gutenberg to Gates|first=John W.|last=Klooster|date=6 April 2018|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=6 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1888, the electric power industry was flourishing, and power companies had built thousands of power systems (both direct and alternating current) in the United States and Europe. These networks were effectively dedicated to providing electric lighting. During this time the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse's companies had grown into a propaganda campaign over which form of transmission (direct or alternating current) was superior, a series of events known as the "[[War of Currents]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kc69qrid9oC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=%22war+of+the+currents%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D2TGUKmVIa6G0QGJw4DgCw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22war+of+the+currents%22&amp;f=false|title=The 100 Most Significant Events in American Business: An Encyclopedia|first=Quentin R.

In 1895, after a protracted decision-making process, [[alternating current]] was chosen as the transmission standard with Westinghouse building the [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations|Adams No. 1 generating station]] at [[Niagara Falls]] and General Electric building the three-phase alternating current power system to supply Buffalo at 11 kV.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 3"/&gt;

In 1979, a European consortium including Siemens, Brown Boveri &amp; Cie and AEG realized the record HVDC link from Cabora Bassa (Mozambique) to Johannesburg (South Africa), extending more than 1,420 km and rated 1.9 GW at ±533 kV, that resorted to top performing 3.2-kV

For example, the development of computers meant [[load flow study|load flow studies]] could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for remote control of a power system's switchgear and generators.

== Basics of electric power ==
[[File:Switched mode power adapter.jpg|thumb|right|An external AC to DC power adapter used for household appliances]]

Electric power is the product of two quantities: [[electric current|current]] and [[electric potential|voltage]]. These two quantities can vary with respect to time ([[AC power]]) or can be kept at constant levels ([[direct current|DC power]]).

Most refrigerators, air conditioners, pumps and industrial machinery use AC power whereas most computers and digital equipment use DC power (the digital devices you plug into the mains typically have an internal or external power adapter to convert from AC to DC power). AC power has the advantage of being easy to transform between voltages and is able to be generated and utilised by brushless machinery. DC power remains the only practical choice in digital systems and can be more economical to transmit over long distances at very high voltages (see [[HVDC]]).&lt;ref name="allabout"&gt;[http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/ All About Circuits] [Online textbook], Tony R. Kuphaldt et al., last accessed on 17 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roberto Rudervall |author2=J.P. Charpentier |author3=Raghuveer Sharma | title = High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Transmission Systems Technology Review Paper | publisher = World Bank | date = March 7–8, 2000 | url= http://library.abb.com/GLOBAL/SCOT/scot221.nsf/VerityDisplay/9E64DAB39F71129BC1256FDA004F7783/$File/Energyweek00.pdf }} (also [http://www.trec-uk.org.uk/elec_eng/world_bank_hvdc.pdf here])&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to easily transform the voltage of AC power is important for two reasons: Firstly, power can be transmitted over long distances with less loss at higher voltages. So in power systems where generation is distant from the load, it is desirable to step-up (increase) the voltage of power at the generation point and then step-down (decrease) the voltage near the load. Secondly, it is often more economical to install turbines that produce higher voltages than would be used by most appliances, so the ability to easily transform voltages means this mismatch between voltages can be easily managed.&lt;ref name="allabout" /&gt;

[[Solid state (electronics)|Solid state devices]], which are products of the semiconductor revolution, make it possible to transform [[DC to DC converter|DC power to different voltages]], build [[brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC machines]] and [[Switched-mode power supply|convert between AC and DC power]]. Nevertheless, devices utilising solid state technology are often more expensive than their traditional counterparts, so AC power remains in widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ned Mohan |author2=T.

== Balancing the grid ==

One of the main difficulties in power systems is that the amount of active power consumed plus losses should always equal the active power produced. If more power is produced than consumed the frequency wil rise and vice versa. Even small deviations from the nominal frequency value will damage synchronous machines and other appliances. Making sure the frequency is constant is usually the task of a [[transmission system operator]]. In some countries (for example in the [[European Union]]) this is achieved through a [[balancing market]] using [[Ancillary services (electric power)|ancillary services]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Stoft. Power System Economics. IEEE Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components of power systems ==

=== Supplies ===
[[File:Big Bend Power Station.jpg|thumb|250px|The majority of the world's power still comes from [[coal power|coal-fired power stations]] like this]]

All power systems have one or more sources of power. For some power systems, the source of power is external to the system but for others, it is part of the system itself—it is these internal power sources that are discussed in the remainder of this section. Direct current power can be supplied by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[fuel cell]]s or [[photovoltaic cell]]s. Alternating current power is typically supplied by a rotor that spins in a magnetic field in a device known as a [[turbo generator]].  There have been a wide range of techniques used to spin a turbine's rotor, from steam heated using [[fossil fuel]] (including coal, gas and oil) or [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], falling water ([[hydroelectric power]]) and wind ([[wind power]]).

The speed at which the rotor spins in combination with the number of generator poles determines the frequency of the alternating current produced by the generator. All generators on a single synchronous system, for example, the [[National Grid (UK)|national grid]], rotate at sub-multiples of the same speed and so generate electric current at the same frequency. If the load on the system increases, the generators will require more torque to spin at that speed and, in a typical power station, more steam must be supplied to the turbines driving them.  Thus the steam used and the fuel expended are directly dependent on the quantity of electrical energy supplied. An exception exists for generators incorporating power electronics such as [[Wind turbine design#Gearless wind turbine|gearless wind turbines]] or linked to a grid through an asynchronous tie such as a [[HVDC]] link &amp;mdash; these can operate at frequencies independent of the power system frequency.

Depending on how the poles are fed, alternating current generators can produce a variable number of phases of power. A higher number of phases leads to more efficient power system operation but also increases the infrastructure requirements of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electric Machinery and Power System Fundamentals |last=Chapman |first=Stephen |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston |isbn=0-07-229135-4 |pages=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity grid systems connect multiple generators and loads operating at the same frequency and number of phases, the commonest being three-phase at 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. However, there are other considerations. These range from the obvious: How much power should the generator be able to supply?  What is an acceptable length of time for starting the generator (some generators can take hours to start)? Is the availability of the power source acceptable (some renewables are only available when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing)?  To the more technical: How should the generator start (some turbines act like a motor to bring themselves up to speed in which case they need an appropriate starting circuit)? What is the mechanical speed of operation for the turbine and consequently what are the number of poles required? What type of generator is suitable ([[synchronous generator|synchronous]] or [[induction generator|asynchronous]]) and what type of rotor (squirrel-cage rotor, wound rotor, salient pole rotor or cylindrical rotor)?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electric Machinery and Power System Fundamentals |last=Chapman |first=Stephen |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston |isbn=0-07-229135-4 |pages=Chapters 6 and 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loads ===
[[File:Toaster.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[toaster]] is a great example of a single-phase load that might appear in a residence. Toasters typically draw 2 to 10 amps at 110 to 260 volts consuming around 600 to 1200 watts of power.]]

Power systems deliver energy to loads that perform a function. These loads range from household appliances to industrial machinery. Most loads expect a certain voltage and, for alternating current devices, a certain frequency and number of phases. The appliances found in your home, for example, will typically be single-phase operating at 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz with a voltage between 110 and 260 volts (depending on national standards). An exception exists for centralized air conditioning systems as these are now typically three-phase because this allows them to operate more efficiently. All devices in your house will also have a wattage, this specifies the amount of power the device consumes. At any one time, the net amount of power consumed by the loads on a power system must equal the net amount of power produced by the supplies less the power lost in transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.telenet.be/worldstandards/electricity.htm Electricity around the world], Conrad H. McGregor, April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/question501.htm What are amps, watts, volts and ohms?], HowStuffWorks.com, 31 October 2000. Last accessed: 27 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Making sure that the voltage, frequency and amount of power supplied to the loads is in line with expectations is one of the great challenges of power system engineering. However it is not the only challenge, in addition to the power used by a load to do useful work (termed [[real power]]) many alternating current devices also use an additional amount of power because they cause the alternating voltage and alternating current to become slightly out-of-sync (termed [[reactive power]]). The reactive power like the real power must balance (that is the reactive power produced on a system must equal the reactive power consumed) and can be supplied from the generators, however it is often more economical to supply such power from capacitors (see "Capacitors and reactors" below for more details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electric Machinery and Power System Fundamentals |last=Chapman |first=Stephen |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston |isbn=0-07-229135-4 |pages=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final consideration with loads is to do with power quality. In addition to sustained overvoltages and undervoltages (voltage regulation issues) as well as sustained deviations from the system frequency (frequency regulation issues), power system loads can be adversely affected by a range of temporal issues. These include voltage sags, dips and swells, transient overvoltages, flicker, high-frequency noise, phase imbalance and poor power factor.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.powerstandards.com/tutor.htm Brief power quality tutorials for engineers]'', PSL, accessed 21 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Power quality issues occur when the power supply to a load deviates from the ideal: For an AC supply, the ideal is the current and voltage in-sync fluctuating as a perfect sine wave at a prescribed frequency with the voltage at a prescribed amplitude. For DC supply, the ideal is the voltage not varying from a prescribed level. Power quality issues can be especially important when it comes to specialist industrial machinery or hospital equipment. &lt;!-- Would be great to have an example of a famous failure here --&gt;

=== Conductors ===

Conductors carry power from the generators to the load. In a [[electrical grid|grid]], conductors may be classified as belonging to the [[electric power transmission|transmission system]], which carries large amounts of power at high voltages (typically more than 69 kV) from the generating centres to the load centres, or the [[electricity distribution|distribution system]], which feeds smaller amounts of power at lower voltages (typically less than 69 kV) from the load centres to nearby homes and industry.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Brain, "[http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/power.htm How Power Grids Work]", howstuffworks.com, 1 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Choice of conductors is based on considerations such as cost, transmission losses and other desirable characteristics of the metal like tensile strength. [[Copper]], with lower resistivity than [[Aluminium|Aluminum]], was the conductor of choice for most power systems. However, Aluminum has a lower cost for the same current carrying capacity and is the primary metal used for transmission line conductors. [[Overhead line]] conductors may be reinforced with steel or aluminium alloys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/26247685/Practical-Applications-of-Electrical-Conductors Practical Applications of Electrical Conductors], Stefan Fassbinder, Deutsches Kupferinstitut, January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conductors in exterior power systems may be placed overhead or underground. Overhead conductors are usually air insulated and supported on porcelain, glass or polymer insulators. Cables used for underground transmission or  [[building wiring]] are insulated with [[cross-linked polyethylene]] or other flexible insulation. Large conductors are stranded for ease of handling; small conductors used for building wiring are often solid, especially in light commercial or residential construction.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.tpub.com/content/neets/14176/css/14176_22.htm Naval Engineering Training Series]'' (Figure 1.6), U.S. Navy (republished by tpub.com), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conductors are typically rated for the maximum current that they can carry at a given temperature rise over ambient conditions. As current flow increases through a conductor it heats up. For insulated conductors, the rating is determined by the insulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_12/3.html Conductor ampacity], All About Circuits, Tony R. Kuphaldt et al., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; For overhead conductors, the rating is determined by the point at which the sag of the conductors would become unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution |last=Grigsby |first=Leonard |year=2007 |publisher=CRC Press 2007 |isbn=978-0-8493-9292-4  |pages=Chapter 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capacitors and reactors ===

The majority of the load in a typical AC power system is inductive; the current lags behind the voltage.  Since the voltage and current are out-of-phase, this leads to the emergence of an "imaginary" form of power known as [[reactive power]]. Reactive power does no measurable work but is transmitted back and forth between the reactive power source and load every cycle. This reactive power can be provided by the generators themselves, through the adjustment of generator excitation, but it is often cheaper to provide it through capacitors, hence capacitors are often placed near inductive loads to reduce current demand on the power system (i.e., increase the [[power factor]]), which may never exceed 1.0, and which represents a purely resistive load. Power factor correction may be applied at a central substation, through the use of so-called "synchronous condensers" (synchronous machines which act as condensers which are variable in [[Volt-ampere reactive|VAR]] value, through the adjustment of machine excitation) or adjacent to large loads, through the use of so-called "static condensers" (condensers which are fixed in VAR value).

Reactors consume reactive power and are used to regulate voltage on long transmission lines. In light load conditions, where the loading on transmission lines is well below the [[surge impedance loading]], the efficiency of the power system may actually be improved by switching in reactors. Reactors installed in series in a power system also limit rushes of current flow, small reactors are therefore almost always installed in series with capacitors to limit the current rush associated with switching in a capacitor. Series reactors can also be used to limit fault currents.

Capacitors and reactors are switched by circuit breakers, which results in moderately large steps in reactive power.  A solution comes in the form of [[static VAR compensator]]s and [[STATCOM|static synchronous compensator]]s. Briefly, static VAR compensators work by switching in capacitors using thyristors as opposed to circuit breakers allowing capacitors to be switched-in and switched-out within a single cycle. This provides a far more refined response than circuit breaker switched capacitors. Static synchronous compensators take a step further by achieving reactive power adjustments using only [[power electronics]].

=== Power electronics ===

Power electronics are semiconductor based devices that are able to switch quantities of power ranging from a few hundred watts to several hundred megawatts. Despite their relatively simple function, their speed of operation (typically in the order of nanoseconds&lt;ref&gt;[http://electricalandelectronics.org/2009/04/09/switching-characteristics-of-thyristors-during-turn-on/ Switching Characteristics of Thyristors During Turn-On] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707185316/http://electricalandelectronics.org/2009/04/09/switching-characteristics-of-thyristors-during-turn-on/ |date=7 July 2012 }}, ''[electricalandelectronics.org]'', April 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;) means they are capable of a wide range of tasks that would be difficult or impossible with conventional technology&lt;!--and are increasingly being found--&gt;. The classic function of power electronics is [[Rectifier|rectification]], or the conversion of AC-to-DC power, power electronics are therefore found in almost every digital device that is supplied from an AC source either as an adapter that plugs into the wall (see photo in ''Basics of Electric Power'' section) or as component internal to the device. High-powered power electronics can also be used to convert AC power to DC power for long distance transmission in a system known as [[HVDC]]. HVDC is used because it proves to be more economical than similar high voltage AC systems for very long distances (hundreds to thousands of kilometres). HVDC is also desirable for interconnects because it allows frequency independence thus improving system stability. Power electronics are also essential for any power source that is required to produce an AC output but that by its nature produces a DC output. They are therefore used by many photovoltaic installations both industrial and residential.

Power electronics also feature in a wide range of more exotic uses. They are at the heart of all modern electric and hybrid vehicles—where they are used for both motor control and as part of the [[brushless DC motor]]. Power electronics are also found in practically all modern petrol-powered vehicles, this is because the power provided by the car's batteries alone is insufficient to provide ignition, air-conditioning, internal lighting, radio and dashboard displays for the life of the car. So the batteries must be recharged while driving using DC power from the engine—a feat that is typically accomplished using power electronics. Whereas conventional technology would be unsuitable for a modern electric car, commutators can and have been used in petrol-powered cars, the switch to [[alternator]]s in combination with power electronics has occurred because of the improved durability of brushless machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Air-conditioner Manufacturer Chooses Smart Power Modules |newspaper=Power Electronics Technology |date=31 August 2005 |url=http://powerelectronics.com/news/air-conditioner-modules/|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electric railway systems also use DC power and thus make use of power electronics to feed grid power to the locomotives and often for speed control of the locomotive's motor. In the middle twentieth century, [[rectifier locomotive]]s were popular, these used power electronics to convert AC power from the railway network for use by a DC motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE – Part A: Power Engineering | title=Electrical equipment for rectifier locomotives |date=October 1957 | pages=341–354 |author1=Calverley, H.B. |author2=Jarvis, E.A.K. |author3=Williams, E. | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5242078b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today most electric locomotives are supplied with AC power and run using AC motors, but still use power electronics to provide suitable motor control. The use of power electronics to assist with the motor control and with starter circuits cannot be overestimated and, in addition to rectification, is responsible for power electronics appearing in a wide range of industrial machinery. Power electronics even appear in modern residential air conditioners.

Power electronics are also at the heart of the [[variable speed wind turbine]]. Conventional wind turbines require significant engineering to ensure they operate at some ratio of the system frequency, however by using power electronics this requirement can be eliminated leading to quieter, more flexible and (at the moment) more costly wind turbines. A final example of one of the more exotic uses of power electronics comes from the previous section where the fast-switching times of power electronics were used to provide more refined reactive compensation to the power system.

=== Protective devices ===
{{main|power system protection}}
Power systems contain protective devices to prevent injury or damage during failures.  The quintessential protective device is the fuse. When the current through a fuse exceeds a certain threshold, the fuse element melts, producing an arc across the resulting gap that is then extinguished, interrupting the circuit.  Given that fuses can be built as the weak point of a system, fuses are ideal for protecting circuitry from damage. Fuses however have two problems: First, after they have functioned, fuses must be replaced as they cannot be reset. This can prove inconvenient if the fuse is at a remote site or a spare fuse is not on hand. And second, fuses are typically inadequate as the sole safety device in most power systems as they allow current flows well in excess of that that would prove lethal to a human or animal.

The first problem is resolved by the use of [[circuit breaker]]s—devices that can be reset after they have broken current flow. In modern systems that use less than about 10&amp;nbsp;kW, miniature circuit breakers are typically used. These devices combine the mechanism that initiates the trip (by sensing excess current) as well as the mechanism that breaks the current flow in a single unit. Some miniature circuit breakers operate solely on the basis of electromagnetism. In these miniature circuit breakers, the current is run through a solenoid, and, in the event of excess current flow, the magnetic pull of the solenoid is sufficient to force open the circuit breaker's contacts (often indirectly through a tripping mechanism). A better design, however, arises by inserting a bimetallic strip before the solenoid—this means that instead of always producing a magnetic force, the solenoid only produces a magnetic force when the current is strong enough to deform the bimetallic strip and complete the solenoid's circuit.

In higher powered applications, the [[protective relay]]s that detect a fault and initiate a trip are separate from the circuit breaker. Early relays worked based upon electromagnetic principles similar to those mentioned in the previous paragraph, [[digital protective relay|modern relays]] are application-specific computers that determine whether to trip based upon readings from the power system. Different relays will initiate trips depending upon different [[power system protection|protection schemes]]. For example, an overcurrent relay might initiate a trip if the current on any phase exceeds a certain threshold whereas a set of differential relays might initiate a trip if the sum of currents between them indicates there may be current leaking to earth. The circuit breakers in higher powered applications are different too. Air is typically no longer sufficient to quench the arc that forms when the contacts are forced open so a variety of techniques are used. One of the most popular techniques is to keep the chamber enclosing the contacts flooded with [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)—a non-toxic gas that has sound arc-quenching properties. Other techniques are discussed in the reference.&lt;ref&gt;http://ocw.kfupm.edu.sa/user/EE46603/Circuit%20Breakers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The second problem, the inadequacy of fuses to act as the sole safety device in most power systems, is probably best resolved by the use of residual current devices (RCDs). In any properly functioning electrical appliance, the current flowing into the appliance on the active line should equal the current flowing out of the appliance on the neutral line. A residual current device works by monitoring the active and neutral lines and tripping the active line if it notices a difference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbrook.co.uk/pdf/pbcatpg21-22.pdf How does an RCD work?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215094125/http://www.greenbrook.co.uk/pdf/pbcatpg21-22.pdf |date=15 February 2010 }}, PowerBreaker, accessed on 14-Mar-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Residual current devices require a separate neutral line for each phase and to be able to trip within a time frame before harm occurs. This is typically not a problem in most residential applications where standard wiring provides an active and neutral line for each appliance (that's why your power plugs always have at least two tongs) and the voltages are relatively low however these issues do limit the effectiveness of RCDs in other applications such as industry. Even with the installation of an RCD, exposure to electricity can still prove lethal.

=== SCADA systems ===

In large electric power systems, [[SCADA|supervisory control and data acquisition]] (SCADA) is used for tasks such as switching on generators, controlling generator output and switching in or out system elements for maintenance. The first supervisory control systems implemented consisted of a panel of lamps and switches at a central console near the controlled plant. The lamps provided feedback on the state of the plant (the data acquisition function) and the switches allowed adjustments to the plant to be made (the supervisory control function). Today, SCADA systems are much more sophisticated and, due to advances in communication systems, the consoles controlling the plant no longer need to be near the plant itself. Instead, it is now common for plants to be controlled with equipment similar (if not identical) to a desktop computer. The ability to control such plants through computers has increased the need for security—there have already been reports of cyber-attacks on such systems causing significant disruptions to power systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ Report: hack on Ukraine's power grid ], Kim Zetter, WIRED, March 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power systems in practice ==
Despite their common components, power systems vary widely both with respect to their design and how they operate. This section introduces some common power system types and briefly explains their operation.

=== Residential power systems ===
Residential dwellings almost always take supply from the low voltage distribution lines or cables that run past the dwelling. These operate at voltages of between 110 and 260 volts (phase-to-earth) depending upon national standards. A few decades ago small dwellings would be fed a single phase using a dedicated two-core service cable (one core for the active phase and one core for the neutral return). The active line would then be run through a main isolating switch in the [[distribution board|fuse box]] and then split into one or more circuits to feed lighting and appliances inside the house. By convention, the lighting and appliance circuits are kept separate so the failure of an appliance does not leave the dwelling's occupants in the dark. All circuits would be fused with an appropriate fuse based upon the wire size used for that circuit. Circuits would have both an active and neutral wire with both the lighting and power sockets being connected in parallel. Sockets would also be provided with a protective earth. This would be made available to appliances to connect to any metallic casing. If this casing were to become live, the theory is the connection to earth would cause an RCD or fuse to trip—thus preventing the future electrocution of an occupant handling the appliance. [[Earthing system]]s vary between regions, but in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia both the protective earth and neutral line would be earthed together near the fuse box before the main isolating switch and the neutral earthed once again back at the distribution transformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The MEN System of Earthing |journal=Electricians Newsletter No. 1 |page=2 |publisher=Office of Energy (WA) |date=May 2001 |url=http://www.docep.wa.gov.au/energysafety/PDF/Newsletters/electricians_newslet.pdf |accessdate=30 Dec 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310180723/http://www.docep.wa.gov.au/EnergySafety/PDF/Newsletters/electricians_newslet.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of minor changes over the year to practice of residential wiring.  Some of the most significant ways modern residential power systems tend to vary from older ones include:

* For convenience, miniature circuit breakers are now almost always used in the fuse box instead of fuses as these can easily be reset by occupants.
* For safety reasons, RCDs are now installed on appliance circuits and, increasingly, even on lighting circuits.
* Dwellings are typically connected to all three-phases of the distribution system with the phases being arbitrarily allocated to the house's single-phase circuits.
* Whereas air conditioners of the past might have been fed from a dedicated circuit attached to a single phase, centralised air conditioners that require three-phase power are now becoming common.
* Protective earths are now run with lighting circuits to allow for metallic lamp holders to be earthed.
* Increasingly residential power systems are incorporating [[microgeneration|microgenerators]], most notably, photovoltaic cells.

=== Commercial power systems ===

Commercial power systems such as shopping centers or high-rise buildings are larger in scale than residential systems. Electrical designs for larger commercial systems are usually studied for load flow, short-circuit fault levels, and voltage drop for steady-state loads and during starting of large motors. The objectives of the studies are to assure proper equipment and conductor sizing, and to coordinate protective devices so that minimal disruption is cause when a fault is cleared. Large commercial installations will have an orderly system of sub-panels, separate from the main distribution board to allow for better system protection and more efficient electrical installation.

Typically one of the largest appliances connected to a commercial power system is the HVAC unit, and ensuring this unit is adequately supplied is an important consideration in commercial power systems. Regulations for commercial establishments place other requirements on commercial systems that are not placed on residential systems. For example, in Australia, commercial systems must comply with AS 2293, the standard for emergency lighting, which requires emergency lighting be maintained for at least 90 minutes in the event of loss of mains supply.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electricalsolutions.net.au/articles/1546-Emergency-lighting-an-essential-service&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[National Electrical Code]] requires commercial systems to be built with at least one 20A sign outlet in order to light outdoor signage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecmweb.com/nec/code-basics/nec-commercial-loads-2-20100201/|title=Commercial Loads — Part 2|author=|date=25 March 2010|website=ecmweb.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building code regulations may place special requirements on the electrical system for emergency lighting, evacuation, emergency power, smoke control and fire protection.

==Ballast water==
{{Main article|Ballast water discharge and the environment}}
[[Ballast water]] discharges by ships can have a negative impact on the [[marine environment]].&lt;ref name="Walker et al 2019 Environmental Effects of Marine Transportation"/&gt;

Cruise ships, large tankers, and bulk cargo carriers use a huge amount of ballast water, which is often taken on in the coastal waters in one region after ships discharge [[wastewater]] or unload cargo, and discharged at the next port of call, wherever more cargo is loaded. Ballast water discharge typically contains a variety of biological materials, including [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[virus]]es, and [[bacteria]]. These materials often include non-native, nuisance, invasive, exotic species that can cause extensive ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems along with serious human health problems.

==Sound pollution==
Noise pollution caused by shipping and other human enterprises has increased in [[contemporary history|recent history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The [[Bonn Convention|Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species]] has identified ocean noise as a potential threat to marine life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Noise Pollution and Ship-Strikes |url=http://www.cms.int/press/pressconferences/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Media_advisory_%20Noise_pollution_whale_ship_strikes.pdf |publisher=UN Environment Programme-Convention on Migratory Species |access-date=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722013241/http://www.cms.int/press/pressconferences/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Media_advisory_%20Noise_pollution_whale_ship_strikes.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The disruption of whales' ability to communicate with one another is an extreme threat and is affecting their ability to survive. According to Discovery Channel's article on Sonic Sea Journeys Deep Into the Ocean,&lt;ref&gt;Discovery Channel's article on Sonic Sea Journeys Deep Into the Ocean&lt;/ref&gt; over the last century, extremely loud noise from commercial ships, oil and gas exploration, naval sonar exercises and other sources has transformed the ocean's delicate acoustic habitat, challenging the ability of whales and other marine life to prosper and ultimately to survive. Whales are starting to react to this in ways that are life-threatening. Kenneth C. Balcomb, a whale researcher and a former U.S Navy officer,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth C. Balcomb, a whale researcher and a former U.S Navy officer&lt;/ref&gt; states that the day March 15, 2000, is the day of infamy. As Discovery says,&lt;ref&gt;Discovery says&lt;/ref&gt; where him and his crew discovered whales swimming dangerously close to the shore. They're supposed to be in deep water.  So I pushed it back out to sea, says Balcomb.&lt;ref&gt;says Balcomb&lt;/ref&gt; Although sonar helps to protect us, it is destroying marine life. According to IFAW Animal Rescue Program Director Katie Moore,&lt;ref&gt;IFAW Animal Rescue Program Director Katie Moore&lt;/ref&gt; "There's different ways that sounds can affect animals. There's that underlying ambient noise level that's rising, and rising, and rising that interferes with communication and their movement patterns. And then there's the more acute kind of traumatic impact of sound, that's causing physical damage or a really strong behavioral response. It's fight or flight".

==Wildlife collisions==
[[Marine mammal]]s, such as whales and manatees, risk being struck by ships, causing injury and death.&lt;ref name="Walker et al 2019 Environmental Effects of Marine Transportation"/&gt; For example, if a ship is traveling at a speed of only 15 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], there is a 79 percent chance of a collision being lethal to a whale.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

One notable example of the impact of ship collisions is the endangered [[North Atlantic right whale]], of which 400 or less remain.&lt;ref name=TaylorWalker2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor S, Walker TR | title = North Atlantic right whales in danger | journal = Science | volume = 358 | issue = 6364 | pages = 730–731 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29123056 | doi = 10.1126/science.aar2402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest danger to the North Atlantic right whale is injury sustained from ship strikes.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2006.00098.x |title=Vessel Collisions with Whales: The Probability of Lethal Injury Based on Vessel Speed |journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=23 |pages=144–156 |year=2007 |last1=Vanderlaan |first1=Angelia S.

==Atmospheric pollution==
[[Exhaust gas]]es from ships are considered to be a significant source of [[air pollution]], both for conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="Walker et al 2019 Environmental Effects of Marine Transportation"/&gt;

There is a perception that cargo transport by ship is low in air pollutants, because for equal weight and distance it is the most efficient transport method, according to shipping researcher Alice Bows-Larkin.&lt;ref name="bows"&gt;[http://voiceofrussia.com/uk/news/2014_06_27/Shipping-contributes-up-to-5-percent-of-worldwide-CO2-emissions-says-study-0947/ Shipping contributes up to 3 percent of worldwide CO2 emissions, says study], Voice of Russia UK. 27 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly true in comparison to [[Environmental impact of aviation|air freight]]; however, because sea shipment accounts for far more annual tonnage and the distances are often large, shipping's emissions are globally substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2016.04.018 |title=Regulating global shipping corporations' accountability for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the seas |journal=Marine Policy |volume=69 |pages=159–170 |year=2016 |last1=Rahim |first1=Mia Mahmudur |last2=Islam |first2=Md. Tarikul |last3=Kuruppu |first3=Sanjaya | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bows"/&gt; A difficulty is that the year-on-year increasing amount shipping overwhelms gains in efficiency, such as from [[Slow steaming|slow-steaming]] or the [[Kite applications#Cargo|use of kites]]. The growth in tonne-kilometers of sea shipment has averaged 4 percent yearly since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Tyndall"&gt;[http://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/media/eps/schoolofmechanicalaerospaceandcivilengineering/research/centres/tyndall/pdf/High_Seas_High_Stakes_High_Seas_Project_Final_Report.pdf High Seas, High Stakes], Final Report. Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Univ. of Manchester, UK. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; And it has grown by a factor of 5 since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="bows"/&gt; There are now over 100,000 transport ships at sea, of which about 6,000 are large container ships.&lt;ref name="bows"/&gt;

===Conventional pollutants===

[[Air pollution]] from cruise ships is generated by [[diesel engine]]s that burn high [[sulfur]] content [[fuel oil]], also known as bunker oil, producing [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxide]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]], in addition to [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], and hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="Walker et al 2019 Environmental Effects of Marine Transportation"/&gt; [[Diesel exhaust]] has been classified by EPA as a likely human [[carcinogen]]. EPA recognizes that these emissions from marine diesel engines contribute to [[ozone]] and carbon monoxide nonattainment (i.e., failure to meet [[air quality]] standards), as well as adverse health effects associated with ambient concentrations of particulate matter and visibility, [[haze]], [[acid rain|acid deposition]], and [[eutrophication]] and [[nitrification]] of water.&lt;ref name="68FR9751"&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC. "Control of Emissions From New Marine Compression-Ignition Engines at or Above 30 Liters Per Cylinder." Final rule. ''Federal Register,'' {{USFR|68|9751}}, 2003-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA estimates that large marine diesel engines accounted for about 1.6 percent of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions and 2.8 percent of mobile source particulate emissions in the United States in 2000. Contributions of marine diesel engines can be higher on a port-specific basis. [[Ultra-low sulfur diesel]] (ULSD) is a standard for defining [[diesel fuel]] with substantially lowered [[sulfur]] contents.  As of 2006, almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in Europe and North America is of a ULSD type.

In 2016 the IMO has made new sulfur regulations which must be implemented by larger ships by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marine-electronics.eu/sulfur-regulations-in-shipping-industry-from-2020|title=New sulfur regulations from 2020 [Infographic]|author=|date=|website=marine-electronics.eu|access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of total global air emissions, shipping accounts for 18 to 30 percent of the [[nitrogen oxide]] and 9 percent of the [[Sulfur oxide|sulphur oxides]].&lt;ref name="Schrooten1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schrooten L, De Vlieger I, Panis LI, Chiffi C, Pastori E | title = Emissions of maritime transport: a European reference system | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 408 | issue = 2 | pages = 318–23 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19840885 | doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.07.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vidal2009"&gt;{{Cite news

"EU faces ship clean-up call." ''BBC News''. Retrieved 1 November 2006, from http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3019686.stm&lt;/ref&gt; According to Irene Blooming, a spokeswoman for the European environmental coalition [[Seas at Risk]], the fuel used in oil tankers and container ships is high in sulfur and cheaper to buy compared to the fuel used for domestic land use. "A ship lets out around 50 times more sulfur than a lorry per metric tonne of cargo carried."&lt;ref name="Harrabin"/&gt; Cities in the U.S. like [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Houston]], [[Galveston]], and [[Pittsburgh]] see some of the heaviest shipping traffic in the nation and have left local officials desperately trying to clean up the air.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt; Increasing trade between the U.S. and China is helping to increase the number of vessels navigating the [[Pacific]] and exacerbating many of the environmental problems. To maintain the level of growth China is experiencing, large amounts of [[grain]] are being shipped to China by the boat load. The number of voyages are expected to continue increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, C., &amp; Olicker, J. (20 April 2004). World in the Balance: China Revs Up [Transcript]. PBS: NOVA. Retrieved 26 November 2006, from https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3109_worldbal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenhouse gas pollutants===

3.5 to 4 percent of all [[Global warming|climate change emissions]] are caused by shipping, primarily carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="Walker et al 2019 Environmental Effects of Marine Transportation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vidal2009" /&gt;

As one way to reduce the impact of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from shipping, vetting agency RightShip developed an online "Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Rating" as a systematic way for the industry to compare a ship's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions with peer vessels of a similar size and type. Based on the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) that applies to ships built from 2013, RightShip's GHG Rating can also be applied to vessels built prior to 2013, allowing for effective vessel comparison across the world's fleet. The GHG Rating utilises an A to G scale, where A represents the most efficient ships. It measures the theoretical amount of carbon dioxide emitted per tonne nautical mile travelled, based on the design characteristics of the ship at time of build such as cargo carrying capacity, engine power and fuel consumption. Higher rated ships can deliver significantly lower CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions across the voyage length, which means they also use less fuel and are cheaper to run.

===Stress for improvement===

One source of environmental stresses on maritime vessels recently has come from states and localities, as they assess the contribution of commercial marine vessels to regional air quality problems when ships are docked at port.&lt;ref name="Schrooten2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2007.09.071 |title=Inventory and forecasting of maritime emissions in the Belgian sea territory, an activity-based emission model |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=667–676 |year=2008 |last1=Schrooten |first1=Liesbeth |last2=De Vlieger |first2=Ina |last3=Int Panis |first3=Luc |last4=Styns |first4=Karel |last5=Torfs |first5=Rudi | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, large marine diesel engines are believed to contribute 7 percent of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]/[[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. Ships can also have a significant impact in areas without large commercial ports: they contribute about 37 percent of total area nitrogen oxide emissions in the [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] area, and that percentage is expected to increase to 61 percent by 2015.&lt;ref name="68FR9751" /&gt; Again, there is little cruise-industry specific data on this issue. They comprise only a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, but cruise ship emissions may exert significant impacts on a local scale in specific coastal areas that are visited repeatedly. Shipboard incinerators also burn large volumes of garbage, plastics, and other [[waste]], producing ash that must be disposed of. Incinerators may release toxic emissions as well.

In 2005, [[MARPOL]] Annex VI came into force to combat this problem. As such cruise ships now employ [[CCTV]] monitoring on the smokestacks as well as recorded measuring via opacity meter while some are also using clean burning gas turbines for electrical loads and propulsion in sensitive areas.

==Oil spills==
Most commonly associated with ship pollution are [[oil spills]].&lt;ref name="Walker et al 2019 Environmental Effects of Marine Transportation"/&gt; While less frequent than the pollution that occurs from daily operations, oil spills have devastating effects. While being toxic to marine life, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), the components in [[crude oil]], are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the [[sediment]] and marine environment.&lt;ref name="Panetta"&gt;Panetta, L. E. (Chair) (2003). "America's living oceans: charting a course for sea change." Electronic Version, CD. Pew Oceans Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles. One of the more widely known spills was the [[Exxon Valdez]] incident in [[Alaska]]. The ship ran aground and dumped a massive amount of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers and volunteers, over 400,000 [[seabirds]], about 1,000 [[sea otters]], and immense numbers of fish were killed.&lt;ref name="Panetta"/&gt;

==International regulation==
Some of the major international efforts in the form of [[treaties]] are the Marine Pollution Treaty, Honolulu, which deals with regulating marine pollution from ships, and the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, which deals with marine species and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Steger, M. B. (2003). ''Globalization: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press Inc. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; While plenty of local and international regulations have been introduced throughout [[maritime history]], much of the current regulations are considered inadequate. "In general, the treaties tend to emphasize the technical features of safety and pollution control measures without going to the root causes of sub-standard shipping, the absence of incentives for compliance and the lack of enforceability of measures."&lt;ref&gt;Khee-Jin Tan, A. (2006). ''Vessel-source marine pollution: the law and politics of international regulation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press{{pn|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common problems encountered with international shipping arise from paperwork errors and customs brokers not having the proper information about your items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clxlogistics.com/top-4-challenges-you-need-to-master-for-international-shipping/|title=4 Challenges in International Shipping - CLX Logistics Blog|author=|date=11 September 2015|website=clxlogistics.com|access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise ships, for example, are exempt from regulation under the US discharge permit system (NPDES, under the Clean Water Act) that requires compliance with technology-based standards.&lt;ref name="Panetta"/&gt; In the [[Caribbean]], many ports lack proper [[waste disposal]] facilities, and many ships dump their waste at sea.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Programme in collaboration with GEF, the University of Kalmar, and the Municipality of Kalmar, Sweden, &amp; the Governments of Sweden, Finland and Norway. (2006). ''Challenges to international waters: regional assessments in a global perspective'' [Electronic Version]. Nairobi, Kenya: United Nations Environment Programme. Retrieved 5 January 2010, from http://www.unep.org/dewa/giwa/publications/finalreport/&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, due to the complexities of shipping trade and the difficulties involved in regulating this business, a comprehensive and generally acceptable regulatory framework on corporate responsibility for reducing GHG emissions is unlikely to be achieved soon. In fact, emissions are continuing to increase. Under these circumstances, it is necessary for the states, the shipping industry and global organizations to explore and discuss market based mechanisms for vessel-sourced GHG emissions reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2016.04.018 |title=Regulating global shipping corporations' accountability for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the seas |journal=Marine Policy |volume=69 |pages=159–170 |year=2016 |last1=Rahim |first1=Mia Mahmudur |last2=Islam |first2=Md. Tarikul |last3=Kuruppu |first3=Sanjaya | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sewage==
[[File:Smelly whale.jpg|thumb|dead whale|right|Carcass of a whale on a shore in Iceland.]]
The cruise line industry dumps {{convert|255,000|USgal|m3}} of [[greywater]] and {{convert|30,000|USgal|m3}} of [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] into the sea every day.&lt;ref name="Walker et al 2019 Environmental Effects of Marine Transportation"/&gt; Blackwater is sewage, [[wastewater]] from [[toilet]]s and medical facilities, which can contain harmful [[bacteria]], pathogens, [[virus]]es, [[intestinal parasite]]s, and harmful nutrients. Discharges of untreated or inadequately treated sewage can cause bacterial and viral [[pollution|contamination]] of [[fishery|fisheries]] and [[shellfish]] beds, producing risks to public health. Nutrients in sewage, such as [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]], promote excessive [[algal blooms]], which consumes [[oxygen]] in the water and can lead to [[fish kill]]s and destruction of other aquatic life. A large cruise ship (3,000 passengers and crew) generates an estimated 55,000 to 110,000 liters per day of blackwater waste.&lt;ref name=cruisecontrol&gt;The Ocean Conservancy, "Cruise Control, A Report on How Cruise Ships Affect the Marine Environment," May 2002, p. 13. - PDF [http://act.oceanconservancy.org/site/DocServer/cruisecontrol.pdf?docID=141]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the environmental impact of shipping, and sewage in particular [[MARPOL 73/78|marpol]] annex IV was brought into force September 2003 strictly limiting untreated waste discharge. Modern cruise ships are most commonly installed with a [[membrane bioreactor]] type treatment plant for all blackwater and greywater, such as (https://web.archive.org/web/20130408054426/http://www.gertsen-olufsen.com/Ship-Offshore/Products/G-O_Brands/G-O_Bioreactor.aspx), Zenon or [https://web.archive.org/web/20110715193114/http://www.rochem.com/htm/Rochem_Ultrafiltration.htm Rochem] which produce near drinkable quality effluent to be re-used in the machinery spaces as technical water.

==Cleaning==
Greywater is wastewater from the [[sink]]s, [[shower]]s, [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]s, [[laundry]], and [[cleanliness|cleaning]] activities aboard a ship. It can contain a variety of pollutant substances, including [[fecal coliforms]], [[detergent]]s, [[oil]] and grease, [[metal]]s, [[organic compound]]s, [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, nutrients, [[food waste]], [[medical waste|medical]] and dental waste. Sampling done by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and the state of Alaska found that untreated greywater from cruise ships can contain pollutants at variable strengths and that it can contain levels of fecal coliform bacteria several times greater than is typically found in untreated domestic wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Draft Discharge Assessment Report, pp. 3-5 - 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Greywater has potential to cause adverse environmental effects because of concentrations of nutrients and other [[biochemical oxygen demand|oxygen-demanding]] materials, in particular. Greywater is typically the largest source of liquid waste generated by cruise ships (90 to 95 percent of the total). Estimates of greywater range from 110 to 320 liters per day per person, or 330,000 to 960,000 liters per day for a 3,000-person cruise ship.&lt;ref&gt;Cruise Control, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solid waste==
Solid waste generated on a ship includes [[glass]], [[paper]], cardboard, [[aluminium]] and [[steel]] cans, and [[plastic]]s.&lt;ref name="Walker et al 2019 Environmental Effects of Marine Transportation"/&gt; It can be either non-hazardous or hazardous in nature. Solid waste that enters the ocean may become [[marine debris]], and can then pose a threat to marine organisms, humans, coastal communities, and industries that utilize marine waters. Cruise ships typically manage solid waste by a combination of [[source reduction]], [[waste minimization]], and [[recycling]]. However, as much as 75 percent of solid waste is [[incineration|incinerated]] on board, and the [[incinerator bottom ash|ash]] typically is discharged at sea, although some is landed ashore for disposal or recycling. [[Marine mammal]]s, fish, [[sea turtle]]s, and birds can be injured or killed from entanglement with plastics and other solid waste that may be released or disposed off of cruise ships. On average, each cruise ship passenger generates at least two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Environmental Leadership in Business, "A Shifting Tide, Environmental Challenges and Cruise Industry Responses," p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; With large cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers, the amount of waste generated in a day can be massive. For a large cruise ship, about 8 [[ton]]s of solid waste are generated during a one-week cruise.&lt;ref&gt;Bluewater Network, "Cruising for Trouble: Stemming the Tide of Cruise Ship Pollution," March 2000, p. 5. A report prepared for an industry group estimated that a 3,000-person cruise ship generates {{convert|1.1|e6USgal|m3}} of graywater during a seven-day cruise. Don K. Kim, "Cruise Ship Waste Dispersion Analysis Report on the Analysis of Graywater Discharge," presented to the International Council of Cruise Lines, 14 September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that 24 percent of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide (by weight) comes from cruise ships.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council, Committee on Shipboard Wastes, Clean Ships, Clean Ports, Clean Oceans: Controlling Garbage and Plastic Wastes at Sea (National Academy Press, 1995), Table 2-3, pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board (incinerated, pulped, or ground up) for discharge overboard. When garbage must be off-loaded (for example, because glass and aluminium cannot be incinerated), cruise ships can put a strain on port reception facilities, which are rarely adequate to the task of serving a large passenger vessel.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council, Committee on Shipboard Wastes, Clean Ships, Clean Ports, Clean Oceans: Controlling Garbage and Plastic Wastes at Sea (National Academy Press, 1995), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilge water==
On a ship, oil often leaks from [[engine]] and [[machine]]ry spaces or from engine maintenance activities and mixes with water in the [[bilge]], the lowest part of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] of the ship, but there is a filter to clean bilge water before being discharged.&lt;ref name="Walker et al 2019 Environmental Effects of Marine Transportation"/&gt; Oil, [[gasoline]], and [[by-product]]s from the biological breakdown of petroleum products can harm fish and [[wildlife]] and pose threats to human health if ingested. Oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various [[sub-lethal damage|sub-lethal]] chronic effects. Bilge water also may contain solid wastes and [[pollution|pollutant]]s containing high levels of [[biological oxygen demand|oxygen-demanding]] material, oil and other chemicals. A typically large cruise ship will generate an average of 8 metric tons of oily bilge water for each 24 hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;"Shifting Tide," p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; To maintain ship stability and eliminate potentially hazardous conditions from oil [[vapor]]s in these areas, the bilge spaces need to be flushed and periodically pumped dry. However, before a bilge can be cleared out and the water discharged, the oil that has been accumulated needs to be extracted from the bilge water, after which the extracted oil can be reused, incinerated, and/or offloaded in port. If a separator, which is normally used to extract the oil, is faulty or is deliberately bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could be discharged directly into the ocean, where it can damage marine life. A number of cruise lines have been charged with [[environmental crime|environmental violation]]s related to this issue in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Cruise ship pollution fine draws criticism | last = Adams | first = Marilyn | date = 2002-11-07 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | url = https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2002/2002-11-08-cruises-1acover.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Liner may have dumped oily water, reports say | last = Huettel | first = Steve | date = 2004-04-14 | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/14/Business/Liner_may_have_dumped.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Karte_Christiansø.jpg|thumb|180px|Buildings and water on Christiansø and Frederiksø]]
'''Ertholmene''' (formerly spelled ''Ærtholme(ne)'' and generally known as '''Christiansø''') is a small archipelago situated {{convert|19|km|mi}} northeast of [[Gudhjem]], [[Bornholm]] and {{convert|27|km|mi}} east of [[Allinge-Sandvig]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. It is {{convert|106|mi|km}} southeast of the capital of [[Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tjpeiffer.com/crowflies.html Distance as the crow flies]&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derives from the Danish for "pea islands".

Ertholmene belongs to [[Denmark]] and has the country's [[Extreme points of Denmark|easternmost point]]. Its permanent population was 83 people in 2018,&lt;ref&gt;Statistikbanken.dk/Population and elections/Population and population projections/Population in Denmark/(Table)BEF4:Population 1. January by islands (1901-2017)/Christiansø + Frederiksø/Select year(s)&lt;/ref&gt; and its area is {{convert|39|ha|km2}} (0.16 sq mi). Together with Bornholm it is part of Landsdel Bornholm. Ertholmene makes up the Parish of Christiansø in the [[Church of Denmark]] and is served by [[Christiansø Church]]. On 1 January 2017 out of 78 inhabitants in total there were 69 members of the Church of Denmark (88.46% of the population). Ertholmene has never been part of a municipality, county, or region. The islands are administered by the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]].

Ertholmene consists of three main islands, ''Christiansø'' (named after [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian V]]), ''Frederiksø'' (named after [[Frederick IV of Denmark|King Frederick IV]]) and ''Græsholm'', plus a number of minor rocks and [[skerry|skerries]], including [[Tat (skerry)|Tat]] and [[Østerskær]], Denmark's easternmost point. Christiansø makes up 22.3 [[hectare]]s (0.0861 sq mi), Frederiksø 4 (0.01544 sq mi), and [[Græsholm]] 11 hectares (0.04247 sq mi). Only Christiansø and Frederiksø are inhabited, while Græsholm is a bird reserve. The sound between Christiansø and Frederiksø, a well-sheltered natural harbour, is crossed by a pedestrian bridge that can be pulled aside to accommodate larger vessels.

==History==

Fishermen from Bornholm have used Ertholmene for temporary shelter since the [[Middle Ages]]. The first permanent settlement was the result of the Danish-Swedish conflicts in the late 17th century. As Denmark needed a naval base in the central Baltic Sea, a [[fort]] was built on Christiansø and Frederiksø in 1684 which served as an outpost for the [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish Navy]] until 1855. [[Christiansø Church]] originally served the garrison.&lt;ref name=natmus&gt;[http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Bornholm_532-555.pdf Otto Norn, C. G. Schultz, Erik Skov, "Christiansø Kirke"]: Bornholms Nørre Herred, Danmarks Kirker, Bornholm, Nationalmuseet, Gad, 1954, pp. 576–583. {{da icon}} Retrieved 2 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The population peaked at the census in 1810 which showed 829 inhabitants. They were soldiers and were there because of the [[Gunboat War]]. Many of the historical buildings now serve as living quarters for the local population, and some are rented, year after year, to regular summer residents. The islands' external appearance has changed very little in over 300 years. Girdled by thick granite walls with old cannons pointed seaward, Christiansø is a picturesque tourist spot seemingly frozen in time.  A former part of the fort, ''Store Tårn'' has housed the [[Christiansø Lighthouse]] for the past 200 years,&lt;ref&gt;Anker E. Kofoed: ''Christiansøs Historie'', Christiansøs Museum, 1984. {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a small round tower on Frederiksø, ''Lille Tårn,'' serves as a museum.

==Administrative status==

The islands form an [[unincorporated area]] that does not belong to either a municipality or a region. Instead they are state property governed by an administrator, appointed by the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Danish ministry of defence]], with the responsibility being the tasks normally performed by municipalities and other public sector civil services. The major sources of income are [[fishery]] and [[tourism]]. There are 80,000 tourists per year, mostly day visitors arriving via Bornholm. Ertholmene is also a popular destination for [[yachting|yachts]].

=== Taxation ===
The islanders, who do not pay municipal taxes of any kind and were never part of a municipality, are exempt from the central government "Health Contribution" tax (''Sundhedsbidrag'') which stood at 8% when it was introduced on 1 January 2007 with [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|''Kommunalreformen'' ("The Municipal Reform" of 2007)]], because it was thought that the relatively isolated islets would otherwise be abandoned. This tax replaced the [[Counties of Denmark|county]] tax, which the islanders were also exempt from paying, not being part of a county. From 1 January 2019 this tax will be abolished, while income taxes in the lowest bracket will be raised simultaneously instead with this tax being phased out. From 2012, the tax was lowered by one percentage point per year, reaching 1% in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornholm.nu/?Id=10317 Bornholm.nu » Christiansø » Ingen sundhedsskat på Chr.ø&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornholm.nu/?Id=7904 Bornholm.nu » Christiansø » Bornholm kan få Christiansø&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gene pool''' is the set of all [[gene]]s, or genetic information, in any [[population]], usually of a particular [[species]].

== Description ==
A large gene pool indicates extensive [[genetic diversity]], which is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense [[Selection (biology)|selection]]. Meanwhile, low [[genetic diversity]] (see [[inbreeding]] and [[population bottleneck]]s) can cause reduced [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] and an increased chance of [[extinction]], although as explained by [[genetic drift]] new genetic variants, that may cause an increase in the [[Physical fitness|fitness]] of organisms, are more likely to fix in the population if it is rather small.

When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular [[phenotypic]] trait, the population is said to be 'monomorphic'. When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are said to be [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]].

== History ==
The Russian geneticist Aleksandr Sergeevich Serebrovskii first formulated the concept in the 1920s as ''genofond'' (gene fund), a word that was imported to the United States from the Soviet Union by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], who translated it into English as “gene pool.”&lt;ref name="LonelyIdeas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Loren |date=2013 |title=Lonely Ideas: Can Russia Compete? |publisher=MIT Press |page=169 |isbn=978-0-262-01979-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gene pool concept in crop breeding ==
Harlan and de Wet (1971) proposed classifying each crop and its related species by gene pools rather than by formal taxonomy.&lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harlan, J.R. |author2=Wet, J.M.J.d. |year=1971|title=Toward a Rational Classification of Cultivated Plants|journal=Taxon|volume=20|issue=4|pages=509–517|jstor=1218252|doi=10.2307/1218252}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Primary gene pool (GP-1): Members of this gene pool are probably in the same "[[species]]" (in conventional biological usage) and can intermate freely. Harlan and de Wet wrote, "Among forms of this gene pool, crossing is easy; [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are generally fertile with good chromosome pairing; gene segregation is approximately normal and [[Horizontal gene transfer|gene transfer]] is generally easy.".&lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971" /&gt; They also advised subdividing each crop gene pool in two:
#*Subspecies A: Cultivated races
#*Subspecies B: Spontaneous races (wild or weedy)
#Secondary gene pool (GP-2): Members of this pool are probably normally classified as different species than the crop species under consideration (the primary gene pool). However, these species are closely related and can cross and produce at least some fertile hybrids. As would be expected by members of different species, there are some reproductive barriers between members of the primary and secondary gene pools:
#*hybrids may be weak
#*hybrids may be partially sterile
#*[[chromosomes]] may pair poorly or not at all
#*recovery of desired [[phenotype]]s may be difficult in subsequent generations
#*However, "The gene pool is available to be utilized, however, if the plant breeder or geneticist is willing to put out the effort required."&lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971" /&gt;
#Tertiary gene pool (GP-3): Members of this gene pool are more distantly related to the members of the primary gene pool. The primary and tertiary gene pools can be intermated, but [[gene]] transfer between them is impossible without the use of "rather extreme or radical measures" &lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971" /&gt; such as:
#*embryo rescue (or embryo culture, a form of plant [[organ culture]])
#*induced [[polyploidy]] (chromosome doubling)
#*bridging crosses (e.g., with members of the secondary gene pool).

== Gene pool centres ==
Gene pool centres refers to areas on the earth where important crop plants and domestic animals originated. They have an extraordinary range of the wild counterparts of cultivated plant species and useful tropical plants.
Gene pool centres also contain different sub tropical and temperate region species.

[[Image:Ligurian Sea map.png|thumb|right|300px|The Ligurian Sea]]
A '''Genoa low''' (also known as '''Genoa Cyclogenesis''', '''Ligurian Depression''', or '''V(5)-track cyclone''') is a cyclone that forms or intensifies from a pre-existing cyclone to the south of the [[Alps]] over the [[Gulf of Genoa]], [[Ligurian Sea]], [[Po Valley]] and northern [[Adriatic]].&lt;ref name="nrlmil" &gt;{{cite web|title=Local Hazardous Weather Conditions|url=http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/port_studies/africaports/Tunis/ihazcond.html|publisher=Naval Research Laboratory|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vb cyclones are rare events which occur on average only 2.3 times per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Messmer|first=Martina|date=|title=Climatology of Vb cyclones, physical mechanisms and their impact on extreme precipitation over Central Europe|url=http://boris.unibe.ch/71502/1/messmer15esd.pdf|journal=Earth System Dynamic|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyclogenesis==
[[Image:Alpenrelief 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Relief map of Alpine region of Europe]]
The northwestern Mediterranean and the Gulf of Genoa in particular, are not only a transition area for passing cyclones, but are frequently areas of cyclogenesis.&lt;ref name="Kreienkamp" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Kreienkamp|first=F.|author2=A. Spekat |author3=W. Enke |title=A robust method to identify cyclone tracks from gridded data|journal=Advances in Science and Research|year=2010|volume=4|pages=105–114|doi=10.5194/asr-4-105-2010|url=http://www.adv-sci-res.net/4/105/2010/asr-4-105-2010.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012|bibcode = 2010AdSR....4..105K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satellite Overview and Synoptic Situation|url=http://www.eumetrain.org/data/7/7/synop.htm|publisher=eumetrain|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Low pressure areas move into or are formed as a result of North Atlantic air entering the Mediterranean Sea between the Alps and the [[Massif Central]], via the [[Rhone Valley]], or via the [[Carcassonne]] gap between the [[Pyrenees]] and Massif Central. This cold and moist air enters the Mediterranean basin, and is deflected by the high mountains of northwest [[Corsica]], which divert the air mass to the northeast, triggering cool and wet [[Libeccio]] winds in response into to the [[Ligurian Sea]], which in turn hit the western [[Apennines]] located in the immediate vicinity of the sea.

Several factors that have special relevance in the development of depressions south of the Alps are:

* The thermal contrast between land and sea.
* Interaction between the polar front jet stream and the subtropical jet stream.
* Effect of northerly flow over the Alps, enhancing cyclogenetic activity along the southern slopes.
* Effect of the concave curvature of the southern slopes of the Alps, enhancing cyclonic formation.&lt;ref name="nrlmil" /&gt;

A complex interaction is established between the [[orography]] of Liguria and the contrast between the cold and humid air mass and the warmer water of the Ligurian Sea, the process ends with the formation of a low pressure area over the Ligurian Sea, just near the city of [[Genoa]]. Genoa low cyclogenesis can occur at any time of year, though usually situated further south during the summer.&lt;ref name="nrlmil" /&gt; Cyclogenesis is shifted to the east depending on the amount of cold air entering the Po Valley, and generally shifts to the [[Gulf of Venice]] when little enters the valley.&lt;ref name="nrlmil" /&gt;

==Effects on climate==
The depressions bear rain, often intense, on the Ligurian coast and hills of [[Tuscany]], due to [[orographic lift]] which affects the southern side of the  Apennines. The area of low pressure is slow moving, and may follow a trajectory from west to east, then going on to affect the regions of the Adriatic, or move from the north-west to south-east down along the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]: in this last case, the structure will reach the same cyclonic area of formation of Tyrrhenian depressions, although not related to the latter.

===Van Bebber cyclone tracks===
[[File:Zugstrassen der barometrischen Minima.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of cyclone tracks over Europe, showing divergence of track V over the Ligurian sea and north Adriatic]]
Most Genoa lows remain stationary or leave a residual trough to the south of the Alps.&lt;ref name="nrlmil" /&gt; Three principal tracks which they typically follow were identified by Wilhelm Jakob van Bebber who classified [[European windstorm]] tracks ("Zyklonenbahnen" in German) in 1891.&lt;ref name="Kreienkamp" /&gt; To this date, track V of the latter group has remained in common use, unlike the large majority of van Bebber's tracks.&lt;ref name="Kreienkamp" /&gt; The V track is linked to flooding events in central and eastern Europe, low pressure areas (south of the Alps) can track across France into the Mediterranean Sea where they pick up additional moisture, or form, and then move into central and eastern or southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Vb-Wetterlage ist das Härteste|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/meteorologie-die-vb-wetterlage-ist-das-haerteste/1659146.html|publisher=tagesspiegel.de|accessdate=28 March 2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tracks diverge from the Genoa low formation area along the following pathways.

====Vb track====
A strong southwesterly flow in the upper atmosphere leads the lows to the northeast and north-northeast, ("Zugstrasse Vb" Van Bebber) towards the [[Vienna Basin]]. The lows then glide over colder and denser air from the northwest and are lifted orographically by the [[Bohemian Massif]], [[Ore Mountains]], [[Sudetes]], [[Beskids]] and [[Tatra Mountains]].&lt;ref name=Mudelsee&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mudelsee |first1=M. |last2=Börngen |first2=M. |last3=Tetzlaff |first3=G. |last4=Grünewald |first4=U. |title=Extreme floods in central Europe over the past 500 years: Role of cyclone pathway 'Zugstrasse Vb' |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=December 2004 |volume=109 |doi=10.1029/2004JD005034 |url=http://www.manfredmudelsee.com/publ/pdf/Extreme_floods_in_central_Europe_over_the_past_500_years.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=30 November 2012|bibcode = 2004JGRD..10923101M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm and moist air masses cause prolonged and abundant precipitation during slow [[Meridional flow]] over the upper catchments of both the southern and northern [[European Watershed]]. Flooding then progresses down their major rivers of central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Europe Floods 2010|url=http://www.eqecat.com/pdfs/central-europe-floods-2010-05.pdf|publisher=eqecat|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 'Vb-track' displays a high potential for large summer floods in Europe.&lt;ref name="Donat"&gt;{{cite web|last=Donat|first=Markus G.|title=European wind storms, related loss potentials and changes in multi-model climate simulations|url=http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDISS_derivate_000000007781/Donat_Dissertation_Public.pdf?hosts=|work=Dissertation, FU Berlin|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the link between large summer floods and the Vb track have also been described as having a significant but weak correlation.&lt;ref name="Mudelsee" /&gt;

Examples of flooding events which follow this pattern are:

====Vc track====
The Vc track draws the lows across the [[Panonian plain]] towards the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and on towards western [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldova]].

====Vd track====
If there is a strong anticyclone over the [[Balkans]], Turkey and the [[Black Sea]], the usual track of the low is southeasterly, skirting the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It is this track that moves the low across the Tyrrhenian Sea. Even after the primary low has moved out of the Tyrrhenian Sea-central Mediterranean area, if a residual trough remains south of the Alps, as is often the case, new centers can develop and occasionally move southeastward along the west coast of Italy.&lt;ref name="nrlmil" /&gt; It is also common that a Genoa Low that has moved to the southwest will stall and become stationary, just to the west of the foot of the Italian boot, and this often will be associated with new low centers developing to the east over the [[Ionian Sea]].&lt;ref name="nrlmil" /&gt; In this case, gale force [[Bora (wind)|Bora]] are typically generated by the time the depression moves into the Ionian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genoa Low|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wxfacts/Genoa-Low.htm|publisher=weather online|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hail''' is a form of solid [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. It is distinct from [[ice pellets]] (American English "sleet"), though the two are often confused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1668/whats-the-difference-between-hail-sleet-and-freezing-rain What's the difference between hail, sleet, and freezing rain?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202162403/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1668/whats-the-difference-between-hail-sleet-and-freezing-rain |date=2014-02-02 }}. The Straight Dope (1999-08-06). Retrieved on 2016-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice, each of which is called a '''hailstone'''. Ice pellets fall generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited during cold surface temperatures.&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster definition of "hailstone"|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hailstone|accessdate=2013-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116030043/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hailstone|archivedate=2013-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other forms of [[ice|water ice]] such as [[graupel]], which is made of [[hard rime|rime]], and [[ice pellets]], which are smaller and [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]], hailstones usually measure between {{convert|5|mm|in|1}} and {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} in diameter. The [[METAR]] reporting code for hail {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} or greater is '''GR''', while smaller hailstones and graupel are coded '''GS'''.

Hail is possible within most [[thunderstorm]]s as it is produced by [[cumulonimbus]],&lt;ref name="gloss"/&gt; and within {{convert|2|nmi|km}} of the parent storm.  Hail formation requires environments of strong, upward motion of air with the parent thunderstorm (similar to [[tornadoes]]) and lowered heights of the freezing level. In the [[mid-latitude]]s, hail forms near the [[continental climate|interiors of continents]], while in the [[tropics]], it tends to be confined to high [[elevation]]s.

There are methods available to detect hail-producing thunderstorms using [[weather satellite]]s and [[weather radar]] imagery. Hailstones generally fall at higher speeds as they grow in size, though complicating factors such as melting, friction with air, wind, and interaction with rain and other hailstones can slow their descent through [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the stones reach a damaging size, as it can cause serious damage to human-made structures and, most commonly, farmers' crops.

==Definition==
Any thunderstorm which produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Hailstorm|title=Hailstorm|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|accessdate=2009-08-29|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606103908/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Hailstorm|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hail has a diameter of {{convert|5|mm|in}} or more.&lt;ref name="gloss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=hail1|title=Hail|year=2009|accessdate=2009-07-15|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725142407/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=hail1|archivedate=2010-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hailstones can grow to {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} and weigh more than {{convert|0.5|kg|lb|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nssl0001.htm|title=Aggregate hailstone|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2007-04-23|accessdate=2009-07-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810182627/http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nssl0001.htm|archivedate=2009-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike ice pellets, hailstones are layered and can be irregular and clumped together.  Hail is composed of transparent ice or alternating layers of transparent and translucent ice at least {{convert|1|mm|in}} thick, which are deposited upon the hailstone as it travels through the cloud, suspended aloft by air with strong upward motion until its weight overcomes the [[vertical draft|updraft]] and falls to the ground. Although the diameter of hail is varied, in the United States, the average observation of damaging hail is between 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1&amp;nbsp;in) and [[golf ball]]-sized (1.75&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/jewell/hailslsc.pdf|title=P9.5 Evaluation of an Alberta Hail Growth Model Using Severe Hail Proximity Soundings in the United States|author1=Ryan Jewell|author2=Julian Brimelow|date=2004-08-17|accessdate=2009-07-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507044027/http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/jewell/hailslsc.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stones larger than 2&amp;nbsp;cm (0.80&amp;nbsp;in) are usually considered large enough to cause damage.  The [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] issues severe thunderstorm warnings when hail that size or above is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=D9553AB5-1#severethunderstorm|title=Severe Thunderstorm criteria|author=Meteorological Service of Canada|publisher=[[Environment Canada]]|date=November 3, 2010|accessdate=2011-05-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805192340/http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=D9553AB5-1#severethunderstorm|archivedate=August 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[National Weather Service]] has a 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1&amp;nbsp;in) or greater in diameter threshold, effective January 2010, an increase over the previous threshold of ¾-inch hail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=oneinchhail|title=NEW 1 Inch Hail Criteria|author=National Weather Service|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|date=January 4, 2010|accessdate=2011-05-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907093725/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=oneinchhail|archivedate=September 7, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries have different thresholds according to local sensitivity to hail; for instance grape growing areas could be adversely impacted by smaller hailstones. Hailstones can be very large or very small, depending on how strong the updraft is: weaker hailstorms produce smaller hailstones than stronger hailstorms (such as [[supercell]]s).

== Formation ==
Hail forms in strong [[thunderstorm]] clouds, particularly those with intense [[updraft]]s, high liquid water content, great vertical extent, large water droplets, and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing {{convert|0|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref name="gloss"/&gt;  These types of strong updrafts can also indicate the presence of a tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cae/svrwx/hail.htm|title=Hail...|accessdate=2009-08-28|date=2009-01-27|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, [[Columbia, South Carolina]]|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Eastern Region Headquarters|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412103944/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cae/svrwx/hail.htm|archivedate=2009-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth rate of hailstones is impacted by factors such as higher elevation, lower freezing zones, and wind shear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theweatherprediction.com/severe/hail/|title=FORECASTING HAIL|website=www.theweatherprediction.com|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Layer nature of the hailstones ===
[[File:hailshaft.jpg|thumb|right|Hail shaft]]
[[File:Hail clouds.jpg|thumb|Severe thunderstorms containing hail can exhibit a characteristic green coloration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology|page=1754|author=Frank W. Gallagher, III.|title=Distant Green Thunderstorms – Frazer's Theory Revisited|volume=39|date=October 2000|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|doi=10.1175/1520-0450-39.10.1754|issue=10|bibcode = 2000JApMe..39.1754G }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like other precipitation in cumulonimbus clouds, hail begins as water droplets. As the droplets rise and the temperature goes below freezing, they become [[supercooled]] [[water]] and will freeze on contact with [[condensation nuclei]]. A cross-section through a large hailstone shows an onion-like structure.  This means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers, alternating with layers that are thin, white and opaque.  Former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents, falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted.  This up and down motion was thought to be responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone.  New research, based on theory as well as field study, has shown this is not necessarily true.

The storm's [[updraft]], with upwardly directed wind speeds as high as {{convert|110|mph|km/h}},&lt;ref name="ncar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/research/meteorology/storms/hail.php|title=Hail|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-18|author=National Center for Atmospheric Research|publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527170048/http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/research/meteorology/storms/hail.php#|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; blows the forming hailstones up the cloud. As the hailstone ascends it passes into areas of the cloud where the concentration of humidity and supercooled water droplets varies.  The hailstone’s growth rate changes depending on the variation in humidity and supercooled water droplets that it encounters.  The accretion rate of these water droplets is another factor in the hailstone’s growth.  When the hailstone moves into an area with a high concentration of water droplets, it captures the latter and acquires a translucent layer.  Should the hailstone move into an area where mostly water vapour is available, it acquires a layer of opaque white ice.&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt;

Furthermore, the hailstone’s speed depends on its position in the cloud’s updraft and its mass.  This determines the varying thicknesses of the layers of the hailstone.  The accretion rate of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstone depends on the relative velocities between these water droplets and the hailstone itself. This means that generally the larger hailstones will form some distance from the stronger updraft where they can pass more time growing.&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt;  As the hailstone grows it releases [[latent heat]], which keeps its exterior in a liquid phase. Because it undergoes 'wet growth', the outer layer is ''sticky'' (i.e. more adhesive), so a single hailstone may grow by collision with other smaller hailstones, forming a larger entity with an irregular shape.&lt;ref name="Brimlow"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modeling Maximum Hail Size in Alberta Thunderstorms|journal=Weather and Forecasting|author1=Julian C. Brimelow |author2=Gerhard W. Reuter |author3=Eugene R.

Hail can also undergo 'dry growth' in which the latent heat release through freezing is not enough to keep the outer layer in a liquid state. Hail forming in this manner appears [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] due to small air bubbles that become trapped in the stone during rapid freezing. These bubbles coalesce and escape during the 'wet growth' mode, and the hailstone is more clear. The mode of growth for a hailstone can change throughout its development, and this can result in distinct layers in a hailstone's cross-section.&lt;ref name=rauber&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9_8YLgEACAAJ&amp;dq=severe+%26+hazardous+weather|title=Severe &amp; Hazardous Weather|isbn=9780757597725|author1=Rauber|first1=Robert M|last2=Walsh|first2=John E|last3=Charlevoix|first3=Donna Jean|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hailstone will keep rising in the thunderstorm until its mass can no longer be supported by the updraft.  This may take at least 30 minutes based on the force of the updrafts in the hail-producing thunderstorm, whose top is usually greater than 10&amp;nbsp;km high.  It then falls toward the ground while continuing to grow, based on the same processes, until it leaves the cloud. It will later begin to melt as it passes into air above freezing temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html|title=Hail Fact Sheet|date=2000-04-10|author=Jacque Marshall|accessdate=2009-07-15|publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015141754/http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html|archivedate=2009-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, a unique trajectory in the thunderstorm is sufficient to explain the layer-like structure of the hailstone.  The only case in which multiple trajectories can be discussed is in a multicellular thunderstorm, where the hailstone may be ejected from the top of the "mother" cell and captured in the updraft of a more intense "daughter" cell.  This, however, is an exceptional case.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Influence of Storm Flow Struce on Hail Growth|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |author=Stephan P.

=== Factors favoring hail ===
Hail is most common within continental interiors of the mid-latitudes, as hail formation is considerably more likely when the freezing level is below the altitude of {{convert|11000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="mesoanal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meted.ucar.edu/resource/soo/MesoAnalyst.htm|title=Meso-Analyst Severe Weather Guide|first=Pete|last=Wolf|date=2003-01-16|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030320222147/http://www.meted.ucar.edu/resource/soo/MesoAnalyst.htm|archivedate=2003-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Entrainment (meteorology)|Movement]] of dry air into strong thunderstorms over continents can increase the frequency of hail by promoting evaporational cooling which lowers the freezing level of thunderstorm clouds giving hail a larger volume to grow in.    Accordingly, hail is less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater altitude.  Hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas E. Downing |author2=Alexander A. Olsthoorn |author3=Richard S. J.

Hail growth becomes vanishingly small when air temperatures fall below {{convert|-30|C|F|0}} as supercooled water droplets become rare at these temperatures.&lt;ref name="mesoanal"/&gt;  Around thunderstorms, hail is most likely within the cloud at elevations above {{convert|20000|ft|m}}.

In [[North America]], hail is most common in the area where [[Colorado]], [[Nebraska]], and [[Wyoming]] meet, known as "Hail Alley".&lt;ref name="ncarhail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html|title=Fact Sheet on Hail|accessdate=2009-07-18|author=Rene Munoz|date=2000-06-02|publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015141754/http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html|archivedate=2009-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hail in this region occurs between the months of March and October during the afternoon and evening hours, with the bulk of the occurrences from May through September. [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]] is North America's most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season.&lt;ref name="Nolanhail"/&gt; To the north of this area and also just downwind of the Rocky Mountains is the [[Hailstorm Alley]] region of [[Alberta]], which also experiences an increased incidence of significant hail events.

== Short-term detection ==
[[File:Three body scatter spike-NOAA.png|thumb|Example of a three-body spike: the weak triangular echoes (pointed by the arrow) behind the red and white thunderstorm core are related to hail inside the storm.]]
[[Weather radar]] is a very useful tool to detect the presence of hail-producing thunderstorms. However, radar data has to be complemented by a knowledge of current atmospheric conditions which can allow one to determine if the current atmosphere is conducive to hail development.

Modern radar scans many angles around the site. Reflectivity values at multiple angles above ground level in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the [[Vertically Integrated Liquid]] or VIL, gives the [[liquid water content]] in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm is related to the evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/projects/hail_study.htm|title=VIL density and Associated Hail Size Along the Northwest Gulf Coast|author1=Charles A. Roeseler |author2=Lance Wood |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Southern Region Headquarters|date=2006-02-02|accessdate=2009-08-28|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818231127/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/projects/hail_study.htm |archivedate = August 18, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.

Certain patterns of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The [[three body scatter spike]] is an example. This is the result of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went directly from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.

More recently, the [[Dual polarization|polarization]] properties of weather radar returns have been analyzed to differentiate between hail and heavy rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K. |last1=Aydin |first2=T.A. |last2=Seliga |first3=V. |last3=Balaji |date=October 1986 |title=Remote Sensing of Hail with a Dual Linear Polarization Radar |journal=Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1475–14 |doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1986)025&lt;1475:RSOHWA&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1520-0450|bibcode = 1986JApMe..25.1475A  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chill.colostate.edu/w/Hail_signature_development|title=Hail Signature Development|author=[[Colorado State University]]-CHILL National Radar Facility|publisher=[[Colorado State University]]|date=2007-08-22|accessdate=2009-08-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107012923/http://chill.colostate.edu./w/Hail_signature_development|archivedate=2009-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of differential reflectivity (&lt;math&gt;Z_{dr}&lt;/math&gt;), in combination with horizontal reflectivity (&lt;math&gt;Z_{h}&lt;/math&gt;) has led to a variety of hail classification algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chill.colostate.edu/w/Hydrometeor_classification_example|title=Hydrometeor classification example|author=[[Colorado State University]]-CHILL National Radar Facility|publisher=[[Colorado State University]]|date=2008-08-25|accessdate=2009-08-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624185402/http://chill.colostate.edu/w/Hydrometeor_classification_example|archivedate=2010-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visible satellite imagery is beginning to be used to detect hail, but false alarm rates remain high using this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0169-8095(96)00032-4|date=1998-07-25|title=Satellite data based detection and prediction of hail|last1=Bauer-Messmer|first1=Bettina|last2=Waldvogel|first2=Albert|journal=Atmospheric Research|volume=43|issue=3|page=217|bibcode = 1997AtmRe..43..217B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hagelkorn mit Anlagerungsschichten.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Large hailstone with concentric rings]]

The size of hailstones is best determined by measuring their diameter with a ruler.  In the absence of a ruler, hailstone size is often visually estimated by comparing its size to that of known objects, such as coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnrdata.dnr.ne.gov/NeRAIN/docs/hail.asp |title=NeRAIN Data Site-Measuring Hail |author1=Nebraska Rainfall Assessment |author2=Information Network |publisher=Nebraska Department of Natural Resources |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302170320/http://dnrdata.dnr.ne.gov/NeRAIN/docs/hail.asp |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the objects such as hen's eggs, peas, and marbles for comparing hailstone sizes is imprecise, due to their varied dimensions.

[[Terminal velocity]] of hail, or the speed at which hail is falling when it strikes the ground, varies.

== Accumulations ==

[[Image:Hail in Charlton, Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|Accumulated hail after a storm in [[Charlton, Massachusetts]]]]

Narrow zones where hail accumulates on the ground in association with thunderstorm activity are known as hail streaks or hail swaths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/hail/hail_climatology.html|title=Hail Climatology|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2006-10-09|accessdate=2009-08-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613020028/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/hail/hail_climatology.html|archivedate=2009-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be detectable by satellite after the storms pass by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-roc.inria.fr/clime/lynx/peters-factsheet.pdf|title=Crop Hail Damage Assessment|author=Albert J.

Flash flooding and mudslides within areas of steep terrain can be a concern with accumulating hail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesudburystar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1612615|title=Sudbury lashed by freak storm; hail pummels downtown core|author=Harold Carmichael|date=2009-06-15|accessdate=2009-08-28|newspaper=Sudbury Star|publisher=Sun Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depths of up to {{convert|18|in|m|abbr=on}} have been reported. A landscape covered in accumulated hail generally resembles one covered in accumulated snow and any significant accumulation of hail has the same restrictive effects as snow accumulation, albeit over a smaller area, on transport and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Thomas W. Schlatter|author2=Nolan Doesken|date=September 2010|title=Deep Hail: Tracking an Elusive Phenomenon|url=http://www.weatherwise.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2010/September%202010/weather-deep-hail-full.html|journal=Weatherwise|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|volume=63|issn=0043-1672|accessdate=2015-08-09|number=5}} {{Dead link|date=May 2017|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accumulated hail can also cause flooding by blocking drains, and hail can be carried in the floodwater, turning into a snow-like slush which is deposited at lower elevations.

On somewhat rare occasions, a thunderstorm can become stationary or nearly so while prolifically producing hail and significant depths of accumulation do occur; this tends to happen in mountainous areas, such as the July 29, 2010 case&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.coloradodaily.com/rant-rave/ci_15630529#axzz1NnYBPl6D|title = Boulder County cleans up Nederland-area roadways after foot-deep hailstorm|last = Rubino|first = Joe|date = 2010-07-29|work = Colorado Daily|accessdate = 2014-12-20|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610200951/http://www.coloradodaily.com/rant-rave/ci_15630529#axzz1NnYBPl6D|archivedate = 2015-06-10|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a foot of hail accumulation in [[Boulder County]], Colorado. On June 5, 2015, hail up to four feet deep fell on one city block in [[Denver, Colorado]].  The hailstones, described as between the size of bumble bees and ping pong balls, were accompanied by rain and high winds.  The hail fell in only the one area, leaving the surrounding area untouched.  It fell for one and a half hours between 10 p.m. and 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. A meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder said, "It's a very interesting phenomenon.  We saw the storm stall. It produced copious amounts of hail in one small area. It's a meteorological thing."  Tractors used to clear the area filled more than 30 dump-truck loads of hail.&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28258514/one-denver-block-buried-under-up-four-feet | title=One Denver block buried under up to 4 feet of hail | publisher=The Denver Post | date=5 June 2015 | accessdate=7 June 2015 | author=Mitchell, Kirk | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606235643/http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28258514/one-denver-block-buried-under-up-four-feet | archivedate=6 June 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research focused on four individual days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) of hail in 30 minutes on the Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=E. Kalina et. all|date=26 October 2015|title=Colorado Plowable Hailstorms: Synoptic Weather, Radar and Lightning Characteristics|url=|journal=American Meteorological Society|volume=31|issue=2|page=663|doi=10.1175/WAF-D-15-0037.1|bibcode=2016WtFor..31..663K}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing research in this area is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clouds.colorado.edu/deephail|title=Deep Hail Project – Report your hail depth!!|publisher=University of Colorado Boulder|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708085322/http://clouds.colorado.edu/deephail|archivedate=2016-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suppression and prevention ==
[[Image:Banska Stiavnica Cannon-1.JPG|thumb|right|Hail cannon in an old castle in [[Banska Stiavnica]], Slovakia]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], people in Europe used to ring church bells and fire [[cannon]]s to try to prevent hail, and the subsequent damage to crops. Updated versions of this approach are available as modern [[hail cannon]]s. [[Cloud seeding]] after [[World War II]] was done to eliminate the hail threat,&lt;ref name="ncar"/&gt; particularly across [[the Soviet Union]] – where it was claimed a 70 to 98&amp;nbsp;percent reduction in crop damage from hail storms was achieved by deploying [[silver iodide]] in clouds using [[rocket]]s and [[artillery shell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Abshaev M.T., Abshaev A.M., Malkarova A.M.

[[File:MosqueinAbuja.jpg|thumbnail|[[Harmattan]] Haze in [[Abuja]].]]
[[File:Striped Sun at Summer Solstice 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Haze over the [[Mojave Desert]] from a [[brush fire]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], seen as the Sun descends on the 2016 [[June solstice]], allows the Sun to be photographed without a [[photographic filter|filter]].]]'''Haze''' is traditionally an [[atmospheric phenomenon]] in which [[dust]], [[smoke]], and other dry [[particulates]] obscure the [[visibility|clarity]] of the sky. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] manual of codes includes a classification of horizontal obscuration into categories of [[fog]], [[ice fog]], [[steam fog]], [[mist]], haze, [[smoke]], [[vog|volcanic ash]], [[dust]], [[sand]], and [[snow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WMOCodes/WMO306_vI1/Publications/1995edition2005update/WMO306_Vol-I-1-PartA.pdf WMO Manual on Codes]&lt;/ref&gt; Sources for haze particles include [[agriculture|farming]] ([[ploughing]] in dry weather), traffic, industry, and [[wildfire]]s.

Seen from afar (e.g. an approaching airplane) and depending on the direction of view with respect to the Sun, haze may appear brownish or bluish, while [[mist]] tends to be bluish grey. Whereas haze often is thought of as a phenomenon of dry air, mist formation is a phenomenon of humid air. However, haze particles may act as [[cloud condensation nuclei|condensation nuclei]] for the subsequent formation of mist droplets; such forms of haze are known as "wet haze."

Haze also occurs when there is too much pollution in the air while there is also dust

In meteorological literature, the word ''haze'' is generally used to denote visibility-reducing [[aerosol]]s of the wet type. Such aerosols commonly arise from complex [[chemical reaction]]s that occur as [[sulfur dioxide]] gases emitted during [[combustion]] are converted into small droplets of [[sulfuric acid]]. The reactions are enhanced in the presence of [[sunlight]], high relative humidity, and stagnant air flow. A small component of wet-haze aerosols appear to be derived from compounds released by trees, such as [[terpenes]]. For all these reasons, wet haze tends to be primarily a warm-season phenomenon. Large areas of haze covering many thousands of kilometers may be produced under favorable conditions each [[summer]].

==Air pollution==
{{main|Smog}}

Haze often occurs when dust and smoke particles accumulate in relatively dry air. When weather conditions block the dispersal of smoke and other pollutants they concentrate and form a usually low-hanging shroud that impairs [[visibility]] and may become a [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] [[health]] threat. Industrial pollution can result in dense haze, which is known as [[smog]].

Since 1991, haze has been a particularly acute problem in Southeast Asia. The main source of the haze has been fires occurring in Sumatra and Borneo. In response to the [[1997 Southeast Asian haze]], the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN countries]] agreed on a Regional Haze Action Plan (1997). In 2002, all ASEAN countries signed the [[ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution|Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution]], but the pollution is still a problem today. Under the agreement, the ASEAN secretariat hosts a co-ordination and support unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haze-online.or.id/ ASEAN action hazeonline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205080201/http://www.haze-online.or.id/ |date=2005-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2013 Southeast Asian haze]], Singapore experienced a record high pollution level, with the 3-hour Pollution Standards Index reaching a record high of 401.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore haze hits record high from Indonesia fires|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22998592|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) program was developed as a collaborative effort between the US EPA and the National Park Service in order to establish the chemical composition of haze in National Parks and establish air pollution control measures in order to restore the visibility to pre-industrial levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/improve/ IMPROVE Visibility Program]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] requires that any current visibility problems be remedied, and future visibility problems be prevented, in 156 Class I Federal areas located throughout the United States.  A full list of these areas is available on EPA's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/visibility/class1.html Federal Class 1 Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International disputes ===

==== Transboundary haze ====

Haze is no longer a domestic problem. It has become one of the causes of international disputes among neighboring countries. Haze migrates to adjacent countries and thereby pollutes other countries as well.
One of the most recent problems concerned the two neighboring countries Malaysia and Indonesia. In 2013, due to forest fires in Indonesia, the capital city of Malaysia [[Kuala Lumpur]] and surrounding areas became shrouded in a pall of noxious fumes, smelling of ash and coal for more than a week, in the country’s worst environmental crisis since 1997. The main sources of the haze are Indonesia’s Sumatra Island, Kalimantan, and Riau, where farmers, plantation owners and miners have set hundreds of fires in the forests to clear land during dry weather. Winds blow most of the fumes across the narrow [[Strait of Malacca]] to Malaysia, although parts of Indonesia are also affected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8908221/ns/world_news-environment/#.VXPyvvmUdvA&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2015 Southeast Asian haze]] was a major crisis.

==Obscuration==
Haze causes issues in the area of terrestrial photography, where the penetration of large amounts of dense atmosphere may be necessary to image distant subjects. This results in the visual effect of a loss of [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] in the subject, due to the effect of light [[scattering]] through the haze [[particulate|particles]]. For these reasons, sunrise and sunset colors appear subdued on hazy days, and stars may be obscured at night. In some cases, attenuation by haze is so great that, toward sunset, the sun disappears altogether before reaching the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;''Figure 1''. "The setting sun dimmed by dense haze over State College, Pennsylvania on 16 September 1992". {{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noa.gov/publications/corfidi/haze.html |title=Haze over the Central and Eastern United States |publisher=The National Weather Digest |date= March 1996 |accessdate= April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Haze can be defined as an aerial form of the [[Tyndall effect]] therefore unlike other atmospheric effects such as cloud and fog, haze is spectrally selective: shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more, and longer (red/[[infrared]]) wavelengths are scattered less. For this reason, many super-telephoto lenses often incorporate yellow [[filter (optics)|filters]] or coatings to enhance image contrast. Infrared (IR) imaging may also be used to penetrate haze over long distances, with a combination of IR-pass optical filters (such as the [[Wratten number|Wratten 89B]]) and IR-sensitive detector.

In [[biology]], a '''hermaphrodite''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɜr|ˈ|m|æ|f|r|ə|d|aɪ|t}}) is an organism that has complete or partial [[reproductive organs]] and produces [[gametes]] normally associated with both male and female [[sexes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hermaphrodite Merriam-Webster Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807134545/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hermaphrodite |date=2011-08-07 }} Retrieved 28 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] groups of animals (mostly [[invertebrates]]) do not have separate sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263151/hermaphroditism| title=hermaphroditism| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]| accessdate=9 April 2013| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308104232/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263151/hermaphroditism| archivedate=8 March 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of [[sexual reproduction]] in which either partner can act as the "female" or "male." For example, the great majority of [[tunicata|tunicates]], [[pulmonate]] snails, [[opisthobranch]] [[snails]], [[earthworms]] and [[slug]]s are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other [[vertebrates]]. Most plants are also hermaphrodites.

Historically, the term ''hermaphrodite'' has also been used to describe [[ambiguous genitalia]] and [[gonadal mosaicism]] in individuals of [[gonochoristic]] species, especially human beings. The word ''[[intersex]]'' has come into preferred usage for humans, since the word ''hermaphrodite'' is considered to be misleading and stigmatizing,&lt;ref name=Dreger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreger|first1=Alice Domurat|title=Intersex in the age of ethics|date=1999|publisher=Univ.

Arthropods are the [[phylum]] with the largest number of species.  Most hermaphroditic species exhibit some degree of self-fertilization. The distribution of self-fertilization rates among animals is similar to that of plants, suggesting that similar processes are operating to direct the evolution of selfing in animals and plants.&lt;ref name="pmid17089966" /&gt;

Sequential hermaphrodites ([[dichogamy]]) occur in [[species]] in which the individual is born as one sex, but can later change into the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=barrows&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal behavior desk reference: a dictionary of animal behavior, ecology, and evolution |last=Barrows |first=Edward M.|authorlink= |edition=2nd |year=2001 |publisher=CRC Press |location= Boca Raton, Fla|isbn=978-0-8493-2005-7|oclc=299866547 |page= 317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts simultaneous hermaphrodites, in which an individual may possess fully functional male and female genitalia.

Sequential hermaphrodites can only change sex once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eAjSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage|title=Sex Determination in Fish|first=T.

Sequential hermaphrodites can be divided into three broad categories:
* '''Protandry''': Where an organism is born as a male, and then changes sex to a female.&lt;ref name=barrows/&gt;
** Example: The [[clownfish]] (genus ''[[Amphiprion]]'') are colorful reef fish found living in [[symbiosis]] with [[sea anemone]]s. Generally one anemone contains a 'harem', consisting of a large female, a smaller reproductive male, and even smaller non-reproductive males. If the female is removed, the reproductive male will change sex and the largest of the non-reproductive males will mature and become reproductive. It has been shown that fishing pressure can change when the switch from male to female occurs, since fishermen usually prefer to catch the larger fish. The populations are generally changing sex at a smaller size, due to [[natural selection]].
* '''Protogyny''': Where the organism is born as a female, and then changes sex to a male.&lt;ref name=barrows/&gt;
** Example: [[wrasse]]s (Family [[Labridae]]) are a group of reef fish in which protogyny is common. Wrasses also have an uncommon life history strategy, which is termed diandry (literally, two males). In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase male and a terminal phase male. Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial. They are, perhaps, female mimics (which is why they are found swimming in group with other females). Terminal phase males are territorial and have a distinctively bright coloration. Individuals are born as males or females, but if they are born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Females and initial phase males can become terminal phase males. Usually, the most dominant female or initial phase male replaces any terminal phase male when those males die or abandon the group.
*'''Bidirectional Sex Changers''': where an organism has female and male reproductive organs, but act as either female or male during different stages in life.&lt;ref name=barrows/&gt;
**Example: [[Lythrypnus dalli]] (Family [[Lythrypnus]]) are a group of [[coral reef fish]] in which bidirectional sex change occurs. Once a social hierarchy is established a fish changes sex according to its social status, regardless of the initial sex, based on a simple principle: if the fish expresses subordinate behavior then it changes its sex to female, and if the fish expresses dominant or not subordinate behavior then the fish changes its sex to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodgers|first=E.W.|author2=Early, R.L. |author3=Grober, M.S. |title=Social status determines sexual phenotype in the bi-directional sex changing bluebanded goby Lythrypnus dalli|journal=J Fish Biol|year=2007|volume=70|issue=6|pages=1660–1668.|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, [[grouper]]s are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often [[aquacultured]]. Since the adults take several years to change from female to male, the [[broodstock]] are extremely valuable individuals.

===Simultaneous hermaphrodites===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gnathostomulid]] --&gt;
&lt;!--"Simultaneous hermaphrodite" redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Mating Pseudobiceros bedfordi.png|thumb|[[Turbellaria]]ns mating by [[penis fencing]]. Each has two penises on the undersides of their heads which they use to inject sperm.]][[File:Mating earthworms.jpg|Mating Earthworms|thumb|[[Earthworm]]s are simultaneous hermaphrodites, having both male and female reproductive organs.]]
A simultaneous (or synchronous) hermaphrodite (or homogamous) is an adult organism that has both male and female sexual organs at the same time.&lt;ref name=barrows/&gt; [[Self-fertilization]] often occurs.
* [[Reproductive system of gastropods]]: [[Pulmonate]] [[land snail]]s and land [[slug]]s are perhaps the best-known kind of simultaneous hermaphrodite, and are the most widespread of terrestrial animals possessing this sexual polymorphism. Sexual material is exchanged between both animals via [[spermatophore]], which can then be stored in the [[spermatheca]]. After exchange of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], both animals will lay fertilized eggs after a period of gestation; then the eggs will proceed to hatch after a development period. Snails typically reproduce in early spring and late autumn.
*[[:Banana slug]]s are one example of a hermaphroditic gastropod. Mating with a partner is more desirable biologically, as the genetic material of the resultant offspring is varied, but if mating with a partner is not possible, self-fertilization is practiced. The male sexual organ of an adult banana slug is quite large in proportion to its size, as well as compared to the female organ. It is possible for banana slugs, while mating, to become stuck together. If a substantial amount of wiggling fails to separate them, the male organ will be bitten off (using the slug's [[radula]]), see [[apophallation]]. If a banana slug has lost its male sexual organ, it can still mate as a female, making its hermaphroditic quality a valuable adaptation.
* The species of colourful [[sea slugs]] ''[[Goniobranchus reticulatus]]'' is hermaphroditic, with both male and female organs active at the same time during copulation.  After mating, the external portion of the penis detaches, but is able to regrow within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21431678 | title = Sea slug's 'disposable penis' surprises | author = Rebecca Morelle | date = 12 February 2013 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2012.1150 | title = Disposable penis and its replenishment in a simultaneous hermaphrodite | year = 2013 | last1 = Sekizawa | first1 = A. | last2 = Seki | first2 = S. | last3 = Tokuzato | first3 = M. | last4 = Shiga | first4 = S. | last5 = Nakashima | first5 = Y. | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 20121150 | pmid=23407499 | pmc=3639767}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hamlet (fish)|Hamlets]], unlike other fish, seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self-fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights.
* [[Earthworm]]s are another example of a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Although they possess ovaries and testes, they have a protective mechanism against self-fertilization. Sexual reproduction occurs when two worms meet and exchange [[gamete]]s, copulating on damp nights during warm seasons. Fertilized eggs are protected by a cocoon, which is buried on or near the surface of the ground.
* The free-living hermaphroditic nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of approximately 1%.&lt;ref name="pmid16005289"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barrière A, Félix MA |title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

* The mangrove killifish (''[[Mangrove rivulus|Kryptolebias marmoratus]]'') is a species of fish that lives along the east coast of North, Central and South America. These fish are simultaneous hermaphrodites. ''K. marmoratus'' produces eggs and sperm by meiosis and routinely reproduces by self-fertilization. Each individual hermaphrodite normally fertilizes itself when an egg and sperm produced by an internal organ unite inside the fish's body.&lt;ref&gt;Sakakura, Y., Soyano, K., Noakes, D.L.G. &amp; Hagiwara, A.

===Pseudohermaphroditism===
{{main|Pseudohermaphroditism}}
When [[spotted hyena]]s were first discovered by explorers, they were thought to be hermaphrodites. Early observations of spotted hyenas in the wild led researchers to believe that all spotted hyenas, male and female, were born with what appeared to be a penis. The [[Spotted hyena#Female genitalia|apparent penis in female spotted hyenas]] is in fact an enlarged clitoris, which contains an external birth canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/699-painful-realities-hyena-sex.html|title=The Painful Realities of Hyena Sex|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119124756/http://www.livescience.com/699-painful-realities-hyena-sex.html|archivedate=2012-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/716.php|title=Hyena Graphic|website=EurekAlert!|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310230213/http://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/716.php|archivedate=2011-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be difficult to determine the sex of wild spotted hyenas until [[sexual maturity]], when they may become pregnant.

Some people who are intersex, such as some of those with [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], outwardly appear completely female or male, frequently without realizing they are intersex. Other kinds of intersex conditions are identified immediately at birth because those with the condition have a sexual organ larger than a clitoris and smaller than a penis.

Some humans were historically termed [[true hermaphroditism|true hermaphrodites]] if their [[gonad]]al tissue contained both testicular and ovarian tissue, or [[pseudohermaphroditism|pseudohermaphrodites]] if their external appearance ([[phenotype]]) differed from sex expected from internal gonads. This language has fallen out of favor due to misconceptions and pejorative connotations associated with the terms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreger|first=Alice D.|last2=Chase|first2=Cheryl|last3=Sousa|first3=Aron|last4=Gruppuso|first4=Phillip A.|last5=Frader|first5=Joel|date=18 August 2005|title="Changing the Nomenclature/Taxonomy for Intersex: A Scientific and Clinical Rationale."|url=http://www.aissg.org/PDFs/Dreger-Nomenclature-2005.PDF|journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=27 July 2016|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220154642/http://www.aissg.org/PDFs/Dreger-Nomenclature-2005.PDF|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a shift to nomenclature based on genetics.

Intersex is in some caused by unusual sex hormones; the unusual hormones may be caused by an atypical set of sex chromosomes. One possible pathophysiologic explanation of intersex in humans is a [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an [[X chromosome|X]] and the other carrying a [[Y chromosome|Y]] chromosome), the two [[zygote|fertilized ova]] are then [[Chimera (genetics)|fused together]] resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal ([[ovotestes]]) and [[Sex-determination system|genetic sex]]. Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the [[SRY]] from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during [[meiosis]]. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of [[testes]] in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of [[SOX9]], and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of [[ovarian]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s). Thus, [[testicular]] and ovarian tissues will both be present in the same individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Fetuses before [[sexual differentiation]] are sometimes described as female by doctors explaining the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leyner |first1=Mark |authorlink1= Mark Leyner|last2=Goldberg M.D.|first2=Billy|title=Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini|year=2005 |publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-8231-5|oclc=57722472}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is technically not true. Before this stage, humans are simply undifferentiated and possess a [[Müllerian duct]], a [[Wolffian duct]], and a [[genital tubercle]].

'''Hermaphrodite''' is used in [[botany]] to describe a [[flower]] that has both [[stamen|staminate]] (male, pollen-producing) and [[carpel]]late (female, ovule-producing) parts. This condition is seen in many common garden plants. A closer analogy to hermaphroditism in botany is the presence of separate male and female flowers on the same individual—such plants are called [[monoecious]]. Monoecy is especially common in [[Pinophyta|conifers]], but occurs in only about 7% of angiosperm species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Molnar|first=Sebastian|title= Plant Reproductive Systems|url= http://www.geocities.com/we_evolve/Plants/breeding_sys.html|date= 17 February 2004|work= Evolution and the Origins of Life|publisher= Geocities.com|accessdate=12 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022174814/http://geocities.com/we_evolve/Plants/breeding_sys.html|archivedate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition also occurs in some algae.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, L. 1931 ''A Handbook of the British Seaweeds.''

The '''IIHF World Ranking''' is a ranking of the performance of the national [[ice hockey]] teams of member countries of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF). It is based on a formula giving points for each team's placings at IIHF-sanctioned tournaments over the previous four years. The ranking is used to determine seedings and qualification requirements for future IIHF tournaments. The current leader in rankings is [[Canada]] in men's play and the [[United States]] in women's play.

==Description==
The system was approved at the IIHF congress of September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/hockey/nhl/09/20/saturday_roundup.ap/ |title=Canadiens lose Koivu, Michaud to injury in 4-3 loss to Senators |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=20 September 2003 |author=The Associated Press |accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to IIHF President [[René Fasel]], the system was designed to be simple to understand and "reflect the long-term quality of all national hockey programs and their commitment to international hockey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor=Edvinsson, Jan-Ake |title=News release–Hockey fans are the best in the world |publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation |date=November 2003 |volume=7 |issue=5 |format=PDF |url=http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/The_IIHF/IIHF_Vol7No5.pdf |page=7| accessdate = 12 May 2009 |work=Ice Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ranking is used to determine the seeding of the teams for the next World Championship and to select the teams which can participate in Winter Olympics without playing in the qualifying round. For example, for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], the first nine teams of the Men's World Ranking and the first six of the Women's World Ranking were pre-qualified. Qualification for the men's tournament at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] was structured around the 2012 ranking. Twelve spots were made available for teams. The top nine teams in the World Ranking after the [[2012 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] received automatic berths into the Ice Hockey event. All IIHF teams had an opportunity to [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Men's qualification|qualify]] for the event. Teams that wished to participate ranked below 29th played a preliminary qualification in September 2012. The winner of the preliminary and teams ranked 19-29th were divided in three groups to play in the pre-qualification round in November 2012. The winner of each pre-qualification group and teams ranked 10-18 were divided in three groups to play in the final qualification in February 2013. The winner of each group then joined the nine top-ranked teams in the Olympics in 2014.

The women's tournament uses a similar qualification format. The top six teams in the IIHF Women's World Ranking after the [[2012 IIHF Women's World Championship]] received automatic berths into the ice hockey event. Lower ranked teams had an opportunity to [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Women's qualification|qualify]] for the event. Teams ranked 19th and below were divided into two groups where they played in a preliminary qualification round in the autumn of 2012. The two winners and teams ranked 13-18 were divided into two groups where they played in the pre-qualification round in November 2012. The two group winners from the round advanced to the final qualification round, where the teams ranked seventh through twelfth joined them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=2014 Olympic Winter Games|url=http://www.iihf.com/sk/home-of-hockey/championships/olympics.html|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formula===
The world ranking is based on the final positions of the last four [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] and last [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympic ice hockey tournament]]. Points are assigned according to a team's final placement in the World Championship or the Olympic tournament. The world champion receives 1200 points and then a 20-point interval is used between teams. However, a 40-point interval is used between gold and silver, silver and bronze, fourth and fifth, and eighth and ninth. This is used as a bonus for the teams who reach the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the final and for winning the gold medal.&lt;ref name="WORLD RANKING"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/world-ranking.html |title=World Ranking |publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]] |date= |accessdate=11 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qOzP24jA?url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/world-ranking.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Points awarded in the current year are valued at the full amount. Points award in the prior years decline linearly by 25% until the fifth year when they are dropped from the calculation.&lt;ref name="WORLD RANKING"/&gt; For example, if after the 2018 Olympics a team had won the gold medal in the last four championships and the last Olympic tournament their score would be 4200:

==Men's rankings==
{{see also|List of IIHF World Rankings}}
The Men's 2018 ranking&lt;ref name="iihf2018men"/&gt; is based on the performance at the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]] of [[2018 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2018]], [[2017 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2017]], [[2016 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2016]], and [[2015 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2015]], and at the [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Olympic]] [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Ice Hockey Tournament]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], South Korea.&lt;ref name="WORLD RANKING"/&gt;

For the 2018 Winter Olympics, Russia's Olympic Committee and many of its athletes were banned for [[doping in sport|illegal doping]].&lt;ref name="Russia Olympic Ban"/&gt; The IIHF opposed an outright ban on all Russian players, concerned that the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]] would disallow its players from participating in the tournament, as the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] had done.&lt;ref name="IIHF Russia"/&gt; The ice hockey team from the Russian hockey federation played under the banner of the International Olympic Committee as "Olympic Athletes from Russia", along with other Russian athletes not banned for doping.&lt;ref name="IIHF Russia"/&gt;

The following table lists the current ranking following the [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|2018 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2018 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]]. Scores in ''italics'' represent minimum possible scores for unfinished tournaments. All tournament's points have their full value displayed, while the ranking is calculated by adding the current year's tournament points to the depreciated previous three years' tournament points as explained above. The depreciated percentages are shown in the column headings, first for the current total, then for the new total. The "Total" columns are the sums of the current tournament points and the depreciated values for past tournaments. The "+/–" columns indicate the increase or decrease in ranking since the last tournament. A dash in a tournament column indicates that the country did not participate.

==Women's rankings==
{{see also|List of IIHF World Rankings}}
The Women's 2018 ranking&lt;ref name="womenrank"/&gt; is based on the performance at the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|World Championships]] of [[2017 IIHF Women's World Championship|2017]], [[2016 IIHF Women's World Championship|2016]], [[2015 IIHF Women's World Championship|2015]], and [[2014 Women's Ice Hockey World Championships|2014]], and at the [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Olympic]] [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Women's tournament|Ice Hockey Tournament]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], South Korea.&lt;ref name="WORLD RANKING"/&gt;

For the 2018 Winter Olympics, Russia's Olympic Committee and many of its athletes were banned due to systemic [[doping in sport|illegal doping]].&lt;ref name="Russia Olympic Ban"/&gt; The IIHF opposed an outright ban on all Russian players&lt;ref name="IIHF Russia"/&gt; and the ice hockey team from the Russian hockey federation played under the banner of the International Olympic Committee as "Olympic Athletes from Russia", along with other Russian athletes not banned for doping.

The following table lists the ranking following the [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Women's qualification|2018 Winter Olympic qualification tournaments]] and the [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Women's tournament|2018 Winter Olympics]]. Scores in ''italics'' represent minimum possible scores for unfinished tournaments. All tournament's points have their full value displayed, while the ranking is calculated by adding the current year's tournament points to the depreciated previous three years' tournament points as explained above. The depreciated percentages are shown in the column headings, first for the current total, then for the new total. The "Total" columns are the sums of the current tournament points and the depreciated values for past tournaments. The "+/–" columns indicate the increase or decrease in ranking since the last tournament. A dash in a tournament column indicates that the country did not participate.

It mainly consists of a trace of three separate [[Striation (geology)|striations]].

== Structure ==
The fault was first mapped by the Active Fault Research Group in 1991 as a complex of north-northwest-striking inactive traces of fault in the [[Hamadōri]] region. It has since been compartmentalized into separate [[Striation (geology)|striations]] near Tabito-cho west of [[Iwaki, Fukushima|Iwaki]] city. The northernmost and largest of the faultlines, the '''North Fault''', was identified in 2009 and extends roughly 24&amp;nbsp;km (15&amp;nbsp;mi) from the southeast to the northwest (N45˚W). To its southwest, two parallel faultlines, the '''East''' and '''Shionihara''' faults, extend from the south-southeast to the north-northwest (N10˚W). The faultlines are separated by 1&amp;nbsp;km (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi) and span roughly 23&amp;nbsp;km and 22&amp;nbsp;km (14&amp;nbsp;mi), respectively. The westernmost of the two, the Shionihara Fault lies near [[Iwaki, Fukushima#Towns|Tabito-cho]] and borders the small village of Shionohira, after which it was named.&lt;ref name=QR4&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.geerassociation.org/GEER_Post%20EQ%20Reports/Tohoku_Japan_2011/QR4_Preliminary%20Observations%20of%20Surface%20Fault%20Rupture_06.06.11.pdf|title=Preliminary Observations of Surface Fault Rupture from the April 11, 2011 Mw6.6 Hamadoori Earthquake, Japan (an aftershock of the March 11, 2011 Tohoku Offshore Earthquake, Japan)|publisher=Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance|first1=Keith I.|last1=Kelson|first2=Leslie F.|last2=Harder, Jr.|first3=Tadahiro|last3=Kishida|first4=Isabelle|last4=Ryder|date=5 June 2011|accessdate=31 January 2012|docket=GEER-025d|pages=1&amp;nbsp;6|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516135608/http://www.geerassociation.org/GEER_Post%20EQ%20Reports/Tohoku_Japan_2011/QR4_Preliminary%20Observations%20of%20Surface%20Fault%20Rupture_06.06.11.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main structural trend is north-northwest&amp;ndash;south-southeast, with sinking observed only to the south on the east side of the fault.  [[Metamorphic rock]] and [[Cretaceous]] [[Stratum|strata]], as well as [[granite]] and [[Amphibolite#Epidiorite|epidiorite]] are distributed in the region; the fault is described as a limit to the distribution of [[tuff]] from the [[Neogene|Neogene Period]].&lt;ref name=Hamadori&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outreach.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eqvolc/201103_tohoku/eng/hamadoori/|title=The surface earthquake fault of the 11th April 2011 earthquake in Hamadoori Fukushima pref|publisher=Outreach and Public Relations Office|date=13 April 2011|accessdate=31 January 2012|work=outreach.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219213656/http://outreach.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eqvolc/201103_tohoku/eng/hamadoori/|archivedate=19 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yunodake Fault===
To the northeast of the Idosawa Fault complex lies a separate normal fault trace, which was named the '''Yunodake Fault''' (also '''Yunotake''') in 2011. Distanced approx. 50&amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;nbsp;mi) from the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]], the fault had been dormant for 120,000&amp;ndash;130,000 before it ruptured during the [[April 2011 Fukushima earthquake|magnitude 7.1 M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; Fukushima Hamadori earthquake]] on 11 April 2011.&lt;ref name="Tokyo Electric Power Company"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/images/handouts_111121_03-e.pdf|title=Status of investigation on Yunotake Fault (quick report)|type=Pamphlet|date=21 November 2011|publisher=Tokyo Electric Power Company|series=[http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/handouts/indexold-e.html Press Conference Handouts Archive: November 2011]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several geological surveys have since been conducted in its vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Implication of recent case histories of earthquake-inflicted mass movement; a case studies at Ojiya City aftermaths the 2004 Mid Niigata Prefecture Earthquake and at Iwaki City aftermaths the 2011 Fukushima Prefecture Hamadori earthquake|docket=MEE10510|first1=Cigdem|last1=Tetik|publisher=International Institute of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|conferenceurl=http://www.segj.org/committee/gyouji/programView/youshiEng.php?event_id=32&amp;endai_id=1070|title=Overview of the urgent disaster investigation in Iwaki City, Fukushima prefecture|conference=SEGJ Technical Conference|publisher=Society of Exploration Geophysicists of Japan|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110928e13.pdf|type=Pamphlet|title=Overview of fault investigation regarding Yunodake fault|publisher=Tokyo Electric Power Company|series=[http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/handouts/indexold-e.html Press Conference Handouts Archive: September 2011]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[sedimentary rock]] layers deposited after the [[Late Pleistocene]] beneath the fault suggests that the Yunotake Fault had been in the active in the past.&lt;ref name="Tokyo Electric Power Company"/&gt;

An '''interdunal wetland''','''interdunal pond''' or '''dune slack''' is a water-filled depression between coastal [[sand dune]]s.  It may be formed either by wind erosion or by dunal encroachment on an existing wetland.&lt;ref name="widnr"&gt;{{Cite web

Because they are typically very shallow, interdunal wetlands warm quickly, and provide an abundant source of [[invertebrate]]s eaten by many species of [[shorebird]]s.&lt;ref name="kost"/&gt;  Many interdunal wetlands are ephemeral, drying out during periods of low rain or low water.

In the [[Great Lakes]] region of [[North America]], interdunal communities are typically mildly [[calcareous]] and dominated by [[Juncus|rush]]es, [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and shrubs.&lt;ref name="kost"&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:NemrutVolcano10.jpg|thumb|A view from Lake Nemrut.]]
'''Lake Nemrut''' ({{lang-tr|Nemrut Gölü}}) is a freshwater [[crater lake]] in [[Bitlis Province]], eastern Turkey. It is part of '''Nemrut Caldera''' ({{lang-tr|Nemrut Kalderası}}), a [[volcano|volcanic]] [[caldera]] atop [[Nemrut (volcano)|Volcano Nemrut]]. The caldera is a registered [[List of natural monuments of Turkey|natural monument]] and the wetlandsis registered as a [[Ramsar site]] of the country.

==Caldera==
[[File:Nemrut Crater.JPG|thumb|The crater of [[Nemrut (volcano)|Volcano Nemrut]].]]
The caldera is located west of [[Lake Van]] in the [[Tatvan]], [[Ahlat]] and [[Güroymak]] districts of Bitlis Province. It is named after the biblical figure King [[Nimrod]]. The caldera is {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} far from Tatvan, and {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} from Ahlat. With its width of nearly {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the crater of Nemrut Volcano is one of the largest calderas of the world. Nemrut Caldera is world's second largest one. The western half of the crater is covered by the lake. AT the summit, there are five lakes, two of them existing permanently and the others seasonal. The biggest of the lakes is Lake Nemrut in the form of [[crescent]]. It contains freshwater of colorless, odorless and drink water quality.&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;

Lake Nemrut is situated at an elevation of about {{convert|2247|m|ft|abbr=on}} above main sea level. It has an area of {{convert|12.36|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and its average depth is about {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a maximum depth of {{convert|176|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;

Nemrut Caldera is on the youngest [[volcanic cone]] in Turkey, which is in a not-eroded state. This unique structural [[geomorphology]] make it a subject of scientific research.&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;

==Biota==
===Flora===
About 450 plant species were recorded in and around Nemrut Caldera, around 200 (44%) of them belonging to the region. The diversity of the flora points out to the variation of climate conditions in the past. Around 38 (8.4%) of the existing plant species are [[endemism|endemic]]. The upside down tulip, which grows here, is a world-famous flower. The climax vegetation of Nemrut Caldera forms the haired birch (''[[Betula]]'') and the trembling aspen (''[[Populus tremula]]''). Other notable plants growing around two lakes of the caldera are the trees dwarf juniper (''[[Juniperus communis]]''), Norway maple (''[[Acer platanoides]]''), European mountain ash (''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]''), common buckthorn  (''[[Rhamnus cathartica]]''), sessile oak (''[[Quercus petraea]]''), pedunculate oak (''[[Quercus robur]]''), white willow (''[[Salix alba]]''), and the shrubs coinwort cotoneaster (''[[Cotoneaster nummularius]]''), cherry plum (''[[Prunus divaricata]]''), grey willow (''[[Salix cinerea]]''), Greek juniper (''[[Juniperus excelsa]]''), breaking buckthorn (''[[Frangula alnus]]''), alder buckthorn (''[[Frangula alnus]]'') and mahaleb cherry (''[[Prunus mahaleb]]''). Steppe-like vegetation is spread over wide areas in the caldera. Those are mainly species of milkvetch (''[[Astragalus]]''). Other [[subshrub]]s and [[herbaceous plant]]s  are prickly thrift (''[[Acantholimon]]''), sainfoin (''[[Onobrychis]]''), sheep's sorrel (''[[Rumex acetosella]]''), ''[[Thymus (plant)|Thymus]]'', ''[[Alyssum]]'', sheep's fescue (''[[Festuca ovina]]''), ''[[Salvia]]'', ''[[Ranunculus]]'', ''[[Silene]]'', rabbitfoot clover (''[[Trifolium arvense]]''), ''[[Pimpinella]]'', ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'', squarrose  (''[[Centaurea triumfettii]]''). Reedy areas are present In the northwestern part of Lake Nemrıt.&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;

===Fauna===
The [[griffon vulture]] [[egg incubation|brood their eggs]] at the caldera, which earned its status of special protected area as habitat for [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] of [[velvet duck]] and [[golden eagle]]. The number of bird species decreased at Lake Nemrut, which is a stopover site for a lot of [[bird migration|migrating bird]]s, due to irregular and uncontrolled hunting. Currently observed animals in the region are the bird species [[partridge]], [[duck]], [[bee-eater]], [[Armenian gull]] and mammals [[hare]], [[fox]], [[bear]]. The [[chamois]] has been [[extinction|extinct]].&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;

==Natural monument and Ramsar site==
The caldera was registered a [[natural monument]] in 2003. The protected area around the crater lake covers {{convert|4.8|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt; Nemrut Caldera Natural Monument ({{lang-tr|Nemrut Kalderası Tabiat Anıtı}}) is protected in the status of a [[tourist attraction]], a protected area of first degree and a [[wetland]].&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;

The government of Turkey designated the wetland of the caldera as the 14th [[Ramsar site]] of the country on April 17, 2013.&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tsa2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ro"/&gt;

It is not permitted to cut reed in the caldera and to fish in the lake, although some livestock grazing takes place around the caldera. A winter sports and ski center was established on the southern slope of the caldera in 2007. The main thread in terms of ecology is overgrazing.&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12068">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Virginia''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of November 2, 2017, there were 35 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No additional sites are currently proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  Four sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

This is a '''list of parties contracting to the [[Ramsar Convention]]''' ''on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat'', which is also known as the '''Convention on Wetlands'''. The Convention's mission is "“the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world”. It calls upon contracting parties to recognize the interdependence of humans and the environment as well as the ecological functions of [[wetland]]s, such as [[wildlife habitat]], [[nutrient cycling]], and [[flood control]]. 

The Ramsar Convention is the oldest multilateral international conservation convention and the only one to deal with one habitat or ecosystem type, wetlands. The Convention's headquarters are in [[Gland, Switzerland|Gland]], [[Switzerland]], and it works closely with the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |title=A brief history of the Ramsar Convention |publisher=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands |date=27 October 2011 |url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/ramsar/display/main/main.jsp?zn=ramsar&amp;cp=1-36-62_4000_0__ |accessdate=16 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EaKnotFH?url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/ramsar/display/main/main.jsp?zn=ramsar&amp;cp=1-36-62_4000_0__ |archivedate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contracting Parties of the Ramsar Convention|url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-about-parties-parties/main/ramsar/1-36-123%5E23808_4000_0__ |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EOE&gt;{{cite web|first=Joel |last=Heinen |title=Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat |publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth |date=20 June 2007 |editor=Hite, Kirsten |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Convention_on_Wetlands_of_International_Importance_especially_as_Waterfowl_Habitat |accessdate=19 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EaQmuen5?url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Convention_on_Wetlands_of_International_Importance_especially_as_Waterfowl_Habitat |archivedate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention was held in the city of [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], [[Iran]] in February 1971 and was originally contracted by seven countries when it came into force on 21 December 1975. As of February 2018 there are 170 contracting parties and over 2,000 designated sites covering over {{convert|200000000|ha|acre}}. Every contracting country has at least one Ramsar site, and 31 of the contracting countries have only one site. The country with the most sites is the United Kingdom with 170. To become a Ramsar site, a site must be nominated by a contracting country, meet at least one of nine criteria, and undergo scientific review. The Convention was most recently ratified by [[North Korea]] in 2018.

The table lists the countries contracting to the convention, the entry date of each country to the convention, the number of Ramsar sites in each country, and the total area of all Ramsar sites in each country.

{{Main|Psychoactive plant}}
[[File:Salvia divinorum - Herba de Maria.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''[[Salvia divinorum]],'' a dissociative hallucinogenic sage]]

A list of plants that are used as [[psychoactive drug]]s. Some of them have been used [[entheogen]]ically for millennia. The plants are listed according to the substances they contain.

==''Cannabis''==
[[File:Cannabis flowering.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Cannabis plant]]

{{Main|Cannabis}}
''Cannabis'' (Marijuana) is a popular psychoactive plant that is often used medically and recreationally. The psychoactive substance in ''Cannabis'', [[THC]], is unique in that it contains no nitrogen and is not an [[indole]], [[tryptamine]], [[phenethylamine]], [[anticholinergic]] (deliriant), or a [[dissociative]] drug. ''Cannabis'' plants tend to vary, with different strains producing dynamic balances of cannabinoids (THC, CBD, etc.) yielding markedly different effects. Popular strains are often hybrids of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' and ''[[Cannabis indica]]''.

Some universities and research firms currently study the medicinal effects of cannabis. Many jurisdictions have laws regulating or prohibiting the sale and use of [[medical cannabis|medical]] and [[recreational cannabis]].

==Tryptamines==

[[File:Dimethyltryptamine-3d-sticks.png|thumb|140px|right|DMT Molecule in 3D]]
Many of the psychedelic plants contain dimethyltryptamine ([[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]), which is either snorted (Virola, Yopo snuffs), vaporized, or drunk with MAOIs ([[Ayahuasca]]). It cannot simply be eaten as it is not orally active without an [[MAOI]] and it needs to be extremely concentrated to be vaporized.

Additionally, well known and proven extraction techniques for DMT have failed to produce any DMT or alkaloids from fresh bark or the leaves on multiple sample taken at various seasons. Should DMT actually exist in this species of Acacia then it exists in extremely small amounts and have failed to produce any alkaloids with Acid/Base extraction techniques using HCl/Na(OH)2. On the same note, more academic research is definitely required into the DMT content of this and other Australian Acacia species with proper chemical analysis of sample.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Beta-carboline]]s are "reversible" MAO-A inhibitors. They are found in some plants used to make [[Ayahuasca]]. In high doses the harmala alkaloids are somewhat hallucinogenic on their own. β-carboline is a [[benzodiazepine receptor]] [[inverse agonist]] and can therefore have convulsive, [[anxiogenic]] and memory enhancing effects.&lt;ref name="pmid17334612"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Venault P, Chapouthier G | title = From the behavioral pharmacology of beta-carbolines to seizures, anxiety, and memory | journal = ScientificWorldJournal | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 204–23 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17334612 | doi = 10.1100/tsw.2007.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[File:Nymphaea caerulea.jpg|150px]]
''[[Nymphaea caerulea]]''
|Blue lotus or lily. Recent studies have shown ''Nymphaea caerulea'' to have psychedelic properties, and may have been used as a sacrament in ancient Egypt and certain ancient South American cultures. Dosages of 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;grams of the flowers induces slight stimulation, a shift in thought processes, enhanced visual perception, and mild closed-eye visuals. ''Nymphaea caerulea'' is related to, and possesses similar activity as ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', the Sacred Lotus. Both ''Nymphaea caerulea'' and ''Nelumbo nucifera'' contain the alkaloids [[nuciferine]] and [[apomorphine]], which have been recently isolated by independent labs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

These psychoactive effects make ''Nymphaea caerulea'' a likely candidate (among several) for the lotus plant eaten by the mythical [[Lotophagi]] in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]].

Used in [[aromatherapy]], ''Nymphaea caerulea'' is purported to have a "divine" essence, bringing euphoria, heightened awareness and tranquility.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[File:Alchemist at work.jpg|thumb|Alchemist fixing his apparatus, with luting box and knife on the table (engraving, 1576)]]
[[File:03 terracottawarriors-greenarcher.jpg|thumb|Soldier from the [[Terracotta Army]], made of several parts luted together before firing]]
'''Lute''' (from [[Latin]] ''Lutum'', meaning mud, clay etc.)&lt;ref&gt;[[wiktionary:lute|Lute]], etymology 2 (Wiktionary).&lt;/ref&gt; was a substance used to [[Sealant|seal]] and affix apparatus employed in [[chemistry]] and [[alchemy]], and to protect component vessels against heat damage by fire; it was also used to line [[furnace]]s.  ''Lutation'' was thus the act of "cementing vessels with lute".

In [[pottery]], luting is a technique for joining pieces of unfired [[leather-hard]] [[clay]] together, using a wet clay [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] or slurry as adhesive.  The complete object is then fired.  Large objects are often built up in this way, for example the figures of the [[Terracotta Army]] in ancient China. The edges being joined might be scored or cross-hatched to promote adhesion, but clay and water are the only materials used. 

==Uses==

Lute was commonly used in [[distillation]], which required airtight vessels and connectors to ensure that no vapours were lost; thus it was employed by chemists and [[Alchemy|alchemists]], the latter being known to refer to it as "''lutum sapientiae''" or the "''lute of Wisdom''".&lt;ref&gt;*Stanton J. Linden. ''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003) p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Alchemist’s Experiment Takes Fire 1687 CHF fa 2000.001.276.JPG|thumb|right|''The Alchemist’s Experiment Takes Fire'', Hendrick Heerschop, 1687 ([[Chemical Heritage Foundation]])]]
The earthen and glass vessels commonly employed in these processes were very vulnerable to cracking, both on heating and on cooling; one way of protecting them was by coating the vessels with lute and allowing it to set. One mixture for this purpose included "fat earth" (terra pinguis), Windsor [[loam]], sand, [[iron filings]] or powdered [[glass]], and cow's hair.&lt;ref name="brittania"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. ''Eighteenth Century Chemistry as It Relates to Alchemy'' (reprinted Kessinger Publishing, 1992) p. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use for lute was to act as a [[safety valve]], preventing the buildup of [[vapour pressure]] from shattering a vessel and possibly causing an explosion. For this purpose, a hole was bored in the flask and covered with ''luting'' material of a particular composition, which was kept soft so that excessive buildup of vapour would cause it to come away from the vessel, thus releasing the pressure safely. This process could also be performed manually by the operator removing and reaffixing the lute as required. Lute was also used to effect repairs to cracked glass vessels.&lt;ref name="brittania" /&gt; In ''The Alchemist’s Experiment Takes Fire'', 1687, one [[alembic]] is exploding; the luting used to seal a receiving bottle to another alembic can be seen behind the alchemist's upraised arm.

Lute was frequently applied to the joints between vessels (such as [[retort]]s and receivers), making them airtight and preventing vapour from escaping; this was especially important for more penetrating "spiritous" vapours and required a mixture that would set hard - such as a mix of [[quicklime]] and either [[egg white]] or [[Sizing|size]] etc. However a stronger lute had to be used to confine acid vapours, and for this purpose fat earth&lt;ref&gt;"Fat earth" is an old name for clay [[loam]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[linseed oil]] were mixed to form "''fat lute''", which could be rolled into cylinders of convenient size, ready for use.&lt;ref&gt;See the entry for "Lute" from: [[Andrew Ure]] &amp; [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vidAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Dictionary of Chemistry]'' (Robert Desilver, 1821).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the vapour was more "aqueous", and less penetrating, strips of paper affixed with [[sizing]] would suffice or "bladder long steeped in water".&lt;ref name="brittania" /&gt;

Another related use for lute was for lining furnaces, and was described as far back as the 16th century by [[Georg Agricola]] in his "[[De re metallica]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sally Newcomb. ''The world in a crucible'' (Geological Society of America, 2009) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

''Fat Lute'' was made of clay mixed with oil and beaten until it had the consistency of [[putty]]. It could be stored in a sealed [[earthenware]] vessel, which retained moisture and kept the material pliable.&lt;ref name="metropolitana"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DztOAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, Mixed Sciences, volume 2]'' (Printed for Baldwin and Cradock, 1830). pp. 602-4.&lt;/ref&gt; An alchemical writer of the 16th century recommended a lute made up of "loam mixed to a compost with horse [[Manure|dung]]"&lt;ref&gt;C. J. S. Thompson. ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yg0pVQtPUxcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lure and Romance of Alchemy]'' (George G Harrap &amp; Co Ltd.) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; while the French chemist [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal|Chaptal]] used a similar mixture of "fat earth" and horse dung, mixed in water and formed into a soft paste.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mftPAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Encyclopaedia Perthensis; or Universal dictionary of the arts, volume 5]'' (John Brown, 1816) p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Linseed meal]]'' or ''[[Almond meal]]'' could be made into a lute by mixing with water ''or'' [[Wheatpaste|dissolved starch]] ''or'' weak glue, and used in combination with strips of [[Textile|rag]] ''or'' moistened [[Pig bladder|bladder]]; however, it was combustible which limited its range of applications.

''[[Calcium hydroxide|Lime]]'' could be made into an effective lute by mixing it with egg white ''or'' glue; for sealing joints it was used in conjunction with strips of rag.

[[Linen]] rags mixed with paste, ''or'' strips of ''Bladder'' soaked in warm water, then coated with paste or egg white, also served as a lute.&lt;ref name="metropolitana" /&gt;

''Fire Lute'' was used to protect vessels from heat damage. It consisted of clay mixed with sand and either [[Horsehair|horse-hair]] ''or'' [[straw]] ''or'' tow (coarse, broken fibre of crops such as [[flax]], [[hemp]], or [[jute]]). It had to be allowed to dry thoroughly before use to be effective.&lt;ref name="metropolitana" /&gt;

''Fusible lute'' was used to coat earthenware vessels to ensure impermeability. A mixture of [[Borax]] and [[slaked lime]], mixed with water into a fine paste, served this purpose.&lt;ref name="metropolitana" /&gt;

''[[James Parker (cement maker)|Parker's Cement]]'', ''[[Plaster of Paris]]'' and ''Fusible fluxes'' (a clay and Borax mixture in 10:1 proportion, mixed to a paste in water)  could all be used as lutes, rendering heat protection and air-tightness. [[Stourbridge]] clay mixed with water could withstand the highest heat of any lute.&lt;ref name="metropolitana" /&gt;

''Hard cement'' was also commonly used to join glass vessels and fix cracks; it was composed of [[resin]], [[beeswax]] and either brick dust or "bole earth", or [[red ochre]] or [[venetian red]]. ''Soft cement'', made of [[beeswax|yellow wax]], [[turpentine]] and venetian red, was also used for repair.&lt;ref name="metropolitana" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1614">The '''Machar Marshes''' are a large area of wetlands in the state of [[Upper Nile (state)|Upper Nile]], [[South Sudan]].  Estimates of their size vary. A 1950 study put the area of swamp at 6,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe and Parks, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1980 study put the area of permanent swamp at 8,700&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;., 60% of which was grass and forest.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe and Parks, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

The marshes are fed by waters from the Khor Machar (a distributary of the [[Baro River]]), the [[Yabus River]] and the [[Daga River (South Sudan)|Daga River]].  At times of high water they are also fed by spill from the [[Pibor River]].  The marshes are drained by the [[Adar River]], a tributary of the [[White Nile]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2146">The '''Malabar Coast moist forests''' is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of southwestern [[India]]. It lies along India's [[Konkan]] and [[Malabar coast]]s, in a narrow strip between the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Western Ghats]] range, which runs parallel to the coast.  It has an area of {{convert|35,500|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, and extends from northern [[Maharashtra]] through [[Goa]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]] to [[Kanyakumari district|Kanniyakumari]] in southernmost [[Tamil Nadu]].

The ecoregion extends from sea level to the 250 meter contour of the Western Ghats. It is bounded on the east by the [[North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]] in Maharashtra and Karnataka, and the [[South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]] in Kerala.

Very little of the natural vegetation of the ecoregion remains; it has largely been cleared for [[agriculture]], grazing, and [[teak]] plantations.

==Protected areas==
In 1997, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] identified three protected areas in the ecoregion, with a combined area of approximately 300 km², encompassing less than 1% of the ecoregion's area. &lt;ref&gt;Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). ''Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment.'' Island Press; [[Washington, DC]]. pp. 311-313&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mid-Atlantic Ridge Ecosystem Project''' MAR-ECO is an international research project in which scientists from 16 nations take part. Norway, represented by the Institute of Marine Research and the University of Bergen, co-ordinates the project which will enhance our understanding of occurrence, distribution and ecology of animals and animal communities along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between Iceland and the Azores. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the volcanic mountain range in the middle of the ocean, marking the spreading zone between the Eurasian and American continental plates. New ocean floor is constantly being formed, and Iceland and the Azores are volcanic islands created when the mid-ocean ridge breaks the sea surface. The groups of animals to be studied are fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods (squids) and a wide range of gelatinous animals (e.g. jellyfish) living either near the seabed or in midwater above the ridge.

The research programme [[Census of Marine Life]] seriously addresses this situation and challenges marine biologists to utilize the most advanced technology to achieve true new information in areas of the ocean that were poorly studied previously. The project MAR-ECO, an element of the [[Census of Marine Life]], rises to the challenge and investigates the diverse animal life along the vast underwater mountain chains of the open ocean.

==History==
MAR-ECO adopts the most advanced technology and instruments for observing and sample the animals and to tackle the challenge of working to 3500 m depth and in rugged terrain. An international multidisciplinary team of biologists, oceanographers, and engineers is offered this rare opportunity. A number of countries have committed their best research vessels, and in the 2003-2005 and 2007-2010 field phases a number of research cruise were conducted. In 2004, a two-month major international expedition was carried out by the new Norwegian vessel RV G.O. Sars, but vessels from Iceland, Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, USA, and Portugal have also made major contributions. In June 2003 a Russian-US cruise using the manned submersibles MIR-1 and -2 took scientists to areas never before visited by humans at 4500m below the surface.
Contributing to sustainable development

MAR-ECO shall enhance the basic knowledge of ocean life and thereby contribute to a sustainable international management of marine resources and the priceless biodiversity of the marine environment. Knowledge obtained by a unified international effort carries greater weight in the policy-making processes than information gathered by isolated national research. Good science may hopefully lead to international consensus on appropriate action.

MAR-ECO and the Census of Marine Life emphasises public outreach and even in the planning phase MAR-ECO has enjoyed considerable public attention and support. Expeditions to unknown depths of the oceans appear to have great appeal, both to scientists and the interested laymen of all ages.

===Management===
The MAR-ECO management consists of a Norwegian secretariat, a public outreach group, and an international steering group. The co-ordinating institutions are Institute of Marine Research and the University of Bergen in Norway. 

Members of the international steering group are experienced scientists from key institutions in Norway, Iceland, Portugal (Azores), France, Germany, United Kingdom, USA, Russia and Brazil. Chair: Odd Aksel Bergstad, Norway.

The project consists of 10 integrated science components dealing with different key objectives, each with dedicated teams and principal investigators. In addition, a range of education and outreach components facilitates dissemination of results to a wide audience. 

Common critical tasks are funded by A.P.Sloan Foundation (USA), and national sources.

====Public Outreach Group and associates====
The Public Outreach Group is based in Bergen, Norway, but has associates among project participants in other countries. The group works closely with the Education and Outreach team of the Census of Marine Life based in the USA.

==Backgrounders==
The Mar-ECO project presented an exhibit in the [[Sant Ocean Hall]] of the [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington, DC]] in 2010.  The exhibit featured specimens, photography, art, models, and multimedia about the discoveries of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/deeperthanlight/ Natural History Museum Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Northeast Georgia Rise''' is an [[oceanic plateau]] located in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] northeast of [[South Georgia Island]] and west of the [[Falkland Plateau]].

==Bathymetry==
The rise is separated from South Georgia Island by the Northeast Georgia Passage.  The Georgia Basin surrounds the northern end of the rise.&lt;ref name="Garabato-etal-2002-fig1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Garabato|Heywood|Stevens|2002|loc=Fig. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone]] (AFFZ) stretches across the Atlantic north of the Northeast Georgia Rise.  A group of small [[seamount]]s north of the rise are aligned with a gap in the AFFZ.  East of this gap the AFFZ is a single ridge with an average height of {{Convert|2500|m|abbr=on}} but west of the gap the AFFZ is a double ridge with an average height of {{Convert|1500|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Bre-LaBr" /&gt;

On the eastern flank of the rise is a prominent ridge, the Soledad Ridge, about {{Convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} tall.  It has the same orientation as the southeastern part of the rise.  It is a [[Basement (geology)|basement]]-feature in which bottom-water have scoured a channel.  Both the Northeast Georgia Rise and the [[Islas Orcadas Rise]] east of it, are seemingly dissected by transverse valleys that extend to the fracture zones of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]].&lt;ref name="Bre-LaBr"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brenner|LaBrecque|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==

===LIP formation and dispersal===
The Northeast Georgia Rise is made of [[oceanic crust]] that formed when Africa and South America spread apart after the [[Gondwana#Breakup|Gondwana breakup]].&lt;ref name="Kri-LaBr-1991" /&gt;  100 Ma the Northeast Georgia Rise was part of the [[Agulhas Plateau]]-Northeast Georgia Rise-[[Maud Rise]] [[large igneous province]] (LIP) in what today is the southwestern-most [[Indian Ocean]] south of [[South Africa]].  This LIP, often called the southeast African LIP, formed at the [[triple junction]] where Gondwana passed over the [[Bouvet Island|Bouvet Hotspot]] and broke-up into Antarctica, South America, and Africa.  This volcanism lasted until 94 Ma after which seafloor spreading detached the Northeast Georgia Rise and Maude Rise from the Agulhas Plateau and the Northeast Georgia Rise migrated westward to its current location and Maud Rise south towards the [[Weddell Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gohl|Uenzelmann-Neben|Grobys|2011|loc=Timing and extent of Large Igneous Province formation, P. 384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northeast Georgia Rise and the Agulhas Plateau were always located on different tectonic plates, the [[South American Plate|South American]] and [[African Plate|African plates]] respectively.  Because of this, these two plateaus can be used to reconstruct the movements of the two plates from the formation of the southeast African LIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eagles|2007|loc=Fracture zones and isochrons in the South Atlantic, p. 354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collision with South Georgia===
Northeast Georgia rise collided with the South Georgia [[microcontinent]]al block about 10 Ma which caused the uplift of this block and the creation of the present islands.  The collision coincided with the termination of spreading at the West Scotia Sea and resulted in a bathymetric obstacle that still steers the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] northward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|Curtis|Schwanethal|2014|loc=Discussion, pp. 301-302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two or more episodes of deformation have modified the topography of the ridge.  Late Oligocene faulting coincides with the opening of the [[Scotia Sea]]; the western part of the Northeast Georgia Rise was uplifted by {{Convert|0.5|-|1|km|abbr=on}} during the [[Neogene]] (23-3 Ma); the topography of the southwestern part of the rise may have formed by interaction with the advancing [[South Sandwich Trench]] or the South Sandwich block.&lt;ref name="Kri-LaBr-1991" /&gt;

As a part of the [[Scotia Plate]], the South Georgia block has been moving eastward.  It is possible that when Northeast Georgia Rise, with its thickened, buoyant crust, reached the convergent [[South American Plate|South American]]-Scotia margin, the rise stopped the South Georgia block, transformed it into a series of fault blocks, and forced the margin to relocate south of the South Georgia block&amp;nbsp;— effectively making it part of the South American Plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|Livermore|Pollitz|2003|pp=802–803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanography==
[[File:East Scotia Ridge vents map.png|thumb|Fronts of the ACC in the Scotia Sea]]
In the [[Scotia Sea]] the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (ACC) is deflected north by the [[South Scotia Ridge]].  It then widens extensively before passing over the [[North Scotia Ridge]].  North of South Georgia the southern boundary of the ACC is retroflected around the Northeast Georgia Rise.&lt;ref name="Garabato-etal-2002-fig1" /&gt;
The Southern [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] Front (SACCF) meanders across the Scotia Sea from the western shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula to the southwestern side of South Georgia.  From there SACCF wraps the island anti-cyclonically, [[retroflect]]s north of it, and flows across the Northeast Georgia Rise before looping cyclonically into the South Atlantic.  The retroflection north of the island and across the rise shows a strong seasonal variability but SACCF remains constrained by these bathymetric obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boehme|Meredith|Thorpe|Biuw|2008|loc=Southern ACC Front:27, p. 13; Summary:50, p. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Weddell Sea Bottom Water|Weddell Sea Deep Water]] (WSDW) circulates cyclonically in the [[Weddell Gyre]] from where it escapes through gaps in the South Scotia Ridge, such as the South Sandwich Trench.  It then flows across the Scotia Sea which it can only escape through the Georgia Passage.  WSDW can reach the Georgia Basin by two routes: either by circumnavigating the Northeast Georgia Rise on its eastern side or by passing through the Northeast Georgia Passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garabato|Heywood|Stevens|2002|loc=4.1.4. The entry to the western Georgia Basin, pp. 692-694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meredith|Watkins|Murphy|Ward|2003|loc=3.2.2. Deep and Bottom Waters:24, p.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2954">The '''Office of the Federal Coordinator, Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects''' is an [[independent agency]] of the [[Federal Government of the United States|U.S. government]]. [[United States Congress|Congress]] created the Office in the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act of 2004.&lt;ref name="ANGPA 2004"&gt;[http://www.arcticgas.gov/ofc/statuatory-authority Statutory Authority - Arcticgas.gov]. Accessed September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent of that law is to help ease forward a multibillion-dollar Alaska natural gas pipeline project that would deliver North Slope gas to consumers in the 48 contiguous states.

Congress directed the Office of the Federal Coordinator to expedite and coordinate federal permitting for construction of a pipeline. The Office coordinates with over 20 federal agencies, the Canadian federal government, the State of Alaska, tribal governments and other stakeholders.

With some exceptions, the law empowers the Office to prohibit a federal agency from including “in any certificate, right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization issued to an Alaska natural gas transportation project any term or condition that may be permitted, but is not required, by any applicable law,” if the term or condition would prevent or significantly impair construction, operation or expansion of the natural gas pipeline project.&lt;ref name="ANGPA 2004" /&gt;

The Federal Coordinator (director of the agency) is [[advice and consent|nominated with advice and consent of the Senate]] by the [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name="USA Alaska"&gt;"Across the USA: Alaska:Fairbanks," ''USA Today'', November 13, 2009, p. 13A.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drue Pearce]] was the first federal coordinator; she was nominated by [[George W. Bush]] and served from December 12, 2006 through January 3, 2010.&lt;ref name="Drue Pearce"&gt;[http://www.arcticgas.gov/ofc/about-us Arcticgas.gov, "About the OFC"]. Accessed September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Persily]] is the current coordinator; [[Barack Obama]] nominated him on December 9, 2009, and was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2010.&lt;ref name="Larry Persily"&gt;[http://www.arcticgas.gov/bio/persily-larry Arcticgas.gov biography of Larry Persily] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620072941/http://www.arcticgas.gov/bio/persily-larry |date=June 20, 2013 }}.

The '''Ordovician''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ɔr|d|ə|ˈ|v|ɪ|ʃ|ən}}) is a [[geologic period]] and [[System (geology)|system]], the second of six periods of the [[Paleozoic]] [[Era (geology)|Era]]. The Ordovician spans 41.2 million years from the end of the [[Cambrian]] Period {{Period end|Cambrian}} million years ago (Mya) to the start of the [[Silurian]] Period {{Period start|Silurian}} Mya.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2015-01.pdf | title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart v.2015/01 | publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] | date=January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ordovician, named after the [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe of the [[Ordovices]], was defined by [[Charles Lapworth]] in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Roderick Murchison]], who were placing the same [[Rock (geology)|rock]] beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian systems, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lapworth (1879) [https://books.google.com/books?id=JJpZAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  "On the Tripartite Classification of the Lower Palaeozoic Rocks,"] ''Geological Magazine'', new series, '''6''' : 1-15.  From pp. 13-14:  "North Wales itself — at all events the whole of the great Bala district where Sedgwick first worked out the physical succession among the rocks of the intermediate or so-called ''Upper Cambrian'' or ''Lower Silurian'' system; and in all probability much of the Shelve and the Caradoc area, whence Murchison first published its distinctive fossils — lay within the territory of the Ordovices; … Here, then, have we the hint for the appropriate title for the central system of the Lower Palaeozoics.  It should be called the Ordovician System, after this old British tribe."&lt;/ref&gt; Lapworth recognized that the [[fossil]] [[fauna]] in the disputed [[Stratum|strata]] were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian systems, and placed them in a system of their own. The Ordovician received international approval in 1960 (forty years after Lapworth's death), when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences|International Geological Congress]].

Life continued to flourish during the Ordovician as it did in the earlier Cambrian period, although the end of the period was marked by the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]]. Invertebrates, namely [[Mollusca|molluscs]] and [[arthropod]]s, dominated the oceans. The [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]] considerably increased the diversity of life. Fish, the world's first true [[vertebrate]]s, continued to evolve, and [[Gnathostomata|those with jaws]] may have first appeared late in the period. Life had yet to diversify on land. About 100 times as many meteorites struck the Earth per year during the Ordovician compared with today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160615135230.htm |title=New type of meteorite linked to ancient asteroid collision | website=Science Daily | date=15 June 2016| accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating: extinction events==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}} 
The Ordovician Period began with a major extinction called the [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event]], about {{Period start|Ordovician}} Mya (million years ago). It lasted for about 42 million years and ended with the Ordovician–Silurian extinction events, about {{Period end|Ordovician}} Mya (ICS, 2004) which wiped out 60% of marine [[Genus|genera]]. The dates given are recent [[radiometric]] dates and vary slightly from those found in other sources. This second period of the Paleozoic era created abundant fossils that became major [[petroleum]] and [[gas]] reservoirs.

&lt;!--merged in from [[Tremadocian]]--&gt;
The boundary chosen for the beginning of both the Ordovician Period and the [[Tremadocian]] stage is highly significant. It correlates well with the occurrence of widespread [[Graptolithina|graptolite]], [[conodont]], and [[trilobite]] species. The base (start) of the Tremadocian allows scientists to relate these species not only to each other, but also to species that occur with them in other areas. This makes it easier to place many more species in time relative to the beginning of the Ordovician Period.

==Subdivisions{{anchor|Subdivisions}}==

A number of regional terms have been used to subdivide the Ordovician Period.

The Ordovician Period in Britain was traditionally broken into Early (Tremadocian and [[Arenig]]), Middle ([[Llanvirn Series|Llanvirn]] (subdivided into Abereiddian and Llandeilian) and [[Llandeilo Group|Llandeilo]]) and Late ([[Caradoc Series|Caradoc]] and Ashgill) epochs. The corresponding rocks of the Ordovician System are referred to as coming from the Lower, Middle, or Upper part of the column. The faunal [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stages]] (subdivisions of epochs) from youngest to oldest are:

'''Late Ordovician'''
* [[Hirnantian]]/Gamach (Ashgill)
* Rawtheyan/Richmond (Ashgill)
* Cautleyan/Richmond (Ashgill)
* Pusgillian/Maysville/Richmond (Ashgill)
'''Middle Ordovician'''
* Trenton (Caradoc)
* Onnian/Maysville/Eden (Caradoc)
* Actonian/Eden (Caradoc)
* Marshbrookian/Sherman (Caradoc)
* Longvillian/Sherman (Caradoc)
* Soudleyan/Kirkfield (Caradoc)
* Harnagian/Rockland (Caradoc)
* Costonian/Black River (Caradoc)
* Chazy (Llandeilo)
* Llandeilo (Llandeilo)
* Whiterock (Llanvirn)
* Llanvirn (Llanvirn)
'''Early Ordovician'''
* Cassinian (Arenig)
* Arenig/Jefferson/Castleman (Arenig)
* Tremadoc/Deming/Gaconadian (Tremadoc)

=== British stages ===
The Tremadoc corresponds to the (modern) Tremadocian. The Floian corresponds to the lower Arenig; the Arenig continues until the early Darriwilian, subsuming the Dapingian. The Llanvirn occupies the rest of the Darriwilian, and terminates with it at the base of the Late Ordovician.
The Sandbian represents the first half of the Caradoc; the Caradoc ends in the mid-Katian, and the Ashgill represents the last half of the Katian, plus the Hirnantian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Concise Geological Timescale|editors=Ogg, Ogg &amp; Gradstein|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fix|text=This would be clearer as a diagram.}}

==Paleogeography==
During the Ordovician, the southern continents were collected into [[Gondwana]]. Gondwana started the period in [[equator]]ial [[latitude]]s and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the [[South Pole]].

Early in the Ordovician, the continents of [[Laurentia]] (in present-day [[North America]]), [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]], and [[Baltica]] (present-day northern Europe) were still independent continents (since the break-up of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pannotia]] earlier), but Baltica began to move towards [[Laurentia]] later in the period, causing the [[Iapetus Ocean]] between them to shrink. The small continent [[Avalonia]] separated from Gondwana and began to move north towards Baltica and Laurentia, opening the [[Rheic Ocean]] between Gondwana and Avalonia.

The [[Taconic orogeny]], a major mountain-building episode, was well under way in Cambrian times. In the early and middle Ordovician, temperatures were mild, but at the beginning of the Late Ordovician, from 460 to 450 Ma, volcanoes along the margin of the Iapetus Ocean spewed massive amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, turning the planet into a hothouse.

Initially, sea levels were high, but as Gondwana moved south, ice accumulated into glaciers and sea levels dropped. At first, low-lying sea beds increased diversity, but later glaciation led to mass extinctions as the seas drained and continental shelves became dry land. During the Ordovician, in fact during the Tremadocian, [[marine transgression]]s worldwide were the greatest for which evidence is preserved.

These [[Volcanic arc|volcanic island arcs]] eventually collided with proto North America to form the Appalachian mountains. By the end of the Late Ordovician the volcanic emissions had stopped. Gondwana had by that time neared the South Pole and was largely [[glacier|glaciated]].

===Ordovician meteor event===
The [[Ordovician meteor event]] is a proposed shower of meteors that occurred during the Middle Ordovician period, roughly 470 million years ago. It is not associated with any major extinction event.&lt;ref name=Nature1&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2004Natur.430..323H |title=Fast delivery of meteorites to Earth after a major asteroid collision |last1=Heck |first1=Philipp R. |last2=Schmitz |first2=Birger |last3=Baur |first3=Heinrich |last4=Halliday |first4=Alex N. |last5=Wieler |first5=Rainer |volume=430 |year=2004 |pages=323–5 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature02736 |pmid=15254530 |issue=6997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1996Icar..119..182H |title=Meteoritic, Asteroidal, and Theoretical Constraints on the 500 MA Disruption of the L Chondrite Parent Body |last1=Haack |first1=Henning |last2=Farinella |first2=Paolo |last3=Scott |first3=Edward R.

== Geochemistry ==
[[File:Anomalodonta gigantea Waynesville Franklin Co IN.JPG|thumb|External mold of Ordovician [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] showing that the original [[aragonite]] shell dissolved on the sea floor, leaving a cemented mold for biological encrustation ([[Waynesville Formation]] of Franklin County, Indiana).]]
The Ordovician was a time of [[calcite sea]] geochemistry in which low-magnesium calcite was the primary inorganic marine precipitate of calcium carbonate. [[Carbonate hardgrounds]] were thus very common, along with calcitic [[ooid]]s, calcitic cements, and invertebrate faunas with dominantly calcitic skeletons. Biogenic [[aragonite]], like that composing the shells of most [[Mollusca|molluscs]], dissolved rapidly on the sea floor after death.&lt;ref name="Stanley1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stanley | first1 = S. | last2 = Hardie | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1016/S0031-0182(98)00109-6 | title = Secular oscillations in the carbonate mineralogy of reef-building and sediment-producing organisms driven by tectonically forced shifts in seawater chemistry | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume = 144 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 3–19 | year = 1998 | pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 1998PPP...144....3S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stanley |first=S.

Unlike Cambrian times, when calcite production was dominated by microbial and non-biological processes, animals (and macroalgae) became a dominant source of calcareous material in Ordovician deposits.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt;

==Climate and sea level==

The Ordovician saw the highest sea levels of the Paleozoic, and the low relief of the continents led to many shelf deposits being formed under hundreds of metres of water.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt; The sea level rose more or less continuously throughout the Early Ordovician, leveling off somewhat during the middle of the period.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt; Locally, some regressions occurred, but sea level rise continued in the beginning of the Late Ordovician. Sea levels fell steadily in accord with the cooling temperatures for ~30 million years leading up to the Hirnantian glaciation. During this icy stage, sea level seems to have risen and dropped somewhat, but despite much study the details remain unresolved.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt;

At the beginning of the period, around {{Period start|Ordovician}} million years ago, the climate was very hot due to high concentration of {{CO2}} (4200 ppm) in the atmosphere, which gave a strong greenhouse effect. By contrast, today the concentration is just above 400 ppm. Marine water temperatures are assumed to have averaged {{Convert|45|C|}}, which restricted the diversification of complex multi-cellular organisms. But over time, the climate became cooler, and around 460 million years ago, the ocean temperatures became comparable to those of present-day equatorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/1279.htm Explosion in marine biodiversity explained by climate change]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[North America]] and [[Europe]], [[Gondwana]] was largely covered with shallow seas during the Ordovician. Shallow clear waters over continental shelves encouraged the growth of organisms that deposit calcium carbonates in their shells and hard parts. The [[Panthalassic Ocean]] covered much of the northern hemisphere, and other minor oceans included [[Proto-Tethys Ocean|Proto-Tethys]], [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Paleo-Tethys]], [[Khanty Ocean]], which was closed off by the Late Ordovician, Iapetus Ocean, and the new Rheic Ocean.

As the Ordovician progressed, we see evidence of [[glacier]]s on the land we now know as Africa and South America, which were near the South Pole at the time, and covered by [[ice cap]]s.

==Life==
[[File:Nmnh fg09.jpg|thumb|A [[diorama]] depicting Ordovician flora and fauna.]]
For most of the Late Ordovician life continued to flourish, but at and near the end of the period there were [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|mass-extinction events]] that seriously affected [[plankton]]ic forms like [[conodont]]s and [[Graptolithina|graptolites]]. The [[trilobite]]s [[Agnostida]] and [[Ptychopariida]] completely died out, and the [[Asaphida]] were much reduced. [[Brachiopod]]s, [[bryozoa]]ns and [[echinoderm]]s were also heavily affected, and the [[endocerid]] [[cephalopod]]s died out completely, except for possible rare Silurian forms. The Ordovician–Silurian extinction events may have been caused by an ice age that occurred at the end of the Ordovician period, due to the expansion of the [[Moss#Geological history|first terrestrial plants]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16814669 Humble moss helped to cool Earth and spurred on life]&lt;/ref&gt; as the end of the Late Ordovician was one of the coldest times in the last 600 million years of Earth's history.

===Fauna===
[[File:Orthoceras BW.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nautiloid]]s like ''[[Orthoceras]]'' were among the largest predators in the Ordovician.]]
[[File:LibertyFormationSlab092313.jpg|thumb|Fossiliferous limestone slab from the Liberty Formation (Upper Ordovician) of Caesar Creek State Park near Waynesville, Ohio.]]
On the whole, the fauna that emerged in the Ordovician were the template for the remainder of the Palaeozoic.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Munnecke | first1 = A.| last2 = Calner | first2 = M.| last3 = Harper | first3 = D.

The ecological system reached a new grade of complexity far beyond that of the Cambrian fauna,&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt; which has persisted until the present day.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt;

Though less famous than the [[Cambrian explosion]], the [[Ordovician radiation]] was no less remarkable; marine faunal [[genus|genera]] increased fourfold, resulting in 12% of all known [[Phanerozoic]] marine fauna.&lt;ref name="Dixon2001"&gt;{{cite book |title=Atlas of Life on Earth |last=Dixon |first=Dougal |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7607-1957-2 |pages=87 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another change in the fauna was the strong increase in [[Filter feeder|filter-feeding]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Ordovician/Ordovician.htm Palaeos Paleozoic : Ordovician : The Ordovician Period] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221094614/http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Ordovician/Ordovician.htm |date=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trilobite, inarticulate brachiopod, [[Archaeocyatha|archaeocyathid]], and [[Eocrinoidea|eocrinoid]] faunas of the Cambrian were succeeded by those that dominated the rest of the Paleozoic, such as articulate brachiopods, [[cephalopod]]s, and [[crinoid]]s. Articulate brachiopods, in particular, largely replaced trilobites in [[continental shelf|shelf]] communities.&lt;ref name="Cooper1986"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Trip Through Time: Principles of Historical Geology |last=Cooper |first=John D. |authorlink= |author2=Miller, Richard H. |author3=Patterson, Jacqueline  |year=1986 |publisher=Merrill Publishing Company |location=Columbus |isbn=978-0-675-20140-7 |pages=247, 255&amp;ndash;259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their success epitomizes the greatly increased diversity of [[calcium carbonate|carbonate]] shell-secreting organisms in the Ordovician compared to the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="Cooper1986" /&gt;

In North America and Europe, the Ordovician was a time of shallow continental seas rich in life. Trilobites and brachiopods in particular were rich and diverse. Although solitary [[coral]]s date back to at least the [[Cambrian]], [[coral reef|reef]]-forming corals appeared in the early Ordovician, corresponding to an increase in the stability of carbonate and thus a new abundance of calcifying animals.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt;&lt;!--Bryozoa in Cambrian: {{doi|10.1130/G30870.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

[[Mollusca|Molluscs]], which appeared during the Cambrian or even the [[Ediacaran]], became common and varied, especially [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], [[Gastropoda|gastropods]], and [[nautiloid]] cephalopods.

Now-extinct marine animals called graptolites thrived in the oceans. Some new cystoids and crinoids appeared.

It was long thought that the first true [[vertebrata|vertebrates]] (fish — [[Ostracoderm]]s) appeared in the Ordovician, but recent discoveries in [[China]] reveal that they probably originated in the Early [[Cambrian]].{{fact|date=January 2018}} The very first [[Gnathostomata|gnathostome]] (jawed fish) appeared in the [[Late Ordovician glaciation|Late Ordovician]] epoch.

During the Middle Ordovician there was a large increase in the intensity and diversity of bioeroding organisms. This is known as the Ordovician [[Bioerosion]] Revolution.&lt;ref name="WilsonPalmer2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=M. A. |authorlink= |author2=Palmer, T.

In the Early Ordovician, trilobites were joined by many new types of organisms, including [[Tabulata|tabulate]] corals, [[Strophomenida|strophomenid]], [[Rhynchonellida|rhynchonellid]], and many new [[Orthida|orthid]] brachiopods, bryozoans, planktonic graptolites and conodonts, and many types of molluscs and echinoderms, including the ophiuroids ("brittle stars") and the first [[Starfish|sea stars]]. Nevertheless, the trilobites remained abundant, all the Late Cambrian orders continued, and were joined by the new group [[Phacopida]]. The first evidence of land plants also appeared (see [[evolutionary history of life]]).

In the Middle Ordovician, the trilobite-dominated Early Ordovician communities were replaced by generally more mixed ecosystems, in which brachiopods, bryozoans, molluscs, [[Cornulitida|cornulitids]], [[tentaculites|tentaculitids]] and echinoderms all flourished, tabulate corals diversified and the first [[Rugosa|rugose corals]] appeared. The planktonic graptolites remained diverse, with the [[Diplograptina]] making their appearance. [[Bioerosion]] became an important process, particularly in the thick calcitic skeletons of corals, bryozoans and brachiopods, and on the extensive [[carbonate hardgrounds]] that appear in abundance at this time. One of the earliest known armoured [[agnatha]]n ("[[ostracoderm]]") vertebrate, ''[[Arandaspis]]'', dates from the Middle Ordovician.

Trilobites in the Ordovician were very different from their predecessors in the Cambrian. Many trilobites developed bizarre spines and nodules to defend against predators such as primitive [[eurypterid]]s and nautiloids while other trilobites such as ''Aeglina prisca'' evolved to become swimming forms. Some trilobites even developed shovel-like snouts for ploughing through muddy sea bottoms. Another unusual clade of trilobites known as the trinucleids developed a broad pitted margin around their head shields.&lt;ref name="Palaeos.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Ordovician/Ordovician.htm#Life |title=Palaeos Paleozoic : Ordovician : The Ordovician Period |accessdate= |date=April 11, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221094614/http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Ordovician/Ordovician.htm#Life |archivedate=December 21, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trilobites such as ''Asaphus kowalewski'' evolved long eyestalks to assist in detecting predators whereas other trilobite eyes in contrast disappeared completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trilobites.info/ A Guide to the Orders of Trilobites&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular clock analyses suggest that early arachnids started living on land by the end of the Ordovician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Paleozoic Stem Group to Mite Harvestmen Revealed through Integration of Phylogenetics and Development|first=Russell J.|last=Garwood|first2=Prashant P.|last2=Sharma|first3=Jason A.|last3=Dunlop|first4=Gonzalo|last4=Giribet|year=2014|journal=Current Biology|volume=24|issue=9|pages=1017–1023|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2814%2900331-5|accessdate=April 17, 2014|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.039|pmid=24726154|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===

[[Green algae]] were common in the Late Cambrian (perhaps earlier) and in the Ordovician. Terrestrial plants probably evolved from green algae, first appearing as tiny non-[[vascular plants|vascular]] forms resembling [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s. Fossil spores from land plants have been identified in uppermost Ordovician sediments.

[[File:Ordovician Land Scene.jpg|thumb|Colonization of land would have been limited to shorelines]]

Among the first land [[fungi]] may have been [[arbuscular mycorrhiza]] fungi ([[Glomerales]]), playing a crucial role in facilitating the colonization of land by plants through [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal symbiosis]], which makes mineral nutrients available to plant cells; such fossilized fungal [[hypha]]e and [[spore]]s from the Ordovician of Wisconsin have been found with an age of about 460 million years ago, a time when the land flora most likely only consisted of plants similar to non-vascular [[bryophyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Redecker |first=D. |authorlink= |author2=Kodner, R.  |author3=Graham, L. E.  |year=2000 |title=Glomalean fungi from the Ordovician |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=289 |issue=5486 |pages=1920–1921 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5486.1920 |url= |quote=| pmid=10988069 |bibcode = 2000Sci...289.1920R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the period==
{{Main article|Ordovician–Silurian extinction events}}
The Ordovician came to a close in a series of [[extinction event]]s that, taken together, comprise the second largest of the five major extinction events in [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] in terms of percentage of [[genus|genera]] that became extinct. The only larger one was the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]].

The extinctions occurred approximately 447–444 million years ago and mark the boundary between the Ordovician and the following [[Silurian]] Period. At that time all complex multicellular organisms lived in the sea, and about 49% of genera of fauna disappeared forever; [[brachiopods]] and [[bryozoans]] were greatly reduced, along with many [[trilobite]], [[conodont]] and [[Graptolithina|graptolite]] families.

The most commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of cold conditions in the late Katian, followed by an [[ice age]], in the Hirnantian faunal stage, that ended the long, stable [[greenhouse]] conditions typical of the Ordovician.

The ice age was possibly not long-lasting. Oxygen [[isotopes]] in fossil brachiopods show its duration may have been only 0.5 to 1.5 million years.&lt;ref name="Stanley1999"&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth System History |last=Stanley |first=Steven M. |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7167-2882-5 |pages=358, 360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers (Page et al.) estimate more temperate conditions did not return until the late Silurian.

The late Ordovician glaciation event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000 ppm to 4400 ppm).&lt;ref name="Young 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = Seth A. | last2 = Saltzman | first2 = Matthew R. | last3 = Ausich | first3 = William I. | last4 = Desrochers | first4 = André | last5 = Kaljo | first5 = Dimitri | year = 2010 | title = Did changes in atmospheric CO2 coincide with latest Ordovician glacial–interglacial cycles? | url = | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume = 296 | issue = 3–4| pages = 376–388 | doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.02.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hecht 2010"&gt;Jeff Hecht, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18618-highcarbon-ice-age-mystery-solved.html  High-carbon ice age mystery solved], ''[[New Scientist]]'', 8 March 2010 (retrieved 30 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The dip was triggered by a burst of volcanic activity that deposited new silicate rocks, which draw CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the air as they erode.&lt;ref name="Hecht 2010" /&gt; This selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it, which have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of [[North Africa]] and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.

As glaciers grew, the sea level dropped, and the vast shallow intra-continental Ordovician seas withdrew, which eliminated many ecological niches. When they returned, they carried diminished founder populations that lacked many whole families of organisms. They then withdrew again with the next pulse of glaciation, eliminating biological diversity with each change.&lt;ref&gt;Emiliani, Cesare. (1992). ''Planet Earth : Cosmology, Geology, &amp; the Evolution of Life &amp; the Environment'' (Cambridge University Press) p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; Species limited to a single epicontinental sea on a given landmass were severely affected.&lt;ref name="Stanley1999" /&gt; Tropical lifeforms were hit particularly hard in the first wave of extinction, while cool-water species were hit worst in the second pulse.&lt;ref name="Stanley1999" /&gt;

Those species able to adapt to the changing conditions survived to fill the ecological niches left by the extinctions.

At the end of the second event, melting glaciers caused the sea level to rise and stabilise once more. The rebound of life's diversity with the permanent re-flooding of continental shelves at the onset of the Silurian saw increased biodiversity within the surviving Orders.

An alternate extinction hypothesis suggested that a ten-second [[gamma-ray burst]] could have destroyed the [[ozone layer]] and exposed terrestrial and marine surface-dwelling life to deadly ultraviolet [[radiation]] and initiated global cooling.&lt;ref name="Melott2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melott |first=Adrian |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=Did a gamma-ray burst initiate the late Ordovician mass extinction? |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=3 |issue= 1|pages=55&amp;ndash;61 |doi=10.1017/S1473550404001910 |url= |quote= |bibcode=2004IJAsB...3...55M|arxiv = astro-ph/0309415 |display-authors=etal|hdl=1808/9204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work considering the [[sequence stratigraphy]] of the Late Ordovician argues that the mass extinction was a single protracted episode lasting several hundred thousand years, with abrupt changes in water depth and sedimentation rate producing two pulses of last occurrences of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/pala.12188|title = The stratigraphy of mass extinction|journal = Palaeontology|volume = 58|issue = 5|pages = 903–924|year = 2015|last1 = Holland|first1 = Steven M|last2 = Patzkowsky|first2 = Mark E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2067">The '''Peninsular Malaysian peat swamp forests''' [[ecoregion]], in the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] [[biome]], are of the [[Malay Peninsula]], which includes portions of [[Malaysia]] and southern [[Thailand]].

==Setting==
The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|3,600|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} on both the eastern and western sides of the peninsula. The [[peat swamp forests]] have formed over hundreds of years, as sediment and organic debris deposited by rivers are trapped behind [[mangrove]]s, gradually building up a layer of waterlogged, acidic, nutrient-poor soil. These forests are less diverse than the surrounding [[Peninsular Malaysian rain forests]], but are home to many endangered animals.

==Flora==
[[Dipterocarp]]s, including ''[[Shorea albida]],'' are the dominant trees, while [[strangler fig]]s (''Ficus'' spp.) are common at the edges of the swamp forests. [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|Pandan (''Pandanus amaryllifolius'')]]  and the [[sealing wax palm|sealing wax palm (''Cyrtostachys lakka'')]]  are common understory plants. These and other plants provide a source of food for a host of animals, including birds.

==Fauna==
The ecoregion home to many endangered species, including tigers, [[Malayan tapir]]s (''Tapirus indicus''), [[clouded leopard]]s (''Neofelis nebulosa''), [[Asian elephant]]s (''Elephas maximus''), and [[Sumatran rhinoceros]]es (''Dicerorhinus sumatrensis'').

== Threats ==
Threats to the forests include: mining, rubber harvesting, and clearing of forest for [[oil palm]] and [[coconut]] plantations. Land draining has also opened a great deal of space in these forests. Many trees are cut down for development of more space, although this has increased peat [[forest fire]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6417">'''Q-vectors''' are used in atmospheric dynamics to understand physical processes such as vertical motion and [[frontogenesis]]. Q-vectors are not physical quantities that can be measured in the atmosphere but are derived from the [[quasi-geostrophic equations]] and can be used in the previous diagnostic situations. On meteorological charts, Q-vectors point toward upward motion and away from downward motion.  Q-vectors are an alternative to the [[omega equation]] for diagnosing vertical motion in the quasi-geostrophic equations.

==Derivation==
First derived in 1978,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoskins|first=B. J. |author2=I. Draghici |author3=H. C. Davies|title=A new look at the ω-equation|journal=Quart. J. R. Met. Soc|year=1978|volume=104|pages=31–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Q-vector derivation can be simplified for the midlatitudes, using the midlatitude β-plane quasi-geostrophic prediction equations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holton|first=James R.|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic|location=New York|isbn=0-12-354015-1|pages=168–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# &lt;math&gt; \frac{D_g u_g}{Dt} - f_{0}v_a - \beta y v_g = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (x component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{D_g v_g}{Dt} + f_{0}u_a + \beta y u_g = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (y component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{D_g T}{Dt} - \frac{\sigma p}{R} \omega = \frac{J}{c_p} &lt;/math&gt; (quasi-geostrophic thermodynamic equation)

And the [[thermal wind]] equations:

&lt;math&gt; f_{0} \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial p} = \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} &lt;/math&gt; (x component of thermal wind equation)

&lt;math&gt; f_{0} \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} = - \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} &lt;/math&gt; (y component of thermal wind equation)

where &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Coriolis parameter]], approximated by the constant 1e&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the atmospheric [[ideal gas constant]]; &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the latitudinal change in the Coriolis parameter &lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac{\partial f} {\partial y} &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is a static stability parameter; &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] at constant pressure; &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is pressure; &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature; anything with a subscript &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; indicates [[geostrophic]]; anything with a subscript &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; indicates [[ageostrophic]]; &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a diabatic heating rate; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the Lagrangian rate change of pressure with time. &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{Dp}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that because pressure decreases with height in the atmosphere, a &lt;math&gt; - \omega &lt;/math&gt; is upward vertical motion, analogous to &lt;math&gt;+w=\frac{Dz}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

From these equations we can get expressions for the Q-vector:

&lt;math&gt; Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

And in vector form:

&lt;math&gt; Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial x} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial y} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging these Q-vector equations into the [[omega equation|quasi-geostrophic omega equation]] gives:

&lt;math&gt; \left(\sigma \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} + f_{\circ}^2 \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial p^2} \right) \omega = -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} + f_{\circ} \beta \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} - \frac{\kappa}{p} \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} J &lt;/math&gt;

Which in an adiabatic setting gives:

&lt;math&gt; -\omega \propto -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the left-hand side of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation in a [[Fourier Series]] gives the &lt;math&gt; -\omega &lt;/math&gt; above, implying that a &lt;math&gt; -\omega &lt;/math&gt; relationship with the right-hand side of the [[omega equation|quasi-geostrophic omega equation]] can be assumed.

This expression shows that the divergence of the Q-vector (&lt;math&gt; \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt;) is associated with downward motion. Therefore, convergent &lt;math&gt; \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt; forces ascend and divergent &lt;math&gt; \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt; forces descend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holton|first=James R.|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic|location=New York|isbn=0-12-354015-1|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Q-vectors and all [[ageostrophic]] flow exist to preserve [[thermal wind]] balance. Therefore, low level Q-vectors tend to point in the direction of low-level ageostrophic winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=C. N.|title=Handbook of atmospheric science: principles and applications|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-632-05286-4|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Q-vectors can be determined wholly with: [[geopotential height]] (&lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt;) and temperature on a constant pressure surface. Q-vectors always point in the direction of ascending air. For an idealized cyclone and anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (where &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial T} {\partial y} &lt;0 &lt;/math&gt;), cyclones have Q-vectors which point parallel to the thermal wind and anticyclones have Q-vectors that point antiparallel to the thermal wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holton|first=James R.|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic|location=New York|isbn=0-12-354015-1|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means upward motion in the area of warm air advection and downward motion in the area of cold air advection.

In [[frontogenesis]], temperature gradients need to tighten for initiation. For those situations Q-vectors point toward ascending air and the tightening thermal gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Weather Service|first=Jet Stream - Online School for Weather|title=Glossary: Q's|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/jetstream/append/glossary_q.htm|work=NOAA - NWS|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas of convergent Q-vectors, cyclonic vorticity is created, and in divergent areas, anticyclonic vorticity is created.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

RMR differs from [[basal metabolic rate|basal metabolic rate (BMR)]] because BMR measurements must meet total physiological equilibrium whereas RMR conditions of measurement can be altered and defined by the contextual limitations.

[[Indirect calorimetry]] is the study or clinical use of the relationship between [[respirometry]] and [[bioenergetics]], where the measurement of the [[Rate (mathematics)|rates]] of change in oxygen consumption, sometimes carbon dioxide production, and less often [[Muscle atrophy#Quantification|urea production]] is transformed to energy expenditure and expressed as the ratio between ''i) energy'' and ''ii) the time frame of the measurement''. For example, following analysis of oxygen consumption of a human subject, if 5.5 kilocalories of energy were estimated during a 5-minute measurement from a rested individual, then the resting metabolic rate equals = 1.1 kcal/min rate.

A comprehensive treatment of confounding factors on BMR measurements is demonstrated as early as 1922 in Massachusetts by Engineering Professor Frank B Sanborn, wherein descriptions of the effects of food, posture, sleep, muscular activity, and emotion provide criteria for separating BMR from RMR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanborn M.S.|first1=Frank B|title=Basal metabolism: its determination and application|date=1922|page=20|url=https://archive.org/stream/basalmetabolismi00sanbuoft/basalmetabolismi00sanbuoft_djvu.txt|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcnab1997&gt;McNab, B.

===Pre-computer technologies===
In the 1780s for the French Academy of Sciences, [[Antoine Lavoisier#Physiological work|Lavoisier]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], and [[Armand Seguin|Seguin]] investigated and published relationships between direct [[calorimetry]] and [[respirometry|respiratory]] gas exchanges from mammalian subjects. 100 years later in the 19th century for the Connecticut-based Wesleyan University, Professors [[Wilbur Olin Atwater|Atwater]] and [[Edward Bennett Rosa|Rosa]] provided ample evidence of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen transport during the '''[[metabolism]]''' of amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids in human subjects, further establishing the value of '''[[indirect calorimetry]]''' in determining [[bioenergetics]] of free-living humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/metabnitr00usde|title=Report of preliminary investigations on the metabolism of nitrogen and carbon in the human organism, with a respiration calorimeter of special construction|website=The Internet Archive|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/descriptionofnew63atwa|title=Description of a New Respiration Calorimeter and Experiments on the Conservation of Energy in the Human Body|website=The Internet Archive|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Atwater and Rosa also made it possible to calculate the caloric values of foods, which eventually became the criteria adopted by the USDA to create the food calorie library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520280052|title=Why Calories Count|website=University of California Press|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century at Oxford University, physiology researcher Claude Gordon Douglas developed an inexpensive and mobile method of collecting exhaled breath (partly in preparation for experiments to be conducted on Pike's Peak, Colorado). In this method, the subject exhales into a nearly impermeable and large volume collection bag over a recorded period of time. The entire volume is measured, the oxygen and carbon dioxide content are analyzed, and the differences from inspired "ambient" air are calculated to determine the rates of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=D. J. C.|date=1964-11-01|title=Claude Gordon Douglas. 1882-1963|url=http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiogmem/10/51|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|language=en|volume=10|issue=0|pages=51–74|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1964.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To estimate energy expenditure from the exhaled gases, several algorithms were developed. One of the most widely used was developed in 1949 at University of Glasgow by research physiologist J. B. de V. Weir. His abbreviated equation for estimating metabolic rate was written with rates of gas exchange being volume/time, excluded urinary nitrogen, and allowed for the inclusion of a time conversion factor of 1.44 to extrapolate to 24-hour energy expenditure from 'kcal per minute" to "kcal per day." Weir used the Douglas Bag method in his experiments, and in support of neglecting the effect of protein metabolism under normal physiological conditions and eating patterns of ~12.5% protein calories, he wrote:
:"...In fact ''if'' the percentage of protein calories [consumed] lies between 10 and 14 the maximum error in using [the equation] is less than 1 in 500."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weir|first=J.

===Computer-aided RMR measurements===
{{Advert section|date=May 2017}}
In the early 1970s, computer technology enabled on-site data processing, some real-time analysis, and even graphical displays of metabolic variables, such as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and air-flow, thereby encouraging academic institutions to test accuracy and precision in new ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Beaver|first1=WL|last2=Wasserman|first2=K|last3=Whipp|first3=BJ|date=1973|title=On-line computer analysis and breath-by-breath graphical display of exercise function tests|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/34/1/128.long|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=34|issue=1|pages=128–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilmore|first1=JH|last2=Davis|first2=JA|last3=Norton|first3=AC|title=An automated system for assessing metabolic and respiratory function during exercise|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=1976|volume=40|issue=4|pages=619–624|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/40/4/619.full|accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later in the decade, battery-operated systems made debuts. For example, a demonstration of the mobile Oxylog with digital display of both cumulative and past-minute oxygen consumption was presented in 1977 at the Proceedings of the Physiological Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphrey|first1=SJE|last2=Wolff|first2=HS|title=The Oxylog|journal=Journal of Physiology|date=1977|page=12|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.1977.sp011841/epdf|accessdate=2016-03-07|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1977.sp011841|volume=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; As manufacturing and computing costs dropped over the next few decades, various universal calibration methods for preparing and comparing various models in the 1990s brought attention to short-comings or advantages of various designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huszczuk|first1=A|last2=Whipp|first2=BJ|last3=Wasserman|first3=K|title=A respiratory gas exchange simulator for routine calibration in metabolic studies|journal=European Respiratory Journal|date=1990|volume=3|issue=4|pages=465–468|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/3/4/465.full.pdf?|accessdate=2016-03-07|pmid=2114308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to lower costs, the metabolic variable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was often ignored, promoting instead a focus on oxygen-consumption models of weight management and exercise training.

In the new millennium, smaller "desktop-sized" indirect calorimeters, such as the New Leaf system from Medical Graphics were being distributed with fully dedicated [[personal computers]] &amp; printers, and running modern windows-based software such as BreezeSuite for Windows OS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angeion 2005 Annual Report -- page 7 -- Narrative Description of Business -- General|url=http://mgcdiagnostics.com/images/uploads/2005_10-KSB.pdf|website=MGC Diagnostics Company|publisher=MGC Diagnostics|accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated software were made available to empower nutritionists and end-consumers alike to track and manage calorie intake.

At this time, several health and wellness companies brought resting and exercise-conditions measurements as a service to the end consumer, which helped shape sales and service teams to keep these systems online and ready for gym-goers and weight management clinics.

Wide variety of tools and devices available in the market nowadays to track RMR based fitness and exercises. Tools can also target day to day activities and how RMR can be used to determine the amount of energy expended by individuals, personalised to their body measurements and types of activities. For instance, ''In 2017'' TryAround introduced Scientific Fitness Tracker that uses RMR to estimate energy expended for nearly 900 physical activities. The tool is available as an app for iPhone users purely based on metabolic equivalents for standard vs corrected RMRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Fitness Tracker by TryAround based on METS, Metabolic Equivalents and RMR|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1219623151?ls=1&amp;mt=8|website=Scientific Fitness Tracker|publisher=TryAround App Ltd|accessdate=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
RMR measurements are recommended when estimating total daily energy expenditure (TEE). Since [[basal metabolic rate|BMR]] measures are restricted to the narrow time frame (and strict conditions) upon waking, the looser-conditions RMR measure is more typically conducted. In the review organized by the [[USDA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients) (2005)|url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dri-nutrient-reports/energy-carbohydrate-fiber-fat-fatty-acids-cholesterol-protein|website=USDA|publisher=National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board|accessdate=21 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310031719/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dri-nutrient-reports/energy-carbohydrate-fiber-fat-fatty-acids-cholesterol-protein|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; most publications documented specific conditions of resting measurements, including time from latest food intake or physical activities; this comprehensive review estimated RMR is 10 – 20% higher than BMR due to thermic effect of feeding and residual burn from activities that occur throughout the day.

=== Relationship between resting ''metabolic rate'' and ''energy expenditure'' ===
Thermochemistry aside, the rate of metabolism and an amount of energy expenditures can be mistakenly interchanged, for example, when describing RMR and REE.

=== Clinical guidelines for conditions of resting measurements ===
The [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] (AND) provides clinical guidance for preparing a subject for RMR measures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raynor|first1=Hollie|last2=Champagne|first2=Catherine|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Interventions for the Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|date=2016|volume=116|issue=1|page=131|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2015.10.031|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/practice/position-and-practice-papers/position-papers/weight-management|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to mitigate possible confounding factors from feeding, stressful physical activities, or exposure to stimulants such as caffeine or nicotine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In preparation, a subject should be fasting for 7 hrs or greater, and mindful to avoid stimulants and stressors, such as caffeine, nicotine, and hard physical activities such as purposeful exercises.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''For 30 minutes before conducting the measurement, a subject should be laying supine without physical movements, no reading nor listening to music. The ambiance should reduce stimulation by maintaining constant quiet, low lighting, and steady temperature. These conditions continue during the measurement stage.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further, the correct use of a well-maintained indirect calorimeter includes achieving a natural and steady breathing pattern in order to reveal oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production rates under a reproducible resting condition. Indirect calorimetry is considered the gold-standard method to measure RMR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Indirect calorimetry: a practical guide for clinicians|journal = Nutrition in Clinical Practice: Official Publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition|date = 2007-08-01|issn = 0884-5336|pmid = 17644692|pages = 377–388|volume = 22|issue = 4|first = Heather A.|last = Haugen|first2 = Lingtak-Neander|last2 = Chan|first3 = Fanny|last3 = Li|doi=10.1177/0115426507022004377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect calorimeters are usually found in laboratory and clinical settings, but technological advancements are bringing RMR measurement to free-living conditions.

=== Use of REE in weight management ===
Long-term weight management is directly proportional to calories absorbed from feeding; nevertheless, myriad non-caloric factors also play biologically significant roles (not covered here) in estimating energy intake. In counting energy expenditure, the use of a resting measurement (RMR) is the most accurate method for estimating the major portion of Total daily energy expenditure (TEE), thereby giving the closest approximations when planning &amp; following a Calorie Intake Plan. Thus, estimation of REE by indirect calorimetry is strongly recommended for accomplishing long-term weight management, a conclusion reached and maintained due to ongoing observational research by well-respected institutions such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], AND (previously ADA), [[American College of Sports Medicine|ACSM]], and internationally by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]].

== Common correlates to metabolic rate and 24-hr energy expenditure ==
Energy expenditure is correlated to a number of factors, listed in alphabetical order.
*Age: Besides the epidemiologically correlated trends of aging, lowered physical activity, and loss of lean muscle mass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manore|first1=Melinda|last2=Meyer|first2=Nanna|last3=Thompson|first3=Janice|title=Sport Nutrition for Health and Performance|date=2009|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=United States of America|isbn=9780736085519|edition=2|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/products/all-products/Sport-Nutrition-for-Health-and-Performance-eBook-2nd-Edition|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; lessened cellular activity (the senescence thereof) may also contribute to lowering of REE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2705">'''Sabicu wood''' or '''sabicu''' is the [[wood]] of at least two species of the genus ''[[Lysiloma]]''. ''[[Lysiloma sabicu]]'' (L.) Benth. occurs sparingly in the Bahamas, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and Cuba. It was named by [[George Bentham]] (1800-1884) from a Cuban specimen examined in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Hooker's ''Journal of Botany and Kew Gardens Miscellany'', Vol. 6, London (1854).&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham went on to identify a second species, ''[[Lysiloma latisiliquum]]'' (L.) Benth., which grows best in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the Linnean Society of London'', London (1875).&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is commonly known as 'wild tamarind' or 'false tamarind'. The wood of both species is similar, being mid-brown in colour, sometimes with a reddish hue, heavy (specific gravity of 0.40-0.75)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidewood.lib.ncsu.edu/description?descid=2882 |title=LEGUMINOSAE MIMOSOIDEAE ''Lysiloma latisiliquum'' (L.) Benth. (SABICU, WILD TAMARIND) |work=Inside Wood |publisher=North Carolina State University |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; hard and durable. Some timber is well figured, but most relatively plain. The wood has been used in construction, shipbuilding and in furniture making, although its weight is a distinct drawback for the latter purpose. The stairs of [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]], in which [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851 was held, were made of sabicu due to its durability. Despite the enormous traffic that passed over them, the wood at the end was found to be little affected by wear.

There is some confusion in the published literature between ''L. sabicu'' and ''L. latisiliquum'', although there is little doubt that the former was the most important commercial species.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Howard, ''Timbers of the World'', London (1948), p. 520; Thomas Laslett, ''Timber and Timber Trees'', London (1875), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also confusion with other Bahamian species colloquially known as 'tamarind', several of which were also called sabicu. The most common of these are ''Peltophorum adnatum'' Griseb. and ''Cojoba arborea'' (L.) Britton &amp; Rose. At various times their wood has also been called 'horseflesh mahogany'. The Economic Botany Collection at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, contains specimens of wood from all these species collected at various times in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The labelling evinces considerable confusion, but it seems likely that 'horseflesh mahogany' properly applies to ''Peltophorum'' and ''Cojoba'', while sabicu applies to ''Lysiloma''.

[[File:Ljungström air preheater.jpg|thumb|Ljungström [[Air Preheater]] by Swedish engineer [[Fredrik Ljungström]] (1875-1964)]]
A '''thermal wheel''', also known as a '''rotary heat exchanger''', or '''rotary air-to-air enthalpy wheel''', or '''heat recovery wheel''', is a type of [[energy recovery]] [[heat exchanger]] positioned within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air-handling system or in the exhaust gases of an industrial process, in order to recover the heat energy. Other variants include '''enthalpy wheels''' and '''desiccant wheels'''. A cooling-specific thermal wheel is sometimes referred to as a '''Kyoto wheel'''.

==Description==
A thermal wheel consists of a circular honeycomb matrix of heat-absorbing material, which is slowly rotated within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air-handling system. As the thermal wheel rotates, heat is picked up from the exhaust air stream in one half of the rotation and given up to the fresh air stream in the other half of the rotation. Thus [[waste heat]] energy from the exhaust air stream is transferred to the matrix material and then from the matrix material to the fresh air stream, raising the temperature of the supply air stream by an amount proportional to the temperature differential between air streams, or "thermal gradient", and depending upon the efficiency of the device. Heat exchange is most efficient when the streams flow in [[counter current exchange|opposite directions]], since this causes a favourable temperature gradient across the thickness of the wheel. The principle of course works in reverse, and "cooling" energy can be recovered to the supply air stream if so desired and the temperature differential allows.

The heat exchange matrix may be aluminium, plastic, or synthetic fiber. The heat exchanger is rotated by a small electric motor and belt drive system. The motors are often inverter speed-controlled for improved control of the leaving air temperature. If no heat exchange is required, then the motor can be stopped altogether.

Because  of the nature of thermal wheels in the way that heat is transferred from the exhaust air stream to the supply air stream without having to pass directly through an exchange medium, the gross efficiencies are usually much higher than that of any other air-side heat recovery system. The shallower depth of the heat exchange matrix, as compared to that, say, for a plate heat exchanger, means that the pressure drop through the device is normally lower in comparison. Generally, a thermal wheel will be selected for [[face velocity|face velocities]] between {{convert|1.5|and|3.0|m/s}}, and with equal air volume flow rates, gross "sensible" efficiencies of 85% can be expected. Although there is a small extra energy requirement to rotate the wheel, the motor energy consumption is usually very low and has little effect upon the seasonal efficiency of the device. In addition, the ability to recover "latent" heat, depending upon the materials and coatings used, can improve gross efficiencies by 10–15%.

==Energy transfer process==
Normally the heat transfer between airstreams provided by the device is termed as "[[Sensible heat|sensible]]", which is the exchange of energy, or [[enthalpy]], resulting in a change in temperature of the medium (air in this case), but with no change in moisture content. However, if moisture or relative [[humidity]] levels in the return air stream are high enough to allow condensation to take place in the device, then this will cause "[[latent heat|latent]]" heat to be released, and the heat transfer material will be covered with a film of water. Despite a corresponding absorption of latent heat, as some of the water film is evaporated in the opposite air stream, the water will reduce the thermal resistance of the boundary layer of the heat exchanger material and thus improve the heat transfer coefficient of the device, and hence increase efficiency. The energy exchange of such devices now comprises both sensible and latent heat transfer; in addition to a change in temperature, there is also a change in moisture content of the air streams.

However, the film of condensation will also slightly increase pressure drop through the device, and depending upon the spacing of the matrix material, this can increase resistance by up to 30%. This will increase fan energy consumption and reduce the seasonal efficiency of the device.

Aluminium matrices are also available with an applied [[hygroscopic]] coating, and the use of this, or the use of porous synthetic fiber matrices, allows for the [[adsorption]] and release of water vapour, at moisture levels much lower than that normally required for condensation and latent heat transfer to occur. The benefit of this is an even higher heat transfer efficiency, but it also results in the drying or [[Humidifier|humidification]] of air streams, which may also be desired for the particular process being served by the supply air.

For this reason these devices are also commonly known as an '''enthalpy wheel'''.

===Use in gas turbines===
{{main|Chrysler Turbine Car}}
During the automotive industry's interest in [[gas turbine]]s for vehicle propulsion (around 1965), [[Chrysler]] invented a unique type of rotary heat exchanger&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/mopar/turbine.html Chrysler turbine information]&lt;/ref&gt; that consisted of a rotary drum constructed from corrugated metal (similar in appearance to corrugated cardboard). This drum was continuously rotated by reduction gears driven by the turbine. The hot exhaust gasses were directed through a portion of the device, which would then rotate to a section that conducted the induction air, where this intake air was heated. This recovery of the heat of combustion significantly increased the efficiency of the turbine engine. This engine proved impractical for an automotive application due to its poor low-rpm torque. Even such an efficient engine, if large enough to deliver the proper performance, would have a low average [[fuel efficiency]]. Such an engine may at some future time be attractive when combined with an electric motor in a [[hybrid vehicle]] owing to its robust longevity and an ability to burn a wide variety of liquid fuels.{{OR|date=August 2014}}

==Desiccant wheel==
A '''[[desiccant]] wheel''' is very similar to a thermal wheel, but with a coating applied for the sole purpose of dehumidifying, or "drying", the air stream. The desiccant is normally [[silica gel]]. As the wheel turns, the desiccant passes alternately through the incoming air, where the moisture is [[Adsorption|adsorbed]], and through a “regenerating” zone, where the desiccant is dried and the moisture expelled.  The wheel continues to rotate, and the adsorbent process is repeated. Regeneration is normally carried out by the use of a heating coil, such as a water or steam coil, or a direct-fired gas burner.

Thermal wheels and desiccant wheels are often used in series configuration to provide the required dehumidification as well as recovering the heat from the regeneration cycle.

==Disadvantages==
Thermal wheels are not suitable for use where total separation of supply and exhaust air streams is required, since air will bypass at the interface between the air streams at the heat exchanger boundary, and at the point where the wheel passes from one air stream to the other during its normal rotation. The former is reduced by brush seals, and the latter is reduced by a small purge section, formed by plating off a small segment of the wheel, normally in the exhaust air stream.

Matrices made from fibrous materials, or with hygroscopic coatings, for the transfer of latent heat, are far more susceptible to damage and degradation by "[[fouling]]" than plain metal or plastic materials, and are difficult or impossible to effectively clean if dirty. Care must be taken to properly filter the air streams on both exhaust and fresh air sides of the wheel. Any dirt attaching on either air side will invariably be transported into the air stream of the other side.

'''[[Time line of the geologic history of the United States]]''' -
[[10th millennium BC in North American history|10th millennium BC]]
|}

== Time line chart ==

This '''time line of the geologic history of the United States''' chronologically lists important events occurring within the present political boundaries of [[United States]] (including territories) before 12,000 years ago.  This time line segment may include some events that occurred outside these borders that profoundly influenced later American life and its present landscape.  It also includes evidence of Native American communities predating the [[Clovis culture]].

Because of the inaccuracies inhernet in [[radiocarbon dating]] and other methods of interpreting the geologic (and archaeological) record, most dates in this time line represent approximations that may vary considerably from source to source.  The assumptions implicit in geologic dating methods also may yield a general bias in the dating in this time line.

* 1,600,000 to 10,000 years ago:  The [[Pleistocene]] Epoch; humans arrive in North America at the end of the epoch.
* 200,000 years ago:  Oldest archaeological claim of human habitation of the New World, very likely in error.
* 50,000 years ago:  Current practical limit of radiocarbon dating.
* 42,000 to 21,000 years ago: Geneticists estimate that people of eastern Siberia and Native Americans belonged to the same population.
* 41,000 years ago: [[Bear]] remains from a cave on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska; humans visited tens of thousands of years later.
* 40,000 to 30,000 years ago: The [[Australian Aborigines]] reach their continent by boat, leading some archaeologists to suggest that the First Americans might have reached the New World by travel overseas.
* 35,000 years ago:  California linguist [[Johanna Nichols]] estimates that diversification began in the Native American people.
* 35,000 to 25,000 years ago:  Humans reach far eastern Siberia opposite Alaska.
* 25,000 to 10,000 years ago:  Natural land bridge of [[Beringia]] connects Siberian Far East with Alaska.
* 23,000 years ago:  [[Cordilleran ice sheet]] closes Pacific coast to overland travel.
* 23,000 to 19,000 years ago:  During these coldest millennia, glacial lobes hundreds of kilometers wide flowed into the North Pacific Ocean.
* 16,500 years ago:  [[Solutrean Period]] in prehistoric Europe ends after producing artifacts vaguely similar to those of Clovis, New Mexico.
* 16,000 years ago: Earliest radiocarbon dating from the [[Cactus Hill]], Virginia archaeological site with human artifacts buried below Clovis fluted-point spear points.
* 15,000 years ago: First Native Americans probably have arrived in Alaska from Siberia-—possibly much earlier.
* 14,250 years ago: Unmistakable human artifacts deposited into sediments of this age at [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]], Pennsylvania.
* 14,000 years ago:  Vast North American ice sheets retreat, opening Pacific coast route southward from Alaska to overland travel.
* 14,000 to 13,000 years ago:  A warming climate leaves the Pacific coast of North America ice-free during summer, opening the possibility of southward migration.
* 13,000 years ago: Asians had begun walking across the land bridge from Siberia to become the first Native Americans.
* 12,500 years ago: Radiocarbon dating of organic remains excavated at [[Monte Verde]], Chile indicate that people lived in the New World, probably migrating from Siberia along the Pacific coast

A '''transatlantic tunnel''' is a theoretical [[tunnel]] that would span the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] possibly for such purposes as [[mass transit]]. Some proposals envision technologically advanced trains reaching speeds of {{convert|500|to|8000|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="exe"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Transatlantic Tunnel|episodelink=&lt;!-- for wikiarticle about episode --&gt;|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/engineering/transatlantictunnel/interactive/interactive.html|series=Extreme Engineering|serieslink=Extreme Engineering|credits=Joseph Giotta (Narrator), Powderhouse Productions|network=[[Discovery Channel]]|airdate=16 April 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014656/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/engineering/transatlantictunnel/interactive/interactive.html|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most conceptions of the tunnel envision it between the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] ‒ or more specifically between [[New York City]] and [[London]].

Advantages compared to air travel could be increased speed, and use of electricity instead of scarce oil based fuel, considering a future time long after [[peak oil]].

The main barriers to constructing such a tunnel are cost with estimates of between $88 billion to $175 billion as well as the limits of current [[materials science]].&lt;ref name="popsci"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Trans-Atlantic MagLev: Vacuum Tube Train|author=Carl Hoffman|journal=[[Popular Science]]|date=12 April 2004|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-04/trans-atlantic-maglev|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing major tunnels, such as the [[Channel Tunnel]], [[Seikan Tunnel]] and the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]], despite using less expensive technology than any yet proposed for the transatlantic tunnel, struggle financially{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Proposed tunnels==
Many variations of the concept exist, including a tube above the [[seabed]], a tunnel beneath the ocean floor, or some combination of the two.

===Vactrain===
{{Main|Vactrain}}
A 1960s proposal has a {{convert|3100|mi|km}}-long near-[[vacuum]] tube with [[vactrain]]s, a theoretical type of [[maglev (transport)|maglev]] train, which could travel at speeds up to {{convert|5000|mph|km/h}}. At this speed, the travel-time between [[New York City]] and [[London]] would be less than one hour. Another modern variation, intended to reduce costs, is a [[submerged floating tunnel]] about {{convert|160|ft|m}} below the ocean surface, in order to avoid ships, bad weather, and the high pressure associated with a much deeper tunnel near the sea bed. It would consist of 54,000 prefabricated sections held in place by 100,000 tethering cables. Each section would consist of a layer of foam sandwiched between concentric steel tubes, and the tunnel would also have reduced air pressure.&lt;ref name="exe"/&gt;

===Jet propulsion===
Ideas proposing [[rocket]], [[jet engine|jet]], [[scramjet]], and air-pressurized tunnels for train transportation have also been put forward. In the proposal described in an ''[[Extreme Engineering]]'' episode, trains would take 18 minutes to reach top speed, and 18 minutes at the end to come to a halt. During the deceleration phase, the resultant 0.2g acceleration would lead to an unpleasant feeling of tilting downward, and it was proposed that the seats would individually rotate to face backwards at the midpoint of the journey, in order to make the deceleration more pleasant.&lt;ref name=exe/&gt;

==History==
===Early interest===
Suggestions for such a structure go back to [[Michel Verne]], son of [[Jules Verne]], who wrote about it in 1888 in a story entitled ''Un Express de l'avenir'' (''An Express of the Future''). This story was published in English in ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in 1895, where it was incorrectly attributed to Jules Verne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

1913 saw the publication of the novel ''[[Der Tunnel (novel)|Der Tunnel]]'' by [[Germany|German]] author [[Bernhard Kellermann]]. It inspired four films of the same name: [[The Tunnel (1915 film)|one in 1915]] by [[William Wauer]], and separate [[The Tunnel (1933 German-language film)|German]], [[The Tunnel (1933 French-language film)|French]], and [[The Tunnel (1935 film)|British]] versions released in 1933 and 1935. The German and French versions were directed by [[Curtis Bernhardt]], and the British one was written in part by [[science fiction]] writer [[Curt Siodmak]]. Perhaps suggesting contemporary interest in the topic, an original poster for the American release of the British version (renamed ''Transatlantic Tunnel'') was, in 2006, estimated for auction at $2,000–3,000.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web

The April 2004 issue of ''[[Popular Science]]'' suggests that a transatlantic tunnel is more feasible than previously thought, and without major engineering challenges. It compares it favorably with laying transatlantic pipes and cables, but with a cost of 88 to 175&amp;nbsp;billion dollars.&lt;ref name="popsci"/&gt; In 2003, the Discovery Channel's show ''[[Extreme Engineering]]'' aired a program, titled "Transatlantic Tunnel",&lt;ref name="exe" /&gt; which discussed the proposed tunnel concept in detail.

'''Tumchaite''', Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Zr,Sn)Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;•H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is a colorless to white monoclinic phyllosilicate mineral. It is associated with [[calcite]], [[dolomite]], and [[pyrite]] in the late dolomite-calcite carbonatites. It can be transparent to translucent; has a vitreous luster; and has perfect cleavage on {100}. Its hardness is 4.5, between [[fluorite]] and [[apatite]]. Tumchaite is [[isotypic]] with [[penkvilksite]]. The structure of the mineral is identified by silicate sheets parallel {100}, formed by alternation of clockwise and counterclockwise growing spiral chains of corner-sharing SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. Tumchaite is named for the river [[Tumcha]] near [[Vuoriyarvi massif]].&lt;ref name="Subbotin"/&gt;

==Occurrence==
Tumchaite is found in carbonatites of the alkaline-ultramafic Vuoriyarvi massif, the Murmansk Region, Russia. This is located in the North Karelia on the north shore of the Vuoriyarvi lake and  occupies an area of about 19.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The mineral has been found as lens-like segregation of .5 x 1.0 x 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in size in core sample from the bore hole. Tumchaite is associated with calcite, dolomite, a mineral of the serpentine group, and pyrite, and is formed during the hydrothermal alteration of carbonatites.&lt;ref name ="Subbotin"/&gt;

==Physical properties==
Tumchaite occurs as tabular monoclinic crystals, but other habits include massive and granular.&lt;ref name="webmineral"/&gt; The size of individual crystals is approximately 0.2 x 1.2 x 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It is colorless to white, transparent to translucent. The streak is white and the luster is vitreous. Cleavage on {100} is perfect, no parting is observed, and fracture is uneven as tumchaite is very brittle. The [[Mohs hardness]] is 4.5, between [[fluorite]] and [[apatite]]. The [[Vickers hardness test]] yielded 365 to 445- averaging 410- kg/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a 40 g load. The density, which was determined by flotation of the mineral using a dilute Clerici-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solution, was 2.78 (2) g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; versus the 2.77 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; determined by the empirical formula.&lt;ref name ="Subbotin"/&gt;

==Chemical composition==
Subbotin, et al., performed quantitative electron microprobe analysis with MS 46 CAMECA instrument operated at 20kV (30 for Zr) and sample current 15-30 nA. The following standards were used for the elements shown in parentheses: [[lorenzenite]] (for Na and Ti), [[diopside]] (Ca and Si), [[wadeite]] (Zr), [[hematite]] (Fe), MnCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Mn), Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (Y), metallic Sn, Hf, and Nb.&lt;ref name ="Subbotin"/&gt;

Water contents could not be determined due to little amount of homogeneous material. The presence of molecular water in the mineral was confirmed by the refinement of the crystal structure. The [[empirical formula]], calculated on the basis of 13 O atoms is (Na&lt;sub&gt;2.03&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.01&lt;/sub&gt;)(Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.76&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.17&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.01&lt;/sub&gt;)Si&lt;sub&gt;4.02&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;•2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, simplified to Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Zr,Sn)Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;•H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name ="Subbotin"/&gt;

==X-ray crystallography==
A single crystal with the approximate dimensions of 0.20 x 0.20 x 0.20&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was selected for the X-ray study. This study was performed using a Siemens P4 four circle diffractometer, using graphite monochromatized Mo''K''α radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). Unit cell parameters were found through a least square fit using 25 medium θ reflections: ''a''=9.144 (4), ''b''=8.818 (3), ''c''=7.537 (3) Å, β=113.22 (3)°, ''V''=558.49 Å&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Z''=2. The full diffraction pattern can be found in Table 2 of Subbotin, et al.&lt;ref name ="Subbotin"/&gt;

==Structure==
Tumchaite is isotypic with penkvilksite-1''M'' and is chemically related to [[vlasovite]]. The dominant structural feature of tumchaite is the silicate sheet [Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;] parallel to {100}, which can be considered as a result of condensation of the tetrahedral spiral chains running along [010] with six tetrahedra in the repeat unit. Adjacent spirals are oriented in alternate clockwise and counterclockwise ways. Tumchaite contains two symmetrically independent SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra: Si1 and Si2 have two and three bridging O atoms, respectively.&lt;ref name ="Subbotin"/&gt;

The tetrahedral silicate sheets are connected by cationic octahedra with a disordered distribution of Zr and Sn (at 0, 1/2, 0), with the Zr/Sn ratio in these octahedra being 4. Figure 2 of Subbotin, et al., shows an illustration of this structure.&lt;ref name="Subbotin"/&gt;

The '''Whitehill Formation''', alternatively written as '''White Hill Formation''' and formerly known as '''White Band''' or '''Whitehill''' or '''White Hill Member''', is a regional [[Early Permian]] ([[Artinskian]] to [[Kungurian]], dating to around 282 to 275 Ma) geologic [[Formation (geology)|formation]] belonging to the [[Ecca Group]] in the southeastern [[ǁKaras Region]] of southeastern [[Namibia]] and [[Eastern Cape|Eastern]], [[Northern Cape|Northern]] and [[Western Cape]] provinces of [[South Africa]].

The formation comprises [[black shale]]s, [[mudstone]]s, [[siltstone]]s, [[dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] beds, [[gypsum]] and [[halite]] layers and a layer of [[tuff]] within the formation. With a thickness between {{convert|50|and|70|m|ft}} and present in an area of {{convert|600|by|600|km|mi}}, the formation is considered the primary target for [[shale gas]] potential in the Southern Karoo. [[Total Organic Carbon]] (TOC) values average 4.5% with a range from 0.5 to 14.7%, placing the formation in the same range as the well-known [[Barnett Shale]] and [[Marcellus Formation]] of the United States.

The Whitehill Formation of the [[Karoo Basin|Karoo]] and [[Nama Basin|Nama or Kalahari Basin]] is contemporaneous with the [[Huab Formation]] of the [[Huab Basin]] and is correlated with a series of formations in the [[Pelotas Basin|Pelotas]] and [[Paraná Basin]]s in southeastern Brazil, deposited in a larger basinal area, 150 million years before the break-up of [[Pangea]]. The abundance of ''[[Glossopteris]]'' and ''[[Mesosaurus]]'' fossils are characteristic of the [[Gondwana]]n correlation across present-day South America, Africa, Antarctica and Australia. The Whitehill Formation has provided fossil reptiles, [[insect]]s, fish and flora.

== Description ==
The Whitehill Formation is an extensive Lower Permian unit, cropping out in a thin band stretching from the [[Western Cape]] in South Africa through southeastern Namibia and the [[Northern Cape]] in the north to the [[Eastern Cape]] of South Africa in the east.&lt;ref name=Cole2014_p4&gt;Cole, 2014, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The formation is found at the edge of the Karoo Basin at distances of {{convert|600|km|mi}} north to south and east to west.&lt;ref name=Cole2014_p15&gt;Cole, 2014, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The formation is part of the [[Karoo Supergroup]], more precisely the [[Ecca Group]], where it overlies the [[Prince Albert Formation]] and is overlain by the [[Collingham Formation]],&lt;ref name=Evans1999_p175&gt;Evans &amp; Bender, 1999, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; and in the southern Karoo by the [[Tierberg Formation]].&lt;ref name=Cole2014_p28&gt;Cole, 2014, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

Single zircon [[Uranium|U]]-[[Lead|Pb]] SHRIMP dating yielded an age of 279.1 ± 1.5 Ma for the [[Uhabis River Tuff]] present in the upper strata of the underlying Prince Albert Formation.&lt;ref name=Werner2006_p207&gt;Werner, 2006, p.207&lt;/ref&gt; The Khabus Tuff within the Whitehill Formation provided a weighted mean &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb/&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U age of 280.5 ± 2.1 Ma.&lt;ref name=Werner2006_p362&gt;Werner, 2006, p.362&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors use an estimated age for the whole formation of around 275 Ma.&lt;ref name=Geel2013_p259&gt;Geel et al., 2013, p.259&lt;/ref&gt;

In the central part of the [[Karoo Basin]], the formation ranges in thickness from {{convert|50|to|70|m|ft}} and is highly organic with up to 14 weight percent of [[Total Organic Carbon]] (TOC).&lt;ref name=Branch2007_p465&gt;Branch et al., 2007, p.465&lt;/ref&gt; The formation is highly conductive and can be traced in seismic profiles across nearly the whole basin.&lt;ref name=Branch2007_p475&gt;Branch et al., 2007, p.475&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lithologies ===
The Whitehill Formation has been subdivided into two major subunits according to their weathering color in outcrops. The lower and thicker part consists mainly of bluish- to greenish-grey [[shale]]s and [[mudstone]]s, which grade upward into more light brownish, buff weathering, slightly coarser grained [[siltstone]]s. This zone is conformably overlain by white weathering shales, with intermittent [[chert]] lenses and [[pyrite|pyritic]] stringers; the latter rarely exceeding {{convert|20|mm|in}} in thickness. The sedimentary structure is generally massive, however laminations do occur that resemble algal lamellae. The formation appears white due to [[weathering]] of pyrite ([[sulfide]]) at surface to [[sulfate]] ([[gypsum]]).&lt;ref name=Branch2007_p467&gt;Branch et al., 2007, p.467&lt;/ref&gt; This section is grading upward into dark [[carbonaceous]], bluish-grey weathering shales. From a lithological point of view only the upper part of the succession consists of the Whitehill-characteristic carbonaceous [[black shale]]s.&lt;ref name=Werner2006_p80&gt;Werner, 2006, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tuff]]aceous zone occurs within the Whitehill Formation a few metres below the stratigraphic interval, which contains several dolomitic limestones. This limestone interval forms a mappable unit in all outcrops of the Whitehill Formation in central southern Namibia.&lt;ref name=Werner2006_p221&gt;Werner, 2006, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; In the Northern Cape, the formation is intruded by [[dolerite]] sills.&lt;ref name=Cole2014_p22&gt;Cole, 2014, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; The sediments are considered to be deposited in an [[anoxic environment]]. Besides pyrite, the shales contain [[dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] lenses near the base. The rocks are highly folded and faulted by the [[Cape orogeny]] forming the [[Cape Fold Belt]], and thus, interpreted as "decollement".&lt;ref name=Geel2013_p258&gt;Geel et al., 2013, p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whitehill Formation was deposited in a shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] with little to no connection to the open ocean. This sea, stretching from the [[Paraná Basin]] in current southeastern Brazil to the [[Karasberg Basin|Karasberg]] and [[Karoo Basin]]s of southwestern Africa, probably represents the transition from marine to brackish or freshwater conditions, in sediment-starved, stratified and anoxic embayments.&lt;ref name=Evans1999_p175/&gt;

From outcrops in southernmost Namibia (Aussenkjer-Noordoewer area) it became evident that the boundary between the Prince Albert and the Whitehill Formation represents the turning point from a [[progradation (geology)|progradational]] to a [[retrogradation (geology)|retrogradational]] succession.&lt;ref name=Werner2006_p99&gt;Werner, 2006, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; The tuffs within the Whitehill Formation, as well as other tuffaceous beds found in the underlying and overlying formations, were possibly sourced by volcanoes located in present-day South America,&lt;ref name=Werner2006_p383&gt;Werner, 2006, p.383&lt;/ref&gt; although other interpretations of the tuffs of the Dwyka and Ecca Groups propose a general source along the southern [[Panthalassia]]n margin of current southern Africa.&lt;ref name=Werner2006_p377&gt;Werner, 2006, p.377&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Correlations ===
{{see also|Paraná Basin|Pelotas Basin}}
The Whitehill Formation is time equivalent with the [[Pietermaritzburg Formation]] of the [[Waterberg Basin]] of southern Namibia.&lt;ref name=Werner2006_p373&gt;Werner, 2006, p.373&lt;/ref&gt; To the north in the Karoo Basin, the shales of the Whitehill Formation are laterally equivalent with the [[Vryheid Formation]].&lt;ref name=Cole2014_p7&gt;Cole, 2014, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The upper part of the formation is correlated with the [[Irati Formation]] of the [[Paraná Basin|Paraná]] and [[Pelotas Basin]]s in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]], the [[Black Rock Member]] of the [[Falkland Islands]],&lt;ref name=Werner2006_p373&gt;Werner, 2006, p.373&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[Huab Formation]] in the [[Huab Basin]] of northwestern Namibia. The lower section correlates with the [[Palermo Formation|Palermo]] and [[Rio Bonito Formation]]s of the Paraná Basin and the [[Prince Albert Formation]] of the Karoo.&lt;ref name=Horsthemke1990_p74&gt;Horsthemke et al., 1990, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; The Permian sequence in the Huab Basin is much thinner than those of the Paraná and Karoo Basins.&lt;ref name=Holzforster2000_p255&gt;Holzförster et al., 2000, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; The fossil assemblages of ''[[Glossopteris]]'' and ''Mesosaurus'' are known from other parts of [[Gondwana]]; the Vryheid Formation of South Africa and coal deposits of the Lower Permian in Australia.&lt;ref name=Horsthemke1990_p69&gt;Horsthemke et al., 1990, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fossil content ===
[[File:Stereosternum.jpg|thumb|right|165px|Interpretation of ''Stereosternum'']]
[[File:Lepidodendron.png|thumb|right|165px|Interpretation of ''Lepidodendron'']]
The Whitehill Formation has provided a variety of fossil insects, rare flora and ''[[Mesosaurus]]'' fossils, typical for the Permian of Gondwana. The mesosaurids are preserved as molds filled with gypsum crystals; they are commonly disarticulated.  More rarely, casts of mesosaurids are found. Plant stems are similarly rare, and most commonly occur as chloritized fragments floating in the pink lower, more massive mudstone succession of the Whitehill Formation, while [[coprolite]]s containing either palaeoniscoid scales or fragmentary [[crustacea]]n carapaces are preserved on bedding planes.&lt;ref name=Evans1999_p177&gt;Evans &amp; Bender, 1999, p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

The following fossils have been reported from the Whitehill Formation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=90755 Khabus; Hill of the Captain's House] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=117279 Modderdrift farm] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=14328 Brandhoek (Bra 111)] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=117281 Krantz Poort farm] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=156986 Kenmoore Farm] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=13083 Victoria West District] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=90257 Burghersdorp] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=90303 District of Albania, Griqualand West] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic geology ==
The high concentration of organic matter in the [[black shale]]s of the Whitehill Formation make it an interesting target for [[shale gas]] exploration. The formation is considered the prime focus for potential shale gas prospects in the Southern Karoo.&lt;ref name=Geel2013_p263&gt;Geel et al., 2013, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; TOC levels average at 4.5% TOC,&lt;ref name=Geel2013_p260&gt;Geel et al., 2013, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; and range from 0.5 to 14.7%, comparable to known shale gas producing formations as the [[Marcellus Formation]] and the [[Barnett Shale]].&lt;ref name=Cole2014_p5&gt;Cole, 2014, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The formation is considered to have economic potential in an area around [[Beaufort West]] to [[Graaff-Reinet]].&lt;ref name=Cole2014_p31&gt;Cole, 2014, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

Results from [[Rock-Eval pyrolysis]], [[vitrinite reflectance]] measurements, open pyrolysis and thermovaporization analyses carried out on core samples drilled through the formation show that organic matter has reached an advanced stage of kerogen development. These rocks can therefore be classified as [[source rock maturity|overmature]], likely because of the thermotectonic processes related to the [[Cape orogeny]] forming the [[Cape Fold Belt]] overprint on lower Karoo rocks in the study area. It is possible that the maturity of the shales decreases farther north in the Karoo basin.&lt;ref name=Geel2013_p264&gt;Geel et al., 2013, p.264&lt;/ref&gt;
