'''750 Seventh Avenue''' is a 615&amp;nbsp;ft (187m) tall Class-A office skyscraper in [[New York City]]. It was completed in 1989 in the postmodern style&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=892 |title=750 Seventh Avenue, New York City - SkyscraperPage.com |website=skyscraperpage.com |access-date=2017-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124070714/http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=892 |archivedate=2007-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has 36 floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115515/750-seventh-avenue-new-york-city-ny-usa|title=750 Seventh Avenue, New York City {{!}} 115515 {{!}} EMPORIS|last=GmbH|first=Emporis|website=www.emporis.com|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo &amp; Associates designed the building, and it is owned by [[Hines Interests Limited Partnership|Hines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkarchitecture.info/Building/705/750-Seventh-Avenue.php|title=750 Seventh Avenue|publisher=New York Architecture Info|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Texas]] based real estate investment company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2011/04/thirty-bidders-later-former-morgan-stanley-hub-in-contract/|title=Thirty Bidders Later, Former Morgan Stanley Hub in Contract|publisher=New York Observer|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's continuous helix design, culminating in a chimney-like extension, was caused by the New York City Building Code, which requires setbacks. The 84 exterior column transfers exist because of the owner's requirement for a column-free space. It is tied with the [[New York Life Building]] for the 74th tallest building in New York City. It is also LEED certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://42floors.com/us/ny/new-york/750-7th-ave|title=750 7th Avenue, New York City {{!}} 42Floors|website=42floors.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Alok Dixit is born in a Brahmin family in [[Kanpur]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/how-love-got-better-india-acid-attack-201412464948664688.html |title=How love got the better of India acid attack |date=24 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an alumnus of [[Indian Institute of Journalism &amp; New Media]], [[Bangalore]], [[India]].

==Career==
Alok joined [[Indian Air Force]] in 2007 and served till Mar 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/how-love-got-better-india-acid-attack-201412464948664688.htmlfilename=hub140511HOW.asp |title=How love got the better of India acid attack |date=24 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the service and became a fellow of [[IIJNM]], [[Bangalore]]. After a short service as a [[reporter]] in TV9 News channel in [[Mumbai]], he switched to Jagran Prakashan Limited and worked for portal [[Inext]] Live.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2013}}

Alok works with the survivors of [[acid attacks]] in [[India]]. In the last two years, Dixit built a campaign across the country called "Stop Acid Attacks". This organization, made up mainly of acid attack victims, makes it a point to visit the victims and help them in whatever way possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stopacidattacks.org/p/chhaon.html |title=Chhanv |date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Alok Dixit, set out to fight against the scourge of acid attacks in India. Along the way, the issue consumed him and he found himself in a relationship with acid attack survivor turned activist and TV Anchor, [[Laxmi (acid attack victim)|Laxmi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/how-love-got-better-india-acid-attack-201412464948664688.htmlfilename=hub140511HOW.asp |title=How love got the better of India acid attack |date=24 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 24-year-old Laxmi from Delhi, who is also a winner of a 2014 Women of Courage award, underwent seven major surgeries to try and reduce the burns to her skin, told to People Magazine, ‘'After the attack, I never thought I would ever find a soulmate. I had lost hope. She said: 'Someone asked me the question of what if the attacker still offered to marry me? I said, he has changed my face, but he has failed to change my mind”. Afterward,I never wanted to find love. I mean there was no hope in any case because of the scars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/s/gwi/rls/rem/2014/222920.htm |title=Remarks at the International Women of Courage Awards |date=4 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But after meeting Dixit, that all changed and she says she learned to love again. “But in Alok, I couldn't have found anyone better. He understood the kind of pain I was in. He understood what I had been going through".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2551616/Indian-acid-attack-victim-Laxmi-24-disfigured-jealous-boyfriend-finally-finds-love.html |title=Indian acid attack victim Laxmi, 24, who was disfigured by jealous boyfriend finally finds love |date=4 Feb 2014 | location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alok says, “Just like anyone falls in love, I fell in love with Laxmi”.
“Yes, she is the victim of an acid attack, and it shows, but that did not come in the way of our relationship. I liked her courage and the fact that she boldly faced the world without trying to hide within four walls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stopacidattacks/acid-attack-survivor-laxmi-s-spirit-wins-her-a-partner-for-life/article1-1170630.aspx |title=Acid attack survivor Laxmi’s spirit wins her a partner for life |date=8 Jan 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309190754/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stopacidattacks/acid-attack-survivor-laxmi-s-spirit-wins-her-a-partner-for-life/article1-1170630.aspx |archivedate=9 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both decided not to get married and instead be in a live-in relationship. Alok writes in one of his blogs on Aljazeera, “Marriage in our situation can bring with it lots of pressure on us. Relatives will attend the wedding for the curiosity value rather than any real concern for our happiness.” He says, “I am not going to follow the norms that the society approves of. We will prove that our love does not need a name. Our love is about understanding and support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/how-love-got-better-india-acid-attack-201412464948664688.htmlfilename=hub140511HOW.asp |title=How love got the better of India acid attack |date=24 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'We have decided to live together until we die. But we are challenging the society by not getting married. We don’t want people to come to our wedding and comment on my looks. The looks of a bride are most important for people. So we decided not to have any ceremony' says Laxmi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20794186,00.html |title=Indian Acid Attack Survivor Finds Love – and a Job as a TV News Anchor |date=6 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their families have accepted the relationship and also their decision not to have a ceremonial wedlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stopacidattacks/acid-attack-survivor-laxmi-s-spirit-wins-her-a-partner-for-life/article1-1170630.aspx |title=Acid attack survivor Laxmi’s spirit wins her a partner for life |date=8 Jan 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309190754/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stopacidattacks/acid-attack-survivor-laxmi-s-spirit-wins-her-a-partner-for-life/article1-1170630.aspx |archivedate=9 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They now have a daughter named Pihu.

==Internet Censorship==
Alok Dixit along with his friend [[Aseem Trivedi]] and Arpit Gupta and Chirag Joshi started [[Save Your Voice]], which soon became a public movement in [[India]]. His campaigning against the government and intermediaries has gained international media attention. A debate on the issue of [[internet censorship]] has been started after the creative protests of [[Save Your Voice]]. Langada March was a big success of his campaigns in the initial days. Sibal’s Day Campaign and Freedom in the Cage involved young bloggers, writers, journalists and students to its campaign.

While reporting on the Sibal’s Day campaign, a reporter writes in [[Wall Street Journal]], " Although Save Your Voice is relatively small; it is gaining popularity on social media." [[The Hindu]] observes Freedom in the cage as the idea which portrays that artistes inside a cage playing the guitar or painting a canvas was equal to the government's IT rules that have "caged" the freedom of the people granted by the Constitution of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/article3345069.ece |title=Artistes protest government control over the Internet |date=23 April 2012 | location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom Fast===
With his reservations on the Intermediary Guidelines of the Information Technology Act, 2011 of [[India]], Alok Dixit along with his colleague [[Aseem Trivedi]] started a hunger strike at [[Jantar Mantar]] to support the annulment motion in [[Rajya Sabha]]. Foreign Policy considers this fast as the ‘most colorful highlights’ from the internet freedom movements in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/06/06/the_war_for_india_s_internet |title=The War for India's Internet |date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former CNN journalist and co-founder of Global Voices Online, [[Rebecca MacKinnon]] writes, "A lively national Internet freedom movement has grown rapidly across India since the beginning of this year. The most colorful highlight so far was a seven-day Gandhian hunger strike, otherwise known as a "freedom fast," held in early May on a New Delhi sidewalk by political cartoonist Aseem Trivedi and activist-journalist Alok Dixit." [[The Hindu]] quotes Alok on the fourth day of the Hunger strike, "The empowerment that social media provides has begun to be seen as threatening. This is an attempt to clamp down on an individual’s right to dissent and his freedom of expression. Alok and his friend ended their Anshan after their health deteriorated and Police forcefully admitted them to the [[Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital]] in New Delhi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3390327.ece |title=For the sake of free speech |date=8 May 2012 | location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |first=Sujatha |last=Subramanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]] criticized Indian Government in their press release saying, “Two of the movement’s campaigners, the cartoonist Aseem Trivedi and the citizen journalist Alok Dixit, were forced today to end a hunger strike they began on 2 May. Their health had deteriorated considerably and they were hospitalized.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/two-cyber-activists-end-fast-but-12-05-2012,42614.html |title=TWO CYBER-ACTIVISTS END FAST BUT CAMPAIGN AGAINST IT RULES GATHERS PACE |date=12 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912050029/http://en.rsf.org/two-cyber-activists-end-fast-but-12-05-2012%2C42614.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupy India===
Masked members of [[Save Your Voice]] held a protest at [[Jantar Mantar]] in [[New Delhi]] against Indian government's attempts to restrict freedom on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/technology/anonymous-to-hit-road-for-web-freedom-protest_53387.html |title='Anonymous' to hit road for Web freedom protest |date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest in India was spearheaded by '[[Save Your Voice]]' and '[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]' at various historic monuments in 16 cities, of India. Alok took active part in the networking between the International hacking group and Indian members of [[Save Your Voice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/anonymous-to-hit-road-for-web-freedom-protest/1009545.html |title='Anonymous' to hit road for Web freedom protest |date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest has resulted in access being denied to a host of websites that carry illegal copies of films and albums among other legal content, including isohunt.com and pastebin.com. The website of one of the [[Save Your Voice]] members, [[Aseem Trivedi]], was also blocked by BigRock and against which the members protested and campaigned throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/nation/the-world-wild-web |title=India: Hacking group protests against censorship |date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The government is bringing censorship through the back door and we will oppose it," says Alok in one of his interviews with The Asian Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianage.com/india/anonymous-hackers-protest-over-india-internet-laws-374 |title=‘Anonymous’ hackers protest over India Internet laws |date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To register their protest, campaigners have also hacked the website of state-run telecom provider MTNL and pasted the logo of the [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] group, the mask of 17th century British revolutionary Guy Fawkes, on mtnl.net.in. MTNL's corporate website could not be accessed for over four hours, following the attack, but its individual city-specific websites (for Delhi and Mumbai)remained unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/north/anonymous-hackers-protest-indian-internet-laws-928 |title='Anonymous' hackers to protest Indian Internet laws |date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest of cartoonist Aseem Trivedi===
Police in Maharashtra state arrested Aseem Trivedi, a political cartoonist and the co-founder of [[Save Your Voice]] campaign, on Saturday, 9 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3878239.ece |title=‘Says complainant: Trivedi’s cartoons insult Constitution |date=10 Sep 2012 | location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He faced charges of [[sedition]], violating Internet security laws, and insulting national honor for publishing cartoons mocking national symbols and criticizing corruption on his website, [[Cartoons Against Corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19540565 |title=India cartoonist Aseem Trivedi's arrest sparks outrage |date=10 Sep 2012 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Trivedi’s arrest, Alok run a nationwide campaign against the arrest of the cartoonist under the banner of [[Save Your Voice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpj.org/2012/09/indian-cartoonist-jailed-for-images-criticizing-go.php |title=Indian cartoonist jailed for images criticizing government |date=10 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign got huge public support from civil society groups and artist communities across borders. [[Mahesh Bhatt]], a prominent Bollywood figure and film director, joined the press conference at Mumbai Press Club with activist Alok Dixit and offered every possible support in Trivedi’s case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timescontent.com/syndication-photos/reprint/news/287027/mahesh-bhat-producer-bollywood-alok.html |title=Mahesh Bhat |date=12 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alok has also mediated between the Home Minister [[RR Patil]] and cartoonist [[Aseem Trivedi]] when cartoonist refused to take bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-12/india/33788194_1_sedition-charge-sedition-case-section-124a |title=Cartoonist gets bail, sedition rap may be dropped |date=12 Sep 2012 | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixit is now working closely with the prominent activists like [[Binayak Sen]], [[Arvind Kejriwal]], [[Arundhati Roy]] and [[Aseem Trivedi]] to repeal the Sedition Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3885665.ece |title= Aseem Trivedi accepts bail, to be released today |date=11 Sep 2012 | location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunger Strike against Sec 66 A of the IT Act===
After repeated misuse of sec 66 A of the IT Act Alok Dixit with his colleague from [[Save Your Voice]], [[Aseem Trivedi]] decided to sit on an indefinite hunger (Anshan) strike against this draconian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24online.com/aseem-trivedi-to-sit-on-indefinite-hunger-strike-from-today_LatestNews24_7019.aspx |title='Aseem Trivedi to sit on indefinite hunger strike from today |date=8 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This got a bigger public attention when activist turned politician [[Arvind Kejriwal]] joined this campaign and promised to make it a nationwide agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Cartoonist-Aseem-Trivedi-ends-eight-day-fast/Article1-973119.aspx |title='Cartoonist Aseem Trivedi ends eight-day fast |date=15 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his colleague Trivedi ended the fast after Kejriwal requested him not to waste his life and rather work towards ‘uprooting the UPA government’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/121215/news-current-affairs/article/kejriwal-requests-cartoonist-aseem-trivedi-ends-eight-day-fast |title='Kejriwal requests, cartoonist Aseem Trivedi ends eight-day fast |date=8 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support the hunger strike, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] hacked the [[Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited]] (BSNL) website.  BSNL home page showed an image of cartoonist Trivedi with text that read "Hacked by Anonymous India. Support Aseem trivedi (cartoonist) and Alok Dixit on the hunger strike.

Also known as "Awn Network" ({{lang-ar|شبكة عون}}), many people in Gaza prefer to call it  [[Legal Clinic]]s ({{lang-ar|العيادة القانونية}}), it was established by [[UNDP]]/PAPP &lt;ref&gt;UNDP Programme of Assistance to Palestinian People

==The Network==
[[File:Agreement Signing Ceremony.JPG|thumb|Agreement Signing Ceremony between UNDP Palestine ([[Ibrahim Abu-shammalah]] left) and Bar Associations ([[Salama Bseiso]] right), Gaza City April 25, 2013.]]

The members of Awn Network are; the {{ill|Palestinian Bar Association|ar|شبكة عون للوصول للعدالة في قطاع غزة}}, [[human rights|human right]] organizations, community-based organizations and academic institutions, the permanent secretariat of the Awn Network is within the Palestinian Bar Association. In 2012 network members provided legal aid services (awareness, consultation and representation) to more than 23,000 people, of whom 72% were women.
Awn Net has invested heavily in coordination and cooperation within the 20 members of the network by supporting dialogue meetings (including the Legal Task Force), referral mechanisms, the case management system and the legal aid database, while continuing to provide capacity development support to individual network members and working to ensure sustainability of the network.
Awn Network has provided legal services to mainly poor and vulnerable people, to strengthen their access to [[justice]] and solve their legal problems at the lowest and simplest level possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsdl.org.ps/site/en/?p=48|title=The National Society for Democracy and Law - The idea of the causes and background of the work of Legal Aid Scheme|website=www.nsdl.org.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal services provided==

Legal services start with legal [[information]] and [[education]], giving people knowledge that they have rights under the law and how to exercise them. Such knowledge and confidence can help in solving legal problems without recourse to the courts, a cost-effective and empowering strategy. Where legal remedies are available, this can be the cheapest and simplest form of legal aid, and the one where the greatest resources should be applied.
Legal advice (explaining what the law means and how to exercise it in relation to a concrete problem) is often less costly than providing assistance – understood as helping a person to take legal steps to protect their rights.
Free judicial representation by Awn Network’s legal aid lawyers is only limited to poor individuals who can’t afford paying courts fees or lawyers’ costs.

The community legal aid clinics are based at civil society organizations and aims at providing free of charge legal services to needy people and enhancing access to justice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18970">The '''Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty''' (BJC) is an education and advocacy association in the [[United States]] with a number of [[Baptist]] denominations. It states that it seeks to promote [[freedom of religion|religious liberty]] for all and to uphold the principle of [[Separation of church and state|church-state separation]].  It has, for example, joined with other religious organizations in opposing government-sponsored displays of the [[Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=43483&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission, issues, and advocacy==
===Mission===

The BJC defines itself in the following terms: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mission of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty is to defend and extend God-given religious liberty for all, furthering the Baptist heritage that champions the principle that religion must be freely exercised, neither advanced nor inhibited by government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjconline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=136 Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The BJC strives to avoid language of speaking "for" Baptists or "representing" Baptists.  It is the firm belief of BJC staffers that, in the words of a former Executive Director of the organization, "You don't speak ''for'' Baptists.  You only speak ''to'' Baptists."&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, James M. "Religious Freedom Award Response," ''Christian Ethics Today: Journal of Christian Ethics'', Issue 24, Vol. 5, No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues===

The BJC restricts its activities to a small number of issues relating to religious liberty and the separation of church and state: church electioneering, civil religion, free exercise, government funding, political discourse, public prayer, and religious displays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjconline.org/issues/index.htm Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005020118/http://www.bjconline.org/issues/index.htm |date=October 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On all of these issues, the organization supports a balanced approach that broadly interprets both the free exercise and no establishment clauses of the First Amendment.

===Advocacy===

To promote its positions on these issues, the organization uses the strategies of education, legislation, and litigation.  They publish a wide array of materials relating to church-state separation, from self-published historical pamphlets to significant coalition statements.

One of the most effective educating tools in recent years was "Religion in the Public Schools: A Joint Statement of Current Law."  Drafted and endorsed by a number of leading organizations spanning the political spectrum, from the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] and the [[Christian Legal Society]] to the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[National Council of Churches]], the document was a resource for parents, students, teachers, and administrators throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjconline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=98&amp;Itemid=109 Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, this document was later condensed and mailed to schools across the country by President [[Bill Clinton]] because of its accuracy and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/Speeches/08-1995/religion.html Archived: Secretary's Statement on Religious Expression&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403072158/http://www.ed.gov/Speeches/08-1995/religion.html |date=April 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Baptist Joint Committee was a member of the drafting committee for this document.

In addition to education, the Baptist Joint Committee participates in legislative activities geared towards advocating for the passage or defeat of various bills within the [[U.S. Congress]].  Most of these activities revolve around speaking directly to members of Congress concerning legislation, but occasionally the general counsel or executive director will be called upon to testify before Congress.  Brent Walker, the current Executive Director, has testified before Congress on a number of occasions, most notably being on October 25, 1995, on the issue of the Religious Equality Amendment.  Speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Walker said, "The best government can do is to get out of religion's way; the worst it can do is to get behind and push.  The present constitutional language requires the former; the proposed amendments would allow the latter.  Persons of faith who treasure religious liberty don't need or want an amendment."&lt;ref&gt;"Testimony of J. Brent Walker before the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate." ''Senate Committee on the Judiciary: Hearings - 104th Congress." October 25, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant part of the BJC's work to protect religious liberty has been its participation in religious liberty cases that are considered by various courts, particularly in the Supreme Court. The BJC engages in litigation by filing "amicus curiae" briefs, a term that means "friend of the court." Those briefs are filed to assist the court by providing support for specific points at issue in the dispute. Throughout the BJC's history, the organization has filed more than 120 legal briefs in court cases.&lt;ref&gt;Report from the Capital: 75th Anniversary Edition, September 2011, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and organization==
Serving 15 Baptist bodies, the BJC is a non-profit 501(c)(3) education and advocacy organization that has worked for more than 75 years promoting religious liberty for all and upholding the principle of church-state separation.  It is supported by the following Baptist organizations:

*[[Alliance of Baptists]]
*[[American Baptist Churches USA]]
*[[Baptist General Association of Virginia]]
*[[Baptist General Conference]]
*[[Baptist General Convention of Missouri]]
*[[Baptist General Convention of Texas]]
*[[Cooperative Baptist Fellowship]]
*[[Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of North Carolina]]
*[[National Baptist Convention of America]]
*[[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]]
*[[National Missionary Baptist Convention of America]]
*[[North American Baptist Conference]]
*[[Progressive National Baptist Convention]]
*[[Religious Liberty Council]]
*[[Seventh Day Baptists|Seventh Day Baptist General Conference]]

In addition to receiving support from Baptist organizations, the BJC also receives support from individuals who identify with the cause of religious liberty and church-state separation.

==History==
===Early committees on public relations&lt;ref&gt;Stan L. Hastey's ''A History of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, 1946-1971'', a doctoral thesis presented to the faculty of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in October 1973, has been used as a central source for all information until 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;===

Baptist involvement in public affairs began formally on Saturday, May 16, 1936, when the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (SBC) created the Committee on Public Relations.  The committee had the following charge:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... as situations arise, in which agencies of this Convention are compelled to confer, to negotiate, to demand just rights that are being threatened or to have other inescapable dealings with the American or other Governments, this Committee shall function, when so requested by any existing board or agency of this body, as the representative of Southern Baptists and shall report in detail to the Southern Baptist Convention the results of such conferences and negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''Annual of the Southern Baptist Convention'', 1936, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "first incarnation" of the Baptist Joint Committee (BJC) was soon joined by a similar body chartered by the [[Northern Baptist Convention]] (NBC) on May 25, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;''Annual of the Northern Baptist Convention'', 1937, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, the Conventions began discussing the possibility of a joint venture, and both committees often worked jointly on issues of mutual concern.  The NBC in 1937 and 1939 summarily passed resolutions promoting the combination of the committees,&lt;ref&gt;''NBC Annual'', 1937, p. 278; ''NBC Annual'', 1939, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  but the SBC resisted formal operational cooperation until 1941, when a resolution was finally passed that supported organizational merger.&lt;ref&gt;''SBC Annual, 1941, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the adoption of a precisely similar resolution from the NBC's Committee on Public Relations,&lt;ref&gt;''NBC Annual'', 1941, pp. 108-110&lt;/ref&gt; the Joint Conference Committee on Public Relations was officially created.

The resolutions of both the SBC and the NBC included provisions for joint endeavor with the Committee on Public Relations of the [[National Baptist Convention, USA]] and the [[National Baptist Convention of America]], and the reports to the SBC and NBC indicate that these two major black Baptist conventions were included in the cooperation surrounding the combination.&lt;ref&gt;''SBC Annual'', 1944, p. 136; ''NBC Annual'', 1944, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in 1946===

In 1946 the committee established offices in Washington, D.C., and became the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs.  Joseph Martin Dawson was elected the organization's first full-time Executive Director, a position he held until his retirement at age seventy-five on October 13, 1953.

Dawson's leadership led to a number of significant changes within the organization.  One of the first was the introduction of the ''Report from the Capital'', a periodical containing news and opinions of interest to politically minded Baptists.  The first issue appeared in October, 1946, and the Baptist Joint Committee has published the ''Report'' ever since as a primary source for its opinions and views on church-state issues.

In addition to publishing the ''Report'', the organization gained office space through the generous support of the [[Baptist World Alliance]] and the [[District of Columbia Baptist Association]].  Dawson also expanded the organization's base of support to include the [[Seventh Day Baptist General Conference|Seventh Day Baptists]], and the [[Baptist General Conference|North American Baptist General Conference]].  Overtures were made to the various organizations of [[General Baptists]], although such efforts were largely unsuccessful.

One of the final changes wrought by Dawson's tenure was the preparation of the BJC's first constitution.  This constitution was one of the factors which led to the narrowing focus of the Baptist Joint Committee on issues related primarily to church-state separation.  The constitution stated:

{{quote|The [Baptist Joint Committee] shall be empowered to enunciate, defend, and extend the historic, traditional Baptist principle of religious freedom with particular application to the separation of church and state as embodied in the Constitution of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Joint Conference Committee on Public Relations," 1949, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Southern Baptist controversy===

In 1979, a shift occurred when the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] elected [[Adrian Rogers]] to the convention presidency.

The relationship with the Convention got rockier throughout the 1980s.  Prior to these years, resolutions had passed the annual meetings regularly expressing near-unanimous support to the BJC and its stands.&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher, Dorothy C. ''A History and Analysis of the Role of the Baptist Joint Committee, 1972-Present''.  Library Printing Service: Waco TX, 1993, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;  But as the eighties brought charges of liberalism among the BJC staff on a variety of issues, James Dunn, who assumed his duties as Executive Director in 1980 at the beginning of the controversy, responded:

{{quote|It's ... disingenuous to lament the "left leaning" of the Baptist Joint Committee regarding issues on which we do not take a stand or lean at all ... The Baptist Joint Committee is chugging straight ahead on the course set in the 1980s by the members and staff of the BJCPA.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, James M. "Reflections," ''Report from the Capital'' Vol. 44 (January 1989): p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the controversy, significant leadership among the conservative faction were attacking Dunn repeatedly.  an example comes from Paige Patterson: "[Dunn] hobnobs with the liberal establishment in the house and Senate ... That doesn't make us very happy either."&lt;ref&gt;Beth Spring.  "James Dunn Is the Focus of a Southern Baptist Controversy," ''Christianity Today'' Vol. 28 (March 16, 1984): p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  In that same year, the convention defeated a motion to cut off funding for the BJC at their Kansas City meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Shleicher 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, relations seemed to improve when a special study committee formed by the Executive Committee to study a motion to cut off funding recommended maintaining ties with the BJC.  An exhaustive report by Dr. [[Hugh Wamble]] of [[Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]] also delivered a positive recommendation, and the Convention allocated a record budget donation to the BJC in that year.  In return, the SBC share of board members in the BJC was increased to 18 from 15, giving them one-third of the seats on the Committee.  These members were authorized to function as a separate "Public Affairs Committee" (PAC), and proceeded to pass a number of resolutions on matters they knew could not be supported by the BJC, such as the [[Robert Bork|Bork]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher 179-183&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAC then requested to conduct a two-day evaluation of the staff.  Instead, the BJC executive committee, composed of other denominational representatives and the PAC, voted to conduct a thorough evaluation that would serve the interests of all represented denominations, the PAC requested a number of documents related to staff expenses and compensation.  The BJC complied on a number of requests, but refused to provide access to confidential staff correspondence and individual expense accounts.  After these meetings and losing these critical votes, the PAC voted separately to cut ties with the BJC.&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the PAC protested that they merely were trying to exercise accountability, C.J. Malloy Jr., of the [[Progressive National Baptist Convention]], had this to say about the PAC effort:

{{quote|For a new group of personalities to come in and vote against every proposal was unfortunate.  If they were seeking to get information, they went about it in a rather intimidating way.  I feel it was more a personal attack [on the staff] than seeking to get information.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Knox and Greg Warner, "Reactions, Interpretations of BJC Members Differ," ''Report from the Capital'' Vol. 42 (November/December 1987): p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1988, at the fall meeting of the SBC Executive Committee, the group recommended in a 42 to 27 vote that a competing Religious Liberty Commission be established in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher 186&lt;/ref&gt;  James Dunn, who was not invited to the hearing, called the process "shabby, unfair, unethical, and improper,"  He asserted that the BJC would not compromise their principles for what he termed "a mess of politically tainted pottage."&lt;ref&gt;Julian H. Pentecost, "A Disturbing Meeting of the SBC executive Committee," ''Religious Herald'' Vol. 162 (March 9, 1989): p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a motion failed by 6,034 to 5,198 to give $350,000 of the BJC's funding to the [[Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary]].  At the same meeting, there was a tense exchange between James Dunn and the PAC chairman, Samuel T. Currin.  Currin charged the BJC as soliciting $100,000 to $200,000 in funding outside their constitution.  Dunn replied: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are those whose mentality is so conspiratorial, so dark and manipulatively political that they cannot imagine the groundswell of support that has come to the Baptist Joint Committee simply because our funding was cut in San Antonio last year ... They didn't ask if they could, if they should, if we would take it.  But I am just like anybody who has an agency responsibility—I haven't sent a single check back.  But I have not been soliciting funds.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Druin, "Dunn Answers Questions on BJCPA Funds," ''Baptist Standard'' Vol. 101 (MJuly 19, 1989): p. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same space, Dunn indicated that the Committee could be provided with a list of their new contributors arranged by category, but they would not name individual donors to prevent them from being added to the SBC leadership's "hit list.

In 1990, the SBC reduced the BJC budget to $50,000, an 87% decrease over its previous levels of funding.&lt;ref&gt;"Executive Committee Cuts BJCPA--CLC Receives Religious Liberty Assignment and $391,796," ''Southern Baptist Public Affairs'' (Spring 1990): p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later, at the 1991 annual meeting, all funding to the BJC was abolished in an amendment from Fred Minix of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher 194&lt;/ref&gt;

After the SBC withdrew its financial support, the Baptist Joint Committee received donations directly from several Southern Baptist state conventions, local churches, and individuals. The agency's other supporting bodies also helped make up the financial difference.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Pam. "On Guard for Religious Liberty: Six Decades of the Baptist Joint Committee." Macon: Smyth and Helwys Publishing, 1996. Page 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 name change===

In 2005, the BJC name was changed to the "Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty" to more accurately reflect their singular focus on religious liberty issues.

===75th Anniversary===

The Baptist Joint Committee celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2011 and released a special edition of ''Report from the Capital'' highlighting the history of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrate 75 Years of the BJC!|url=http://bjconline.org/celebrate-75-years-of-bjc/|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bile Beans''' was a [[laxative]] and [[herbal tonic|tonic]] first marketed in the 1890s.{{r|Leeds}}{{sfnp|Spiegl|1996|p=22|ps=none}} The product supposedly contained substances extracted from a hitherto unknown vegetable source by a fictitious chemist known as Charles Forde.{{r|BMJ1906}} In the early years Bile Beans were marketed as "Charles Forde's Bile Beans for Biliousness", and sales relied heavily on newspaper advertisements. Among other cure-all claims, Bile Beans promised to "disperse unwanted fat" and "purify and enrich the blood".{{r|Blog}}

Although the manufacturer claimed that the formula for Bile Beans was based on a vegetable source known only to [[Aboriginal Australians]], its actual ingredients, which included [[Rhamnus purshiana|cascara]], [[rhubarb]], [[liquorice]] and [[menthol]], were commonly found in pharmacies of the period. A court case initiated in Scotland in 1905 found that the Bile Bean Manufacturing Company's business was based on a fraud and conducted fraudulently, but Bile Beans continued to be sold until the 1980s nevertheless.

==Formulation and manufacture==
Charles Edward Fulford (1870–1906) and Ernest Albert Gilbert (1875–1905) first sold Bile Beans in Australia in late 1897, marketed as "Gould's Bile Beans".{{r|Sunday Times}} Fulford was a Canadian who had travelled to Australia to sell [[Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People]] for his uncle, [[George Taylor Fulford]].{{r|Loeb}}{{r|Yorkshire Post}}

Fulford and Gilbert established the Bile Bean Manufacturing Company in Leeds, England, in 1899. It was claimed that the formula for Bile Beans was created by an Australian scientist Charles Forde in 1898, based on research he had conducted on a vegetable source known only to [[Aboriginal Australians]].  In reality, Charles Forde did not exist; the name was used as an alias for Charles Fulford, who had no scientific training. The beans were initially manufactured in America by Parke Davis &amp; Co. of [[Detroit]], until the Bile Bean Manufacturing Company set up a production facility in [[Leeds]], England,{{r|Corley}} trading under the name of C. E. Fulford Limited, which also sold other [[patent medicine]]s, including the [[Zam-Buk]] ointment,{{efn|Zam-Buk was manufactured by the Zam-Buk Company of Leeds, another of Charles Fulford's enterprises.{{r|Rose&amp;Co}}}} Pep pastilles and later [[Vitapointe]] hair conditioner.{{r|Leeds}}{{efn|The principle production plant moved to [[Blyth, Northumberland]] in 1963.{{r|Chemist}}}}

The product sold by Fulford and Gilbert was not the first patent medicine marketed as "Bile Beans".  A different type of Bile Beans was invented by James F. Smith,  a chemist from [[Texarkana, Texas]], in the 1870s or 1880s, and J.F. Smith &amp; Co traded out of St Louis, Mo. The firm also produced a product called "Smith's Blood Beans", claimed to "purify the blood" and was "put up in packages similar to Bile Beans" with "sugar coating blood red in color", and a "wrapper [...] lithographed in red ink instead of black".{{r|Smith}}  In 1902 the Bile Bean Manufacturing Company acquired the trade mark of "J. F. Smith's Bile Beans" in the UK, which had been registered in 1887.{{r|Appeal}}

According to a 1903 report published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', the chief ingredients of Bile Beans were [[Rhamnus purshiana|cascara]], [[rhubarb]], [[liquorice]] and [[menthol]], packaged as a gelatine-coated pill,{{r|BMJ1903}} all ingredients commonly found in pharmacies of the period.{{r|BMJ1905}}  It was not until 1941 that English companies were legally required to disclose the active ingredients in their non-prescription drugs.{{r|Loeb2001}}  By the 1940s, the ingredients included various [[purgative]]s, [[cholagogue]]s, and [[carminative]]s, including [[aloin]] (aloe), [[Podophyllum]], [[Rhamnus purshiana|cascara]], [[Convolvulus scammonia|scammony]], [[jalap]], [[Citrullus colocynthis|colocynth]], [[Veronicastrum virginicum|leptandrin]], [[soap|saponis]] (soap), [[cardamom]], [[capsicum]], [[ginger]], [[peppermint oil]], and [[gentian]], mixed with [[liquorice]], powdered gum ([[Gum arabic|acacia]] or [[tragacanth]]) and glucose, coated with black charcoal or carbon powder to form ovoid pills.{{r|Rowe}}

==Findings of fraud==
In 1905 the Bile Beans Manufacturing Company initiated a [[passing off]] court case in Scotland against an Edinburgh chemist, George Graham Davidson, who sold "Davidson's Bile Beans", seeking to prevent him from selling any product using the name "bile beans" except that supplied by the company. The presiding judge, [[Andrew Jameson, Lord Ardwall|Lord Ardwall]], rejected the case, as he considered that the plaintiff's business was "founded on, and conducted by fraud", there being no secret ingredient and no connection with any plant found in Australia.{{r|BMJ1905}}{{r|Ardwall}}  The [[Court of Session]] dismissed an appeal, because it considered that the Bile Bean Manufacturing Company had deliberately defrauded the public by making false factual statements about the product, concluding that it was not entitled to any legal protection against the use of the term "bile beans".{{r|Appeal}}

==Marketing strategy==
[[File:Advert; Medically approved Bile Beans Wellcome L0044201.jpg|upright|thumb|right]]
After setting up in England in 1899 the company spent about £60,000 a year in advertising its products,{{r|Corley}} and according to Birmingham University Professor of Medicine Robert Saundby,{{r|Saundby}} "created a demand by flooding the country with advertisements, placards, pamphlets and imaginary pictures."{{sfnp|Saundby|1907|p=5|ps=none}} Early newspaper promotions usually took the form of testimonials proclaiming "miraculous life changing cures".{{r|Bradford}} Often illustrated, they included letters from customers cured of lost appetites, severe headaches, indigestion and biliousness.{{r|Mercury}} A half-page advertisement in the ''Sheffield Evening Telegraph'' on 12 October 1900 featured a lady who had been cured by Bile Beans after ten doctors had failed to successfully treat her condition; copies of signed affidavits from neighbours were also printed.{{r|Sheffield}} The level of advertising was not curtailed despite the adverse comments made by the judges in the court ruling.{{r|BMJ1909}}

[[File:BileBeanMarch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Frontispiece to the sheet music for the "Bile Bean March"]]
Among the more unusual marketing promotions undertaken by the Bile Beans Manufacturing Company was the "Bile Bean March", composed by Charles Fulford's older brother [[Frank Harris Fulford]] and first published in 1898.{{r|Loeb}}{{r|UMA}} The music was described as "a bold, spirited composition" in a 1902 newspaper report.{{r|Dundee}} Readers could apply to receive a free copy of the sheet music by sending their address details to the company.{{r|Leeds Times}} Another marketing ploy was the production of a cookery book,{{r|UMA}} which was also made widely available free of charge.{{r|Bradford}} A ''Bile Bean Puzzle Book'' was published during the early 1930s and also freely distributed.{{r|Folkestone}} By that time advertising for Bile Beans had become increasingly targeted at women, promising them health, bright eyes and a slim figure if taken regularly.{{r|Bradford}}

When [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] started [[longwave]] [[commercial radio]] broadcasts in English in 1933, its first advertisers were Fulford's Bile Beans and [[Zam-Buk]].{{sfnp|Watson|Hill|2012|p=47|ps=none}}

During the 1940s newspaper advertising was supplemented by a poster campaign.{{r|UMA}} Aimed at maintaining high levels of purchasing by women, the posters featured young ladies dressed to participate in various activities, including horse riding, swimming and hiking;{{r|UMA}} the designs were the work of [[S. H. Benson]],{{r|Museum}} a London advertising agency whose clients included [[Bovril]] and [[Guinness]].{{r|Benson}} ''The Bulletin of the North Carolina State Board of Health'' hypothesised in 1916–17 that many provincial newspapers relied heavily on the revenues generated by advertisements from manufacturers of suspect remedies, and it speculated that editorial control had been applied to restrict extensive reporting of the Bile Beans court case.{{r|Bulletin}} Similar suspicions had been raised almost ten years earlier by medical director Eric Pritchard{{r|BMJ1943}} who went on to highlight a clause showing newspaper advertising contracts could be revoked if the publication carried any material considered "detrimental to the Company's interest".{{sfnp|Pritchard|1908|p=175|ps=none}}
{{-}}

==Later history==
Gilbert died in 1905 and Charles Fulford the following year in Australia, aged 36, after which the business was run by Charles's older brother, Frank Harris Fulford.{{r|Loeb}}{{r|UMA}} Charles's estate was valued at £1.3 million,{{r|Will}} around £{{Inflation|UK|1300000|1906|fmt=c}} today.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} He made several bequests which included the gift of twenty per cent of the company shares to the British charity [[Barnardo's]], although this conditional donation sparked consternation.{{r|Will}} The clauses stipulated the charity must set up a limited company that would only sell Bile Beans and patent medicines manufactured by Fulford's businesses; additionally, Barnardo's were forbidden to sell any of the shares.{{r|BMJ1906a}} A writer in the British Medical Journal suggested the bequest presented the charity with an ethical dilemma as it enjoyed the patronage from both medical and religious professions so to trade in products described by a judge as fraudulent would be perpetuating the deception.{{r|BMJ1906a}} Initially Barnardo's refused the gift but eventually accepted an unconditional lump sum.{{sfnp|Pritchard|1908|pp=172–173|ps=none}}

Despite the Bile Beans Manufacturing Company having lost the Scottish court case in 1906, Bile Beans remained popular through the 1930s, and continued to be sold until the 1980s.{{sfnp|Spiegl|1996|p=22|ps=none}} The business was so successful that Frank Fulford was able to purchase [[Headingley Castle]] in Leeds in 1909, and to donate artworks to the museum at [[Temple Newsam]].{{r|Bradford}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">The [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) has [[Islam]] as its [[State religion|official religion]], and the federation regards [[blasphemy]] as a very serious matter. The UAE uses the school system as well as [[censorship]] and [[Freedom of the press|control of the press and the broadcast media]] to prevent blasphemy. When blasphemy occurs, the Emirates have two court systems to mete out punishment.

== The federation ==
Citizens make up twenty percent of the Emirates' population. Of the citizens, eighty-five percent are [[Sunni]]; the remainder are [[Shia]]. The Constitution provides for freedom of religion subject to established customs.&lt;ref name = "USSD2008"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108495.htm
  | accessdate = 20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school system==
The Emirates make the study of Islam compulsory in government schools and compulsory for Muslim students in private schools. Children whose passports identify them as Muslim (though their parents may be [[Bahai]] or [[Druze]]) must study Islam. Private schools must not teach subjects or use textbooks that offend Islam, defame any religion, or contravene the country's moral sensibilities.&lt;ref name = "USSD2008"/&gt;

==The courts==
The Emirates have a system of [[Sharia]] courts and a system of [[secularism|secular]] courts. Both systems handle criminal and civil cases. The secular courts are usually part of the federal system and are answerable to the Federal Supreme Court in [[Abu Dhabi]]. The Sharia courts are administered by each emirate, but they are answerable to the Federal Supreme Court. The court systems in the emirates of [[Dubai]] and [[Ras al Khaimah]] are independent of the federal system, but they apply the Civil Procedure Code. Each court system has a multilevel appeals process, and verdicts in all capital cases are appealable to the President. The nature of a case determines which court system hears it, but most cases fall under the jurisdiction of the secular courts. Due-process rights are uniform under both Sharia and civil court procedure. The courts operate on a presumption of innocence. The Federal Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that Sharia punishments may not be imposed on non-Muslims.&lt;ref name = "USSD2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US1993"&gt;{{cite web

==Human rights==
All English and Arabic newspapers published in the UAE receive government subsidies. Foreign and domestic publications are subject to censorship.&lt;ref name = "US1993"/&gt;  The Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information and Culture reviews all imported newspapers, periodicals, books, films, and videos, and bans items considered pornographic, violent, derogatory to Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly critical of friendly countries, or critical of the Government or the ruling family.&lt;ref name = "US1993"/&gt; Religious books and audio/video tapes containing blasphemy are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2012, a French businessman was arrested for defacing the Quran by spitting on it before he assaulted and threatened to kill a new British Muslim convert after she refused to marry him. The Frenchman spat on the Quran and insulted Islam and all its prophets. He also threw on the floor a separate book that contained collections of [[Hadith]]. He was arrested and jailed for two years.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/businessman-accused-of-defacing-quran-insulting-islam-1.1080653&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canada (Minister of Justice) v Borowski''''', [1981] 2 S.C.R. 575 is a landmark [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the standard for allowing public interests to gain standing to challenge a law. The Court developed what is known as the '''Borowski test''' for public interest standing.

==Background==
[[Joseph Borowski]] was a prominent [[pro-life]] activist in Saskatchewan who wanted to challenge the abortion provisions under section 287 of the Criminal Code as violations to right to life in the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]].

In a seven to two decision the Court found that Borowski had standing to challenge the law.

==Reasons of the court==
Justice Martland, wrote the decision for the majority. Martland's reasoning was largely based on the previous decision of ''[[Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada]]'', [1975] 1 S.C.R. 138. He stated that a plaintiff seeking a declaration to invalidate a law must show that they are directly affected by it, or have a genuine interest as a citizen and there be no reasonable and effective alternative means to challenge the law.

Borowski was found to meet this requirement as it would be difficult to bring such an issue to court without having an interest group make a challenge.

==Commentary==
The test was later re-articulated more narrowly in the decision of ''[[Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)]]'', [1992] 1 S.C.R. 236.

'''Conscience clauses''' are legal [[clause]]s attached to laws in some parts of the [[United States]] and other countries which permit [[pharmacist]]s, [[physician]]s, and/or other providers of [[health care]] not to provide certain medical services for reasons of religion or [[conscience]]. In many cases, the clauses also permit health care providers to refuse to refer patients to unopposed providers. Those who choose not to refer or provide services may not be disciplined or discriminated against. The provision is most frequently enacted in connection with issues relating to [[reproduction]], such as [[abortion]], [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]], [[birth control|contraception]], and [[stem cell]] based treatments, but may include any phase of patient care.&lt;ref name="Mlsna"&gt;

== History ==
The earliest national conscience clause law in the United States, which was enacted immediately following the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', applied only to abortion and sterilization.  It was sponsored by Senator [[Frank Church]] of Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/j.2516.NeJaime-Siegel.2591_r4r9q2au.pdf Douglas Nejaime &amp; Reva Siegel, ''Conscience Wars: Complicity-Based Conscience Claims in Religion and Politics''], 124 [[Yale Law Journal]] 2516 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Church Amendment, passed by the Senate on a vote of 92-1, exempted private hospitals receiving federal funds under the [[Hill-Burton Act]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] from any requirement to provide abortions or sterilizations when they objected on “the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions.”  Nearly every state enacted similar legislation by the end of the decade—often with the support of legislators who otherwise supported abortion rights. [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Harry Blackmun]], the author of the [[Roe v. Wade]] [[majority opinion]], endorsed such clauses “appropriate protection” for individual physicians and denominational hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16273974|year=2005|last1=Appel|first1=J. M|title=Judicial diagnosis 'conscience' vs. Care how refusal clauses are reshaping the rights revolution|journal=Medicine and Health, Rhode Island|volume=88|issue=8|pages=279–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscience clauses have been adopted by a number of U.S. states. including [[Arkansas]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Mississippi]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[South Dakota]].  There are some recent comprehensive reviews of federal and state conscience clause laws across the United States and in select other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Thaddeus Mason Pope, Legal Briefing: Conscience Clauses and Conscientious Refusal, 21(2) Journal of Clinical Ethics 163-180 (2010), http://clinicalethics.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informed consent ===
An [[informed consent]] clause, although allowing medical professionals not to perform procedures against their conscience, does not allow professionals to give fraudulent information to deter a patient from obtaining such a procedure (such as lying about the risks involved in an abortion to deter one from obtaining one) in order to impose one's belief using deception.  These principles were reaffirmed in the [[Utah Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''Wood v. University of Utah Medical Center'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2204&amp;context=lawreview Glenn E. Roper, ''An Open Question in Utah's Open Courts Jurisprudence: The Utah Wrongful Life Act and'' Wood v. University of Utah Medical Center], 2004 BYU L. Rev. 893 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Commenting on the case, bioethicist Jacob Appel of New York University wrote that "if only a small number of physicians intentionally or negligently withhold information from their patients significant damage is done to the medical profession as a whole" because "pregnant women will no longer know whether to trust their doctors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15031969|year=2004|last1=Appel|first1=J. M|title=Physicians, "wrongful life" and the Constitution|journal=Medicine and Health, Rhode Island|volume=87|issue=2|pages=55–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right of Conscience Rule===
The [[Right of Conscience Rule]] was a set of protections for healthcare workers enacted by President [[George W. Bush]] on December 18, 2008, allowing healthcare workers to refuse care based on their personal beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/18/AR2008121801556.html?sub=AR|title=Rule Shields Health Workers Who Withhold Care Based on Beliefs | work=The Washington Post | first=Rob | last=Stein | date=December 19, 2008 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the rule denied federal funding to institutions that did not allow workers to refuse care that went against their beliefs.  In February 2011, President [[Barack Obama]] rescinded the Right of Conscience Rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stein|first1=Rob|title=Obama Administration Replaces Controversial 'Conscience' Regulation for Health-Care Workers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021803251.html|accessdate=10 July 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://federalregister.gov/a/2011-3993 Regulation for the Enforcement of Federal Health Care Provider Conscience Protection Laws], 76 Fed. Reg. 9968 (Feb. 23, 2011) (to be codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 88).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacists===
States have historically provided a conscience clause right allowing pharmacists to refrain from participating in abortions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/pdf/97-6/Grealis.PDF Catherine Grealis, ''Religion in the Pharmacy: A Balanced Approach to Pharmacists’ Right To Refuse To Provide Plan B''], 97 [[Georgetown Law Journal]] 1715 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2005, Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] by emergency executive order required all pharmacists to provide Plan B [[levonorgestrel]].  In September 2012, the [[Illinois Appellate Court]] found the Governor’s order violated Illinois law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3948793665091842366&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Morr-Fitz, Inc. v. Quinn''], 976 N.E.2d 1160, 364 Ill. Dec. 597 (App. Ct. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, the Pharmacy Board of the [[Washington State Department of Health]] rejected a draft rule proposed by Governor [[Christine Gregoire]] to require all pharmacies to begin carrying Plan B.&lt;ref name=pennstate&gt;[http://www.pennstatelawreview.org/articles/114%20Penn%20St.%20L.%20Rev.%20293.pdf Jason R. Mau, Stormans ''and the Pharmacists: Where Have All the Conscientious Rx Gone?''], 114 Penn St. L. Rev. 293 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor Gregoire responded by releasing a public statement warning the Board members to reconsider or they could be removed.&lt;ref name=pennstate/&gt;  In July 2006, the [[Washington State Law Against Discrimination|Washington State Human Rights Commission]] warned the Board members that they would be personally liable for illegally discriminating against women if they did not pass the Governor’s Plan B rule.&lt;ref name=pennstate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/vol123_stormans_v_selecky.pdf ''Recent cases: Ninth Circuit Rejects Strict Srutiny for Pharmacy Dispensing Requirement''], 123 Harv. L. Rev. 596 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2007, the Board approved a final rule prohibiting pharmacies from not stocking Plan B for religious reasons but allowing exemptions for “good faith” business reasons.&lt;ref name=pennstate/&gt;

When Ralph’s Thriftway, a grocery store in [[Olympia, Washington]], refused for religious reasons to carry Plan B, it was widely boycotted, leading Gregoire to cancel the grocer’s longstanding account with the [[Washington Governor's Mansion]].&lt;ref name=pennstate/&gt;  The only complaints for violating the Plan B rule were filed against the grocer.&lt;ref name=pennstate/&gt;  Half of Washington’s hospitals are Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whelan|first1=Ed|title=A Prescription for Religious Liberty|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/433406/stormans-cert-petition|accessdate=10 July 2016|work=[[National Review]]|date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grocer sued but, instead of alleging violations of the broader [[Constitution of Washington]], its attorneys at the [[Alliance Defending Freedom]] and the [[Becket Fund for Religious Liberty]] only filed under the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name=wash&gt;[https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/493/85WLR739.pdf?sequence=1 Noel E. Horton, ''Article I, Section 11: A Poor "Plan B" for Washington's Religious Pharmacists"], 85 Wash. L Rev. 739 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The case is known as ''Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman''.

On November 8, 2007, U.S. District Judge [[Ronald B. Leighton]] granted the grocer a preliminary injunction blocking the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4766384879284020369&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky''], 524 F. Supp. 2d 1245 (W.D. Wash. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pennstate/&gt;  On May 1, 2008, [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] Judges [[Thomas G. Nelson]] and [[Jay Bybee]] denied the state a stay of the injunction pending appeal, over a dissent by Judge [[A. Wallace Tashima]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2931624592913244137&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky''], 526 F.3d 406 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pennstate/&gt;  However, on July 8, 2009, Circuit Judge [[Kim McLane Wardlaw]], joined by [[Richard Clifton]] and [[N. Randy Smith]] reversed the preliminary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3829532757511494628&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 Stormans, Inc. v.

On February 22, 2012, after four years of discovery and a twelve-day bench trial, Judge Leighton issued a permanent injunction blocking the Plan B rule as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15387952290284090879&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Stormans, Inc. v.

In 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|113|S.|2625}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|114|S.|2960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Cory Booker]] introduced the “Access to Birth Control Act” bill, which would require all pharmacists in the United States to provide emergency contraception.

==Responses==
Health care providers [[pro-life|opposed to abortion]] or [[contraception]] support the clauses because they believe that disciplinary or legal action for refusing to perform services obliges providers to supply services which their moral or religious principles forbid.

[[Reproductive rights]] organizations, such as [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], oppose the provision because they maintain that pharmacists, doctors, and hospitals have a [[professional]] duty to fulfill patients' legal medical needs, regardless of their own ethical stances. Opponents see conscience clauses as an attempt to limit reproductive rights in lieu of bans struck down by [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] rulings such as ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/PPFA/refusalclauses_12-04.pdf Refusal Clauses: A Threat to Reproductive Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628035454/http://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/PPFA/refusalclauses_12-04.pdf |date=2010-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the term "conscience clause" is controversial and primarily used by those who support these provisions. Those who oppose them often prefer to use the term "refusal clause," implying that those who exercise the clauses are refusing to treat a patient.

==Catholic doctrine==
The conscience clause is widely invoked in Catholic universities, hospitals, and agencies because [[Catholicism and abortion|the Catholic Church opposes abortion]], [[Christian views on contraception#Roman Catholicism|contraceptives, sterilization]], and [[Stem cell controversy#Catholicism|embryonic stem cell treatments]]. Opponents of related [[Freedom of Choice Act|FOCA]] legislation have interpreted the possible end of the conscience clause as a demand to either "do abortions or close."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2205326 "Obama's Threat to Catholic Hospitals"] Melinda Henneberger writing in ''Slate''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archbishop Dolan]] has said, "“In effect, the president is saying we have a year to figure out how to violate our consciences."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/obama-administration-holds-to-birth-control-insurance-rule-but-gives-religious-groups-more-time-to-comply/2012/01/20/gIQAR84nDQ_story.html Obama administration gives groups more time to comply with birth control rule]. ''Washington Post''. NC Aizenman. January 20, 2012. 8:51 AM.&lt;/ref&gt; However, conscience clauses are sometimes interpreted differently and their use will often depend on the given context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300a-7 "Sterilization or Abortion"] US Code § 300a–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public health specialists{{who|date=May 2014}} have questioned whether "conscience clauses" are ethical, observing in an article on the danger to miscarrying patients created by hospital anti-abortion policies that "in some Catholic-owned hospitals, the private patient–physician relationship, patient safety, and patient comfort are compromised by religious mandates that require physicians to act contrary to the current standard of care in miscarriage management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2636458 | pmid=18703442 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.126730 | volume=98 | issue=10 | title=When there's a heartbeat: miscarriage management in Catholic-owned hospitals | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1774–8 | last1 = Freedman | first1 = LR | last2 = Landy | first2 = U | last3 = Steinauer | first3 = J| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7114">'''Creative Sector Tax Relief''' is a programme of [[tax incentive]]s implemented in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2012 which encompass new incentives aimed at supporting the animation, high-end television and video games industries, in addition to the existing relief available for [[film production]]. The new reliefs are designed to promote culturally-relevant productions in the UK, to incentivise [[investment]] into UK productions that would otherwise take place outside the UK, and to support the necessary critical mass of infrastructure and skills in the UK for both today and in the longer term.

==History==
The government announced in the March 2012 Budget that it would introduce corporation tax reliefs from April 2013 for the [[video games industries|video-games]], [[animation]] and high-end television industries, subject to State aid approval and following consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=HM Revenue and Customs|title=Budget 2012|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2012/corp-bus-tax.htm|work=Corporate and Business Taxes|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new reliefs were confirmed in Budget 2013&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/budget-2013-chancellors-statement "Budget statement 2013"] Retrieved on 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and the draft Finance Bill 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/finance_bill_2013.htm "Finance Bill 2013"] Retrieved on 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Up to this point, the creative industries had struggled to access existing [[Technology Tax Relief|technology tax relief]] because the qualifying definitions of schemes such as R&amp;D Tax Relief have fallen outside the creative sectors, even though companies in these sectors are often pioneers in new and advanced technologies.
The reliefs will bring the UK’s creative sector tax regime into line with other countries such as Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1268752355851 "Canadian Film Tax Relief"] Retrieved on 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan which already have specific tax reliefs for the creative industries.

==Overview==
Production companies in all three industries are able to claim an additional deduction worth 100 per cent of UK qualifying production expenditure (where qualifying expenditure is a maximum of 80 per cent of total production expenditure) and, if they are loss-making, they will be able to surrender such losses for a payable tax credit worth 25 per cent of UK qualifying production expenditure (ie. effectively a payable credit of a maximum 20 per cent of total production expenditure).
These reliefs are modelled on the existing film tax relief scheme, which has supported over £5 billion of investment into [[British films]] and seen a 70 per cent increase in the film production workforce since its introduction in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/creative_sector_tax_reliefs_response111212.pdf "Creative Sector Tax Relief Treasury response"] Retrieved on 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft [[Finance Bill]] 2013 legislation allowed for qualifying expenditure incurred after 1 April 2013 to be eligible for the reliefs subject to State aid approval by the [[European Commission]]. The Commission approved the animation tax relief and high-end television production tax relief to start on 1 April 2013 once the regulations come into force with the Royal Assent of the 2013 Finance Act in August 2013. Video game tax relief was given State aid approval by the EU Commission in March 2014, meaning that it came into effect from 1 April 2014.

The steady state cost, after the initial phasing-in period, of the reliefs is forecast to be approximately £120 million per annum (£55 million for video game tax relief and animation tax relief, plus £65 million for high-end television production tax relief) in terms of corporation tax revenues foregone by [[HM Treasury]]. The estimated annual administrative cost for HMRC of running all three new creative industry tax relief regimes will be approximately £500,000). They will also set up a specialist unit to facilitate claims for animation and video game relief (but not high-end tv production).

==Cultural test==
Productions must be certified by the [[Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport]] (DCMS) as culturally British in order to be eligible for relief, as per the existing Film Tax Relief.

The cultural tests for each relief were published in the draft Finance Bill 2013 .

The cultural tests will be handled by the [[British Film Institute]] on behalf of DCMS as follows:

==Other technology tax reliefs==
* Video Games Tax Relief - The Video Games Tax Relief (VGTR) was established in 2014 to help support creativity in the UK games industry. The key benefit of the tax relief is that qualifying companies can claim up to 20% of their “core expenditure” back, provided that expenditure has been made in the European Economic Area (EEA).
* Animation Tax Relief
* High-End TV Production Tax Relief
* [[Research and Development Tax Credit|Research &amp; Development Tax Credit]] 
* [[Research and Development Expenditure Credit|Research &amp; Development Expenditure Credit]] 
* [[Research and Development Capital Allowances|Research &amp; Development Capital Allowances]]
* [[Patent Box]]
* Film Tax Relief

The [[Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (EIS) and the [[Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax-relief to individuals who invest in small early-stage [[business]]es.

==Public consultation and working groups==
The government ran a public consultation exercise in summer 2012 on the proposals for Creative Sector Tax Reliefs. Respondents included industry participants ([[The Walt Disney Company]]; [[Channel 4]]; [[Electronic Arts]]; [[Aardman Animations]]) the financial services community including large accounting firms ([[PWC]]; [[Deloitte]]) and independent consultants (MMP Tax); and trade bodies such as [[The Independent Games Developers Association]](TIGA).

The government also established industry-focused working groups for the animation, high-end television and video games industries to complement wider consultation on the new tax reliefs and to discuss options and proposals in more detail.

'''''Cyber Rights: Defending Free speech in the Digital Age''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book about [[cyberlaw]], written by [[free speech]] [[lawyer]] [[Mike Godwin]]. It was first published in 1998 by [[Times Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|37688296}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was republished in 2003 as a revised edition by [[The MIT Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|469426514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin graduated from the [[University of Texas School of Law]] in 1990 and was the first staff counsel for the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. Written with a first-person perspective, ''Cyber Rights'' offers a background in the legal issues and history pertaining to free speech on the [[Internet]]. It documents the author's experiences in defending free speech online, and puts forth the thesis that "the remedy for the abuse of free speech is more speech".&lt;ref name="decandido" /&gt; Godwin emphasizes that decisions made about the expression of ideas on the Internet affect freedom of speech in other media as well, as granted by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The book was received favorably by ''[[Library Journal]]'', where it was "Recommended for anyone concerned about expression on the Internet and democratic society."&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' noted Godwin's "unusually broad view of free speech", and criticized the author for viewing issues "filtered through rose-colored screens".&lt;ref name="tracysmith" /&gt; ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' highlighted ''Cyber Rights'' among "1998's Best Reading".&lt;ref name="romano" /&gt;

{{main|Mike Godwin}}
[[File:Mike Godwin at Wikimedia 2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mike Godwin]] in 2010]]
Godwin is a graduate of the [[University of Texas School of Law]].&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Thomas | first =Harry  | title =Speaking out for Net | work =[[San Antonio Express-News]] | page =4G; Section: Books | date =August 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the book's first publication, Godwin was employed as a staff counsel EFF.&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt; He had been hired as EFF's first staff counsel after graduating from law school in 1990.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; ''[[Law Library Journal]]'' noted, "In this position, he worked on the frontlines of the fight to make sure that freedom of expression is more than tolerated, that in fact it is able to flourish in cyberspace."&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

''Cyber Rights'' is Godwin's first book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Keynote Speakers  | work =CFP 2004: Computer Freedom and Privacy Conference | publisher =www.cfp2004.org | date = March 18, 2004 | url = http://www.cfp2004.org/program/speakers.html | accessdate =2009-12-19  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin described himself as a [[civil libertarian]].&lt;ref name="hudson" /&gt; From 1997 to 1998, Godwin was a fellow of the [[Media Studies Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Giles  | first =Robert H.   |author2=Robert W.

==Contents==
''Cyber Rights'' analyzes the legal issues involved with communicating on the Internet,&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt; including those relating to [[Internet privacy]] and government involvement.&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt; The book is written with a first-person perspective: the reader learns of the author's morning ritual, the fact that his cat is named Francie and that he married a woman he met through a [[Bulletin Board System]].&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; Godwin's motivation was to keep the Internet safe from government actions that restrict [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt; He asserts that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] should apply equally to the Internet as it does to other media.&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt;

The book's early chapters ground the reader in principles involving [[cyberspace]] and the law.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; The author provides enough background that a layperson can understand the relevant legal history, including explaining [[libel]] and the extent to which [[copyright]]ed text may be quoted and used under the [[fair use]] principle.&lt;ref name="hudson" /&gt; Godwin explains his goal is "to show that striking a balance in favor of individual rights has always been the right decision for us and that it remains so even when technology gives us new ways to exercise those rights. Individual liberty has never weakened us; freedom of speech, enhanced by the Net, will only make us stronger".&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; He instructs the reader on how to become proficient in dealing with [[mainstream media|mainstream news media]], writing, "Learn how to hack all the media. Then put that knowledge to good use".&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

Subsequent chapters consider traditional challenges to broad free speech in the online context, including: [[defamation]], [[sexual harassment]], copyright and issues involving [[privacy]]. He dismisses these issues as less important than freedom of speech. Godwin argues that individuals maintain latitude when communicating over the Internet because "it's far more likely that they'll do good than otherwise. This is because freedom of speech is itself a good. The framers of the Constitution were right to give it special protection, because societies in which people can speak freely are better off than societies in which they can't".&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

The author discusses influential legal cases including a judgment involving [[Compuserve]], where the court ruled that the [[Internet service provider]] should be deemed similar to a bookstore avoiding liability for publishing potentially offensive speech. He recounts ''[[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service]]'' which followed a raid by the [[United States Secret Service]] in 1990 on [[Steve Jackson Games]] and his involvement influencing the media relating to the incident.&lt;ref name="hudson" /&gt; He cites the LaMacchia case, which dealt with charges of [[copyright infringement of software]] subsequently dismissed.&lt;ref name="tracysmith" /&gt; An incident at [[Santa Rosa Junior College]] which involved issues of free speech and [[gender discrimination]] is discussed and analyzed in the book.&lt;ref name="decandido" /&gt;

Godwin analyzes the effects of a 1995 cover story "Cyberporn" in ''[[TIME]]'' magazine and writings by [[Martin Rimm]] that discussed the effect of [[Internet pornography]].&lt;ref name="decandido" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tracysmith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hudson" /&gt; He explains how the theories presented in the article were discredited.&lt;ref name="hudson" /&gt; Godwin calls the incident following the ''TIME'' article the "cyber-porn panic"; noting how the magazine published a cover story on a purported pornography "study" and how he and others exposed flaws in the piece.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

He cites the [[Communications Decency Act of 1996]] (CDA) as an example of U.S. government action which cramps free speech.&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt; Godwin describes the subsequent attempts to defeat CDA.&lt;ref name="hudson" /&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held two sections to be unconstitutional and Godwin recounts how he became emotional over the decision.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; Throughout the book Godwin emphasizes that "the remedy for the abuse of free speech is more speech".&lt;ref name="decandido" /&gt; ''Cyber Rights'' puts forth the notion that "virtual communities" can be fostered on the Internet that serve the values of democracy,&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt; writing "The decisions we make about the Internet don't affect just the Internet – they are answers to basic questions about the relationship each citizen has to the government and about the extent to which we trust one another with the full range of fundamental rights granted by the Constitution,".&lt;ref name="hudson" /&gt;

==Reception==
''Cyber Rights'' was reviewed favorably in ''[[Library Journal]]'', where it was described as "a provocative discussion of the social and legal issues concerning computer online communications".&lt;ref name="puro"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Puro  | first =Steven   | title =Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age  | journal =[[Library Journal]]|publisher=Cahners Business Information   | volume =123  | issue =12  | page =112  | date =July 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review noted that Godwin, "provides an excellent background to the governmental and privacy dimensions of the Internet, using anecdotal accounts to illustrate web-related legal issues."&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt; ''Library Journal'' concluded, "Recommended for anyone concerned about expression on the Internet and democratic society."&lt;ref name="puro" /&gt; ''[[Booklist]]'' observed, "He wants us to understand that the principles upon which this country is founded are unquestionably worth the risk. He passionately defends, in clear, one-two-three soundbites, the online freedom he wants his daughter to inherit, and he insists that his readers untangle the meanings behind the use of words such as indecency and pornography to frighten and to confuse."&lt;ref name="decandido"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =DeCandido  | first =GraceAnne A.   | title =Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age  | journal =[[Booklist]]|publisher=[[American Library Association]]  | volume =94  | issue =22  | page =1932 | date =August 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Booklist'' recommended ''Cyber Rights'' be carried in libraries, concluding, "Most libraries will want copies for both circulating and professional collections."&lt;ref name="decandido" /&gt;

''Cyber Rights'' received a positive review in ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', which noted, "Readers of 'Cyber Rights' will range from those who have never heard of Mike Godwin to those who have tangoed with him online at some point or have at least lurked silently as the debate raged. Whatever the number in the first category, those falling into the second are legion. Godwin has been online so long he's had a celebrated law that predicts the course of online discussions named after him."&lt;ref name="hudson" /&gt; The review observed, "Throughout 'Cyber Rights,' it becomes clear that what makes Godwin a sometimes unpleasant online sparring partner is precisely what has catapulted him to the front lines in the seemingly endless battles for free speech on the Net. ... his tenacity and his insistence on wrestling every last breath out of his opponents' arguments."&lt;ref name="hudson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hudson |first=David |title=Net freedom ring |work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |publisher=Salon Media Group |date=July 16, 1998 |url=http://www.salon.com/21st/books/1998/07/16books.html |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606192604/http://www.salon.com/21st/books/1998/07/16books.html |archivedate=June 6, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Salon'' characterized the book as, "an instructional book with an argument to convey – a sort of cross between a dry, textbookish primer and a lively personal history."&lt;ref name="hudson" /&gt;

''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' gave the book a favorable review, noting, "This is a lively, garrulous account by an activist who was deeply involved in turning back the threat of regulation and, at least for the time being, securing rights of free expression online."&lt;ref name="boylan"&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Boylan|first=James| title =Cyber Rights  | journal =[[Columbia Journalism Review]]  | volume =37  |issue=3| page =67 | date =September 1998|issn=0010-194X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review described the latter portion of the book as "a more intense personal chronicle of Godwin's deep involvement in what he calls the 'cyberporn panic' – the push to control Internet content."&lt;ref name="boylan" /&gt; ''Columbia Journalism Review'' concluded, "Ultimately, Godwin shows, this strong response laid the groundwork for lawsuits that enabled the Supreme Court to declare the 'decency' amendment unconstitutional. He was in the thick of things throughout this effort, and his journal lets the reader relive the tension and uncertainty of trying to halt a media stampede before it crushed everything in its path."&lt;ref name="boylan" /&gt;

''[[School Library Journal]]'' recommended the book for young readers, and commented, "Teens growing up with the Net aren't likely to find a better roadmap to the issues affecting their First Amendment future there than this book."&lt;ref name="menefee"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Menefee  | first =Christine C.| title =Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age  | journal =[[School Library Journal]]  | volume =45 | issue =2 | page =144 | date =February 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' was critical of Godwin's writing style in the book, and observed, "He writes in a strong, piercing voice that probably does wonders in a courtroom, but comes off increasingly shrill over several hundred pages of commentary, and at one point fairly warns his reader, 'Subtlety isn't my strong point.'"&lt;ref name="biersdorfer"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Biersdorfer  | first =J.D.   | title =Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age  | journal =[[The New York Times Book Review]]  | volume =103|issue=34  | page =17  | date =August 23, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Information Ethics'' wrote, "This is less an analytic study than a personal survey of situations or occurrences articulated in an informal, colloquial, and anecdotal fashion. It is not aimed at the intelligentsia or legal profession, although members of these groups would certainly benefit from the details."&lt;ref name="hauptman"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Hauptman  | first =Robert  | title =Cyber Rights  | journal =Journal of Information Ethics  | volume =11  | issue =1  | pages =73–74  | date =Spring 2002 |location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]]|publisher= McFarland &amp; Co.  | issn =1061-9321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review concluded, "The details are sometimes overwhelming, but for those who wish to know everything, this is a good place to start."&lt;ref name="hauptman" /&gt;

''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' highlighted ''Cyber Rights'' among "1998's Best Reading", and concluded, "Often reads, as Godwin intends, as a handbook for free-speech activism".&lt;ref name="romano"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Romano  | first =Carlin|author2=Michael D. Schaffer  | title =Fact or Fiction, Here's 1998's Best Reading  | work =[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]  | page =Q03; Section: Features Books | date =December 6, 1998  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' concluded, "'Cyber Rights' is an extremely important book, one that anyone who accesses the Internet should read. Those who support the causes Godwin fights against aren't going to be happy with it, because he pokes some big holes in their arguments. But one of the bedrock freedoms we all enjoy is freedom of speech, and Godwin makes an elegant defense in its behalf."&lt;ref name="thomas" /&gt; ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' characterized the book as a multifacted legal instructive work, and commented, "Part philosophical musings, part legal primer, part history and part political analysis, the book touches on just about every facet of how the Internet is transforming free-speech issues."&lt;ref name="McKenzie"&gt;{{cite news   | last =McKenzie  | first =Aline   | title =Freedom requires vigilance  | work =[[The Dallas Morning News]]  | page =3F; Column: Book Review | date =August 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote, "Godwin makes a passionate case for ensuring the online world has the same civil rights as the 'real' world."&lt;ref name="hardware"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Houston Chronicle staff  | title =hardware  | work =[[Houston Chronicle]]  | page =1; Section: Technology  | date =September 18, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the book ''Internet and the Law'', author Aaron Schwabach comments, "The book takes an anticensorship position, but it presents all sides of the various questions fairly and completely."&lt;ref name="schwabach"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Schwabach  | first =Aaron   | title =Internet and the Law: Technology, Society, and Compromises  | publisher =ABC-CLIO  | year =2005  | page =373  | isbn =1-85109-731-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''CommLaw Conspectus'' of [[The Catholic University of America]] noted, "''Cyber Rights'' brims with anecdotes and behind-the-scenes looks at the people and organizations struggling with the [reality] and potential of the [[information superhighway]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Petit  | first =Patrick J.   | title =Bibliography of Recent Books in Communications Law  | journal =CommLaw Conspectus  | volume =7  | page =207  | publisher =[[The Catholic University of America]]  | date =Winter 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the book in ''[[The Green Bag]]'' concluded, "Overall, Godwin seems to be preaching to the choir, rather than making legal arguments to win over converts. Lower publication costs do increase the possibility of publication, but, standing alone, may not justify replacing the legal regimes developed over time to regulate expression – legal regimes which, for the most part, have endured through previous revolutions in the technology of disseminating information. Theology, which calls on faith, and economics, which calls on reason and empiricism, may not be compatible. But the Internet is about a shift in the economics of expression, not a theological revolution in how the First Amendment affects society, and when the project is getting the legal prescriptions right, all of the implications must be taken seriously."&lt;ref name="speta"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Speta  | first =James B.   | title =Review: Internet Theology Mike Godwin Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age  | journal =[[The Green Bag|The Green Bag an Entertaining Journal of Law]]  | volume =2  | issue =2d  | page =227  | publisher = The Green Bag, Inc. | date =Winter 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' commented that in the book Godwin put forth "an unusually broad view of free speech".&lt;ref name="tracysmith" /&gt; The review noted that by citing noteworthy legal cases affecting free speech online, "he frames nicely some of the issues raised by the encounter of the 200-year-old Bill of Rights and the cutting-edge Internet."&lt;ref name="tracysmith" /&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' wrote that by the end of the book, "his arguments have become predictable – or flimsy, as when he implies that the Net poses no new risks with its dissemination of dangerous information, such as bomb-making instructions, because libraries have carried such information for years."&lt;ref name="tracysmith" /&gt; The review concluded, "Godwin's book is a thoughtful examination of an important subject, but its thoughts seem too often filtered through rose-colored screens."&lt;ref name="tracysmith"&gt;{{cite journal  |first= Tracy |last=Smith|title =Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age  | journal =[[Publishers Weekly]]  | volume =45  | issue =29  | page =202 | publisher =Cahners Business Information | date =July 20, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the revised and updated 2003 edition of the book, ''[[Law Library Journal]]'' wrote, "''Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age'' is a book that can help the uninitiated become familiar with the issues and arguments that have shaped the debate over regulating cyberspace."&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Kim  | first =June  | title =Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age  | journal =[[Law Library Journal]] |publisher=[[American Association of Law Libraries]] | volume =96  | issue =3  | pages =542–544  | date =Summer 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review noted, "''Cyber Rights'' was inspired by Godwin's unwavering belief that an uncensored Internet can transform society into a true democracy. It is an exceptionally personal work and resembles an online journal. ... The book, written in the first person, has a casual and conversational style. As the reader is able to 'hear' the author's voice, ''Cyber Rights'' is extremely easy to read."&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; ''Law Library Journal'' criticized the book for being repetitive, and for dismissing arguments of his opponents as "an irrational fear of the unknown (i.e., cyberspace) or as a poor understanding of case law or the Framers' intent".&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; The review acknowledged, "''Cyber Rights'' is a good introduction to the world of cyberspace and the legal issues that affect the Internet. It presents, in a readable style, a passionate perspective on an emerging area of law."&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; ''Law Library Journal'' recommended the book for "large academic law libraries".&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44687">A '''data breach''' is the intentional or unintentional release of [[secure information|secure]] or private/confidential information to an untrusted environment.  Other terms for this phenomenon include '''unintentional information disclosure''', '''data leak''' and also '''data spill'''.  Incidents range from concerted attacks by [[Black hat hacking|black hats]] associated with [[organized crime]],  [[political activist]] or [[Central government|national governments]] to careless disposal of used [[computer]] equipment or [[Data storage|data storage media]] and unhackable source.

Definition: "A data breach is a security incident in which sensitive, protected or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen or used by an individual unauthorized to do so."&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]]. [http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/im1504.pdf Information Memorandum]. Retrieved 2015-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt;
Data breaches may involve financial information such as credit card or bank details, [[personal health information]] (PHI), [[Personally identifiable information]] (PII), [[trade secrets]] of corporations or [[intellectual property]].  Most data breaches involve overexposed and vulnerable unstructured data – files, documents, and sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2016/04/26/panama-papers-leak-the-new-normal/#|title=Panama Papers Leak: The New Normal?|publisher=Xconomy|date=2016-04-26|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[nonprofit]] [[consumer organization]]  [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]], a total of 227,052,199 individual records containing sensitive personal information were involved in security breaches in the United States between January 2005 and May 2008, excluding incidents where sensitive data was apparently not actually exposed.&lt;ref name="pri"/&gt;

Many [[Jurisdiction|jurisdictions]] have passed [[data breach notification laws]], requiring a company that has been subject to a data breach to inform customers and takes other steps to remediate possible injuries.

==Definition==
This may include incidents such as theft or loss of [[digital media]] such as [[Magnetic tape data storage|computer tapes]], [[hard drive]]s, or [[laptop computer]]s containing such media upon which such information is stored [[encryption|unencrypted]], posting such information on the [[world wide web]] or on a computer otherwise accessible from the [[Internet]] without proper [[information security]] precautions, transfer of such information to a system which is not completely open but is not appropriately or formally [[accreditation|accredited]] for security at the approved level, such as unencrypted [[e-mail]], or transfer of such information to the [[information system]]s of a possibly hostile agency, such as a competing corporation or a foreign nation, where it may be exposed to more intensive decryption techniques.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.archives.gov/isoo/faqs/incidents-spills.html When we discuss incidents occurring on NSSs, are we using commonly defined terms?]'', "Frequently Asked Questions on Incidents and Spills", [[National Archives]] Information Security Oversight Office&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ISO/IEC 27040]] defines a data breach as: ''compromise of security that leads to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to protected data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed''.

==Trust and privacy==
The notion of a trusted environment is somewhat fluid.  The departure of a trusted staff member with access to sensitive information can become a data breach if the staff member retains access to the data after termination of the trust relationship.  In distributed systems, this can also occur with a breakdown in a [[web of trust]]. [[Data quality]] is one way of reducing the risk of a data breach,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationsecuritybuzz.com/expert-comments/nhs-must-prioritise-quality-prevent-data-breaches/ The NHS Must Prioritise Quality To Prevent Further Data Breaches]&lt;/ref&gt; partly because it allows the owner of the data to rate data according to importance and give better protection to more important data.

Most such incidents publicized in the media involve [[Privacy|private]] information on individuals, e.g. [[social security number]]s. Loss of corporate information such as [[trade secret]]s, sensitive corporate information, and details of [[contract]]s, or of government information is frequently unreported, as there is no compelling reason to do so in the absence of potential damage to private citizens, and the publicity around such an event may be more damaging than the loss of the data itself.

==Insider versus external threats==
Those working inside an organization are a major cause of data breaches. Estimates of breaches caused by accidental "human factor" errors range from 37% by [[Ponemon Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ponemon.org/blog/risk-of-insider-fraud-second-annual-study Risk of Insider Fraud: Second Annual Study]. Ponemon.org (2013-02-28). Retrieved 2014-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; to 14% by the Verizon 2013 Data Breach Investigations Report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2013/ Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report | Verizon Enterprise Solutions]. VerizonEnterprise.com. Retrieved 2014-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The external threat category includes hackers, cybercriminal organizations and state-sponsored actors.

While security prevention may deflect a high percentage of attempts, ultimately a motivated attacker will likely find a way into any given network.

==Medical data breach==
{{Main article|Medical data breach}}
Some celebrities have found themselves to be the victims of inappropriate medical record access breaches, albeit more so on an individual basis, not part of a typically much larger breach.&lt;ref name="Spears Clooney"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ornstein |first=Charles |title=Hospital to punish snooping on Spears|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/15/local/me-britney15 |accessdate=2013-07-26 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the series of medical data breaches and the lack of public trust, some countries have [[:Category:Medical privacy legislation|enacted laws]] requiring safeguards to be put in place to protect the security and confidentiality of medical information as it is shared electronically and to give patients some important rights to monitor their medical records and receive notification for loss and unauthorized acquisition of health information. The United States and the EU have imposed mandatory medical data breach notifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364912000209|title=Medical data breaches: Notification delayed is notification denied|accessdate=11 May 2016 | doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2012.01.003|volume=28|issue=2|journal=Computer Law|pages=163–183|year=2012|last1=Kierkegaard|first1=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Although such incidents pose the risk of [[identity theft]] or other serious consequences, in most cases there is no lasting damage; either the breach in security is remedied before the information is accessed by unscrupulous people, or the thief is only interested in the hardware stolen, not the data it contains. Nevertheless, when such incidents become publicly known, it is customary for the offending party to attempt to mitigate [[damages]] by providing to the victim's subscription to a [[credit reporting agency]], for instance, new credit cards, or other instruments.  In the case of Target, the 2013 breach cost Target a significant drop in profit, which dove an estimated 40 percent in the 4th quarter of the year. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/business/target-reports-on-fourth-quarter-earnings.html|title=Data Breach Hurts Profit at Target|date=27 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=11 May 2016|last1=Harris|first1=Elizabeth A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2015, [[Target Corporation|Target]] published a report claiming a total loss of $290 million to data breach related fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manworren|first=Nathan|last2=Letwat|first2=Joshua|last3=Daily|first3=Olivia|date=May 2016|title=Why you should care about the Target data breach|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007681316000033|journal=Business Horizons|volume=59|issue=3|pages=257–266|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2016.01.002|issn=0007-6813}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Yahoo breach disclosed in 2016 may be one of the most expensive today. It may lower the price of its acquisition by Verizon by $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/report-verizon-wants-1-billion-discount-after-yahoo-privacy-concerns/|title=Verizon Wants $1 Billion Discount After Yahoo Privacy Concerns|last=|first=|date=October 6, 2016|website=|publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verizon later released there renegotiation to Yahoo agreeing to lower the final price from $4.8 to $4.48 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trautman|first=Lawrence J.|date=2016|title=Corporate Directorss and Officerss Cybersecurity Standard of Care: The Yahoo Data Breach|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2883607|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2883607|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cybercrime cost energy and utilities companies an average of $12.8 million each year in lost business and damaged equipment according to DNV GL, an international certification body and classification society based in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hydrocarbonprocessing.com/news/2016/09/oil-and-gas-industry-joins-forces-in-fight-against-cybercrime|title=Hydrocarbon Processing|last=|first=|date=September 29, 2016|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data breaches cost healthcare organizations $6.2 billion in the last two years (presumably 2014 and 2015), according to a Ponemon study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beckersasc.com/asc-turnarounds-ideas-to-improve-performance/data-breaches-cost-healthcare-industry-6-2b-4-points.html|title=Data breaches cost healthcare industry $6.2B|last=|first=|date=May 12, 2016|website=Becker's ASC Review|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notoriously difficult to obtain information on direct and indirect value loss resulting from a data breach. A common approach to assess the impact of data breaches is to study the market reaction to such an incident as proxy for the economic consequences. This is typically conducted through the use of [[event studies]], where a measure of the event’s economic impact can be constructed by using the security prices observed over a relatively short period of time. Several studies such studies have been published with varying findings, including works by Kannan, Rees, and Sridhar (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kannan|first=Karthik|last2=Rees|first2=Jackie|last3=Sridhar|first3=Sanjay|date=2007-09|title=Market Reactions to Information Security Breach Announcements: An Empirical Analysis|journal=International Journal of Electronic Commerce|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=69–91|doi=10.2753/jec1086-4415120103|issn=1086-4415}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cavusoglu, Mishra, and Raghunathan (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cavusoglu|first=Huseyin|last2=Mishra|first2=Birendra|last3=Raghunathan|first3=Srinivasan|date=2004|title=The Effect of Internet Security Breach Announcements on Market Value: Capital Market Reactions for Breached Firms and Internet Security Developers|journal=International Journal of Electronic Commerce|volume=9|issue=1|pages=69–104|jstor=27751132}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Campbell, Gordon, Loeb, and Lei (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Katherine|last2=Gordon|first2=Lawrence A.|last3=Loeb|first3=Martin P.|last4=Zhou|first4=Lei|date=2003-07-01|title=The economic cost of publicly announced information security breaches: empirical evidence from the stock market*|url=https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-computer-security/jcs192|journal=Journal of Computer Security|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=431–448|doi=10.3233/JCS-2003-11308|issn=1875-8924}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Schatz and Bashroush (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schatz|first=Daniel|last2=Bashroush|first2=Rabih|date=2016-03-14|title=The impact of repeated data breach events on organisations' market value|journal=Information and Computer Security|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=73–92|doi=10.1108/ics-03-2014-0020|issn=2056-4961|url=http://roar.uel.ac.uk/4333/1/postprint_iacs_bashroush_2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* In December 2009 a [[RockYou!]] password database was breached containing 32 million usernames and plaintext passwords, further compromising the use of weak passwords for any purpose.
* In May 2009 the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal]] was revealed by [[The Daily Telegraph]].  A hard disk containing scanned receipts of UK Members of Parliament and Peers in the House of Lords was offered to various UK newspapers in late April, with The Daily Telegraph finally acquiring it.  They published details in instalments from 8 May onwards.  Although it was intended by Parliament that the data was to be published, this was to be in redacted form, with details the individual members considered "sensitive" blanked out.  The newspaper published unredacted scans which showed details of the claims, many of which appeared to be in breach of the rules and suggested widespread abuse of the generous expenses system.  The resulting media storm led to the resignation of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and the prosecution and imprisonment of several MPs and Lords for fraud.  The expenses system was overhauled and tightened up, being put more on a par with private industry schemes.  The [[Metropolitan Police Service]] continues to investigate possible frauds, and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] is considering further prosecutions.  Several MPs and Lords apologised and made whole, partial or no restitution, and retained their seats.  Others who had been shamed in the media did not offer themselves for re-election at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010]].  Although numbering less than 1,500 individuals, the affair received the largest global media coverage of any data breach (as at February 2012).

The '''Environmental Modification Convention''' ('''ENMOD'''), formally the '''Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques''' is an international [[treaty]] prohibiting the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. It opened for signature on 18 May 1977 in [[Geneva]] and entered into force on 5 October 1978.

The Convention bans [[weather warfare]], which is the use of [[weather modification]] techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] of 2010 would also ban some forms of weather modification or geoengineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbd.int/cop10&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of [[herbicide]]s in warfare, such as [[Agent Orange]], but it does require case-by-case consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule76 |title=Practice Relating to Rule 76. Herbicides |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |year=2013 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parties==
{{Main|List of parties to the Environmental Modification Convention}}
The Convention was signed by 48 states; 16 of the signatories have not ratified. As of January 2018, the Convention has 78 state parties.&lt;ref name=undb/&gt;

==History==
The problem of artificial modification of the environment for military or other hostile purposes was brought to the international agenda in the early 1970s. Following the US decision of July 1972 to renounce the use of climate modification techniques for hostile purposes, the 1973 resolution by the US Senate calling for an international agreement "prohibiting the use of any environmental or geophysical modification activity as a weapon of war", and an in-depth review by the Department of Defense of the military aspects of weather and other environmental modification techniques, US decided to seek agreement with the Soviet Union to explore the possibilities of an international agreement.

In July 1974, US and USSR agreed to hold bilateral discussions on measures to overcome the danger of the use of environmental modification techniques for military purposes and three subsequent rounds of discussions in 1974 and 1975. In August 1975, US and USSR tabled identical draft texts of a convention at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD), [[Conference on Disarmament]], where intensive negotiations resulted in a modified text and understandings regarding four articles of this Convention in 1976.

The Convention was approved by [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72|Resolution 31/72]] of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1976, by 96 to 8 votes with 30 abstentions.

==Environmental Modification Technique==
Environmental Modification Technique includes any technique for changing – through the deliberate manipulation of natural processes – the dynamics, composition or structure of the earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space.

==Structure of ENMOD==
The Convention contains ten articles and one Annex on the Consultative Committee of Experts. Integral part of the Convention are also the Understandings relating to articles I, II, III and VIII. These Understandings are not incorporated into the Convention but are part of the negotiating record and were included in the report transmitted by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1976 Report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, Volume I, General Assembly Official records: Thirty-first session, Supplement No. 27 (A/31/27), New York, United Nations, 1976, pp.&amp;nbsp;91–92.&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Office at Geneva. http://www.unog.ch&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6101">{{redirect|FTCA|the Federal Trade Commission Act|Federal Trade Commission Act}}

The '''Federal Tort Claims Act''' (August 2, 1946, ch.646, Title IV, {{USStat|60|812}}, {{usctc|28|6|171|pipe="28 U.S.C. Pt.VI Ch.171"}} and {{usc|28|1346(b)}}) ("FTCA") is a 1946 [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal statute]] that permits private parties to sue the [[United States]] in a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] for most [[tort]]s committed by persons acting on behalf of the United States. Historically, citizens have not been able to sue their state—a doctrine referred to as [[sovereign immunity]]. The FTCA constitutes a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, permitting citizens to pursue some tort claims against the government.

==Limitations==
Under the FTCA, "[t]he United States [is] liable . . . in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but [is not] liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages."  {{UnitedStatesCode|28|2674}}. Federal courts have jurisdiction over such claims, but apply the law of the State "where the act or omission occurred." {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1346}}(b). Thus, both federal and State law may impose limitations on liability. The FTCA exempts, among other things, claims based upon the performance, or failure to perform a "discretionary function or duty."&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|28|2680(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTCA also exempts a number of [[intentional tort]]s.&lt;ref name="usc|28|2680h"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|28|2680(h)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FTCA does not exempt intentional torts committed by "investigative or law enforcement officers," thus allowing individuals aggrieved by the actions of law enforcement officers to have their day in court.&lt;ref name="usc|28|2680h"/&gt; The Supreme Court affirmed this so-called "law enforcement proviso" in ''[[Millbrook v. United States]]'', where a federal prisoner was allowed to bring a claim against the United States for intentional torts committed by federal prison guards in the scope of their employment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-10362_2d9g.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Under the FTCA, a tort claim against the United States must be presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after the claim accrues, or it is time-barred. 28 U.S.C. § 2401(b).

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has limited the application of the FTCA in cases involving the military. This is the [[Feres v. United States|''Feres'' doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|340|135|1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

FTCA is the "exclusive means by which a party may sue the United States for money damages . . . in tort" (28 USC § 2679. Exclusiveness of remedy). Accordingly, an FTCA action "can be brought only in a United States District Court" (28 USC § 1346(b)). Regarding the timing of filing, FTCA's § 2401(b) states that the action must be brought "within two years after the claim accrues," or "within six months after . . . notice of final denial of the claim by the agency . . . ."

In addition, under the FTCA,  "Liability is determinable in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred" (§1346(b)(1)).

==History==
The ''"Federal Tort Claims Act"'' was also previously the official short title passed by the Seventy-ninth Congress on August 2, 1946 as Title IV of the ''Legislative Reorganization Act'', 60 Stat. 842, which was classified principally to chapter 20 (§§ 921, 922, 931–934, 941–946) of ''former'' Title 28, ''Judicial Code and Judiciary''.

That Title IV of the ''Legislative Reorganization Act'' act of August 2, 1946 was substantially repealed and reenacted as sections 1346 (b) and 2671 et seq. of this title by act June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 982, the first section of which enacted this title (Tort Claims Procedure).&lt;ref name="LIIshortTitle"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2671- 28 U.S.C. §2671, Additional Notes, "Short Title" Section] as found on the Legal Information Institute Online, Cornell University Law School&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was passed following the 1945 [[B-25 Empire State Building crash]], where a bomber piloted in thick [[fog]] by Lieutenant Colonel William F. Smith, Jr. crashed into the north side of the [[Empire State Building]]. As NPR reported, "Eight months after the crash, the U.S. government offered money to families of the victims. Some accepted, but others initiated a lawsuit that resulted in landmark legislation. The Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, for the first time, gave American citizens the right to sue the federal government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Day A Bomber Hit The Empire State Building |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92987873 |work=[[National Public Radio]] |date= |accessdate=2008-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the crash was not the initial catalyst for the bill, which had been pending in Congress for more than two decades, the statute was made retroactive to 1945 in order to allow victims of that crash to seek recovery.&lt;ref name="pp.24-30"&gt;State Ins.

'''Geek shows''' were an act in [[traveling carnival]]s and  [[circus]]es of early [[United States|America]] and were often part of a larger [[sideshow]].

The billed performer's act consisted of a single geek, who stood in center ring to chase live chickens. It ended with the performer biting the chickens' heads off and swallowing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/geek|title=Definition of GEEK|publisher=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geek shows were often used as openers for what are commonly known as [[freak show]]s. It was a matter of pride among circus and carnival professionals not to have traveled with a troupe that included geeks.  Geeks were often alcoholics or drug addicts, and paid with liquor – especially during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] – or with [[illegal drug trade|narcotics]].

==Etymology and meaning==
{{Copypaste|section|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/geek|date=June 2018}}
The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the following for "[[geek]]":

{{Quote

|text="sideshow freak," 1916, U.S. carnival and circus slang, perhaps a variant of ''geck'' "a fool, dupe, simpleton" (1510s), apparently from [[Low German]] ''geck'', from an imitative verb found in [[North Sea Germanic]] and [[Scandinavian language|Scandinavian]] meaning "to croak, cackle," and also "to mock, cheat." The modern form and the popular use with reference to circus sideshow "wild men" is from 1946, in [[William Lindsay Gresham]]'s novel ''[[Nightmare Alley]]'' (made into a film in 1947 starring [[Tyrone Power]]).

}}
In modern usage, the term "geek show" is often applied to situations where an audience is drawn to a performance or show where the performance consists of a horrific act that is found distasteful but ultimately entertaining by masses. It may also be used by a single person in reference to an experience which he or she found humiliating but others found entertaining. It is used in derision.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==References in pop culture==

''[[Freaks (film)|Freaks]]'' (1932) is a [[horror film]] with a long history of controversy because it used real carnival performers. In its original release, it became the only [[M-G-M]] film ever to be pulled from [[Movie theater|cinemas]] before completing its domestic engagements.&lt;ref name="Vieira49"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vieira |first1=Mark A. |title=Hollywood Horror: From Gothic to Cosmic |year=2003 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-8109-4535-5 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[film noir]] classic ''[[Nightmare Alley (film)|Nightmare Alley]]'' (1947), based on the novel by [[William Lindsay Gresham]], [[Tyrone Power]] plays a sideshow [[barker (occupation)|barker]] in a seedy carnival which includes a geek biting the heads off live chickens. Power's character later succeeds as a [[charlatan]] [[mentalist]], but then descends into [[alcoholism]] and is reduced to falsely portraying a geek as a means of survival in another sideshow. In one of Gresham's non-fiction books, Monster Midway, he details the process of making an alcoholic or a drug addict perform a geek act in exchange for a fix.

He primarily did a 'Human Bomb' show, self-detonating at the end, but also performed with the rodents for his turn as a geek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hensley|first1=Chad|title=A Look Inside an Infernal Machine  An Interview with Joe Coleman|url=http://www.esoterra.org/joec.htm|website=esoterra.org|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990 [[Troma]] film ''[[Luther the Geek]]'' revolves around a geek named Luther, who eventually becomes a murderer who bites the heads off his victims.

A geek show figures in the [[Katherine Dunn]] novel ''[[Geek Love]]'' (1989).  Crystal Lil, the debutante mother of the [[freak]]s, met their father while performing as a geek during her summer break from university. Aloysius, the proprietor of the traveling circus, comments that college boys often toured as geeks during their summer breaks, but at the sight of the lovely Crystal Lil and her eagerness they made an exception. During a recounting of her time as a geek, Crystal remarks on how damaged her teeth were from biting the heads off chickens.

In the 1998 ''[[Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Bart Carny]]", Homer and Bart are asked to perform in a geek show to pay off a debt: "You just bite the heads off the chickens and take a bow".&lt;ref&gt;[[q:The Simpsons#Bart Carny .5B9.12.5D]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Ballad of a Thin Man]]", from the 1965 album ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'', makes a reference to the geek. It is directed at the 'straight' Mr Jones, who is unable to come to terms with the counter culture youth revolution around him:
:You hand in your ticket
:And you go watch the geek
:Who immediately walks up to you
:When he hears you speak
:And says, "How does it feel
:To be such a freak?"
:And you say, "Impossible"
:As he hands you a bone.

In the 1995 ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode "[[Humbug (The X-Files)|Humbug]]", real-life sideshow performer [[The Enigma (performer)|The Enigma]] portrays a mostly-mute geek named "The Conundrum."  True to geek form, his willingness to eat anything plays a crucial role in resolving the episode's plot.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In ''[[Marvel Noir]]'', [[Norman Osborn]] has his henchmen all employed from various sideshow attractions. [[Adrian Toomes]] was a former Geek, and seems to have lost all conscience, as he devoured [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Noir #1, 2''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[The Wizard of Gore (2007 film)|The Wizard of Gore]]'' there is a show that opens with "The Geek" (played by [[Jeffrey Combs]]) eating maggots and then biting the head off a rat.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the first two episodes of ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show]]'', there is a geek named Meep (played by [[Ben Woolf]]) who performs in the Freak Show biting heads off of baby chickens. He is eventually wrongfully arrested and murdered by the other inmates in prison.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In HBO's ''[[Carnivàle]]'', Ben Hawkins' father, Henry Scudder, deserted the [[French Foreign Legion]] and fled to America where he eventually succumbed to alcoholism and worked as a sideshow geek at Hyde and Teller's carnival.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Bangladesh]] is one of the most vulnerable nations in the world [[Climate change in Bangladesh|due to climate change]]. As the [[List of countries by population|ninth most populous country]] and [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|twelfth most densely populated countries]] in the world, its rising population and limited land space have put tremendous strains on the urban [[ecosystem]]. The capital of [[Dhaka]] itself underwent severe transformations in recent years to catch up the increased rate of urbanisation.  This change was paralleled by a boom in the real estate, construction and housing industry. According to [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), Dhaka is one of the most polluted cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhuiya. G. M. J. A (2007). 1. Bangladesh. Solid Waste Management: Issues and Challenges in Asia, pg 29.|url=http://www.apo-tokyo.org/publications/files/ind-22-swm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unified measures have been adopted from the national community in an effort to avoid further man made calamities due to [[climate change]] and higher [[Air pollution|emissions]]. There are six main sectors most likely to be affected by climate change in Bangladesh – water resources and coastal zones, infrastructure and human settlements, agriculture and food security, forestry and biodiversity, fisheries, and human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Building responsiveness to climate change through community based adaptation in Bangladesh.|journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deforestation]] has resulted in several man made disasters in the country's history. [[Green building]]s assure efficient usage of water and energy and the nation is struggling in the [[Electricity sector in Bangladesh|production of electricity]] and suffering from [[Water supply and sanitation in Bangladesh|a shortage of water]].

==Background==
The first [[green building]] in Bangladesh was by EPIC group in May 2011.&lt;ref name=bx&gt;{{cite news | url =http://bx.businessweek.com/sustainable-design/cipl-epic-group-awarded-prestigious-leed-green-building-certification/2244668986263151741-fd4fe7d11f916a10a5b6c0b1a56acbaa/| title =  CIPL (EPIC Group) Awarded Prestigious LEED Green Building Certification | publisher= ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' | author = Corresspondent| date = 12 May 2011| accessdate = 12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, Sustainable Built Environment Initiative – Bangladesh (later Bangladesh Green Building Council) founder, [[Sanwar Azam Sunny|Sanwar Azam]] had worked to unify the stake holders towards a greener country, saying that with growing population in a diminishing land and rapid urbanisation to major cities, '[[Going green]]' had become a marketing ploy for various organisations as there were no quantifiable way to judge a structures [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name=jugantor1&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bangladeshnews24.com/jugantor/newspaper/2011/05/18/news0708.php | title = 'Green' buildings | publisher = ''[[Jugantor]]'' | author = Siddikur Rahman | date = 18 May 2011 | accessdate = 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offered a centralised board to offer [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certifications to interested projects and firms.&lt;ref name=indep2&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theindependentbd.com/paper-edition/frontpage/129-frontpage/59753-green-buildings-thats-the-watchword.html | title = 'Green' buildings— that's the watchword | publisher = ''[[The Independent (Bangladesh)|The Independent]]'' | author = Faisal Mahmud | date = 10 July 2011 | accessdate = 10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he proposed a similar voluntary building rating tool that is much cheaper to attain and one that is much suited to the socio-economic conditions of the country and relevant to its building environment and construction culture.&lt;ref name=indep3&gt;{{cite news | url = http://theindependentbd.com/weekly-independent/60480-national.html | title = 'Going Green' Now a Marketing Ploy for Many Organisations | publisher = ''[[The Independent (Bangladesh)|The Independent]]'' | author = Staff Correspondent | date = 15 July 2011 | accessdate = 10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azam also stressed the need for educational programs in [[sustainable design]]s and various [[universities in Bangladesh]] planned to promote Green Building principles in their curriculum, such as in the [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]], [[American International University-Bangladesh]], [[North South University]], [[BRAC University]] and [[University of Asia Pacific (Bangladesh)|Asia Pacific University]].&lt;ref name=indep2/&gt; Dr. [[Saleh Uddin]] was the Events and Education Committee of Bangladesh Green Building Council. Citing that in cramped environment, such buildings and structures would be far more comfortable and satisfying but most importantly directly address some national issues, like [[Water conservation|conserving water]] and [[Energy conservation|energy]]. The [[Government of Bangladesh]] in 2009 stopped giving connections to newly constructed buildings meaning that new homes would not have access to energy, and even water due to shortages.&lt;ref name=dst&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=224314| title =  New gas connections to industries by April |publisher = ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]'' | author = Staff Corresspondent| date = 29 February 2012| accessdate = 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts agreed that a rating tool would not only facilitate government incentives to sustainable communities but achieve the six-point goals of the [[Water supply and sanitation in Bangladesh#Recent developments:National Water Policy and related policies|National Water Policy of 1999]] by the [[World Bank]] as well as the [[Renewable energy policy of Bangladesh|Renewable Energy Policy of 2008]] by the [[Government of Bangladesh|Ministry of Power and Energy]].&lt;ref name=indep2/&gt;

In an event with Architecture and construction experts, he urged for a national need for [[sustainable development]] in the nation's growing building industry and brought a forum together to act as the [[Green Building Council|national GBC]] of Bangladesh. He stressed reductions of [[carbon emissions]] from buildings. National and international energy companies like Energpac and [[Siemens]] attended the event to assess the roles of the corporate stakeholders while [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) fellows commented on the global imperative of such an initiative.&lt;ref name=indep1&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theindependentbd.com/paper-edition/metropolitan/dhaka/59002-bgbc-launching-ceremony-today.html | title = BGBC launching ceremony today | publisher = ''[[The Independent (Bangladesh)|The Independent]]'' | author = Staff Reporter | date = 5 July 2011 | accessdate = 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first proposed rating tool aimed to fulfill the [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability|Seventh Target]] from the United Nations' [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), as for the first time the council provided support for green building certifications.&lt;ref name=seab&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tradelinkmedia.biz/tlm/response/download/153 | title = Interview with Sanwar A Sunny: Green Building Council | publisher = ''[[Southeast Asia Building (magazine)|Southeast Asia Building Magazine]]'' | page = 100 | author = Amita Natverlal | date = September 2011| accessdate = 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially with minimal government support, the plan was to transform the market with cost effective steps. In another interview with ''[[The Independent (Bangladesh)|The Independent]]'', Sanwar said "there is a great misconception regarding the cost effectiveness of the green design and construction," and that increased productivity and energy savings of a green building outweighs initial costs. About the feasibility of widespread utilisation of LEED certifications, he said that it is very expensive and the Bangladesh is in the process of developing a [[Green building#Regulation and operation|green building rating system]] in the regional context.&lt;ref name=indep4&gt;{{cite news | url = http://theindependentbd.com/paper-edition/frontpage/129-frontpage/81684-buyers-fleeced-in-name-of-green-buildings.html | title = Buyers fleeced in name of 'green buildings' | publisher = ''[[The Independent (Bangladesh)|The Independent]]'' | author = Faisal Mahmud | date = 24 November 2011| accessdate = 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities were also promoted by national and region experts. Prominent national award winning architects such as [[Mustapha Khalid Palash]], the [[Holcim Awards for Sustainable Construction|2010 Holcim Green Built Sustainable Design Competition]] winner was the Chairman of the Practicing Professionals Committee, and [[Rafiq Azam]], defined BGBC platform as a way for Bangladesh to define 'Green' according to the national circumstances.&lt;ref name=ds1&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thedailystar.net/campus/2011/07/03/snap.htm| title = BGBC Experts Discuss Sustainability at AIUB | publisher = ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]'' | author = News Correspondent | date = 17 July 2011 | accessdate = 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute of Architects Bangladesh]], which works with different government organisation to offer education and government advocacy commented on the adaptability of sustainable principles in the national architecture community in the form of the BGBC rating tool.&lt;ref name=aiub&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.aiub.edu/HtmlViewer2.aspx?EventsID=499| title = BGBC Experts Discuss Sustainability at Architecture Department of AIUB | publisher = ''[[American International University-Bangladesh|AIUB News Bulletin]]'' | author = Dept. of Architecture| date = 6 July 2011| accessdate = 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, BGBC founder pointed out that such green building standards and tools will lead to conservation as buildings would less consumption of electricity and water,&lt;ref name=indep2/&gt; and also 'the need for reduction of carbon emissions' in the current building and construction scenario. At the same meeting, the Additional Chief Architect of the [[Government of Bangladesh|Ministry of Housing and Public Works, Bangladesh]] spoke about the government's role.&lt;ref name=indep1/&gt; By 2012, the Ministry of Public Works began working with the [[World Bank]]&lt;ref name=unb&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.unbconnect.com/component/news/task-show/id-66628| title = Land grabbers won't be spared, warns State Minister for Housing | publisher= ''UNBConnect'' | author = Staff Corresspondent| date = 10 January 2012| accessdate = 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to study energy and water efficiency&lt;ref&gt;[[Devex]] (2012) [http://www.devex.com/en/projects/developing-a-green-building-code-gbc-to-mandate-improvements-in-energy-and-water-usage-in-bangladesh Developing a Green Building Code (GBC) to Mandate Improvements in Energy and Water Usage in Bangladesh] ''[[World Bank]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and emissions reductions through Green Building Codes.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Guatemala]] on 16 May 1999.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p323 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured four questions; one on defining the nation and social rights (including those of the indigenous population, workers, military service and an expansion of the social security system) one on reforming [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]], one on reforming the executive (including redefining the role of the military) and one on reforming the judiciary.&lt;ref name=DN/&gt; All four were rejected by voters, although turnout was just 18.6%.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;Nohlen, pp330-331&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer networking]], '''HTTP 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons''' is an error [[List of HTTP status codes|status code]] of the [[HTTP]] protocol to be displayed when the user requests a resource which cannot be served for legal reasons, such as a web page censored by a government. The number 451 is a reference to [[Ray Bradbury]]'s 1953 [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', in which books are outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This status code is standardized in RFC 7725.

Examples of situations where an HTTP 451 error code could be displayed include web pages deemed a danger to national security, or web pages deemed to violate copyright, privacy, [[blasphemy law]]s, or any other law or court order.

The RFC is specific that a 451 response does not indicate whether the resource exists but requests for it have been blocked, if the resource has been removed for legal reasons and no longer exists, or even if the resource has never existed, but any discussion of its topic has been legally forbidden (see [[superinjunction]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[:RFC:7725|RFC 7725]], §3&lt;/ref&gt; Some sites have previously returned [[HTTP 404]] (Not Found) or similar if they are not legally permitted to disclose that the resource has been removed. Such a tactic is used in the [[United Kingdom]] by some internet service providers utilising the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] blacklist, returning a 404 message or another error message instead of showing a message indicating the site is blocked.&lt;ref&gt;"If the request is for the blocked content then the proxy server will return a 404 error page to the customer" https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Cleanfeed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"TCP Reset is sent back to the customer instead of content." https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/dec/08/internet-censorship-wikipedia-diagram&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
When an entity blocks access to a resource and returns status 451, it should include a "Link" HTTP header field whose value is a URI reference identifying itself. When used for this purpose, the "Link" header field must have a "rel" parameter whose value is "blocked-by".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725|title=An HTTP Status Code to Report Legal Obstacles|website=IETF Tools|date=February 2016|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

&lt;source lang="http"&gt;
HTTP/1.1 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons
Link: &lt;https://spqr.example.org/legislatione&gt;; rel="blocked-by"
Content-Type: text/html

'''''Kolender v. Lawson''''', 461 U.S. 352 (1983), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case concerning the constitutionality of laws that allow police to demand that "[[Loitering|loiterers]]" and "wanderers" provide identification.

== Background ==
[[Edward C. Lawson|Edward Lawson]] was a law-abiding black man with suitable knowledge of the U.S. Constitution. Lawson was frequently subjected to police questioning and harassment in San Diego County, California, where he lived when as a pedestrian he walked in so-called "white neighborhoods." He was detained or arrested approximately 15 times by the [[San Diego Police Department|San Diego Police]] within 18 months, was prosecuted twice, and was convicted once (the second charge was dismissed).

Lawson challenged California Penal Code §647(e),&lt;ref&gt;
California Penal Code §647(e) read, in relevant part,
:"Every person who commits any of the following acts is guilty of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor: . . . (e) who loiters or wanders upon the streets or from place to place without apparent reason or business and who refuses to identify himself and to account for his presence when requested by any peace officer so to do, if the surrounding circumstances are such as to indicate to a reasonable man that the public safety demands such identification."
California later removed this section because of this lawsuit, replacing it with what used to be §647(f).
&lt;/ref&gt;
which required persons who loiter or wander on the streets to identify themselves and account for their presence when requested by a peace officer to do so.
A California appellate court, in ''People v. Solomon''  (1973), 33 Cal. App.3d 429, had construed the law to require "credible and reliable" identification that carries a "reasonable assurance" of its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;
In ''People v. Solomon'' (1973), the Court construed §&amp;nbsp;647(e) as requiring that a person detained under that statute’s authority produce "credible and reliable identification {{nowrap|. . .}} carrying reasonable assurance that the identification is authentic and providing means for later getting in touch with the person who has identified himself." (33 Cal.App.3d 429, 439). The [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] denied review. Both the Ninth Circuit (658 F.2d 1362, 1364–1365, n. 3) and the U.S. Supreme Court (461 U.S. 352, 356, n. 4) used this construction in voiding §&amp;nbsp;647(e) for vagueness.
&lt;/ref&gt;

William Kolender was an appellant who was acting in his capacity as [[Chief of Police]] of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], as was John Duffy who was acting in his capacity as [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department|Sheriff of San Diego County]].

=== Prior history ===
The Ninth Circuit, in ''Lawson v. Kolender'', 658 F.2d 1362 (1981), had additionally held that Penal Code §647(e) violated the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]’s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures because it "subverts the probable cause requirement" by authorizing arrest for conduct that is no more than suspicious. "Vagrancy statutes cannot turn otherwise innocent conduct into a crime." Id. at 1367.

The Ninth Circuit also noted that "police knowledge of the identity of an individual they have deemed ‘suspicious’ grants the police unfettered discretion to initiate or continue the investigation of the person long after the detention has ended. Information concerning the stop, the arrest and the individual’s identity may become part of a [[Criminal records in the United States |large scale data bank]]." Id. at 1368.

Lawson [[pro se litigation|represented himself]] up through the conclusion of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Federal Ninth Circuit Court]] appeal. He was told he could not represent himself before the Supreme Court without a law degree,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} so he had{{clarify|reason=Did he hire or request or did they offer; pro bono?|date=November 2017}} an [[ACLU]] lawyer represent him before the Court.

== Conclusion ==
Using the construction of the California appellate court in ''Solomon'', the Court held that the law was [[Vagueness doctrine |unconstitutionally vague]] because it gave excessive discretion to the police (in the absence of probable cause to arrest) whether to stop and interrogate a suspect or leave him alone.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O’Connor]], writing for the Court, noted that the law
:"... provided no standard for determining what a suspect must do to comply with [the law]", conferring on police "virtually unrestrained power to arrest and charge persons with a violation."
&lt;/ref&gt;
The Court hinted that the California statute compromised the constitutional right to freedom of movement.{{#tag:ref| The Court upheld the circuit court holdings: 
* A person can not be required to furnish identification if not reasonably suspected of any criminal conduct.
* A reasonable suspicion of criminal activity alone is insufficient to justify a patdown search
* The person stopped is not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest.
* Vagrancy ordinances cannot turn otherwise innocent conduct into a crime.
* Personal liberty, which is guaranteed to every citizen under U.S. Constitution and laws, consists of the right of locomotion, to go where one pleases, and when, and to do that which may lead to one's business or pleasure, only so far restrained as the rights of others may make it necessary for the welfare of all other citizens. One may travel along the public highways or in public places; and while conducting themselves in a decent and orderly manner, disturbing no other, and interfering with the rights of no other citizens, there, they will be protected under the law, not only their persons, but in their safe conduct. Any law that would place the keeping and safe conduct of another in the hands of even a conservator of the peace, unless for some breach of the peace committed in his presence, or upon suspicion of felony, would be most oppressive and unjust, and destroy all the rights, which the Constitution guarantees.
* An innocent person cannot generally know when a police officer has reasonable cause to believe that his behavior warrants further investigation for criminal activity, and therefore cannot know when refusal to identify himself will be a crime.
* No one may be required under peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.
* Police knowledge of the identity of an individual they have deemed "suspicious" grants the police unfettered discretion to initiate or continue investigation of the person long after the detention has ended. Information concerning the stop, the arrest and the individual's identity may become part of a large scale data bank. The serious intrusion on personal security outweighs the mere possibility that identification may provide a link leading to arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lawson v. Kolender |journal=United States Federal Reports |volume=2 |issue=658 |page= 1362 |date=Oct 15, 1981 |publisher=United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit |url=https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/658/658.F2d.1362.79-3685.79-3641.79-3633.79-3629.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|group="Note" |name="Lawson v. Kolender headnotes"}}{{#tag:ref| The Court's own holdings:
* While police have the right to request citizens to answer voluntarily questions concerning unsolved crimes they have no right to compel them to answer.
* Fourth Amendment concerns are implicated where a state statute permits investigative detentions in situations where the police officers lack a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on objective facts.
* The concern with curbing criminal activity cannot justify legislation that would otherwise fail to meet constitutional standards for definiteness and clarity.
* A state criminal statute that requires persons who loiter or wander on the streets to provide a credible and reliable identification and to account for their presence when requested by a peace officer under circumstances that would justify a valid stop is unconstitutionally vague on its face within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it encourages arbitrary enforcement by failing to clarify what is contemplated by the requirement that a suspect provide a credible and reliable identification.
* Statutory limitations on individual freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution are examined for substantive authority and content as well as for definiteness or certainty of expression. The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.
* In providing that a detention under a state statute may occur only where there is the level of suspicion sufficient to justify a constitutional stop, a state insures the existence of neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Kolender v.

Because the U.S. Supreme Court was able to resolve ''Kolender'' on the issue of [[Vagueness doctrine |vagueness]], [[Constitutional avoidance|they did not decide the Fourth Amendment issue.]]

==Subsequent history==
''Kolender'' was cited in ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'', {{ussc|542|177|2004}}, as an example of a [[Stop and identify statutes|"stop and identify" statute]] the Court had voided on vagueness grounds. In ''Hiibel'', the Court held that a Nevada law&lt;ref&gt;
Nev. Rev. Stat. (NRS) §171.123(3) provides that:
{{quote|The officer may detain the person pursuant to this section only to ascertain his identity and the suspicious circumstances surrounding his presence abroad. Any person so detained shall identify himself, but may not be compelled to answer any other inquiry of any peace officer.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
requiring persons detained upon reasonable suspicion of involvement in a crime to identify themselves to a peace officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures or the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]’s privilege against self incrimination. Unlike California Penal Code §647(e) as construed in ''Solomon'', the Nevada statute was apparently interpreted by the Nevada Supreme Court as requiring only that persons detained state their names.&lt;ref&gt;
See ''Hiibel v.  Dist. Ct.'', 118 Nev. 868, at 875.
&lt;/ref&gt;

California Penal Code §647(e) was repealed in 2008 at the request of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department]].&lt;ref&gt;
California Penal Code §647(e) was repealed by Ch. 302, Stats. 2007 (SB&amp;nbsp;425, Margett), [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_0401-0450/sb_425_cfa_20070423_154726_sen_comm.html at the request] of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. The [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_0401-0450/sb_425_cfa_20070618_100456_asm_comm.html analysis] on 11 June 2007 by the [[California Assembly]] Committee on Public Safety noted that "The provision has served no purpose other than to cause confusion since 1983".

'''Liberal conservatism''' is a [[list of political ideologies|political ideology]] combining [[conservatism|conservative]] policies with [[liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on ethical and social issues, or a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} It is a political position which also supports [[civil liberties]] along with some [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions and is usually regarded as a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] ideology. In [[western Europe]], especially [[northern Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and has also adopted some [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] positions.

==Overview, definitions and usage==
As both "conservatism" and "liberalism" have had different meanings over time and across countries, the term "liberal conservatism" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[conservatism]], which rejects the principle of equality as something in discordance with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the United Kingdom and the United States), the term "liberal conservatism" came to be understood simply as "conservatism" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly classical liberal values to call themselves "[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112&lt;/ref&gt; However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a "hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the term "liberal conservatism" is not used. American "[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]" happens to be quite different from the [[Liberalism in Europe|European brand]] and occupies the [[center-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] and [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those conservatives who have embraced [[national conservatism|national conservative]] views, more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] stances and/or outright [[populism]], let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. In much of [[central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, a divide between conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) and liberals persists. On the other hand, in those countries where liberal conservative movements have more recently entered the political mainstream, such as Italy and Spain, the terms "liberal" and "conservative" may be understood as synonymous. Often this involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. Compared to traditional [[centre-right politics]], such as those proposed by Christian democrats, liberal conservatism is less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] economically, favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy. In the modern European discourse, "liberal conservatism" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and environmentalism. In this sense, "liberal conservatism" has been espoused for instance by [[nordic countries|Nordic]] conservative parties (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have seen right-wing populist parties emerge to their right and do not comprise Christian democrats who form separate parties and the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[David Cameron]], who in an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010 said that he had always described himself as a "liberal conservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first speech to a Conservative Party's conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of "grand schemes to remake the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm "Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference"], BBC, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]
Historically, in the 18th and 19th centuries "[[conservatism]]" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous "[[liberalism]]" – now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] – advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].

[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]
According to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is "economics is prior to politics".&lt;ref name=vincent&gt;{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, Sandoff, "Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism." ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435–464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of current liberal conservatism as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] and the ideological outlook of centre-right parties. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] – without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term "liberal" is used to describe those with free market economic views. This is the case, for example, in [[continental Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;dq=EU+left-wing+liberal+parties&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Europe, a Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics - Hans Slomp - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk|pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Michael |title='Liberal?

{{Gaza blockade}}
'''Media reactions to the Gaza flotilla raid''' on 31 May 2010 ranged from strong support to strong condemnation of Israel. Criticism included the deaths of civilians, the execution of the raid, increased sympathy toward Israel's opponents or enemies, and increased isolation of Israel.

== Israel ==
A survey of Israeli Jews published in ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]'' on 2 June showed 94.8 percent agreeing that it was necessary to stop the boats, with 62.7 percent saying it should have been handled in a different manner. Only 8.1 percent thought Netanyahu should resign. The newspaper didn't say how many people were surveyed or give a margin of error.&lt;ref name="Calev Ben-David and Gwen Ackerman"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Calev Ben-David |author2=Gwen Ackerman |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-04/u-s-urges-gaza-aid-ship-to-change-course-avoid-confrontation.html|title=U.S. Urges Gaza Aid Ship to Change Course, Avoid Confrontation |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=4 June 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism within Israel on the flotilla operation has focused largely on the execution of the raid and not the blockade.&lt;ref name="Calev Ben-David and Gwen Ackerman"/&gt; The
Israeli media, which had initially supported the IDF action and corroborated the IDF account of the incident, later criticized the operation as having been badly handled. ''Haaretz'' said that the Israeli army had fallen into a trap set by the flotilla organizers. While Israeli soldiers were supported, the government was chastised for putting Israel in a compromising situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/01/gaza-flotilla-israeli-media-critical | title=Gaza flotilla attack: Israel's media assumes a critical stance |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 June 2010 | accessdate=2 June 2010 | location=London | first=Rachel | last=Shabi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' had a headline initially reading "Botched raid on Free Gaza Flotilla",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/.../israel-facing-international-backlash-after-nine-die-in-botched-raid-on-free-gaza-flotilla-1.293413|title=Israel facing International backlash after nine die in botched raid on free Gaza flotilla|newspaper=Haaretz|date=1 June 2010|accessdate=1 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the online headline was later changed to "Israel fears diplomatic backlash in wake of Gaza flotilla deaths",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-fears-diplomatic-backlash-in-wake-of-gaza-flotilla-deaths-1.293413|title=Israel fears diplomatic backlash in wake of Gaza flotilla deaths|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=1 June 2010|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Maariv'' went with "Flotilla Fiasco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/10208027.stm|title=Witnesses cast doubt on Israel's convoy raid account|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=1 June 2010|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli journalist [[Gideon Levy]] remarked in an opinion article, "Again Israel will pay a heavy diplomatic price, once which had not been considered ahead of time. Again, the Israeli propaganda machine has managed to convince only brainwashed Israelis, and once more no one asked the question: What was it for? Why were our soldiers thrown into this trap of pipes and ball bearings? What did we get out of it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gideon Levy|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/operation-mini-cast-lead-1.293417|title=Operation Mini Cast Lead|date=1 June 2010 |work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferhat Kentel from Taraf, compared the victims of the [[Gaza flotilla raid]] to [[Hrant Dink]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taraf.com.tr/ferhat-kentel/makale-mavi-marmara-hrant-findik-iscileri-baris.htm "Mavi Marmara, Hrant, fındık işçileri, barış, çocuklar...

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is now civilian blood between the two countries. The natural arc of relations will have to change.&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina Tavernise, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/world/europe/04turkey.html "Thousands in Turkey Mourn Victims of Israeli Raid"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cüneyt Ülsever, a commentator in the daily ''[[Hürriyet]]'', has criticized the [[İHH]], saying, "People will understand very soon that the İHH is harming Turkey, and warned that the effect of the crisis would be to persuade the West that Turkey is aligning itself with the likes of Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah."&lt;ref name="Benhorin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Benhorin|first=Yitzhak|title=Criticism in Turkey: Erdogan knew Gaza sail would be violent|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/Ext/Comp/ArticleLayout/CdaArticlePrintPreview/1,2506,L-3902451,00.html |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|last=Champion|first=Marc|title=Rift Arises in Turkey Over Reaction to Raid |date=8 June 2010 |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704749904575292780934163298 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
''The Washington Post'' and [[CBS News]] reported that American lawmakers in both parties expressed support for Israel in the wake of growing international condemnation following the raid. New York [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] Representative [[Anthony Weiner]] said "This was about instigating an altercation and they succeeded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sargent |first=Greg |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/06/anthony_weiner_strongly_defend.html |title=The Plum Line – Anthony Weiner strongly defends Israeli attack on flotilla |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montopoli |first=Brian |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20006501-503544.html |title=Politicians from Both Parties Rally Behind Israel Following Raid – Political Hotsheet |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date= 1 June 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another New York Representative, [[Gary Ackerman]], told the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] he "strongly support[s] Israel's right to defend itself, and the right of Israels naval commandos, who were executing a legal mission, to defend themselves by using force when they were brutally attacked". [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/38010.html |title=Pro-Israel Dems defend raid – Jake Sherman |newspaper=[[Politico]] |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Fox News]] United States Senator [[John McCain]] said pro-Palestinian activists "wanted to provoke an international crisis ... and they obviously succeeded", while he also questioned President Obama's commitment to Israeli security in the wake of the current crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,593879,00.html |title=Will Obama Stand By Campaign Commitment to Israel's Security? |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date= 2 June 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' asked several questions regarding the responsibility for the clash, while saying there was still much to be learned about the incident. While saying "As is so often the case with events involving Israelis and Palestinians, the competing narratives allow supporters of almost any position to hear what they want to hear." The editorial said, "This much, however, seems undeniable: Israel has done itself serious damage. [This was because] the decision to deploy armed troops to obstruct what was apparently a nonviolent mission and then, even if you accept Israel's version of events, to allow them to be drawn into a battle that left so many civilians dead, will serve as a further blow to the ailing peace process and as more fodder for those who argue that Israel's 'disproportionate' use of force is evidence of a cavalier attitude toward human life." While admitting the raid would not focus new attention on the blockade itself, the editorial also concluded in saying, "This page supports Israel's right to self-defense. We support reasonable measures to stop cross-border shelling and to keep weapons from illegally entering Gaza by land or sea. We oppose the Hamas government's consistent call for the destruction of Israel. But we also want to see an end to the blockade, which amounts to collective punishment of about 1.5 million Palestinians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/02/opinion/la-ed-israel-20100602-18 |title=Israel's self-inflicted wound |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted a statement allegedly from the flotilla organizers saying "A violent response from Israel will breathe new life into the Palestine solidarity movement, drawing attention to the blockade." They then said "There can be no excuse for the way that Israel completely mishandled the incident." And that the raid turned out to be "a grievous, self-inflicted wound. It has damaged Israel's ties with Turkey, once its closest ally in the Muslim world; given the Hamas-led government in Gaza a huge propaganda boost; and complicated peace talks with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank." It also asks "Why did Israel, which has blocked some ships but allowed others to pass, decide to take a stand now? Did it make a real effort to find a compromise with Turkey, which sanctioned the flotilla? [While] Israel has a right to stop weapons from going into Gaza, but there has been no suggestion that the ships were carrying a large cache." ''The New York Times'' concludes, "needs to state clearly that the Israeli attack was unacceptable and back an impartial international investigation. The United States should also join the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council – Britain, France, Russia and China – in urging Israel to permanently lift the blockade."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/opinion/02wed1.html "Israel and the Blockade"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another editorial said "Turkey is understandably furious" but "Turkish officials have let their anger and rhetoric go way too far.... Israel deserves to be criticized for the flotilla disaster. But gratuitously stoking anti-Israeli sentiment is irresponsible and dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/opinion/05sat2.html "Turkey's Fury"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called the raid a "disaster on every level". It also contended that Israel's "enemies could not have scripted a more bungled operation: ... setting off recriminations, policy breaches and deepening isolation for Israel ...
The peace process, already in the cryogenic stage, is at full stop ... The episode reruns old stories. Palestinian sympathizers wanted a confrontation over Israel's blockade of Hamas-run Gaza ... and ignored offers to dock in Israeli ports and ship the aid by land.... Another horrifying Mideast moment will live on to paralyze progress in the future ... The purpose was clearly to call attention to the blockade, viewed as essential by Israel to cap terrorism, and regarded as harsh and unsuccessful by critics." It concluded, "There is no other course than to admit a serious mistake. Without one, the region is condemned to a future without change or hope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/01/EDRK1DO2GN.DTL |title=Israel's raid on flotilla deepens its isolation |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[op-ed]] piece ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said "Israel's actions in boarding the flotilla of ships bound for the Gaza Strip were entirely justified and perhaps even unavoidable." Although, they add the caveat, "Unfortunately they turned into a tactical and strategic fiasco that does further damage to the Jewish State's tattered international reputation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boot |first=Max |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704366504575278621338138694?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEFTTopOpinion |title=Max Boot: Israel's Gaza Flotilla Fiasco |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= 1 June 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate ''Wall Street Journal'' article emphasized Israel's need to keep advanced weaponry from getting to Hamas: "Those who denounce Israel today ought to at least propose how they mean to keep arms from going to Hamas—or else consider the role their denunciations will play in encouraging another war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704490204575278931593199598?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Review &amp; Outlook: Israel's Gaza Choices |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= 1 June 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another article stated "the more facts that come to light about the flotilla, its passengers and their sponsors, the more it seems clear that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Ergodan's government, far more so than Israel's, must be held to account for Monday's violent episode." After describing the links between the Islamic charity that organized the flotilla and terrorist groups, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' states "No wonder that Israel was not prepared to let this flotilla break its blockade of Gaza.... Israel is entirely within its rights to prevent Hamas from linking with groups suspected of supplying arms and money to terrorists. Israel had also gone out of its way to give Turkey fair warning...." ''The Wall Street Journal'' goes on to note that Turkish foreign policy under Erdogan has become progressively radical and out of line with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703561604575282423181610814 |title=Turkey's Radical Drift |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--link is not verifiable--&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' said the raid was a "diplomatic debacle for the government of Binyamin Netanyahu". And, "Though the investigations to come will find many to blame, it's already clear that Israel's response to the pro-Palestinian flotilla was both misguided and badly executed." The editorial also said, "We have no sympathy for the motives of the participants in the flotilla.... What's plain is that the group's nominal purpose, delivering 'humanitarian' supplies to Gaza, was secondary to the aim of provoking a confrontation." While saying "Yet the threat to Israel was political rather than military. So far there's been no indication the boats carried missiles or other arms for Hamas." It continued "Mr. Netanyahu's aim should have been to prevent the militants from creating the incident they were hoping for. Allowing the boats to dock in Gaza, as Israel had done before, would have been better than sending military commandos to intercept them. The fact that the soldiers who roped down from helicopters to the lead Turkish ferry were unprepared to subdue its passengers without using lethal force only compounded the error." It concluded, "The prime minister (Netanyahu) is in a deepening hole; his only way out is to move to the center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/31/AR2010053103160.html |title=The flotilla fiasco |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another editorial stated that while "Western governments have been right to be concerned about Israel's poor judgment ... [they] ought to be at least as worried about the Turkish government ... which ... has shown a sympathy toward Islamic militants and a penchant for grotesque demagoguery toward Israel that ought to be unacceptable for a member of NATO." In reference to Turkey's statement, "Israel had no just cause to clash with 'European lawmakers, journalists, business leaders, and a Holocaust survivor,' the article noted, "there was no fighting with those people, or with five of the six boats in the fleet. All of the violence occurred aboard the Turkish ferry ''Mavi Marmara'', and all of those who were killed were members or volunteers for the Islamic 'charity' that owned the ship." The editorial claimed that the İHH "is a member of the 'Union of Good,' a coalition that was formed to provide material support to Hamas and that was named as a terrorist entity by the United States in 2008". It then said, "The relationship between Mr. Erdogan's government and the İHH ought to be one focus of any international investigation into the incident." The article claims, "In the days since an incident that the İHH admits it provoked [Erdogan] has done his best to compete with Iran's [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] and Hezbollah's [[Hassan Nasrallah]] in attacking the Jewish state [and calling] Israel's actions 'state terrorism.' [and Israel] merciless, rootless state." The editorial labeles Davutoglu's comparison saying "this attack is like 9/11 for Turkey" as an "obscene comparison". The article attacked Erdogan in saying his "attempt to exploit the incident comes only a couple of weeks after he joined Brazil's president in linking arms with Mr. Ahmadinejad, whom he is assisting in an effort to block new UN sanctions". The article mentions that Turkey's moves came despite the Obama administration overtures. "What's remarkable about his turn toward extremism is that it comes after more than a year of assiduous courting by the Obama administration, which, among other things, has overlooked his antidemocratic behavior at home, helped him combat the Kurdish PKK and catered to Turkish sensitivities about the Armenian genocide. Israel is suffering the consequences of its misjudgments and disregard of U.S. interests. Will Mr. Erdogan's behavior be without cost?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR2010060404806.html |title=Turkey's Erdogan bears responsibility in flotilla fiasco |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=5 June 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[USA Today]]'' said "In practical terms, the argument hardly matters. By opting for an assault on the six-ship convoy trying to break a 3-year-old blockade of Gaza, Israel handed its opponents a victory they could not have achieved by other means and simultaneously left itself, the United States and the struggling Mideast peace process with a huge problem.... Israel, however, remained adamant, implausibly casting the flotilla organizers as a mortal threat." They drew parallels saying "The pity is that the Israelis so lacked the same prescience, remarkable in light of their own history. No event was more important to the formation of Israel than the confrontation 63 years ago between the ship Exodus...." They believed that as a "smart solution to the current impasse.... Israel should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza on the condition that cargo first be inspected for weapons. Palestinians should accept that restriction. The United States and United Nations should try to ensure its enforcement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2010-06-02-editorial02_ST_N.htm |title=Our view on battle in the Middle East: Israel's assault on flotilla hands its enemies a victory |work=[[USA Today]] |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Toronto Sun]] said the attack damaged Israel's reputation and suggested it "might have wanted to rethink the orders that led to Monday's fatal clash". It reasoned that this, along with the [[Assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh|Dubai assassination]] of a Hamas leader, "left a trail of evidence a mile wide, to put a dent in the reputation of the country's legendary intelligence and security operations. " Adding, "For the [[Middle East peace process|peace process]], this story feels relevant in ways that may not be obvious right away, as though something has shifted. It's not as simple as Israel stumbling into a PR disaster or lost international support, as some would like to make it." However, it also said, "For the Palestinians, it underscored the division between blockaded, Hamas-run Gaza and the West Bank, which has fared better in so many ways for not being Hamas-run Gaza."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Van |first=Lisa |url=http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/lisa_vandusen/2010/06/01/14218641.html |title=Flotilla attack dents Israel's reputation |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' published an article by former Spanisn Prime Minister [[José Maria Aznar]] saying the world must support Israel because "if it goes down, we all go down. In an ideal world, the assault by Israeli commandos on the 'Mavi Marmara' would not have ended up with nine dead and a score wounded. In an ideal world, the soldiers would have been peacefully welcomed on to the ship." In the article Aznar criticised Turkey, for placing Israel "in an impossible situation" in which it would have to either give up its security or face world condemnation. Aznar concluded that Israel is the West's first line of defense, and must be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Spain PM: If Israel goes down, we all go down|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3906657,00.html |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' called the attack a "brazen act of piracy", that dealt a blow to the legitimacy of Israel's struggle. The paper continued, "Israel claims the activists had links with extremist groups and that some attacked Israeli soldiers with knives and sticks (and in some accounts the odd light firearm). Even if true, this would not justify the illegal capture of civilian ships carrying humanitarian aid in international waters, let alone the use of deadly force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cab86fe0-6cde-11df-91c8-00144feab49a.html |title=Israel is lost at sea |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Günther Nonnenmacher]] of the editorial board of the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' wrote that Israel seems to have lost all sense of proportion and would not pay attention to public opinion.

The Croatian daily ''[[Jutarnji list]]'' said Croatia was in an unenviable position because "On the one hand, the country feels responsibility towards Israel and its politics have always reflected that responsibility. On the other hand, Turkey is an important ally in the region with its influence on the reform processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and as a growing trading partner for Croatia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/General_News/2010-06-02/11375/Croatia_responds_to_Isreali_raid_on_humanitarian_flotilla |title=Croatia responds to Israeli raid on humanitarian flotilla |date=2 June 2010 |publisher=[[Croatian Times]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605075042/http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/General_News/2010-06-02/11375/Croatia_responds_to_Isreali_raid_on_humanitarian_flotilla |archivedate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wall Street Journal'' said that skepticism concerning the IHH version of events on the Mavi Marmara "appears to have accelerated as a result of unexpected criticism of the IHH's actions from Turkish moderate Islamic leader [[Fethullah Gülen]]". Turkey's [[Cuneyt Ulsever]], a commentator in the daily ''[[Hürriyet]]'', wrote, "People will understand very soon that the IHH is harming Turkey, and warned that the effect of the crisis would be to persuade the West that Turkey is aligning itself with the likes of Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah."&lt;ref name="Benhorin"/&gt; ''The Wall Street Journal'' said that skepticism concerning the IHH version of events on the Mavi Marmara "appears to have accelerated as a result of unexpected criticism of the IHH's actions from Turkish moderate Islamic leader [[Fethullah Gülen]]".

The Brazilian film maker [[Iara Lee]] wrote about her experience on the ship in an article in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' in which she said "Israel's powerful navy could have easily approached our boat and boarded it in broad daylight or pursued nonviolent options for disabling our vessel. Instead, the Israeli military launched a nighttime assault with heavily armed commandos.... I feared for the lives of my fellow passengers as I heard shots being fired on deck, and I later saw the bodies of several people killed being carried inside.... When it was over, the Israeli soldiers commandeered our ships, illegally kidnapped us from international waters, towed us to the port of Ashdod, and arrested all of us on board." Concluding, "What happened to our flotilla is happening to the people of Gaza on a daily basis. It will not stop until international law is applied to all countries, Israel included."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/04/EDC31DQ215.DTL "What happened to us is happening in Gaza"].

{{main|Medium frequency}}

'''Medium wave''' ('''MW''') is the part of the [[medium frequency]] (MF) [[radio band]] used mainly for [[AM broadcasting|AM radio broadcasting]]. For Europe the MW band ranges from 526.5&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1606.5&amp;nbsp;kHz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/103309/uk-fat-2017.pdf|title=United Kingdom Frequency Allocation Table|work=ofcom.org.uk p. 16|date=June 22, 2017|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; using channels spaced every 9&amp;nbsp;kHz, and in North America an [[Extended AM broadcast band|extended MW broadcast band]] ranges from 525&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1705&amp;nbsp;kHz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/january_2016_spectrum_wall_chart.pdf|title=United States Frequency Allocations|publisher=[[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]], [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]|date=2016|accessdate=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; using 10&amp;nbsp;kHz spaced channels.  The term is a historic one, dating from the early 20th century, when the [[radio spectrum]] was divided on the basis of the [[wavelength]] of the waves into [[long wave]] (LW), medium wave, and [[short wave radio|short wave]] (SW) radio bands.

== Propagation characteristics ==
Wavelengths in this band are long enough that radio waves are not blocked by buildings and hills and can propagate beyond the horizon following the curvature of the Earth; this is called the [[groundwave]].  Practical groundwave reception typically extends to 200–300 miles, with greater distances over terrain with higher [[ground conductivity]], and greatest distances over salt water.  Most broadcast stations use groundwave to cover their listening area.

Medium waves can also reflect off charged particle layers in the [[ionosphere]] and return to Earth at much greater distances; this is called the [[skywave]].  At night, especially in winter months and at times of low solar activity, the lower ionospheric [[D layer]] virtually disappears. When this happens, MW radio waves can easily be received many hundreds or even thousands of miles away as the signal will be reflected by the higher [[F layer]]. This can allow very long-distance broadcasting, but can also interfere with distant local stations.  Due to the limited number of available channels in the MW broadcast band, the same frequencies are re-allocated to different broadcasting stations several hundred miles apart.  On nights of good skywave propagation, the skywave signals of a distant station may interfere with the signals of local stations on the same frequency.  In North America, the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] (NARBA) sets aside certain channels for nighttime use over extended service areas via skywave by a few specially licensed AM broadcasting stations.  These channels are called [[Clear-channel station|clear channels]], and they are required to broadcast at higher powers of 10 to 50&amp;nbsp;kW.

== Use in the Americas ==
{{See also|North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement}}
Initially, broadcasting in the United States was restricted to two wavelengths: "entertainment" was broadcast at 360 meters (833&amp;nbsp;kHz), with stations required to switch to 485 meters (619&amp;nbsp;kHz) when broadcasting weather forecasts, crop price reports and other government reports.&lt;ref name="erh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/buildbcb.htm |title=Building the Broadcast Band |publisher=Earlyradiohistory.us |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement had numerous practical difficulties. Early transmitters were technically crude and virtually impossible to set accurately on their intended frequency and if (as frequently happened) two (or more) stations in the same part of the country broadcast simultaneously the resultant interference meant that usually neither could be heard clearly. The Commerce Department rarely intervened in such cases but left it up to stations to enter into voluntary timesharing agreements amongst themselves. The addition of a third  "entertainment" wavelength, 400 meters,&lt;ref name="erh" /&gt; did little to solve this overcrowding.

In 1923, the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] realized that as more and more stations were applying for commercial licenses, it was not practical to have every station broadcast on the same three wavelengths. On 15&amp;nbsp;May 1923, Commerce Secretary [[Herbert Hoover]] announced a new bandplan which set aside 81 frequencies, in 10&amp;nbsp;kHz steps, from 550&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1350&amp;nbsp;kHz  (extended to 1500, then 1600 and ultimately 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz in later years). Each station would be assigned one frequency (albeit usually shared with stations in other parts of the country and/or abroad), no longer having to broadcast [[Weather forecasting|weather]] and government reports on a different frequency than entertainment. Class A and B stations were segregated into sub-bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stay tuned: a history of American broadcasting|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-8058-2624-6|author=Christopher H. Sterling |author2=John M. Kittross|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today in most of the [[Americas]], mediumwave broadcast stations are separated by 10&amp;nbsp;kHz and have two [[sideband]]s of up to ±5&amp;nbsp;kHz in theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/octqtr/47cfr73.44.htm "Code of Federal Regulations § 73.44 AM transmission system emission limitations"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/62hRKETJE?url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/octqtr/47cfr73.44.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the rest of the world, the separation is 9&amp;nbsp;kHz, with sidebands of ±4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Both provide adequate audio quality for [[human voice|voice]], but are insufficient for [[high-fidelity]] broadcasting, which is common on the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] [[Frequency modulation|FM]] bands. In the US and Canada the maximum transmitter power is restricted to 50&amp;nbsp;kilowatts, while in [[Europe]] there are medium wave stations with transmitter power up to 2&amp;nbsp;megawatts daytime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwlist.org/mwlist_quick_and_easy.php?area=1&amp;kHz=540|title=MWLIST quick and easy: Europe, Africa and Middle East|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most United States [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] stations are required by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to shut down, reduce power, or employ a directional antenna array at night in order to avoid interference with each other due to night-time only long-distance [[skywave]] [[Radio propagation|propagation]] (sometimes loosely called ‘skip’). Those stations which shut down completely at night are often known as "daytimers". Similar regulations are in force for Canadian stations, administered by [[Industry Canada]]; however, daytimers no longer exist in Canada, the [[CJDL-FM|last station]] having signed off in 2013, after migrating to the [[FM broadcasting|FM band]].

== Use in Europe ==
{{See also|Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975|FM radio#Adoption of FM broadcasting worldwide}}
In Europe, each country is allocated a number of frequencies on which high power (up to 2&amp;nbsp;MW) can be used; the maximum power is also subject to international agreement by the '''[[International Telecommunication Union]]''' '''(ITU)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.itu.int
| title=International Telecommunication Union
| publisher=ITU
| accessdate=2009-04-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases there are two power limits: a lower one for [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] and a higher one for [[directional antenna|directional]] radiation with minima in certain directions. The power limit can also be depending on daytime and it is possible, that a station may not work at nighttime, because it would then produce too much interference. Other countries may only operate low-powered transmitters on the same frequency, again subject to agreement. For example, [[Russia]] operates a high-powered transmitter, located in its [[Kaliningrad]] [[exclave]] and used for external broadcasting, on 1386&amp;nbsp;kHz. The same frequency is also used by low-powered local radio stations in the [[United Kingdom]], which has approximately 250 medium-wave transmitters of 1&amp;nbsp;kW and over;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediumwaveradio.com/uk.php|title=MW channels in the UK|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; other parts of the United Kingdom can still receive the Russian broadcast. International mediumwave broadcasting in Europe has decreased markedly with the end of the [[Cold War]] and the increased availability of satellite and Internet TV and radio, although the cross-border reception of neighbouring countries' broadcasts by expatriates and other interested listeners still takes place.

Due to the high demand for frequencies in Europe, many countries operate single frequency networks; in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[BBC Radio Five Live]] broadcasts from various transmitters on either 693 or 909&amp;nbsp;kHz. These transmitters are carefully synchronized to minimize interference from more distant transmitters on the same frequency.

Overcrowding on the Medium wave band is a serious problem in parts of Europe contributing to the early adoption of [[Very high frequency|VHF]] [[FM broadcasting]] by many stations (particularly in Germany). However, in recent years several European countries (Including [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Poland]] and, to a lesser extent [[Switzerland]]) have started moving away from Medium wave altogether with most/all services moving exclusively to other bands (usually VHF).

In Germany, almost all Medium wave public-radio broadcasts were discontinued between 2012 and 2015 to cut costs and save energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fast alle ARD-Radiosender stellen Mittelwelle ein | publisher=heise.de |date=2015-01-06 |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Fast-alle-ARD-Radiosender-stellen-Mittelwelle-ein-2512316.html |access-date=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the last such remaining programme ([[Deutschlandradio]]) being switched off on 31 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Marcus |last=Heumann |title=Abschied von der Mittelwelle.

== Stereo and digital transmissions ==
{{See also|AM stereo}}
[[File:Tandy AM Stereo.jpg|thumb|Realistic TM-152 AM stereo tuner c. 1988]]
Stereo transmission is possible and offered by some stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Australia, The Philippines, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Italy and France.  However, there have been multiple standards for [[AM stereo]]. [[C-QUAM]] is the official standard in the United States as well as other countries, but receivers that implement the technology are no longer readily available to consumers.  Used receivers with AM Stereo can be found.  Names such as "FM/AM Stereo" or "AM &amp; FM Stereo" can be misleading and usually do not signify that the radio will decode C-QUAM AM stereo, whereas a set labeled "FM Stereo/AM Stereo" or "AMAX Stereo" will support AM stereo.

In September 2002, the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] approved the proprietary [[iBiquity]] [[in-band on-channel]] (IBOC) [[HD Radio]] system of [[digital audio broadcasting]], which is meant to improve the audio quality of signals.  The [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) system standardised by ETSI supports stereo and is the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] approved system for use outside [[North America]] and [[United States territory|U.S. territories]].  Some HD Radio receivers also support C-QUAM AM stereo, although this feature is usually not advertised by the manufacturer.

==Antennas==
[[Image:Wire T antenna station WBZ 1925.jpg|thumb|Multiwire [[T antenna]] of radio station WBZ, Massachusetts, USA, 1925.  T antennas were the first antennas used for medium wave broadcasting, and are still used at lower power]] 
For broadcasting, [[mast radiator]]s are the most common type of antenna used, consisting of a steel lattice [[guyed mast]] in which the mast structure itself is used as the antenna. Stations broadcasting with low power can use masts with heights of a quarter-[[wavelength]] (about 310 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) to 5/8 wavelength (225 electrical degrees; about 440 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer), while high power stations mostly use half-wavelength to 5/9 wavelength. The usage of masts taller than 5/9 wavelength (200 electrical degrees; about 410 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) with high power gives a poor vertical radiation pattern, and 195 electrical degrees (about 400 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) is generally considered ideal in these cases. Usually mast antennas are series-excited (base driven); the feedline is attached to the mast at the base. The base of the antenna is at high electrical potential and must be supported on a ceramic [[electrical insulator|insulator]] to isolate it from the ground. Shunt-excited masts, in which the base of the mast is at a [[node (physics)|node]] of the standing wave at ground potential and so does not need to be insulated from the ground, have fallen into disuse, except in cases of exceptionally high power, 1 MW or more, where series excitation might be impractical.  If grounded masts or towers are required, [[cage aerial|cage]] or long-wire aerials are used. Another possibility consists of feeding the mast or the tower by cables running from the tuning unit to the guys or crossbars at a certain height.

Directional aerials consist of [[tower array|multiple masts]], which need not to be of the same height. It is also possible to realize directional aerials for mediumwave with cage aerials where some parts of the cage are fed with a certain phase difference.

For medium-wave (AM) broadcasting, quarter-wave masts are between {{convert|153|ft|m}} and {{convert|463|ft|m}} high, depending on the frequency.  Because such tall masts can be costly and uneconomic, other types of antennas are often used, which employ capacitive top-loading ([[electrical lengthening]]) to achieve equivalent signal strength with vertical masts shorter than a quarter wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, W.L 1968, ''Antenna Engineering'', McGraw Hill Book Company, Section 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;   A "top hat" of radial wires is occasionally added to the top of mast radiators, to allow the mast to be made shorter.  For local broadcast stations and amateur stations of under 5&amp;nbsp;kW, [[T-antenna|T- and L-antennas]] are often used, which consist of one or more horizontal wires suspended between two masts, attached to a vertical radiator wire.  A popular choice for lower-powered stations is the [[umbrella antenna]], which needs only one mast one-tenth wavelength or less in height.  This antenna uses a single mast insulated from ground and fed at the lower end against ground.  At the top of the mast, radial top-load wires are connected (usually about six) which slope downwards at an angle of 40–45 degrees as far as about one-third of the total height, where they are terminated in insulators and thence outwards to [[Earth anchor|ground anchors]].  Thus the umbrella antenna uses the guy wires as the top-load part of the antenna.  In all these antennas the smaller [[radiation resistance]] of the short radiator is increased by the [[capacitance]] added by the wires attached to the top of the antenna.

In some rare cases [[dipole antenna]]s are used, which are slung between two masts or towers. Such antennas are intended to radiate a [[skywave]]. The medium-wave transmitter at [[Transmitter Berlin-Britz|Berlin-Britz]] for transmitting RIAS used a cross dipole mounted on five 30.5-metre-high guyed masts to transmit the skywave to the ionosphere at nighttime.

===Receiving antennas===
[[Image:Ferritantenne 2.jpg|thumb|Typical ferrite rod antenna used in AM radio receivers]]
Because at these frequencies atmospheric noise is far above the receiver [[signal to noise ratio]], inefficient antennas much smaller than a wavelength can be used for receiving.  For reception at frequencies below 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz, which includes long and medium waves, [[loop antenna]]s are popular because of their ability to reject locally generated noise.  By far the most common antenna for broadcast reception is the [[Ferrite rod|ferrite-rod antenna]], also known as a loopstick antenna.  The high permeability ferrite core allows it to be compact enough to be enclosed inside the radio's case and still have adequate sensitivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6991">'''Mexican labor law''' governs the process by which workers in [[Mexico]] may organize [[labor union]]s, engage in [[collective bargaining]], and [[strike action|strike]]. Current [[labor law]] reflects the historic interrelation between the state and the [[Confederation of Mexican Workers]], the labor confederation officially aligned with the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI), which ruled Mexico under various names for more than seventy years. 

While the law, on its face, promises workers the right to strike and to organize, in practice it makes it difficult or impossible for independent unions to organize while condoning the corrupt practices of many existing unions and the employers with which they deal.

==History of Mexican labor law==
The current system originated in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910–1920, which produced the Constitution of 1917. Article 123 of that Constitution gave workers the right to organize labor unions and to strike. It also provided protection for women and children, the [[eight-hour day]], and a living wage. 

The Constitution's promised rights, however, remained mere promises until 1931, when the government enacted the Ley Federal de Trabajo or Federal Labor Law. The LFT established Juntas de Conciliación y Arbitraje (the Boards of Conciliation and Arbitration), made up of representatives of the government, employers and labor unions.

==Organizing, elections and strikes==
In order to participate in this system, a union must have a legal registration (registro), must have an officially recognized right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements (titularidad), and must periodically re-register its officers and be accepted by the state (toma de nota). This system can be used to hobble independent unions not associated with the CTM or other federations that have established relations with the state, since all three members of these boards often have self-interested reasons for denying or delaying registration to rival unions.

Employers can also avoid unionization by entering into "protection contracts" with "sindicatos blancos" or "white unions", often before a plant is ever built. Such contracts frequently give the union a [[closed shop]], which authorizes the union to demand that the employer fire a worker who is not a member in the union in good standing; that power can, in turn, be used to single out employees who seek to organize independent unions for termination. Some observers, including the independent Unión Nacional de Trabajadores (http://www.unt.org.mx) or UNT, estimate that between eighty and ninety percent of all collective bargaining agreements in Mexico fall into this category. 

Employees are not always aware that they are covered by a protection contract or that they are represented by a union; while the ghost union may have registered with the Board and filed its contract with it, those records are not made public. An outside union that has filed a petition seeking to organize workers may have its petition dismissed if it is unaware that another union is already recognized or if it does not list the correct name or legal address of the incumbent union.

If an outside union challenging a recognized union is able to obtain registration, then it must go through an election to oust the incumbent. Local Boards often delay such elections for long periods; when they do take place they are by voice vote, rather than secret ballot, in elections held in the workplace under the supervision of a representative of the labour board, the employer, the official union and the independent union. In recent contested elections workers have been required to pass through a gauntlet of armed representatives of the incumbent union in order to report for work and to vote in their workplace.  Even if the independent union wins the election, the original contract remains in place until its expiration. 

While Mexican labor law gives workers powerful rights to strike, barring employers from hiring replacement workers or operating during a strike, those rights are dependent on official approval from the Board. These local Boards frequently declare strikes to be "inexistente" or non-existent, depriving striking workers of all their legal protections. As a result, while labour protests and work stoppages are frequent in Mexico, legal strikes are rare.

==Proposals for change==
The PRI and Mexican employers' associations started floating proposals to enhance productivity of Mexican industry by allowing it more "flexibility" during the late 1980s, when "technocrats" such as [[Miguel de la Madrid]], [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] and [[Ernesto Zedillo]] were in command of the PRI. Those proposals made no headway, however, until after the election of [[Vicente Fox Quesada]] of the Partido Acción Nacional, or PAN, in 2000.  Fox's Secretary of Labor, Carlos Abascal Carranza, a former head of one of the largest employer associations, initiated discussions in 2001 with employer associations and the official and independent union confederations aimed at achieving a consensus proposal for labor law reform.

The Abascal proposal presented in 2002, however, would tighten government control of unions and collective bargaining, without taking any steps to make information about unions' collective bargaining agreements or their activities available to affected workers or the public or make the organizing process any less cumbersome. On the contrary, the proposed reforms would heighten the risks for workers seeking to organize by requiring independent unions to submit the name and address of each of their members to the local Boards, which would then have the power to investigate the authenticity of their signatures. 

The reforms would also favor existing unions by barring the board from considering more than one election petition at a time and tightening jurisdictional rules defining which labor organization can represent which workers, according to their craft, enterprise and company, making it impossible for some independent unions to challenge incumbents.

Opponents of the law have challenged it under the provisions of the labor side letter to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). While the CTM originally supported the reforms, some unions within the official labor movement have expressed reservations about it. The proposals are currently at a standstill.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5598">[[File:Flag of Zaire.svg|thumb|200px|The flag of [[Zaire]] and of the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] is a symbol of Mobutism.]]
'''Mobutism''', also spelled '''Mobutuism''', was an official party ideology of the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] (''Mouvement Populaire de la Revolution'', MPR) as well as the official state ideology in [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) during the latter half of the 20th century. Mobutism encompassed and glorified the thoughts, visions, and policies of Zairian president and self-proclaimed "Father of the Nation," [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]. The ideology included such major Mobutu initiatives as "[[Zairianization]]."

The [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] (MPR) was entrenched as the single legal political party in a [[one-party state]] in Zaire.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Crawford; Turner, Thomas. ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State''. University of Wisconsin Press, 1985. Pp. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally Mobutu designed the [[constitution of Zaire]] to have a figurehead opposition party but later claimed that the constitution only recommended but did not demand this and thus a one-party state was created and all other political parties were banned afterwards in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iPuTjqaNOp8C&amp;lpg=PA480&amp;dq=mobutu%20ban%20political%20parties%201966&amp;pg=PA480#v=onepage&amp;q=mobutu%20ban%20political%20parties%201966&amp;f=true ''Encyclopedia of Conflict Since World War II''], James Ciment, Kenneth Hill
Routledge, 1999, page 480&lt;/ref&gt; The ideology laid down in the [[Manifesto of N'sele]], incorporated "[[Zairian nationalism|nationalism]]," "[[revolution]]," and "[[Authenticité (Zaire)|authenticity]]."&lt;ref&gt;Young, Crawford; Turner, Thomas. ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State''. University of Wisconsin Press, 1985. Pp. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Revolution was described as a "truly national revolution, essentially pragmatic," which called for "the repudiation of both capitalism and communism," favoured "national revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Young, Crawford; Turner, Thomas. ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State''. University of Wisconsin Press, 1985. Pp. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifesto of N'sele also laid out the intentions of the government which included expansion of the national government's authority, a program committed to upgrading labour standards, having the country gain economic independence, and the creation of an "authentic nationalism" in Zaire.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Andrew. Language and Nationality in Africa. Oxford University Press, 2008. Pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobutu led the MPR and Zaire as a dictator, and denounced the idea of multiple leaders and political parties in the country saying: "In our African tradition there are never two chiefs….That is why we Congolese, in the desire to conform to the traditions of our continent, have resolved to group all the energies of the citizens of our country under the banner of a single national party."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aipzAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=That+is+why+we+Congolese%2C+in+the+desire+to+conform+to+the+traditions+of+our+continent%2C+have+resolved+to+group+all+the+energies+of+the+citizens+of+our+country+under+the+banner+of+a+single+national+party&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22a+single+national+party%22 ''The rise and decline of the Zairian state''], Crawford Young, Thomas Turner, University of Wisconsin Press, 1985, page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobutu and the MPR were presented in propaganda as being attributed to the divine and sought to replace [[Christianity]] in Zaire with a [[Cult of Personality|religious devotion]] to Mobutu and the MPR with interior minister Engulu Baanga Mpongo once saying to supporters of the MPR: "God has sent a great prophet, our prestigious Guide Mobutu. This prophet is our liberator, our Messiah. Our Church is the MPR. Its chief is Mobutu. We respect him like one respects a Pope. Our gospel is Mobutuism. That is why the crucifixes must be replaced by the image of our Messiah."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1pizmqizePEC&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;ots=3SnnKWmIBe&amp;dq=Our%20gospel%20is%20Mobutuism.%20That%20is%20why%20the%20crucifixes%20must%20be%20replaced%20by%20the%20image%20of%20our%20Messiah&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q=Our%20gospel%20is%20Mobutuism.%20That%20is%20why%20the%20crucifixes%20must%20be%20replaced%20by%20the%20image%20of%20our%20Messiah&amp;f=false ''The Fate of Africa. Martin Meredith''], Public Affairs, 2006, page 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobutu and the MPR pursued a national cultural revival program in Zaire called ''Authenticité'' beginning in 1967 which sought to purge colonial European culture from Zaire and restore local culture, such as by forbidding Christian names and culture while promoting local African names and culture as well as forbidding [[Western world|western]] suits and creating a state-authorized uniform called the ''[[abacost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TKa2e3UvGMkC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=abacost%20mobutu&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=abacost%20mobutu&amp;f=false ''The Tragic State of the Congo: From Decolonization to Dictatorship''], Jeanne M. Haskin, Algora Publishing, 2005, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideology survives today in such organizations as [[Nzanga Mobutu]]'s [[Union of Mobutuist Democrats]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">'''''Nokku kooli''''' is an euphimism for extortion by organized labour unions  in [[Kerala]] under which wages are paid to trade union activists for allowing common householders/ investors/builders to unload belongings/materials using machines or their own labour.&lt;ref name="Zach"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.indiaabroad-digital.com/indiaabroad/20110415?pg=31#pg31 | title='When elections come, Congress party gets suicidal tendencies' - Interview with Paul Zacharia | publisher=India Abroad | date=2011-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens with the tacit support of political parties including those in government. In [[Malayalam]], 'nokku kooli', translates into 'gawking wages' or 'wages for (just) looking on'.&lt;ref name="Outlook-2008"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?237419 | title=Men (Not) At Work | publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]] | date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had gained widespread notoriety all over Kerala, but the practice has been considerably curtailed in recent times.

''Nokku kooli'' often enjoys a quasi-statutory status. The wages list finalized by the Head-load Workers Welfare Fund Board in an industrial zone in [[Kochi]] shows Rs. 200 per load of [[ready-mix concrete]]. This, when the entire process is machine-driven. Similarly, one tipper load (lorry which can mechanically tip the load) fetches Rs. 15 for the union. At least 1,000 tipper lorries are at work in the [[Vallarpadom]] container trans-shipment terminal site in [[Kochi]]. Yet another example was in [[Idukki]]. Recently, the state Power minister [[A.K. Balan]] publicly censured head-load workers who took Rs 3,000 each as ''nokku kooli'' while cranes installed some 14 turbines, each weighing 80 tonnes, atop 120-ft towers, for a windmill farm.&lt;ref name="Outlook-2008" /&gt;

== Modus Operandi ==

The ''[[modus operandi]]'' is usually as follows: At almost every industrial zone and residential area in the state, worker's unions posts "lookouts" whose task is to spot vehicles carrying goods. Once a quarry is spotted the news is quickly conveyed to all available union members, who then descend ''en masse'' to the place where the goods are to be offloaded. Heated negotiations then commence. The leaders often demand extortionist rates for doing the work. Their demand for a "right to work" is often not matched by an obligation to be efficient. So the usual compromise is for pay the union workers a certain amount for just watching - or gawking - while the work is done mechanically or using in-house workers. The employer, of course, loses both ways while making a double payment for the same work - he pays one group of "workers" for not working and another for actually getting it done.&lt;ref name="Hindu-CITU"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/article414036.ece | title=News: States: Kerala | publisher=The Hindu | work=CITU opposes ‘nokku kooli’ | date=April 28, 2010 | accessdate=December 9, 2011 | author=(Special Correspondent of THE HINDU)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Malayalam]] Writer, Paul Zakaria, illustrates Nokku Kooli with the following example:

:''You are, say, moving house. The worker comrades demand a prodigious sum to load/unload; so you decide to do it yourself with help from friends. The comrades look on from a distance; when you’re done, they ask to be paid the demanded wages. If you don’t pay up, there is a bit of violence and you get hurt. The revolution in Kerala says the worker must be paid even if he doesn’t work. That is a kind of workers’ paradise even Marx did not anticipate.''&lt;ref name="PaulZ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/selfdestruct-m/953532/0 | title= Self Destruct | publisher= The Indian Express | work= | date=25 May 2012 | accessdate=25 May 2012 | author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely recognized as an unethical labour practice,&lt;ref name="Outlook-2008" /&gt; it is cited as one of the reasons for poor industrial development in Kerala. Following a recent change of government in the state, the new Labour Minister [[Shibu Baby John]] has said attempts to end the menace of ‘nokku kooli' will commence as part of the department's agenda for the 100-day development program of the State government declared by Chief Minister [[Oommen Chandy]].&lt;ref name="The Hindu"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/06/04/stories/2011060453090400.htm | title=Campaign to end ‘nokkukooli'  | publisher=[[The Hindu]] | date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move by the government has been substantial success and various cities and districts have been declared Nokku Kooli-free.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. On 2018 May 1, an official release from the Kerala CM [[Pinarayi Vijayan]] office said that trade unions had offered full support to the state government's move to end 'nokku kooli' in the state and 'Nokku kooli' to become history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Nokku kooli' to become history in Kerala on May Day: CM Pinarayi|url=https://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2018/03/08/nokku-kooli-end-kerala-may-day.html|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=OnManorama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial Intervention==
The Labour Department of the state government of Kerala has taken steps to end this illegal practice; including depriving the workers involved, of their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/labour-department-cracks-down-on-nokku-kooli/article2899336.ece Labour Department cracks down on nokku kooli]&lt;/ref&gt; There were interventions from [[Kerala High Court]] stating that case would be filed against those demanding ‘nokku kooli’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asianetindia.com/implement-goonda-act-against-nokku-kooli-hc/ Implement goonda-act against nokku kooli: HC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The state government unified the loading and unloading charges in the state after reviewing and revising the prevailing charges. A scheme was launched allowing the advance remittance of loading/unloading charges through [[State Bank of Travancore]] branches. This fare would be claimed by the workers from the bank through "Headload Workers Welfare Fund Board" offices.

This scheme is launched in the capital city [[Thiruvananthapuram]](Trivandrum), which is declared as the first ‘Nokkukooli-free’ city in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lc.kerala.gov.in/index.php/component/content/article/63.html Thiruvananthapuram-The First ‘Nokkukooli-free’ City]&lt;/ref&gt; Government is in the process of launching this scheme all over the state starting with the five municipal corporations in the state. [[Kochi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/Ernakulam-is-now-Nokku-kooli-free/articleshow/11492754.cms Ernakulam is now Nokku kooli free]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kozhikode]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/kozhikode-to-be-third-nokku-koolifree-city/221266-60-116.html kozhikode to be third nokku kooli free city]&lt;/ref&gt; was declared ‘Nokkukooli-free’ subsequently.

[[Image:DeathsLaboratory.gif|thumb|200px|[[E. W. Kemble]]'s "Death's Laboratory" on the cover of ''[[Collier's]]'' (June 3, 1905)]]
A '''patent medicine''', also known as a '''nostrum''' (from the Latin ''nostrum remedium'', or "our remedy") is a commercial product advertised (usually heavily) as a purported [[over-the-counter medicine]], without regard to its effectiveness.

Patent medicines were one of the first major product categories that the [[advertising]] industry promoted; patent medicine promoters pioneered many advertising and sales techniques that were later used for other products.&lt;ref&gt;See Conroy (2009), passim. for an account of [[E. Virgil Neal]], patent medicine manufacturer and promoter (e.g. the tonic, ''nuxated iron'', which was supposedly used by [[Ty Cobb]], [[Jack Dempsey]], and [[Pope Benedict XV]]), Madison Avenue pioneer, and mentor of [[Carl R. Byoir]].&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=June 2015}} Patent medicine advertising often marketed products as being [[panacea (medicine)|medical panaceas]] (or at least a treatment for a large number of diseases) and emphasized exotic ingredients and endorsements from purported experts or celebrities, which may or may have not been true. Patent medicines were increasingly constricted in the United States in the early 20th century as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and [[Federal Trade Commission]] added ever-increasing regulations to prevent fraud, unintentional [[poison]]ing and deceptive advertising. Sellers of [[liniment]]s, claimed to contain [[snake oil]] and falsely promoted as a cure-all, made the ''snake oil salesman'' a lasting symbol for a [[charlatan]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Patent medicines and advertising ==
[[Image:Mugwump.png|right|thumb|150px|Mugwump, an invented name]]
The phrase "patent medicine" comes from the late 17th century&lt;ref name="NationalMuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Balm of America: Patent Medicine Collection &gt; History|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/balm-of-america-patent-medicine-collection?ogmt_page=balm-of-america-history|website=[[National Museum of American History]]|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketing of medical elixirs, when those who found favour with [[monarch|royalty]] were issued ''[[letters patent]]'' authorising the use of the royal endorsement in advertising. Few if any of the nostrums were actually patented; [[chemical patent]]s did not come into use in the United States until 1925.  Furthermore, patenting one of these remedies would have meant publicly disclosing its ingredients, which most promoters sought to avoid.

Advertisement kept these patent medications in the public eye and gave the belief that no disease was beyond the cure of patent medication. “The medicine man’s key task quickly became not production but sales, the job of persuading ailing citizens to buy his particular brand from among the hundreds offered. Whether unscrupulous or self-deluded, nostrum makers set about this task with cleverness and zeal.”&lt;ref&gt;Young, James Harvey. 1961. The Toadstool Millionaires; a social history of patent medicines in America before Federal regulation. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the compounders of such nostrums used a primitive version of [[brand]]ing to distinguish their products from the crowd of their competitors.  Many extant brands from the era live on today in brands such as [[Luden's]] cough drops, [[Lydia E. Pinkham]]'s vegetable compound for women, [[Fletcher's Castoria]] and even [[Angostura bitters]], which was once marketed as a [[stomachic]]. Though sold at high prices, many of these products were made from cheap ingredients.  Their composition was well known within the [[pharmacy]] trade, and druggists manufactured and sold (for a slightly lower price) medicines of almost identical composition. To protect profits, the branded medicine advertisements emphasized brand names, and urged the public to "accept no substitutes".

With the rising popularity of patent medicine in advertising, [[The Kellogg Company]] of Canada adopted similar tactics, publishing a book named ''A New Way of Living'' that would show readers "how to achieve a new way of living; how to preserve vitality; how to maintain enthusiasm and energy; how to get the most out of life because of a physical ability to enjoy it." It touted the All-Bran cereal as the secret to leading "normal" lives free of constipation.&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg Company of Canada. 1932. [https://fishercollections.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/patent%3APatMed_a_0214 ''A New Way of Living.''] Kellogg Company of Canada. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

At least in the earliest days, the history of patent medicines is coextensive with scientific medicine.  Empirical medicine, and the beginning of the application of the [[scientific method]] to medicine, began to yield a few orthodoxly acceptable herbal and mineral drugs for the [[physician]]'s  arsenal.  These few remedies, on the other hand, were inadequate to cover the bewildering variety of [[disease]]s and [[symptom]]s.  Beyond these patches of evidence-based application, people used other methods, such as [[occultism]]; the "[[doctrine of signatures]]"&amp;nbsp;– essentially, the application of [[sympathetic magic]] to [[pharmacology]]&amp;nbsp;– held that nature had hidden clues to medically effective drugs in their resemblances to the human body and its parts.  This led medical men to hope, at least, that, say, [[walnut]] shells might be good for [[skull fracture]]s.  [[Homeopathy]], the notion that illness is binary and can be treated by ingredients that cause the same symptoms in healthy people, was another outgrowth of this early era of medicine. Given the state of the [[pharmacopoeia]], and patients' demands for something to take, physicians began making "blunderbuss" concoctions of various drugs, proven and unproven.  These concoctions were the ancestors of the several nostrums.

Touting these nostrums was one of the first major projects of the advertising industry.  The marketing of nostrums under implausible claims has a long history.  In [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), allusion is made to the sale of medical compounds claimed to be universal [[panacea]]s:

:''As to Squire Western, he was seldom out of the sick-room, unless when he was engaged either in the field or over his bottle. Nay, he would sometimes retire hither to take his beer, and it was not without difficulty that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take his beer too: for no [[quackery|quack]] ever held his nostrum to be a more general panacea than he did this; which, he said, had more virtue in it than was in all the [[Medication|physic]] in an [[apothecary]]'s shop.''

[[File:Tuberclecide advertisement in The Grizzly Bear April 1914.png|thumb|left|1914 advertisement implying approval by the U.S. government]]
Within the English-speaking world, patent medicines are as old as [[journalism]].  "Anderson's Pills" were first made in [[England]] in the 1630s; the recipe was allegedly learned in [[Venice]] by a [[Scotland|Scot]] who claimed to be physician to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].  [[Daffy's Elixir]] was invented about 1647 and remained popular in Britain and the USA until the late 19th century. The use of "letters patent" to obtain exclusive marketing rights to certain labelled formulas and their marketing fueled the circulation of early newspapers.  The use of invented names began early.  In 1726 a patent was also granted to the makers of "Dr. Bateman's Pectoral Drops"; at least on the documents that survive, there was no Dr. Bateman.  This was the enterprise of a [[Benjamin Okell]] and a group of promoters who owned a warehouse and a print shop to promote the product.

A number of [[United States|American]] institutions owe their existence to the patent medicine industry, most notably a number of the older [[almanac]]s, which were originally given away as [[promotional item]]s by patent medicine manufacturers.  Perhaps the most successful industry that grew up out of the business of patent medicine advertisements, though, was founded by [[William H. Gannett]] in [[Maine]] in 1866.  There were few circulating [[newspaper]]s in Maine in that era, so Gannett founded a periodical, ''Comfort'', whose chief purpose was to propose the merits of ''Oxien'', a nostrum made from the fruit of the [[baobab]] tree, to the rural folks of Maine.    Gannett's newspaper became the first publication of [[Guy Gannett Communications]], which eventually owned four Maine dailies and several television stations. (The family-owned firm is unrelated to the [[Gannett Corporation]] that publishes ''[[USA Today]]''.) An early pioneer in the use of [[advertising]] to promote patent medicine was New York businessman [[Benjamin Brandreth]], whose "Vegetable Universal Pill" eventually became one of the best-selling patent medicines in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Kickapoo Sagwa.png|thumb|Kickapoo Indian "Sagwa", sold at [[medicine show]]s]]
Another publicity method – undertaken mostly by smaller firms – was the ''[[medicine show]],'' a traveling [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] of sorts that offered [[vaudeville]]-style entertainments on a small scale, and climaxed in a pitch for some sort of cure-all nostrum.  "[[bodybuilding|Muscle man]]" acts were especially popular on these tours, for this enabled the [[sales]]man to tout the physical vigour the product supposedly offered.  The showmen frequently employed [[shill]]s, who stepped forward from the crowd to offer "unsolicited" testimonials about the benefits of the medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wellmade Remedies|url=https://www.wellmaderemedies.com/ |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, the nostrum was manufactured and bottled in the wagon in which the show travelled. The [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] Indian Medicine Company became one of the largest and most successful medicine show operators.  Their shows had an American Indian or Wild West theme, and employed many [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] as spokespeople such as the [[Modoc War]] scout [[Donald McKay (scout)|Donald McKay]].&lt;ref name="McFarland"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McFarland|first1=Jeremy Agnew|title=Medicine in the Old West: A History, 1850–1900|date=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786456031|pages=190–191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3N2CB-8hdNUC&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "medicine show" lived on in [[American folklore]] and [[Western movie]]s long after they vanished from public life.

== Ingredients and their uses ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
[[Image:SickMadeWell.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sick Made Well, Weak Made Strong, Elixir of Life, etc. Typical ad for patent medicine.]]

===Supposed ingredients===
[[File:Kilmer's Swamp Root.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kilmer's [[Swamp Root]]]]
Some level of exoticism and mystery in the contents of the preparation was deemed desirable by their promoters.  Unlikely ingredients such as the baobab fruit in ''Oxien'' were a recurring theme.  A famous patent medicine of the period was ''[[Dr. Kilmer's Swamp Root]]''; unspecified roots found in swamps had remarkable effects on the kidneys, according to its literature.

Native American themes were also useful: natives, imagined to be [[noble savage]]s, were thought to be in tune with [[nature]], and heirs to a body of traditional lore about [[herb]]al remedies and natural cures.  One example of this approach from the period was ''Kickapoo Indian Sagwa'', a product of the [[Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company]] of [[Connecticut]] (completely unrelated to the real [[Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma|Kickapoo]] Indian tribe of [[Oklahoma]]), supposedly based on a Native American recipe.  This nostrum was the inspiration for [[Al Capp]]'s "Kickapoo Joy Juice," featured in the [[comic strip]], "[[Li'l Abner]]".  Another benefit of claiming traditional native origins was that it was nearly impossible to disprove.  A good example of this is the story behind [[Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills]], which was the mainstay of the Comstock patent medicine business.  According to text on a wrapper on every box of pills, Dr. Morse was a trained medical doctor who enriched his education by travelling extensively throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe.  He supposedly lived among the American Indians for three years, during which time he discovered the healing properties of various plants and roots that he eventually combined into [[Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills]].  No one knows if Dr. Morse ever actually existed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Other promoters took an opposite tack from timeless herbal wisdom.  Nearly any scientific discovery or exotic locale could inspire a key ingredient or principle in a patent medicine.  Consumers were invited to invoke the power of [[electromagnetism]] to heal their ailments.  In the nineteenth century, [[electricity]] and [[radio]] were gee-whiz scientific advances that found their way into patent medicine advertising, especially after [[Luigi Galvani]] showed that electricity influenced the [[muscle]]s.  Devices meant to electrify the body were sold; nostrums were compounded that purported to attract electrical energy or make the body more conductive.  "Violet ray machines" were sold as rejuvenation devices, and balding men could seek solace in an "electric fez" purported to regrow hair.  [[Albert Abrams]] was a well known practitioner of [[Energy medicine|electrical quackery]], claiming the ability to diagnose and treat diseases over long distances by radio.  In 1913 the quack [[John R. Brinkley]], calling himself an "Electro Medic Doctor," began injecting men with colored water as a virility cure, claiming it was "electric medicine from Germany." (Brinkley would go on to even greater infamy through transplanting goat testicles into men's scrotums as a virility treatment.)

Towards the end of the period, a number of [[radioactivity|radioactive]] medicines, containing [[uranium]] or [[radium]], were marketed.  Some of these actually contained the ingredients promised, and there were a number of tragedies among their devotees.  Most notoriously, [[steel]] heir [[Eben Byers|Eben McBurney Byers]] was a supporter of the popular radium water [[Radithor]], developed by the medical [[con artist]] [[William J. A. Bailey]].  Byers contracted fatal radium poisoning and had to have his jaw removed in an unsuccessful attempt to save him from bone cancer after drinking nearly 1400 bottles of Bailey's "radium water."  Water irradiators were sold that promised to infuse water placed within them with [[radon]], which was thought to be healthy at the time.

===Actual ingredients===
Contrary to what is often believed, some patent medicines did, in fact, deliver the promised results, albeit with very dangerous ingredients.  For example, medicines advertised as "infant soothers" contained [[opium]], then a legal drug. Those advertised as "catarrh snuff" contained [[cocaine]], also legal.  While various herbs, touted or alluded to, were talked up in the advertising, their actual effects often came from [[procaine]] extracts or [[ethanol|grain alcohol]]. Those containing opiates were at least effective in relieving pain, coughs, and diarrhea, though they could result in addiction. This hazard was sufficiently well known that many were advertised as causing none of the harmful effects of opium (though many of those so advertised actually did contain opium).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Until the twentieth century, alcohol was the most controversial ingredient, for it was widely recognised that the "medicines" could continue to be sold for their alleged curative properties even in [[prohibition]] states and counties.  Many of the medicines were in fact [[liqueur]]s of various sorts, flavoured with herbs said to have [[medicinal properties]]. Some examples include:

*''Cannabis indica'',  the low growing variants of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] with a high level of [[THC]].
*''Peruna'' was a famous "Prohibition tonic," weighing in at around 18% grain alcohol.  A nostrum known as "[[Jamaican ginger]]" was ordered to change its formula by Prohibition officials. To fool a chemical test some vendors added a toxic chemical, [[tricresyl phosphate]], an [[organophosphate]] compound that produced [[organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy]], a chronic nerve damage syndrome similar to that caused by certain [[nerve agent]]s. Unwary imbibers suffered a form of [[paralysis]] that came to be known as ''jake-leg''&lt;ref&gt;Baum, Dan; "Jake Leg", [[The New Yorker]], Sept. 15, 2003: 50-57.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Clark Stanley, the "Rattlesnake King", produced Stanley's snake oil, publicly processing [[rattlesnake]]s at the  [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago. His liniment, when seized and tested by the federal government in 1917, was found to contain [[mineral oil]], 1% fatty oil, red [[chile pepper|pepper]], [[turpentine]] and [[camphor]]. This is not too unlike modern [[capsaicin]] and camphor liniments.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*The original formulation of [[Coca-Cola]] used [[coca]] leaves, an indirect source of [[cocaine]], and was marketed as an [[energy drink|energy rejuvenator]]. Unlike most patent medicines of its era, it did not contain alcohol.
*Some herbal preparations included [[laxative]]s such as [[Senna (herb)|senna]] or [[diuretic]]s, to give the compounds some obvious physical effects.  Narcotics and stimulants at least had the virtue of making the people who took them feel better.

When journalists and physicians began focusing on the narcotic contents of the patent medicines, some of their makers began replacing the opium [[tincture]] [[laudanum]] with [[acetanilide]], a particularly [[toxin|toxic]] [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] with [[analgesic]] as well as [[antipyretic]] properties that had been introduced into medical practice under the name ''Antifebrin'' by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Cahn | first1 = A. | last2 = Hepp | first2 = P. | title = Das Antifebrin, ein neues Fiebermittel | journal = Centralbl. Klin. Med. | year = 1886 | volume = 7 | pages = 561–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But this ingredient change probably killed more of the nostrum's users than the original narcotics did, since acetanilide not only caused an alarming [[cyanosis]] due to [[methemoglobinemia]] but was later discovered to cause [[liver]] and [[kidney]] damage.&lt;ref name="Ax&amp;Brodie"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Brodie | first1 = B.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. | year = 1948 | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–28 | pmid = 18885610}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The occasional reports of acetanilide-induced cyanosis prompted the search for supposedly less toxic aniline derivatives, such as [[phenacetin]].&lt;ref name=pmid17227290&gt;{{citation | last1 = Bertolini | first1 = A. | last2 = Ferrari | first2 = A. | last3 = Ottani | first3 = A. | last4 = Guerzoni | first4 = S. | last5 = Tacchi | first5 = R. | last6 = Leone | first6 = S. | title = Paracetamol: new vistas of an old drug | journal = CNS Drug Reviews | year = 2006 | volume = 12 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 250–75 | pmid = 17227290 | doi = 10.1111/j.1527-3458.2006.00250.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was ultimately established in 1948 that acetanilide was mostly [[Metabolism|metabolized]] to [[paracetamol]] (known in the United States as [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]: acetaminophen) in the human body, and that it was this metabolite that was responsible for its analgesic and antipyretic properties.&lt;ref name="Ax&amp;Brodie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1 = D. | last1 = Lester | first2 = L.

===Supposed uses===
[[Image:Ebath.png|thumb|Bonnore's [[electromagnetism|Electro Magnetic]] Bathing Fluid was claimed to help many unrelated ailments.]]

Patent medicines were supposedly able to cure just about everything.  Nostrums were openly sold that claimed to cure or prevent [[venereal disease]]s, [[tuberculosis]], and [[cancer]].  ''Bonnore's Electro Magnetic Bathing Fluid'' claimed to cure [[cholera]], [[neuralgia]], [[epilepsy]], [[scarlet fever]], [[necrosis]], [[syphilis|mercurial eruptions]], [[paralysis]], [[hip]] diseases, chronic [[abscess]]es, and "female complaints". William Radam's Microbe Killer, a product sold widely on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1890s and early 1900s, had the bold claim 'Cures All Diseases' prominently embossed on the front of the bottle. Ebeneezer Sibly ('Dr Sibly') in late 18th and early 19th century Britain went so far as to advertise that his Solar Tincture was able to "restore life in the event of sudden death", amongst other marvels.

Every manufacturer published long lists of [[testimonial]]s that described their product curing all sorts of human ailments. Fortunately for both makers and users, the illnesses they claimed were cured were almost invariably self-diagnosed – and the claims of the writers to have been healed of cancer or tuberculosis by the nostrum should be considered in this light.

== The end of the patent medicine era ==
[[File:Clark Stanley's Snake Oil Liniment.png|thumb|Clark Stanley's [[snake oil|Snake Oil]] [[Liniment]].]]
[[Muckraker]] journalists and other investigators began to publicize instances of [[death]], [[drug addiction]], and other hazards from the compounds. This took some small courage on behalf of the publishing industry that circulated these claims, since the typical newspaper of the period relied heavily on the patent medicines.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In 1905, [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]] published an exposé entitled "The Great American Fraud" in ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' that led to the passage of the first [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great American Fraud (4th ed., 1907) |last=Adams |first=Samuel Hopkins |authorlink=Samuel Hopkins Adams |year=1905 |publisher=American Medical Association |location=Chicago |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oH0xqp0M-U0C |accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[statute]] did not ban the alcohol, narcotics, and stimulants in the medicines; it required them to be labeled as such, and curbed some of the more misleading, overstated, or [[fraud]]ulent claims that appeared on the labels.  In 1936 the statute was revised to ban them, and the United States entered a long period of ever more drastic reductions in the medications available unmediated by [[physician]]s and [[medical prescription|prescription]]s. [[Morris Fishbein]], editor of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]], who was active in the first half of the 20th century, based much of his career on exposing quacks and driving them out of business.

The patent medicine makers moved from selling nostrums to selling [[deodorant]]s and [[toothpaste]]s, which continued to be advertised using the same techniques that had proven themselves selling nostrums for tuberculosis and "female complaints."  One survival of the herbal exoticism that once characterized the patent medicine industry is the marketing of [[shampoo]]s, which are often promoted as containing [[perfume]]s such as [[vetiver]] or [[ylang-ylang]], and foods such as [[mango]]es, [[banana]]s, or [[honey]]; consumers are urged to put these ingredients in their hair despite lack of any evidence that these ingredients do anything other than make the hair smell like the ingredients.

In more recent years, also, various herbal concoctions have been marketed as "[[nutritional supplement]]s".  While their advertisements are careful not to cross the line into making explicit medical claims, and often bear a [[disclaimer]] that asserts that the products have not been tested and are not intended to diagnose or treat any disease, they are nevertheless marketed as remedies of various sorts.  [[Weight loss]] "while you sleep" and similar claims are frequently found on these compounds (cf., [[Calorad]], [[Relacore]], etc.).  Despite the ban on such claims, salesmen still occasionally (and illegally) make such claims; [[Jim Bakker]], a disgraced televangelist, was noted in 2018 for selling a [[colloidal silver]] gel that he claimed cured all [[sexually transmitted disease|venereal diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5880433/Televangelist-Jim-Bakker-hawking-silver-gel-claims-cure-venereal-diseases.html&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most notorious such elixirs, however, calls itself "[[Enzyte]]", widely advertised for "natural [[male enhancement]]" – that is, [[penis enlargement]]. Despite being a compound of herbs, minerals, and [[vitamin]]s, Enzyte formerly promoted itself under a fake [[scientific name]] ''Suffragium asotas''. Enzyte's makers translate this phrase as "better sex," but it is in fact ungrammatical [[Latin]] for "refuge for the dissipated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/drugs/2002-04-18-enzyte.htm | work=USA Today | title=Why is this man smiling? It's not Viagra | date=2002-04-17 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving consumer products from the patent medicine era==
[[Image:bromoseltzerwagon.png|thumb|right|A [[Horse-drawn vehicles|horse drawn]] Bromo Seltzer wagon.]]

A number of brands of consumer products that date from the patent medicine era are still on the market and available today.  Their ingredients may have changed from the original formulas; the claims made for the benefits they offer have typically been seriously revised.  These brands include:

[[Image:Lydia Pinkham.png|thumb|upright|[[Lydia Pinkham]]'s Herb Medicine (circa 1875) remains on the market today.]]

*[[Smith Brothers]] Throat Drops
*[[Vicks]] VapoRub

A number of patent medicines are produced in China. Among the best known of these is [[Shou Wu Chih]], a black, alcoholic liquid that the makers claimed turned gray hair black.

===Products no longer sold under medicinal claims===
Some consumer products were once marketed as patent medicines, but have been repurposed and are no longer sold for medicinal purposes.  Their original ingredients may have been changed to remove drugs,  as was done with [[Coca-Cola]].  The compound may also simply be used in a different capacity, as in the case of Angostura Bitters, now associated chiefly with [[cocktail]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16426">{{Taxation| expanded=International}}
A '''permanent establishment''' ('''PE''') is a fixed place of business which generally gives rise to [[income tax|income]] or [[value-added tax]] liability in a particular jurisdiction. The term is defined in many income [[tax treaties]] and in most [[European Union Value Added Tax]] systems. The tax systems in some civil-law countries impose income taxes and value-added taxes only where an enterprise maintains a PE in the country concerned.&lt;ref&gt;
For example, Germany taxes non-German companies only on income from a PE.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of PEs under tax law or tax treaties may contain specific inclusions or exclusions.

== History ==
The concept of permanent establishment emerged in the German Empire after 1845, culminating with the German Double Taxation Act of 1909.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511977855.005|title = History of tax treaties and the permanent establishment concept|last = Kobetsky|first = Michael|pages = 106–151|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511977855.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the objective was to prevent double taxation between Prussian municipalities and this was extended to the entire German federation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1889, the first bilateral tax treaty, including the concept of permanent establishment, was concluded between the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Prussia]], marking the first time the concept was used in international tax law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After years of preparatory works, in 1928, the [[League of Nations]] developed a model to tackle cross-border double taxation and to counter tax evasion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since then, an extensive network of bilateral tax treaty was gradually established, particularly through the influence of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Model Tax Convention,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where this concept persisted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types ==
In the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Model Tax Convention, essentially three types of PEs can be construed:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* A '''fixed place of business''' permanent establishment (article 5(1));
* A '''construction or project''' permanent establishment, which is a special subset of the fixed place of business permanent establishment, with different requirements (article 5(3)); and
* An '''agency''' permanent establishment, through the actions of a dependent agent (article 5(5-6)).
The [[United Nations|UN]] Model Tax Convention, which gives greater consideration to developing countries, adds what is known by '''service''' permanent establishment in article 5(3)b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/documents/UN_Model_2011_Update.pdf|title = UN Model Tax Convention (2011)|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, have been trying to extend the concept of service PE into a '''virtual service''' PE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Tax/International-Tax/Alert--Saudi-Arabian-tax-authorities-introduce-Virtual-Service-PE-concept|title = Saudi Arabian tax authorities introduce Virtual Service PE concept|website = www.ey.com|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Base erosion and profit shifting|Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] project being developed by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and endorsed by the [[G-20 major economies|G20]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-about.htm|title = About Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new nexus based on '''significant digital presence''' is being considered under Action 1, aimed at ''Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264241046-en|title = OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy, Action 1 - 2015 Final Report|last = OECD|doi = 10.1787/9789264241046-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed place of business==
The starting point for determination if a permanent establishment exists is generally a fixed place of business. The definition of permanent establishment in article 5 of the [[OECD]] Model Income Tax Treaty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Article 5 and Commentary|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is followed in most income tax treaties.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/uktreaty.pdf U.S./UK treaty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527220749/http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/uktreaty.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }} Article 5, which is virtually identical to the OECD Model Article 5.  The [http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=87999 Nigeria/South Africa treaty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629124238/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=87999 |date=2011-06-29 }} Article 5, is nearly identical to the OECD Model Article 5, with the addition of a provision clarifying that a fixed place of business used as a sales outlet is a PE, notwithstanding exclusions elsewhere in the article.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commentary indicates that a fixed place of business has three components:
*'''Fixed''' refers to a link between the place of business and a specific geographic point, as well as a degree of permanence with respect to the taxpayer.  An ''"office hotel"'' may constitute a fixed place for a business for an enterprise that regularly uses different offices within the space.  By contrast, where there is no commercial coherence, the fact that activities may be conducted within a limited geographic area should not result in that area being considered a fixed place of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 5-6 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''place''' of business.  This refers to some facilities used by an enterprise for carrying out its business.  The premises must be at the disposal of the enterprise.  The mere presence of the enterprise at that place does not necessarily mean that it is a place of business of the enterprise.  The facilities need not be the exclusive location, and they need not be used exclusively by that enterprise or for that business.  However, the facilities must be those of the taxpayer, not another unrelated person.  Thus, regular use of a customer's premises does not generally constitute a place of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 4 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Business''' of the enterprise must be carried on wholly or partly at the fixed place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 7 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements of what constitutes a ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'permanent establishment''' within the scope of a particular treaty depend on what interpretation a particular country places on that term, in context of the text of that treaty. As per Article 3 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], no one is entitled to claim rights under a particular treaty unless otherwise authorised by the contracting state. Therefore, if a particular contracting state places a different meaning on the term 'permanent establishment' than what the taxpayer seeks to place, the taxpayer would be left with virtually no remedy within that state, other than  to seek a mutual agreement to that dispute with the other contracting state to that treaty.

==Indicative list of permanent establishments==
The OECD Model Tax Convention includes a short indicative list of ''prima facie'' permanent establishments. These, however, are not automatically permanent establishments as the requirements set out, namely, for fixed place of business permanent establishment must be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 12 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en|quote=This paragraph contains a list, by no means exhaustive, of examples, each of which can be regarded, prima facie, as constituting a permanent establishment. As these examples are to be seen against the background of the general definition given in paragraph 1, it is assumed that the Contracting States interpret the terms listed, “a place of management”, “a branch”, “an office”, etc. in such a way that such places of business constitute permanent establishments only if they meet the requirements of paragraph 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is as follows:
* A [[branch (business)|branch]]
* A [[warehouse]] (but see excluded places below)
* A [[factory]]
* A [[mining|mine]] or place of extraction of natural resources
* A place of [[management]]

==Specifically excluded places==
Many treaties explicitly exclude from the definition of PE places where certain activities are conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title = Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version, Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last = OECD|at = Article 4 and Commentary thereon|doi = 10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these exclusions do not apply if non-excluded activities are conducted at the fixed place of business. Among the excluded activities are:
*Ancillary or preparatory activities
*The use of a storage facility solely for delivery of goods to customers
*The maintenance of a stock of goods owned by the enterprise solely for purposes of processing by another enterprise (sometimes referred to as toll processing)
*Purchasing or information gathering activities

==Other specific provisions==

=== Construction or Project PE ===
Many treaties provide specific rules with respect to construction sites.  Under those treaties, a building site or construction or installation project constitutes a PE only if it lasts more than a specified length of time. The amount of time varies by treaty.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/Belgium_-eng.asp Canada/Belgium treaty] sets this limit as 12 months, as does the OECD Model.  By contrast, the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/india.pdf US/India treaty] treats such a site, project or activities continuing for more than 120 days in any twelve-month period as a PE.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agency PE ===
In addition, the activities of a dependent agent&lt;ref&gt;See [[Agency (law)]] for a discussion of the essential characteristics of agent and principal.&lt;/ref&gt; may give rise to a PE for the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Paragraph 5 of Article 5 and Commentary 31 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependent agents may include employees or others under the control of the principal.  A company is generally not considered an agent solely by reason of ownership of the agent company by the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Paragraph 7 of Article 5 and Commentary 40-41 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, activities of an independent agent generally are not attributed to the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Paragraph 6 to Article 5 and Commentary 36-39|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service PE ===
Some treaties deem a PE to exist for an enterprise of one country performing services in the other country for more than a specified length of time&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan002084.pdf United Nations Model Tax Convention] Article 5 paragraph 3(b).&lt;/ref&gt; or for a related enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the US/India treaty, ''supra''., Article 5 paragraph 2(l).&lt;/ref&gt;

== BEPS Action 7 and 15 ==
In October 2015, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] released the final reports on the [[Base erosion and profit shifting|Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] (BEPS) project. Action 7 was targeted at ''Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status'' and proposes a large number of changes that are set to be included in the next version of the OECD Model Tax Convention. The OECD expects many of these changes to be applied to currently existing tax treaties through the work based on Action 15 on ''Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264241688-en|title = OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties, Action 15 - 2015 Final Report|last = OECD|doi = 10.1787/9789264241688-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of countries are involved in the negotiations that are expected to be concluded by the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/multilateral-instrument-for-beps-tax-treaty-measures-the-ad-hoc-group.htm|title = Multilateral instrument for BEPS tax treaty measures: the Ad hoc Group - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report on Action 7 proposes substantial changes to the definition of Agency PE and stricter requirements to the exclusions provision:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/tax/preventing-the-artificial-avoidance-of-permanent-establishment-status-action-7-2015-final-report-9789264241220-en.htm|title = Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status, Action 7 - 2015 Final Report - en - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"These changes will ensure that where the activities that an intermediary exercises in a country are intended to result in the regular conclusion of contracts to be performed by a foreign enterprise, that enterprise will be considered to have a taxable presence in that country unless the intermediary is performing these activities in the course of an independent business. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The changes will also restrict the application of a number of exceptions to the definition of permanent establishment to activities that are preparatory or auxiliary nature and will ensure that it is not possible to take advantage of these exceptions by the fragmentation of a cohesive operating business into several small operations; they will also address situations where the exception applicable to construction sites is circumvented through the splitting-up contracts between closely related enterprises."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Globalize|date=October 2010}}
In [[commercial law]], a '''principal''' is a person, [[Legal person|legal]] or [[Natural person|natural]], who authorizes an [[Agent (law)|agent]] to act to create one or more legal relationships with a [[:wikt:third party|third party]]. This branch of law is called [[Agency (law)|agency]] and relies on the [[common law]] proposition '''''qui facit per alium, facit per se''''' ([[Latin]] "he who acts through another, acts personally").

It is a parallel concept to [[vicarious liability]] and [[strict liability]] (in which one person is held liable for the acts or omissions of another) in [[criminal law]] or [[tort]]s.

==Concepts==
In a busy commercial world, the smooth flow of trade depends on the use of agents. This may be because in [[business entity|business entities]] such as:
*[[sole trader]]s, their ability to conduct business will always be limited unless other people are used to work on their behalf;
*a [[partnership]], the [[natural person]]s who are involved cannot be present to conduct business in multiple locations simultaneously, so they must rely on others to make agreements or deliver services on their behalf; or
*a [[corporation]] is only a [[Juristic person|legal entity]] or fictitious legal person and so can only act through the agency of human beings to get anything done.
In the majority of cases, it is impossible for agents to seek specific authority for every deal or detail within a deal. Agents must, of necessity, be allowed some degree of discretion in the conduct of routine transactions. But, for the purposes of ascribing legal responsibility to the Principal, when the Agent acts with actual or apparent authority, all the Agent's knowledge will be [[imputation (law)|imputed]] to the Principal. If Principals were allowed to hide behind their agents' own ignorance, mistakes or failures to communicate, a Principal could, by using an Agent, achieve a better result than if they acted personally. For example, if the particular deal turned out well, the Principal could adopt the transaction. But, if it turned out badly, the Principal could disavow it. Indeed, if not for imputation, there would be a [[perverse incentive]] to conduct business through Agents rather than personally. Consequently, the Principal cannot exploit ignorance to their advantage by instructing the Agent to withhold key information or by appointing an Agent known to be secretive.

This rule in favour of imputation relates to the duties an Agent owes a Principal, in particular the Agent's duty to communicate material facts to the Principal. Since the purpose of the law is to offer protection to Third Parties who have acted in [[good faith]], it is reasonable to allow them to believe that, in most cases, the Agents have fulfilled this duty. After all, the Principal selects the Agents and has the power to control their actions both through express instructions and incentives intended to influence their behaviour which will include laying down routines for how Agents should handle information, and the extent to which Agents will be rewarded for transmitting information of commercial value. The result is a form of strict liability in which the legal consequences of an Agent's acts or omissions are attributed to a Principal even when the Principal was without fault in appointing or supervising the Agent. Borrowing parallel concepts from Tort and [[Equity (law)|Equity]], this means that the Principal owes the Third Party a [[duty of care]] to ensure that the Agent is honest and efficient, and that a Principal is [[estoppel|estopped]] from denying that an Agent was authorised to act as they did.


==Summary of law==
There are three classes of Principal:
{| class="wikitable"
|+3 classes of principal
!Class
!Description
|-
|Disclosed
|at the time of the transaction made by the Agent with the Third Party, the latter knows that the person he is dealing with is acting as an Agent and also knows the Principal’s identity.
|-
|Partially disclosed
|at the time of the transaction, the Third Party knows that the person he is dealing with is acting as an Agent but does not know the Principal’s identity.
|-
|Undisclosed
|The person acting as an Agent represents they are acting on their own behalf and does not disclose the existence of the agency relationship. 
|}

===Authority===
For these purposes, the Principal must give, or be deemed to give, the Agent authority to act.
*Actual authority
:This arises where the Principal's words or conduct reasonably cause the Agent to believe they have been authorised to act. This may be expressed as a [[contract]] or implied because what is said or done make it reasonably necessary for the person to assume the powers of an Agent. If it is clear that the Principal gave actual authority to Agent, all the Agent's actions falling within the scope of the authority given bind the Principal. This results even if, having actual authority, the Agent in fact acts [[fraud]]ulently for his own benefit, unless the Third Party was aware of the Agent's personal agenda. If there is no contract but the Principal's words or conduct reasonably led the Third Party to believe that the Agent was authorised to act, or if what the Agent proposes to do is incidental and reasonably necessary to accomplish an actually authorised transaction or a transaction that usually accompanies it, then the Principal is bound.
*Apparent or [[ostensible authority]]
:If the Principal's words or conduct would lead a reasonable person in the Third Party’s position to believe that the Agent was authorised to act, say by appointing the Agent to a position which carries with it agency-like powers, those who know of the appointment are entitled to assume that there is apparent authority to do the things ordinarily entrusted to one occupying such a position. If a Principal creates the impression that an Agent is authorised but there is no actual authority, Third Parties are protected so long as they have acted reasonably. This is sometimes termed "Agency by [[Estoppel]]" or the "Doctrine of Holding Out", where the Principal is stopped from denying the grant of authority if Third Parties have changed their positions to their detriment in reliance on the representations made.
*Authority by virtue of a position held
:For example, [[partnership|partners]] have apparent authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being joint and several, and in a [[corporation]], all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their declared position have apparent authority to bind the corporation.
Even if the Agent does act without authority, the Principal may ratify the transaction and accept liability on the transactions as negotiated. This may be express or implied from the Principal's behaviour, e.g. if the Agent has purported to act in a number of situations and the Principal has knowingly acquiesced, the failure to notify all concerned of the Agent's lack of authority is an implied ratification to those transactions and an implied grant of authority for future transactions of a similar nature.mithun
'''

===Liability===

====Agent to Principal====
If the Agent has acted without actual authority, but the Principal is nevertheless bound because the Agent had apparent authority, the Agent is liable to indemnify the Principal for any resulting loss or damage.

====Principal to Agent====
If the Agent has acted within the scope of the actual authority given, the Principal must indemnify the Agent for payments made during the course of the relationship whether the expenditure was expressly authorized or merely  necessary in promoting the Principal’s business.

====Third Party to Principal====
The Third Party is liable to the Principal on the terms of the agreement made with the Agent, unless the Principal was undisclosed and there is clear evidence that either the Agent or the Principal knew that the Third Party would not have entered into the agreement if they had known of the Principal's involvement.

===Duties===
The relationship between a Principal and an Agent is [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary]] which requires the Agent to be loyal to the Principal. This involves duties:
*not to accept any new obligations that are inconsistent with the duties owed to the Principal. Agents can represent the interests of more than one Principal, conflicting or potentially conflicting, only on the basis of full and timely disclosure or where the different agencies are based on a limited form of authority to prevent a situation where the Agent's loyalty to the any one of the multiple Principals is compromised. For this purpose, express clauses in the agreement signed by each Principal with the Agent may identify specific types or categories of activities that do not breach the duty of loyalty and so long as these exceptions are not unreasonable, they bind the Principals.
*not to make a private profit or unjustly enrich himself from the agency relationship. Principals usually include a power in their contract with the Agents allowing them to inspect the Agents' accounts if reasonable suspicion of improper behavior emerges.
In return, the Principal must make a full disclosure of all information relevant to the transactions that the Agent is authorized to negotiate and pay the Agent either the [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] or fee as agreed, or a reasonable fee if none were previously agreed on.

===Remedies against agent===
The principal has the following remedies against the agent for breaching his/her [[fiduciary duty]]:&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"&gt;Slide 9 of [http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/student_view0/chapter19/powerpoint_presentations.html Chapter 19 Powerpoint] for text {{cite book|last1=Kubasek|first1=Nancy|last2=Browne|first2=M.

====Constructive trust====
If the agent wrongfully holds property that should be owned or entitled to the principal, the principal can ask the court to deem it a [[constructive trust]]—that the agent is holding the property on behalf of the principal.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"/&gt;

====Avoidance====

The principal can void contracts negotiated by an agent that breached his or her fiduciary duty.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"/&gt;

====Indemnification====

The principal can sue the agent for liability caused by the agent's wrongful acts, i.e. if a third party obtained a judgment against the principal for wrongful acts caused by the agent, the principal can sue the agent to recover the loss.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KubasekPPT"/&gt;

====Negligence (for not following instructions)====

A principal can sue for the negligence of an agent who '''failed to follow instructions''', unless it was simply a failure to follow the principal's ''advice''.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;

===Undisclosed principal===
An '''Undisclosed principal''' is an unrevealed one, in a situation involving an undisclosed [[agency (law)|agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 563 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is "a person who uses an agent for his/her negotiations with a third party, often when the agent pretends to be acting for himself/herself." &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=2188&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Law.com definition]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[real estate]] transaction, this could be any "major party to a transaction, such as a seller or purchaser of property," who wishes to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realestateagent.com/glossary/real-estate-glossary-show-term-1828-undisclosed-principal.html Real Estate Agent.com web page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some taxing authorities have created [[Law|rules]] regarding tax liability for actions of an undisclosed principal.&lt;ref&gt;The Department of Revenue of the State of Illinois v. Taxpayer, ST 97-12, found at [http://www.revenue.state.il.us/legalinformation/hearings/st/st97-12.pdf State of Illinois government web site].&lt;/ref&gt;  The undisclosed agency may also affect [[tort]] [[Legal liability|liability]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wahab Janitorial Services v. P.M. Group Mgt.'', 161 Ohio App.3d 632, 2007-Ohio-3037 (2005), found at [http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/newpdf/1/2005/2005-Ohio-3037.pdf Pdf file of ''Wahab Janitorial Services'' case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230191847/http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/newpdf/1/2005/2005-ohio-3037.pdf |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination===
The Principal can terminate an Agent's authority at any time without having to give notice. If the trust between the Agent and Principal has broken down, it is not reasonable to allow the Principal to remain at risk in any transactions that the Agent might conclude during a period of notice.

==Economic analysis==
{{main|Principal–agent problem}}

The analysis of principal-agent relationships is an important topic in economics. The main focus of analysis is on the [[information asymmetry]] between the agent, who is assumed to be well informed, and the principal who may not be.

A '''rapporteur''' is a person who is appointed by an organization to report on the proceedings of its meetings.

For example, [[Dick Marty]] was appointed ''rapporteur'' by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] to investigate [[extraordinary rendition]] by the [[CIA]].

Authors of reports prepared by [[Standing Committees of the European Parliament|committees of the European Parliament]] are also known as "rapporteurs". Authors of reports assisting a rapporteur in preparation of [[Standing Committees of the European Parliament|committees of the European Parliament]] are known as '''shadow rapporteurs''', and may vary in number depending on the scope of the issue.

'''The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885''' (48 &amp; 49 Vict., c. 23) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It was a piece of [[electoral reform]] legislation that redistributed the seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], introducing the concept of equally populated [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]], a concept in the broader global context termed [[malapportionment|equal apportionment]], in an attempt to equalise representation across the UK.&lt;ref name="lowell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowell|first=A Lawrence|title=The Government Of England|volume=1|year=1912|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|authorlink=Abbott Lawrence Lowell|page=199 |url=https://archive.org/stream/governmentofengl028326mbp#page/n225/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was associated with, but not part of, the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]].

==Background==
The first major reform of Commons' seats took place under the [[Reform Act 1832]]. The second major reform of Commons' seats occurred in three territory-specific Acts in 1867&amp;ndash;68: 
*the [[Reform Act 1867]] applied to English and Welsh constituencies
*the [[Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868]]  applied to Scottish constituencies and gave Scotland an additional quota of seats
*the [[Representation of the People (Ireland) Act 1868]] applied to Irish constituencies.

The latter United Kingdom set of Acts had fallen short of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] aim to enfranchise and to equalise the electorates.  Electoral quotas diverged and the gap by 1885 widened; most starkly in the retention of boroughs of dubious size and a limited attempt at creation of new urban boroughs.  In reductions these previous reforms halved rather merged into their surroundings those boroughs (historic towns) having fewer than 10,000 inhabitants as at the 1861 census.&lt;ref&gt;Reform Act 1867, s.17&lt;/ref&gt; In a de-radicalising move a few of largest cities were given three MPs, whereby "no person shall vote for more than two candidates".&lt;ref&gt;Reform Act 1867, s.9&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the net partisan impact of these cities tended to be counterbalanced: for example, a borough formerly represented by two Liberals was now usually represented by two Liberals and one Conservative. In a Commons vote on party lines, the Conservative neutralised one of the Liberals, so that the borough counted for one party-based vote albeit having greater and slightly more equalised non-partisan local issue representation. By contrast the mid-size boroughs with two members such as the new creations &amp;mdash; wherever they so happened to have two MPs of the same party &amp;mdash; produced twice the voting power in the House as such cities.&lt;ref name="lowell" /&gt;

By the 1880s, continued industrial growth and resulting population movements had resulted in an increased imbalance between the constituencies in terms of the numbers of MPs and the population.

===The Third Reform Bill===
[[William Ewart Gladstone]], leading a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government, introduced a [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Representation of the People Bill]] in 1884, which sought to greatly extend the franchise but not to alter the boundaries of constituencies. The Liberals had a large majority in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the measure passed through the House easily. The [[United Kingdom House of Lords|House of Lords]], on the other hand, was dominated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The Conservative leader, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], was opposed to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=27&amp;item=history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001024439/http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=27&amp;item=history|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 October 2006|title=Gladstone's second government|last=Little|first=Tony|publisher=Liberal Democrat History Group|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the Conservative party's MPs were elected by the counties, with the Liberals being electorally strong in the boroughs. He realised that the bill's extension of household suffrage into the counties would enfranchise many rural voters such as coalminers and agricultural labourers who were likely to vote for the Liberals. This, he claimed, would lead to "the absolute effacement of the Conservative Party". Salisbury hoped to use the Conservative majority in the Lords to block the bill and force Gladstone to seek a dissolution of Parliament before the reforms could be enacted. The Lords duly rejected the bill and returned it to the Commons, provoking outrage among the Radical wing of the Liberals. A campaign organised around the slogan "The Peers Against the People" called for reform or abolition of the Lords if they rejected the bill a second time.&lt;ref name="Adelman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adelman|first=Paul|title=House of Lords: The Peers Versus the People|journal=History Today|volume=35|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Arlington Street Compact"===
During October 1884 [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] intervened in what was rapidly becoming a constitutional crisis, urging the party leaders to meet and break the deadlock. Negotiations duly started at Salisbury's London home in Arlington Street, [[Westminster]], between the Conservative leader and [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Dilke]], a member of Gladstone's cabinet. Lord Salisbury agreed to allow the reform bill to pass on condition that a bill to redistribute parliamentary seats was also enacted; the two parties reached an agreement, the "Arlington Street Compact", whereby the bulk of MPs would be elected in single-member constituencies. He calculated that this would minimise the adverse effect on the Conservatives of the extension of the vote: dividing the counties would allow Liberal-voting and Conservative-voting districts to be separated. The division of boroughs would allow the suburban areas of towns to be represented separately from the inner cities, allowing the growth of "Villa Toryism".&lt;ref name="Adelman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean"&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Iain|title=Rational choice and British politics: an analysis of rhetoric and manipulation from Peel to Blair|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_O_ADWrESYQC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;ots=VLEej0hgAv&amp;dq=arlington%20street%20compact&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q=arlington%20street%20compact&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-829529-7|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilke, a member of the Radical (socially progressive) wing of the Liberal Party, also favoured the division of boroughs to weaken the influence of the Whig faction in the party. Before 1885 many existing two-member boroughs one Whig and one Radical were nominated by agreement, often leading to uncontested elections.&lt;ref name="Adelman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean" /&gt;

==The Boundary Commissions==
Three boundary commissions were appointed in late 1884, one for England and Wales, one for Scotland and one for Ireland.&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Boundary Commission|date=3 December 1884|work=[[The Times]]|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each commission was given similar instructions.

In dividing the counties they were to use [[Ordnance Survey]] maps and other documents in order to determine the boundaries of divisions. In doing so they were to ensure that each division of a county was to have an equal population "so far as practicable". In addition they were instructed "in all those cases where there are populous localities of an urban character to include them in one and the same division, unless this cannot be done without grave inconvenience, and involving boundaries of a very irregular and objectionable character". Subject to these rules, the divisions were to be as compact as possible and should be based on "well known local areas" such as [[petty sessional division]]s or other aggregations of parishes. If necessary, an individual parish or parishes could be added to existing areas in order to equalise population, but under no circumstances was a parish to be divided. The county divisions were to be named after an "important town or place" within it, "preference being given to any merged borough or boroughs, or when it consists mainly of a well-known area, from that area". When the commissioners had devised a scheme of divisions for a county the details were to be advertised in the local press. A date would then be announced when one of the commissioners would attend at "a principal town" in the county to hear objections or proposed alterations.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt;

The procedure for boroughs (or [[burgh]]s in Scotland) was similar. Firstly the commissioners were to determine whether the present boundaries, or the boundaries proposed in the bill, embraced "the whole of the population which ought to be included within the borough". They could decide if an area formed a "community of interest" with the town and should be included within the borough boundaries. Where suburban areas had a sufficiently large population and distinct identity they might form a county division rather than be included in the borough. If boroughs were extended, existing "well-established" boundaries were to be used if possible. Where boroughs were to be divided, the population of each division was to be approximately equal, and "special regard" was to be had to the "pursuits of the population".&lt;ref name=comm/&gt; This was clearly understood as meaning that [[working class]] and [[middle class]] parts of towns were to be separated where possible.&lt;ref name="Adelman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean" /&gt;

==Passage through parliament==

The Bill was introduced to the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] on 1 December 1884.&lt;ref name="timesedit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial|date=2 December 1884|work=[[The Times]]|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was seen as a compromise measure, and did not include [[proportional representation]]. This led to unrest among the Liberals. [[Leonard Courtney, 1st Baron Courtney of Penwith|Leonard Courteney]], [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]], felt forced to resign his post and the party whip.&lt;ref name="timesedit" /&gt; Gladstone had held a meeting with Liberal MPs earlier in the day at the [[Foreign Office]], where he defended the bill. He stated that far from being a compromise it was very much a government bill, and that the discussions with the opposition had been conducted with "no party bias".&lt;ref name=meeting&gt;{{cite news|title=Liberal Meeting at the Foreign Office|date=2 December 1884|work=[[The Times]]|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill received its second reading on 4 December 1884, and was then sent forward to the committee stage, which was to commence on 19 February 1885. The delay was to allow the boundary commissions to complete their work, with the boundaries and names of the new constituencies to be included as the schedules of the final Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1884/dec/04/second-reading#S3V0294P0_18841204_HOC_246|title=Second Reading|date=4 December 1884|work=Hansard 1803-2005|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In committee few changes were made to the boundaries recommended by the commissioners. However the committee felt that the proposed names for many of the divisions were unfamiliar, and preferred to use what they termed "geographical" names incorporating a compass point. A compromise was made where both were incorporated in the names of many of the constituencies: thus the seat officially called the "Northern or Biggleswade Division of Bedfordshire" was informally referred to as "Biggleswade", the "Biggleswade Division", "Northern Bedfordshire" or "North Bedfordshire".&lt;ref name=commons1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1885/apr/13/england#S3V0296P0_18850413_HOC_237|title=House of Commons Debates 13 April 1885 vol 296 cc1500-69|date=13 April 1885|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act received [[Royal Assent]] on 25 June, and the provisions of both the redistribution and [[Representation of the People Act 1884|representation]] acts first came into use at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]].

==Provisions==
The Committee's work coupled with the Arlington Street Compact resulted a major redistribution under the Act as follows:
*Parliamentary boroughs (later known as borough constituencies):
**All these units with a population of 15,000 or less ceased to have separate representation and were merged into a wider division (constituency) of their county &amp;mdash; namely 79 constituencies were disenfranchised.
**Six other boroughs were also merged into the county divisions: four that included large extents of countryside ([[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]], [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]], [[East Retford (UK Parliament constituency)|East Retford]], [[Shoreham (UK Parliament constituency)|Shoreham]]) and two that had been disenfranchised for corruption ([[Macclesfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Macclesfield]] and [[Sandwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Sandwich]]).&lt;ref name="timesedit" /&gt;
**Those with populations between 15,000 and 50,000 were to have their representation reduced from two MPs to one, namely 76 constituencies.
**Those with populations of more than 50,000 (23 in all) continued to be a set of two-member constituencies
**The [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] would have its representation reduced to two MPs and remain undivided
**The Universities of [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]], and [[Dublin University (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin]].&lt;ref name="lowell" /&gt; would return two MPs
*Two low-population English counties lost an MP: [[Rutland (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutland]] was reduced to one MP and [[Herefordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Herefordshire]] to two MPs.
*The number of seats in the Commons was increased from 652 to 670, inclusive of [[Ireland]].{{ref|reference_name_A|a}}

Apart from boundary changes, approximately 160 seats were new (or "liberated" as Gladstone described it) in England and Wales. The number of seats in Scotland was increased by 12, and the representation of [[Ireland]] in Parliament remained at 103 members, even though its population had declined relative to the rest of the United Kingdom, due to emigration which had continued since the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]]. This arrangement was described by ''[[The Times]]'' as "...obviously dictated by a somewhat pusillanimous [weak-hearted] calculation that it was better to avoid a struggle with the Parnellite party."&lt;ref name=timesedit/&gt;

{{note|reference_name_A|a}}&lt;small&gt;The number of seats had been fixed at 658 in the 1832 and 1867/8 legislation, but two two-member boroughs (Beverley and Bridgwater) and two single-member boroughs (Cashel and Sligo) had been disenfranchised for corruption.&lt;/small&gt;

==Consequences==
===Cessation of dual-MP constituency pacts and majority-minority appeal===
The reduction in the number of two-member constituencies (elected by the [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc vote]] system) ended [[bipartisanship|cross-party cooperation]]: before the Act, in many counties and boroughs the two main parties had agreed to nominate one candidate each, and no election was held. Contested elections became the norm after the Act: 657 of 670 seats were contested at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]].&lt;ref name=searle&gt;{{cite book|last=Searle|first=G R|title=A new England?: peace and war, 1886-1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfy9JDd6OP4C&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;ots=ZLaOP3ZzwT&amp;dq=consequences%201885%20redistribution&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q=consequences%201885%20redistribution&amp;f=false|series=The new Oxford history of England|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-928440-5|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition of the middle and working classes===
{{See also|Parliament Act 1911}}
The division of former two-member constituencies had a direct, clear consequence: it hastened the decline of the domination of Parliament by the [[hereditary peerage|aristocracy]] (formed of those who had won Royal and often military favour and their heirs, many of whom were accurately referred to as the 'landed gentry').  After 1885, for the first time, MPs connected to industry and commerce outnumbered those closely related to the gentry.&lt;ref name=searle/&gt; The Lords immediately stood out therefore as non-representative of the electorate; the "household suffrage" of 1885 gave the majority of men the vote; and by the end of 1918 all those aged over 21 could vote and some women. 

Nonetheless the [[House of Lords|Lord]]s and their [[Nepotism|sons, grandsons and nephews]] in the Commons continued to form the greater part of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] until the [[Liberal Government 1905-1915|Asquith ministry]] &amp;mdash; further, the Lords legally bore equal strength, save for their inability to initiate bills spending public funds since 1407,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/originsofparliament/birthofparliament/overview/lawmakers/&lt;/ref&gt; until Asquith's constitutional [[Parliament Act 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/parliamentacts/&lt;/ref&gt; The Lords could veto bills and propose most types of bills.

===Electoral results and impact on strategy and attitudes===
Immediate expansion of the [[working class]] electorate caused the number of '[[Lib/Lab]]' MPs to rise from 2 in 1874 to 13 in 1885. The Act's new seats saw a 1% [[swing (politics)|single-party swing]] to the Conservatives and so a gain of only 10 seats and a similar gain of 11 seats by [[Independent Liberal]]s, the latter often slightly more radical (redistributive) than both mainstream parties.

The sudden balance of power of the seats held or won by [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] candidates galvanised those opposed to Home Rule. This third party power of veto coupled with the end of local electoral pacts in a foreseeable way; Disrael and Gladstone needed central control of their members to pursue narrower narratives and promote differing values.  The IPP were often labelled particularly by the media and Conservatives as '[[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnellites]]'.&lt;ref name=timesedit/&gt;  Their power saw [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] make Home Rule his touchstone but, in so doing, distance his party from most peers who, until the House of Lords was flooded with Liberal peers in 1911, preferred [[Conservative Party (UK)|conservative]] policies and guarded their near-equal power. Peers of the Whig persuasion flocked to a conservative line given immediate loss of family ties (hence leverage) in the Commons and tide of [[left-wing (politics)|reformist]] policies engulfing the Liberal party caused by the Act's generous franchise and loss of their coveted and often sponsored Whig-Radical and Whig-Conservative dual-member seats in the Commons. In short most peers felt change had gone far and fast enough. The opening words of free thought of the Lords, in its reply to the Queen's Speech came from the [[Duke of Abercorn]] who said:-
{{Quote|"My Lords, I rise to propose that an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty in reply to the Gracious Speech from the Throne, and in doing this I have to crave that indulgence from your Lordships which is always accorded to one who addresses your Lordships for the first time....

Questions of vital moment and importance affecting the safety of the Empire will have to be discussed, and the country will carefully scrutinize them; and ''the manner in which they are treated by a Parliament elected for the first time under household suffrage will be earnestly watched''. [emphasis added]|Hansard HL Deb 21 January 1886 vol. 302 column 36}}

Liberal MPs opposing Home Rule rapidly formed a new party to stand at the next election in 1886, the [[Liberal Unionist Party (UK)|Liberal Unionist]]s who were willing to govern with Conservatives.  

Liberals were unable to rely on any Lords' majorities (ratification) on their Bills from 1885 until the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. The 1911 Act ended the equal power of the House of Lords forever, [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutionally]].&lt;ref name="lowell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean" /&gt;

132 small areas ("parliamentary boroughs") were merged with part or all of their surrounding county constituency, all of which had previously returned two members. Courted for decades with the promise of for social change, religious freedom and free trade by Liberals, often served by a Radical-leaning alongside and a Whig-leaning MP, these boroughs had few Conservative MPs at most elections. Their substitute single-member seats where gaining suburban and wealthy rural parts particularly assisted the Conservative party, which took a position of national "strength and unity" in opposing [[Joseph Chamberlain|Chamberlain]]'s "radicalism" preferring instead education reform and opposing Gladstone's [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] "crusade" in favour of budgetary concessions and support for unionist Irish businesses.&lt;ref name="Adelman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean"/&gt;  The ensuing [[Queens Speech]] showed [[Victoria of Great Britain|the Queen]] was "...resolutely opposed [to Irish Home Rule]...convinced that I shall be heartily supported by my Parliament and my people."&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1886/jan/21/the-queens-speech&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative party thinkers and leaders in both houses had now enfranchised the majority of men trusting them to break the deadlock in their favour; in return they had espoused religious freedom and almost completely free trade.&lt;ref name="Adelman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean"/&gt; The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] may have won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 General Election]] however the new Lords heavy antipathy and the Irish question tore the party apart.

The majority of multi-member seats saw cooperation before 1885 whereas under the new one-MP-per-constituency norm, cooperation as patron and protégé or to attract opposing voters was futile. [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] and the most progressive Radical candidates could now be branded "weak", "divided" or "distanced" from the line of Gladstone and his successors which proved a flaw in the broad congregation of the Liberal Party until the formation of the [[Independent Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|final splinter group of 1931]]. Conservatives depicted Gladstone's dogged advancement of Home Rule, notably his failed first and second Irish Home Rule bills in 1886 and 1893, an open dissent from Her Majesty, as the root cause of Liberal Party disintegration. This unorthodoxy combined with heavy defeats on other Commons bills in the House of Lords which began to hemorrhage more Whigs led to electoral landslide victories for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] party in [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895]] to break the deadlock.

[[File:Religious qualifications for public office in the United States.svg|400px|thumb|{{Legend|#002255|States that have religious qualifications for public office written in their constitutions}}
{{Legend|#D3D3D3|States that do not have religious qualifications for public office written in their constitutions}}]]
Religious qualifications for public office in the United States have always been  prohibited at the [[Federal government of the United States|national level]] of the [[Federalism in the United States|federal system of government]] under the [[Constitution of the United States| Constitution]]. [[Article VI of the Constitution of the United States]] declares that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States". The [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment of the Constitution]] also prevents the [[Congress of the United States]] from making any law "respecting an establishment of religion" (the [[Establishment Clause]]).

[[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|Neither the First Amendment]] nor Article VI, however, were [[Barron v. Baltimore|originally applied]] to the [[United States states|individual states]], and individual restrictions were utilized by individual states to prevent [[Jew]]s, [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], and [[atheist]]s from occupying public offices. State-level requirements for public office were not entirely abolished until 1961, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down religious qualifications for all public officeholders in its decision in ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', a case concerning an atheist's right to serve as a [[notary public]] under a [[Maryland]] law requiring public officials to declare they believed in [[God]].  However, [[No_Religious_Test_Clause#State_law|eight states]] still have language in their constitutions that requires such qualifications.

==History==
===Colonial period===
The history of religious qualifications for public office in the [[United States]] dates back to the [[Colonial history of the United States|British colonial period]]. The [[history of anti-Semitism]] in [[Europe]] dates back to [[Roman Empire|Roman times]]. The [[Jews]] were expelled from [[England]] when [[King]] [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] issued the [[Edict of Expulsion]] of 1290. While some returned once [[Lord Protector]] [[Oliver Cromwell]] [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraged Jews to return to Britain]] in the 1650s, they remained a discriminated minority within the [[United Kingdom]]. England experienced multiple waves of strong [[anti-Catholicism]] after the [[Protestant Reformation]], and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican faith]] became the state religion of the [[Kingdom of England|English Kingdom]] after supplanting a period of Catholicism. Ruled by the [[British Empire]] until 1776, colonial America was dominated by English political and religious influence. In [[Maryland]], Anglicanism was established as the official religion from 1702. The colony's Catholic subjects were barred from both voting and holding public office, although the right to worship privately was granted in 1712.&lt;ref name = "Hennesey 1983, 42"&gt;Hennesey 1983, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After independence===
Religious requirements for political office in the United States were unconstitutional on the national level of the [[Federalism in the United States|federal system of government]] established by the [[Constitution of the United States]] since the ratification of the articles of the Constitution in 1788. The [[No Religious Test Clause]] of [[Article VI of the Constitution of the United States|Article VI]] of the Constitution expressly stated that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States". Additionally, the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]] of the United States Constitution, explicitly prohibiting the [[Congress of the United States]] from making any law "respecting an establishment of religion", was ratified as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] only a few years later. Neither protected the [[civil rights]] safeguarded by the Constitution from the authorities of the [[United States states|individual states]] of the United States, as the Constitution was only deemed to apply to the [[federal government of the United States|central government of the country]]. The state governments were therefore able to legally exclude persons from holding public offices on religious grounds.&lt;ref name = "Paddington et al. 2008, 156"&gt;Paddington ''et al.'' 2008, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]] after the [[American Civil War]], the protections of the Bill of Rights were extended to the individual states on the basis of the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution. 

State requirements for political office were not entirely abolished until 1961, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] rejected a provision of the [[Maryland State Constitution]] requiring all public officeholders to declare a belief in [[God]] in the case of ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]''.&lt;ref name = "Paddington et al. 2008, 156"/&gt; Roy Torcaso, an atheist, had filed suit in Maryland to establish his right to become a [[notary public]] without swearing his belief in God, as demanded by the Maryland Constitution. After being rebuffed, Torcaso went to the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously that the state's religious restriction was invalid as a violation of guaranteed constitutional rights.

Although the ''Torcaso'' decision dismissed enforcement of religious requirements for office as unconstitutional in the United States, antiquated provisions barring atheists from occupying political offices were not immediately stricken from state legislation. As a result, a number of lawsuits were initiated after 1961 to secure the right to hold public office without conforming to religious requirements. These cases followed the United States Supreme Court's precedent.

In 1997, the [[Supreme Court of South Carolina]] decided the case of ''[[Silverman v. Campbell]]'', likewise following the Supreme Court ruling in ''Torcaso v. Watkins''. The court held that Article VI, section 2 of the [[South Carolina State Constitution]] ("No person who denies the existence of the Supreme Being shall hold any office under this Constitution") and Article XVII, section 4 ("No person who denies the existence of a Supreme Being shall hold any office under this Constitution") could not be enforced as articles in conflict with the Constitution of the United States.

==Definition==
The changing concept of family requires a subjective definition of what family entails. There is no contest that the relationship between husband and wife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cvetic|first1=Goran|title=Immigration Cases in Strasbourg: The Right to Family Life Under Article 8 of the European Convention|journal=International and Comparative Law Quarterly|date=1987|volume=36|issue=3|page=650|doi=10.1093/iclqaj/36.3.647}}&lt;/ref&gt; unmarried (de facto) partners,&lt;ref&gt;''Johnston v Ireland'' (9697/82) ECHR 18 December 1986&lt;/ref&gt; parents and children,&lt;ref&gt;''Berrehab v the Netherlands'' (3/1987/126/177; 10730/84) ECHR 28 May 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; siblings,&lt;ref&gt;''Olsson v Sweden'' (10465/83) ECHR 24 March 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘near relatives’ such as between grandparents and grandchildren&lt;ref&gt;''Marckx v Belgium'' 2 EHRR 330.&lt;/ref&gt; represents family as required under the right to family life. Challenge exists where modern forms of family relationships have developed that the law has not yet explicitly recognised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Kath|title=The Unmarried Father and the Right to Family Life: ''Keegan v. Ireland''|journal=Maastricht Journal of European and Comparative Law|date=1995|volume=2|issue=1|page=85|doi=10.1177/1023263X9500200107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “existence… of family life is a question of fact” and is decided subjectively under each factual scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Nadia|last1=Melehi |title=The right to family life free from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation: the European and Inter-American perspectives|date=2014|journal= American University International Law Review |volume=29|page= 954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has stated that when considering what constitutes family relationships the Court “must necessarily take into account developments in society and changes in the perception of social, civil-status and relational issues, including the fact that there is not just one way or one choice in the sphere of leading and living one’s family or private life”.&lt;ref&gt;''Villianatos and Others v Greece'' (29381/09 &amp; 32684/09) [2013] ECHR (7 November 2013), at [84].&lt;/ref&gt; Established family ties can be broken.&lt;ref&gt;Ivana Roagna “Protecting the right to respect for private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights” (2012) Council of Europe Human Rights Handbooks, at 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the right to marry==
The right to marry is closely related to the right to family life, however the two rights are not identical. The right to marry is explicitly provided for in all human rights instruments,&lt;ref&gt;European Convention on Human Rights, Article 12; American Convention on Human Rights, Article 17; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 23(1); African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, Article 18; Universal Declaration on Human Rights, Article 16; European Social Charter, Article 16; International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt; essentially providing that all people have the right to marry and found a family. The right to family life predominantly refers to an individual's right to create and maintain their family relationships. It was clarified in ''X, Y and Z v United Kingdom'' that in the situation where a spouse has been deported from their partner's State due to their nationality, there is no infringement on the right to marry as the individuals are already married, and so the right to family life must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;''X, Y &amp; Z v United Kingdom'' (GC) 22 April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
The main area of conflict arises between the ability of States to control entry and residence within its borders and the impact this control has over an individual’s right to family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burchill|first1=Richard|title=The Right to Live Wherever You Want? The Right to Family Life following the UN Human Rights Committee's Decision in ''Winata''|journal=Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights|date=2003|volume=21|issue=2|doi=10.1177/016934410302100204|ref=harv|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[International Law|international law]] the general principle holds that a State has the right to regulate entry and residence within its own territory.&lt;ref&gt;''Chahal v United Kingdom'' (22414/93) [1996] ECHR 54 (15 November 1996), at [73].&lt;/ref&gt; When this power of control results in the deportation of an individual, this may cause a breach of an individual's right to stay with their family. This conflict occurs where the immigrant is the spouse, parent or relative of a State's citizen, and the State wishes to remove or refuse entry to the immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet Whelan “The right to family live v immigration control: the application of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in Ireland” (2006) Hibernian Law Journal 6, at 93.&lt;/ref&gt; When a challenge is brought forward to the Courts or monitoring bodies, a balance must be struck between the rights of the State to enforce immigration laws and maintain public order, and the impact the enforcement of said laws will have on an individual's right to family life.{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=234}} It has been emphasised that it is not the task of monitoring bodies to “supervise the government's immigration policy, but to examine whether the applicant’s right to respect for family life had been ensured without discrimination”.&lt;ref&gt;''Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v United Kingdom'' (1985) 7 EHRR 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International instruments==
Both Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide basis for the right to family life as a fundamental human right.

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 December 1948, clarifying universal rights held by all individuals regardless of subjective factors.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran International Human Rights Law (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the UDHR now represents customary international law, and as such has legally binding force over States.

The pertinent provision relating to the right to family lies in Article 16(3) of the UDHR:

{{Quote|text=3. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration on Human Rights, Article 16(3) accessed at &lt;http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights===
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on the 16 December 1966, and came into force on the 23 March 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justine Nolan and Simon Rice The International Law of Human Rights (Oxford University Press, Australia, 2011) at 251.&lt;/ref&gt; As at May 2016 there are 168 State parties to the ICCPR, giving effect to the civil and political rights of individuals within their borders.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, accessed at &lt; https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-4&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Articles 17 and 23(1) ICCPR refer to the right to family:

Article 17:
{{Quote|text=1.	No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.
2.	Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.}}

Article 23(1):
{{Quote|text=1. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.}}

The Human Rights Committee has noted that the protection of the family and its members is also directly and indirectly guaranteed by other Articles within the Covenant in addition to Articles 17 and 23, such as protection of the child under Article 24.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Committee “General Comment No 19 of 1990, Article 23” (1994) UN Doc HRI/GEN/1/Rev.1 at 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case Law====
''Winata v Australia'' &lt;ref&gt;''Winata v Australia'' Communication No. 930/2000 (16 August 2001) UN Doc. CCPR/C/72/D/930/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

This case was based on applications made by Hendrick Winata and So Lan Li under Articles 17, 23(1) and 24(1) of the ICCPR alleging that the removal of Winata and Li from Australia, where their adolescent son held residency, would amount a violation of their fundamental human rights, specifically that of their right to family.{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=227}} Both Winata and Li were living illegally in Australia, and were facing deportation by the State. It was claimed that through either the separation of Winata and Li from their son through deportation, or the forced removal of the whole family unit to Indonesia, there would be interference with the fundamental family unit that was not compatible with the State's protection obligations to the right to family under the ICCPR. Australia argued that the application was inadmissible and incompatible with the provisions of the ICCPR, emphasising the ICCPR provides protection “only [to] a right to family life, not a right to family life in a particular country.”{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=229}} The majority view of the [[Human Rights Committee]] found in favour of Winata and Li, holding that while individuals may not have the right to decide where they reside, States are obligated to protect all of the rights within the ICCPR. The Committee recognised the importance of State's control over immigration within their territory, however this discretion is “not unlimited”.&lt;ref&gt;''Winata v Australia'' Communication No. 930/2000 (16 August 2001) UN Doc. CCPR/C/72/D/930/2000 at 7.3.&lt;/ref&gt; It was held that deportation of Winata and Li would constitute a violation of Article 17 and 23(1) ICCPR.

Prior to this case international practice indicated that it was for States to determine who could reside in their territory, even where an infringement of Article 23 would arguably occur.{{sfn|Burchill|2003|p=226}} The Committee’s decision in this instance challenges this assumption, indicating that an individual's right to family life receives precedence over States’ ability to control residence within their territory.

===International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights===
The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) was also adopted by the General Assembly on 16 December 1966, however it did not enter into force till nine years after it opened for signature on 3 January 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justine Nolan and Simon Rice The International Law of Human Rights (Oxford University Press, Australia, 2011) at 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10(1) provides for the right to family:

{{Quote|text=1. The widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly for its establishment and while it is responsible for the care and education of dependant children.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 10 accessed at &lt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Europe==
Within Europe the European Convention on Human Rights and the [[European Social Charter]] stand as foundational human rights instruments.

===European Convention on Human Rights===
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) states:

{{Quote|text=1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&lt;ref&gt;European Convention on Human Rights, Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Article imposes both positive and negative obligations on States; not only is the State required to protect its constituents from arbitrary interference in family life by public authorities,&lt;ref&gt;''Belgian Linguistics case (No. 2)'' (1968) 1 EHRR 252, at 33[7].&lt;/ref&gt; it must also provide within its domestic legal system safeguards that allow the development of a “normal family life”.&lt;ref&gt;''Marckx v Belgium'' 2 EHRR. 330, at [31].&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Article 8 applies to both “legitimate” and “illegitimate” family, with no distinction between the two qualifications within the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Marckx v Belgium'' 2 EHRR. 330, at [31].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case Law====
''EM (Lebanon) (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department''&lt;ref&gt;''EM (Lebanon) (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department'' [2008] UKHL 64, [2008] 3 W.L.R. 931.&lt;/ref&gt;

This case involved a second appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State for the Home Department that EM and her son (AF) must return to Lebanon, the appellant’s country of origin. EM had fled from Lebanon with AF following a violent marriage and resulting divorce. Under Lebanese Shari’a law, the physical custody of the child must be transferred to the father or a male family member once the child reaches seven years of age. AF was over the age of seven, and so would have all custodial rights transferred to his paternal father upon return to Lebanon. EM argued that the forced removal to Lebanon by the United Kingdom would result in a direct breach of both her and AF’s right to family life under Article 8 of the ECHR. The Court held that removal of the appellant and her son to Lebanon would violate both EM and AF’s Article 8 rights, and granted the appeal. This decision is significant, representing the first successful Article 8 claim in a foreign case.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Palmer and A. T. H Smith “Protecting the Right to Respect for Family Life in “Foreign” Cases” (2009) The Cambridge Law Journal 68(3) at 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Social Charter===
The European Social Charter (the Charter) is the counterpart to the European Convention on Human Rights, providing for fundamental social and economic rights under a [[Council of Europe]] treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe “The European Social Charter” (2016) accessed at &lt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/turin-european-social-charter&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter also provides for the right to family under Article 16, reaffirming European parties commitment to the right:

{{Quote|text=With a view to ensuring the necessary conditions for the full development of the family, which is a fundamental unit of society, the Contracting Parties undertake to promote the economic, legal and social protection of family life by such means as social and family benefits, fiscal arrangements, provision of family housing, benefits for the newly married, and other appropriate means.&lt;ref&gt;The European Social Charter, Article 16 accessed at &lt;https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168007cf93&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other international instruments==

===Americas===
The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] is a regional human rights treaty that similarly provides for the right to family life under Article 17(1):
{{Quote|text=1. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state.&lt;ref&gt;American Convention on Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Africa===
The protection of the family and vulnerable groups is specified under the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights in Article 18, stating:
{{Quote|text=1. The family shall be the natural unit and basis of society. It shall be protected by the State which shall take care of its physical health and moral.
2. The State shall have the duty to assist the family which is the custodian of morals and traditional values recognized by the community.}}

The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights was adopted by the Organisation of African Unity in 1981 and entered into force on 21 October 1986.

===United Kingdom===
Within the United Kingdom the right to family life is a ‘qualified right’ under the Human Rights Act 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Citizens Advice “When can a public authority interfere with your human rights?” (2016) accessed at &lt;https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-rights/civil-rights/human-rights/when-can-a-public-authority-interfere-with-your-human-rights/&gt;; Human Rights Act (UK) 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This qualification allows a public authority to interfere with the right to family life if it is in protection of others' rights or in the interest of the wider community. On 9 July 2012 new Immigration Rules came into effect within the United Kingdom, affording greater weight to the States' ability to control entry and residence as compared to the individual right to family life.&lt;ref&gt;The London School of Economics and Political Science “Deportation and the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 HRA” February 2013, accessed from &lt; http://www.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/documents/2011/KlugDeportation.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a presumption that decisions made under the Immigration Rules will breach Article 8 of the ECHR only in “genuinely exceptional circumstances”.&lt;ref&gt;The London School of Economics and Political Science “Deportation and the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 HRA” February 2013, accessed from &lt; http://www.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/documents/2011/KlugDeportation.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  This presumption significantly limits individual’s ability to successfully challenge decisions they believe have breached their fundamental right to family life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3477">'''Self-executing rights''' in [[international human rights law]] are rights that are formulated in such a way that one can deduce that it was the purpose to create international laws that citizens can invoke directly in their national courts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Kooijmans]], Internationaal publiekrecht in vogelvlucht, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, 1994, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-executing rights, or directly applicable rights, are rights which, from the viewpoint of [[international law]], do not require transformation into national law. They are binding as such and national judges can apply them as such, as if they were national rules. From the viewpoint of national law, it may be required that all international law be incorporated into national law before becoming valid. This depends on the national legal tradition.

In order to decide whether a rule is self-executing or not, one must only look at the rule in question. National traditions do not count. A rule that says that states should guarantee [[freedom of expression]] to its citizens is self-executing.{{fact|date=January 2015}} A rule that says that states should take all the necessary measures to create enough [[employment]] is not.{{fact|date=January 2015}} Non-self-executing rules of international law only impose the obligation on states to take measures and to create or alter legislation. Citizens or national judges cannot invoke these rules (and demand employment as in the previous example) in a national court. This means that international law that is not self-executing must be transformed into national law in order to take effect.

The priority of international law remains a fact whether this law is or is not self-executing. A state cannot invoke its national law as a reason not to respect its international obligations. In case of non-self-executing rules, it is obliged to change its national law or to take certain measures. It violates international law if it does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he general principle of international law is that a state cannot plead a rule or a gap in its own municipal law as a defence to a claim based on international law", M. Akehurst, A Modern Introduction to International Law, London: Harper Collins, 1991, p. 43. "The fact that a conflicting domestic provision is contained in the national constitution does not absolve the State Party concerned from international responsibility", A. Rosas, in D. Beetham, Politics and Human Rights, Oxford: Blackwell, 1995, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, a national judge can only decide that their state should modify national law or take certain measures. They cannot invalidate national law that contradicts non-self-executing international law. They can only declare national law null and void if it contradicts self-executing international rights.

Most human rights contained in the main human rights treaties are self-executing and can be invoked by individuals in a national courtroom,&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECPHR) states that "The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention", which means that the rights are self-executing and do not need further legal transformation.&lt;/ref&gt; although this is the case more for civil rights than for economic and social rights.

'''''Taus v. Loftus''''', 151 [[P.3d]] 1185 (Cal. 2007) was a [[Supreme Court of California]] case in which the court held that academic researchers' publication of information relating to a study by another researcher was newsworthy and subject to protection under the state's [[strategic lawsuit against public participation|anti-SLAPP act]]. The court noted that the defendants had not disclosed the plaintiff's name and that Nicole Taus had disclosed it herself when she filed the case under her own name. The court did find that Taus had alleged a ''[[prima facie]]'' case that Loftus had misrepresented herself during the investigation and that this one count may proceed to trial.

The case involved the initial research of [[David Corwin]] into [[child sexual abuse]] and [[repressed memory]] in 1997. [[Elizabeth F. Loftus]] and Melvin J. Guyer were skeptical of the research and investigated the claims that Corwin made. In 2002, Loftus and Guyer published the results of their inquiry, and Taus filed a [[defamation]] and [[invasion of privacy]] lawsuit the following year.

After winning at the California Supreme Court, Taus settled with Loftus for minimal amount to avoid being liable for attorney fees. Taus remained liable for the attorney fees of the other defendants.

== Background ==
=== Corwin study ===
{{main|Jane Doe case}}
In 1997, psychiatrists David Corwin and Erna Olafson published a [[case study]] known as the [[Jane Doe case]], which became an influential work in regards to child sexual abuse and repressed memory. It was used for educational and research purposes as well as an example in civil and criminal law cases.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Gajda, ''The Trials of Academe: The New Era of Campus Litigation'' 196-97 (2009); John D. Zelezny, ''Communications Law: Liberties, Restraints, and the Modern Media'' 210-11 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The study was based on three videotaped interviews conducted in 1984 by Corwin in a child custody case where the father alleged sexual abuse of the then six-year-old child (Jane Doe) by the mother.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus v. Loftus'', 151 P.3d 1185, 1190 (Cal. 2007); Gajda, at 197; Sasha Abramsky, "[http://www.laweekly.com/2004-08-19/news/memory-and-manipulation/full/ Memory and manipulation: the trials of Elizabeth Loftus, defender of the wrongly accused]", ''LA Weekly'', Aug. 19, 2004; Maura Dolan, "[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/21/local/me-memory21 Memory, pain and the truth]", ''L.A. Times'', June 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The study interspersed the interviews with Corwin's analysis and his conclusion that the mother sexually abused Jane and falsely accused the father of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus v. Loftus'', No. A104689, 2005 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 3048, 2005 WL 737747, at *2 (Cal. Ct. App. Apr. 1, 2005), ''aff'd in part, rev'd in part'', 151 P.3d 1185 (Cal. 2007); Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also indicated that it had access to and used reports from [[Child Protective Services]], the police, court files and other evaluators.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 151 P.3d at 1190.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also had an interview from eleven years later, in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 151 P.3d at 1190-91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1995 interview, Jane did not initially remember the 1984 interviews or the alleged abuse.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *3; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; After viewing the videotapes of the 1984 interviews, Jane recalled the alleged abuse more clearly, although there were several inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 151 P.3d at 1191-92; Abramsky; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; Corwin presented the study as evidence of the recovery of repressed memory.&lt;ref&gt;Gajda, at 197; Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr., "Memory Abuse", ''Wall Street Journal'', Jan. 13, 2007, at A12.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the case was published, Elizabeth Loftus and Melvin J. Guyer started an investigation about the background of the case, being skeptical about its validity.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *4; Gajda, at 197; Zelezny, at 211; Abramsky; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; Using legal databases and public records, they found the people involved and interviewed them, uncovering crucial information that was omitted from the original study.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 151 P.3d at 1193; Gajda, at 197-98; Zelezny, at 211; Patrick J. Alach, "Paparazzi and Privacy", 28 ''Loy. L.A. Ent. L. Rev.'' 205, 218 (2008); Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the omitted information was that this was in the middle of a five year custody battle, including court actions from the father's violations of visitation orders.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *4 (referring to ''In re William T'', 218 Cal. Rptr. 420, 428 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985)).&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the fact that Child Protective Services had conducted an investigation but had not removed Jane from her mother's custody, nor were there any reports of abuse from burned feet or hospital visits.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 151 P.3d at 1194; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus and Guyer were also able to document the background of both the father and his new wife (stepmother) and issues that weighed on their credibility.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the research indicated that Jane was probably not abused by her mother, and her memories were result of suggestions and coercion by her father and stepmother, as they were trying to win a custody battle against the biological mother.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *5-6; Abramsky.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University investigations ===

Even before the findings were published, Nicole Taus, the "Jane Doe" of the study, complained about invasion of privacy to the [[University of Washington]] where Loftus worked as a professor.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *7; Abramsky; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; The university started an investigation against Loftus about scientific misconduct and impounded all the files.&lt;ref&gt;Abramsky; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure lasted twenty-one months, and during this time Loftus was not allowed to discuss or write about the case or give any information about the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *7; Abramsky; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; Melvin Guyer was also subject of similar investigation at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *7; Abramsky.&lt;/ref&gt; When the investigations were over, and the researchers were cleared from the charge of misconduct, the results were published in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' in 2002 in a two part article.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *7; Gajda, at 196-204; Abramsky; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lower courts ===
==== Superior Court ====
The case was filed in the Superior Court for [[Solano County]] by Taus in February 2003 against Loftus, Guyer, [[Carol Tavris]], Harvey Shapiro, the University of Washington, and the ''Skeptical Inquirer''.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *8; Dolan; Boutrous.&lt;/ref&gt; In the complaint, Taus identified herself as a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant Junior Grade]] in the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *8; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; Taus sued for [[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|infliction of emotional distress]], invasion of privacy, [[fraud]], and defamation. The first two claims were filed against all the defendants, fraud was filed against Loftus and the university only, and defamation was filed against Loftus and Tavris only.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; There were twenty-one causes of action within these four categories. Loftus and the other defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit on anti-SLAPP grounds, which the trial court approved in part and denied in part.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *9.&lt;/ref&gt; The court denied the motion as to the infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy claims for all defendants. It dismissed the fraud action against Loftus, but not the other defendants, and the defamation claim against Tavris.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *9.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants then appealed.

==== Court of Appeals ====
The case was then heard by the California Court of Appeals, First District, Division 2. The court noted that the debate in the scientific community was on-going over the validity of repressed memory.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that Taus failed to carry her burden as to the [[tort]] of negligent infliction of emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that Taus had made a valid claim against Loftus and Shapiro for invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *22.&lt;/ref&gt; The court also noted that Taus failed to show that the publication of the article invaded her privacy, but comments made at seminars or conferences were actionable.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *22.&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that Taus did not prove the falsity of the statements published, but that some of the defamation claim (as to Loftus) was still supportable.&lt;ref&gt;''Taus'', 2005 WL 737747, at *26-27; Dolan.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the defendants appealed.

== California Supreme Court ==
The defense lawyer argued that the suit interfered with [[constitutional rights]] as well as hindering research with important implication for [[public policy]]. The defendants also argued that the case was a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) and offered the defense contained in the state's anti-SLAPP law.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Taus argued that she wasn't a public figure and that the defendants had invaded her privacy.

=== Opinion of the Court ===
Chief Justice [[Ronald M. George]] delivered the opinion of the court. George stated that the matter was of public interest and continuing debate, and was therefore covered by the anti-SLAPP statute.&lt;ref&gt;Zelezny, at 211.&lt;/ref&gt; This left only one claim against Loftus, allegedly misrepresenting herself while interviewing Taus's foster mother.&lt;ref&gt;Zelezny, at 211; Bob Egelko, "Top state court rules in key privacy case", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Feb. 27, 2007, at B2.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the twenty-one counts, twenty were dismissed, leaving one claim regarding Loftus misrepresenting herself as Corwin's colleague and supervisor while interviewing Taus's foster mother.&lt;ref&gt;Zelezny, at 211; Egelko.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent developments ==
If Taus lost the last claim, she would have faced a bill of the five years of litigation, which came to $450,578.50,&lt;ref name="Tavris" /&gt; but she made an offer to Loftus to drop the case against her.&lt;ref name="LoftusPerils" /&gt; The lawsuit was settled in August 2007 with an agreement that Taus would withdraw the remaining claim, and Loftus's insurance company would pay a nuisance settlement of $7,500 to Taus.&lt;ref name="Tavris" /&gt; Since Taus has lost the majority of her claims, she was still required to cover the cost of the legal fees ($241,872) of the defendants.&lt;ref name="LoftusPerils"&gt;Elizabeth F. Loftus, "[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2008/may-08/perils-of-provocative-scholarship.html Perils of provocative scholarship]", ''Observer'', May 2008, at 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tavris"&gt;Carol Tavris, "[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/whatever_happened_to_jane_doe/ Whatever happened to 'Jane Doe'?]", ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Jan./Feb. 2008, at 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a series of articles discussing ''Taus v. Loftus'' and its implications for [[case study]] research in psychology was published in the ''[[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]]'', including articles by Nicole Taus Kluemper, Laura S. Brown, Ross E. Cheit, Constance J. Dalenberg, [[Gerald Koocher]], Erna Olafson, and Frank W. Putnam. The article by Taus (Kluemper) recounts her story of the case and concludes: "If I had one wish, it would not be to go back in time and un-file my lawsuit against Loftus et al., and it would not be to refuse to be the subject of a case report; it would be that no one ever be forced to endure such a violation of confidentiality again, particularly not at the hand of a psychologist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Nicole S.

'''''The Antitrust Paradox''''' is a 1978 book by [[Robert Bork]] that criticized the state of [[United States antitrust law]] in the 1970s.  A second edition, updated to reflect substantial changes in the law, was published in 1993. It is claimed that the work is the most cited book on antitrust.&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blair|first=Roger D.|author2=Sokol, Daniel D |year=2012|title=The Rule of Reason and the Goals of Antitrust: An Economic Approach|journal=Antitrust Law Journal|volume=78|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork has credited [[Aaron Director]] as well as other economists from the University of Chicago as influences.&lt;ref&gt;Priest GL. (2008). [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1642&amp;context=fss_papers The Abiding Influence of the ''Antitrust Paradox''. ''Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bork argues that the original intent of antitrust laws as well as economic efficiency makes consumer welfare and the protection of competition, rather than competitors, the only goals of antitrust law.&lt;ref&gt;Bork (1978) p.405.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while it was appropriate to prohibit cartels that fix prices and divide markets and mergers that create monopolies, practices that are allegedly exclusionary, such as vertical agreements and [[price discrimination]], did not harm consumers and so should not be prohibited. The [[paradox]] of antitrust enforcement was that legal intervention artificially raised prices by protecting inefficient competitors from competition.

The book was cited by over a hundred courts.&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt; From 1977 to 2007, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] repeatedly adopted views stated in ''The Antitrust Paradox'' in such cases as ''[[Continental Television v. GTE Sylvania]]'', 433 U.S. 36 (1977), ''[[Broadcast Music Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.]]'', ''[[NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma]]'', ''[[Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan]]'', ''[[State Oil Co. v. Khan]]'', ''[[Verizon v. Trinko]]'', and ''[[Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.]]'', legalizing many practices previously prohibited.

''The Antitrust Paradox'' has shaped antitrust law in several ways, prominently by focusing the discipline on efficiency and articulating its goal as "consumer welfare." Many lawyers and economists{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, however, have pointed out that Bork was wrong in his analysis of the legislative intent of the [[Sherman Act]] and have criticized him for incorrect economic assumptions and analytical errors. One of the key criticisms focuses on Bork's use of the term "consumer welfare," which became the stated goal of American antitrust law.

Bork argues that Congress enacted the Sherman Act as a "consumer welfare prescription."&lt;ref&gt;Bork (1978) p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court embraced this view in ''Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.'', 442 U.S. 330 (1979) and in all subsequent decisions. Many scholars, however, have shown that Congress had several motives for the adoption of the Sherman Act, probably none of which was "consumer welfare."&lt;ref name=Orbach&gt;{{cite news |last=Orbach |first=Barak |ssrn=1553226 |title=The Antitrust Consumer Welfare Paradox |work=7 Journal of Competition Law &amp; Economics |issue=133 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Bork's use of the term "consumer welfare" was inconsistent with its use by economists. When the Supreme Court adopted the view that Congress enacted the Sherman Act as a "consumer welfare prescription," it did not define the meaning of the term, which has remained ambiguous.&lt;ref name=Orbach/&gt;

'''''Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford''''', 141 U.S. 250 (1891), was a case before the [[United States Supreme Court]].

==Background==
A railroad passenger, Clara L. Botsford, sustained permanent injuries to her brain and spinal cord when a berth from a [[sleeping car]] fell upon her head.  She sued the railroad for negligence in the construction of the railroad car which allegedly caused her injuries. The [[Union Pacific Railway Company]] claimed that it was entitled, without her consent, to an opportunity to surgically examine her to determine her diagnosis and the extent of her injuries.

==Decision==
The court disagreed, holding that there was no authority under the common law or statutory law for the trial court to order such an examination: "No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Union Pacific Railway Company v.

A '''waqf''' ({{lang-ar|وقف}}), also known as '''habous''' or ''[[mortmain]]'' property, is an [[Alienation (property law)|inalienable]] charitable [[financial endowment|endowment]] under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which typically involves donating a building, plot of land or other assets for [[Muslim]] religious or charitable purposes with no intention of reclaiming the assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awqafsa.org.za/what-is-waqf/|title=What is Waqf - Awqaf SA|author=|date=|website=awqafsa.org.za|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The donated assets may be held by a [[charitable trust]]. The person making such dedication is known as ''waqif'', a donor. In Ottoman Turkish law, and later under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], the ''waqf'' was defined as [[usufruct]] State land (or property) of which the State revenues are assured to pious foundations.&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of Palestine'' (Prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]]), chapter 8, section 1, British Mandate Government of Palestine: Jerusalem 1946, pp. 226–228&lt;/ref&gt; Although based on several [[hadith]]s and presenting elements similar to practices from pre-Islamic cultures, it seems that the specific full-fledged Islamic legal form of [[financial endowment|endowment]] called ''waqf'' dates from the 9th century CE (see paragraph "History and location").

==Terminology==

In Sunni jurisprudence, ''waqf'', also spelled ''wakf'' ({{lang-ar|وقف}}, pronounced {{IPA-ar|ˈwɑqf|}}; ''plural'' {{lang|ar|أوقاف}}, ''awqāf''; {{lang-tr|vakıf}} &lt;ref&gt;Hisham Yaacob, 2006, Waqf Accounting in Malaysian State Islamic Religious Institutions: The Case of Federal Territory SIRC, unpublished Master dissertation, International Islamic University Malaysia.&lt;/ref&gt;) is synonymous with ''ḥabs'' (also called ''ḥubs'' or ''ḥubus'' and commonly rendered ''habous'' in French).&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|authors=Peters, R., Abouseif, Doris Behrens, Powers, D.S., Carmona, A., Layish, A., Lambton, Ann K.S., Deguilhem, Randi, McChesney, R.D., Kozlowski, G.C., M.B.

==Definitions==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
The term waqf literally means "confinement and prohibition" or causing a thing to stop or stand still.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan (1984) as cited in HS Nahar and H Yaacob, 2011, Accountability in the Sacred Context: The case of management, accounting and reporting of a Malaysian cash awqaf institution, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 87–113.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal meaning of Waqf according to Imam Abu Hanifa, is the detention of a specific thing in the ownership of waqf and the devoting of its profit or products "in charity of poors or other good objects".

Imam [[Abu Yusuf]] and [[Muhammad al-Shaybani|Muhammad]] say: Waqf signifies the extinction of the waqif's ownership in the thing dedicated and detention of all the thing in the implied ownership of God, in such a manner that its profits may revert to or be applied "for the benefit of Mankind".{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Bahaeddin Yediyıldız defines the waqf as a system which comprises three elements: ''hayrat'', ''akarat'' and ''waqf''. Hayrat, the plural form of
''hayr'', means “goodnesses” and refers to the motivational factor behind vakıf organization;
''akarat'' refers to corpus and literally means ”real estates” implying revenue-generating sources, such as markets (''bedesten''s, ''arasta''s, ''han''s, etc.), land, baths; and waqf, in its narrow sense, is the institution(s) providing services as committed in the vakıf deed such as ''madrasa''s, public kitchens (''imarets''), ''karwansaray''s, mosques, libraries, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&amp;id=973726cf86a04152bc028759f3578aa8|title = The legacy of vakıf institutions and the management of social policy in Turkey|last = Deligöz|first = Halil|date = 2014|journal = Administrative Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic texts==
There is no direct injunction of the Qur'an regarding Waqf, which is derived from a number of [[hadiths]] (traditions of Muhammad). One says, "Ibn Umar reported, [[Umar|Umar Ibn Al-Khattab]] got land in [[Khaybar]], so he came to the prophet [[Muhammad]] and asked him to advise him about it. The Prophet said, 'If you like, make the property inalienable and give the profit from it to charity.'" It goes on to say that Umar gave it away as alms, that the land itself would not be sold, inherited or donated. He gave it away for the poor, the relatives, the slaves, the [[jihad]], the travelers and the guests. And it will not be held against him who administers it if he consumes some of its yield in an appropriate manner or feeds a friend who does not enrich himself by means of it.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ḥad̲j̲ar al-ʿAsḳalānī , Bulūg̲h̲ al-marām, Cairo n.d., no. 784. Quoted in Waḳf, ''Encylopaedia of Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another hadith, Muhammad said, "When a man dies, only three deeds will survive him: continuing alms, profitable knowledge and a child praying for him."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ḥad̲j̲ar al-ʿAsḳalānī , Bulūg̲h̲ al-marām, Cairo n.d., no. 783. Quoted in Waḳf, ''Encylopaedia of Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2016}}

==Life cycle==

===Founding===
[[Sharia|Islamic law]] puts several legal conditions on the process of establishing a waqf.

====Founder====
A waqf is a contract, therefore the founder (called ''al-wāqif'' or ''al-muḥabbis'' in Arabic) must be of the capacity to enter into a contract. For this the founder must:
*be an [[adult]]
*be [[Sanity|sound of mind]]
*capable of handling financial affairs
*not under interdiction for bankruptcy

Although waqf is an Islamic institution, being a Muslim is not required to establish a waqf, and [[dhimmi]]s may establish a waqf. Finally if a person is fatally ill, the waqf is subject to the same restrictions as a will in Islam.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

====Property====
The property (called ''al-mawqūf'' or ''al-muḥabbas'') used to found a waqf must be objects of a valid contract. The object should not be illegal in Islam (e.g. wine or pork). Finally these objects should not already be in the public domain. Thus, public property cannot be used to establish a waqf. The founder cannot also have pledged the property previously to someone else. These conditions are generally true for contracts in Islam.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

The property dedicated to waqf is generally immovable, such as estate. All movable goods can also form waqf, according to most Islamic jurists. The Hanafis, however, also allow most movable goods to be dedicated to a waqf with some restrictions. Some jurists have argued that even gold and silver (or other currency) can be designated as waqf.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

====Beneficiaries====
The beneficiaries of the waqf can be persons and public utilities. The founder can specify which persons are eligible for benefit (such the founder's family, entire community, only the poor, travelers). Public utilities such as mosques, schools, bridges, graveyards and drinking fountains can be the beneficiaries of a waqf. Modern legislation divides the waqf as "charitable causes", in which the beneficiaries are the public or the poor) and "family" waqf, in which the founder makes the beneficiaries his relatives. There can also be multiple beneficiaries. For example, the founder may stipulate that half the proceeds go to his family, while the other half go to the poor.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

Valid beneficiaries must satisfy the following conditions:&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;
* They must be identifiable. At least some of the beneficiaries must also exist at the time of the founding of the waqf. The Mālikīs, however, hold that a waqf may exist for some time without beneficiaries, whence the proceeds accumulate are given to beneficiaries once they come into existence. An example of a non-existent beneficiary is an unborn child.
*The beneficiaries must not be at war with the Muslims. Scholars stress that non-Muslim citizens of the Islamic state (dhimmi) can definitely be beneficiaries.
*The beneficiaries may not use the waqf for a purpose in contradiction of Islamic principles.

There is dispute over whether the founder himself can reserve exclusive rights to use waqf. Most scholars agree that once the waqf is founded, it can't be taken back.

The Ḥanafīs hold that the list of beneficiaries include a perpetual element; the waqf must specify its beneficiaries in case.&lt;ref name = EI&gt;Waḳf, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declaration of founding====
The declaration of founding is usually a written document, accompanied by a verbal declaration, though neither are required by most scholars. Whatever the declaration, most scholars (those of the Hanafi, Shafi'i, some of the [[Hanbali]] and the Imami Shi'a schools) hold that it is not binding and irrevocable until actually delivered to the beneficiaries or put in their use. Once in their use, however, the waqf becomes an institution in its own right.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

===Administration===
[[File:Waqfnameh.JPG|thumb|Waqf Writing Room in [[Mevlana Museum]]]]
Usually a waqf has a range of beneficiaries. Thus, the founder makes arrangements beforehand by appointing an administrator (called ''nāẓir'' or ''mutawallī'' or ''ḳayyim'') and lays down the rules for appointing successive administrators. The founder may himself choose to administer the waqf during his lifetime. In some cases, however, the number of beneficiaries are quite limited. Thus, there is no need for an administrator, and the beneficiaries themselves can take care of the waqf.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

The administrator, like other persons of responsibility under Islamic law, must have capacity to act and contract. In addition, trustworthiness and administration skills are required. Some scholars require that the administrator of this Islamic religious institution be a Muslim, though the [[Hanafi]]s drop this requirement.&lt;ref name = EI/&gt;

===Extinction===
Waqf is intended to be perpetual and last forever. Nevertheless, Islamic law envisages conditions under which the waqf may be terminated:&lt;ref name = EI/&gt; 
*If the goods of the waqf are destroyed or damaged. Scholars interpret this as the case where goods are no longer used in the manner intended by the founder. The remains of the goods are to revert to the founder or his/her heirs. Other scholars, however, hold that all possibilities must be examined to see if the goods of the waqf can be used at all, exhausting all methods of exploitation before the termination.  Thus, land, according to such jurists, can never become extinguished.
*A waḳf can be declared null and void by the ''ḳāḍī'', or religious judge, if its formation includes committing acts otherwise illegal in Islam, or it does not satisfy the conditions of validity, or if it is against the notion of philanthropy. Since waqf is an Islamic institution it becomes void if the founder converts to another religion.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
*According to the Mālikī school of thought, the termination of the waqf may be specified in its founding declaration. As the waqf would expire whenever its termination conditions are fulfilled (e.g. the last beneficiary). The waqf property then [[Reversion (law)|returns to the founder]], his/her heirs, or whoever is to receive it.

==History and location==
[[File:Madina trip 169.jpg|thumb|Uthman waqf (Medina)]]
The practices attributed to Muhammad have promoted the institution of waqf from the earliest part of Islamic history.&lt;ref&gt;Sait, 2006, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

The two oldest known ''waqfiya'' (deed) documents are from the 9th century, while a third one dates from the early 10th century, all three within the Abbasid Period. The oldest dated ''waqfiya'' goes back to 876 CE, concerns a multi-volume Qur'an edition and is held by the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]] in [[Istanbul]]. A possibly older ''waqfiya'' is a papyrus held by the [[Louvre]] Museum in [[Paris]], with no written date but considered to be from the mid-9th century. The next oldest document is a marble tablet whose inscription bears the Islamic date equivalent to 913 CE and states the ''waqf'' status of an inn, but is in itself not the original deed; it is held at the [[Eretz Israel Museum]] in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gilbert Paul Verbit |year=2002 |title=The Origins of the Trust |location= |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |pages=141–142 |isbn=9781401031534 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}
 
===Egypt===
The earliest pious foundations in Egypt were charitable gifts, and not in the form of a ''waqf''. The first mosque built by '[[Amr ibn al-'As]] is an example of this: the land was donated by [[Qaysaba bin Kulthum]], and the mosque's expenses were then paid by the ''[[Bayt al-mal]]''. The earliest known ''waqf'', founded by financial official Abū Bakr Muḥammad bin Ali al-Madhara'i in 919 (during the [[Abbasid dynasty|Abbasid period]]), is a pond called Birkat Ḥabash together with its surrounding orchards, whose revenue was to be used to operate a hydraulic complex and feed the poor.

===India===
Early references to Wakf in India, can be found in 14th century CE work, ''Insha-i-Mahru'' by Aynul Mulk Ibn Mahru. According to the book, [[Muhammad of Ghor|Sultan Muizuddin Sam Ghaor]] (f. 1195–95 A.D.) dedicated two villages in favor of [[Jama Masjid]], [[Multan]], and, handed its administration to the [[Shaykh al-Islām|Shaikhul Islam]] (highest ecclesiastical officer of the Empire). In the coming years, several more wakfs were created, as the [[Delhi Sultanate]] flourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahru|first=Ainud Din|title=Insha-i Mahru,  Lahore, 1965|year=1965|publisher=Shaikh Abdur Rashid (ed.)|location=Lahore|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per Wakf Act 1954 (later Wakf Act 1995
) enacted by Government of India, Wakfs are categorized as (a) Wakf by user such as Graveyards, ''Musafir Khanas'' (Sarai) and ''Chowltries'' etc., (b) Wakf under ''Mashrutul-khidmat'' (Service Inam) such as ''[[Khazi]]'' service, ''Nirkhi'' service, ''Pesh Imam'' service and ''[[Khateeb]]'' service etc., and (c) ''Wakf Alal-aulad'' is dedicated by the Donor (''Wakif'') for the benefit of their kith and kin and for any purpose recognised by Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable. After the enactment Wakf Act 1954, the Union government directed to all the states governments to implement the Act for administering the wakf institutions like mosques, ''[[dargah]]'', ''[[ashurkhana]]s'', graveyards, ''takhiyas'', ''iddgahs'', ''[[imambara]]'', ''[[Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu|anjuman]]''s and various religious and charitable institutions.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;[http://www.aponline.gov.in/apportal/departments/departments.asp?dep=25&amp;org=169&amp;category=about al Wakf Council, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622015150/http://www.aponline.gov.in/apportal/departments/departments.asp?dep=25&amp;org=169&amp;category=about |date=22 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statutory body under Government of India, which also oversees [[Central Wakf Council, India#State Wakf Boards|State Wakf Boards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://minorityaffairs.gov.in/newsite/main/subj_alloc.asp Subjects allocated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924233558/http://minorityaffairs.gov.in/newsite/main/subj_alloc.asp |date=24 September 2010 }} [[Ministry of Minority Affairs]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn the State Wakf Boards work towards management, regulation and protect the Wakf properties by constituting District Wakf Committees, [[Tehsil|Mandal]] Wakf Committees and Committees for the individual Wakf Institutions.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; As per the report of [[Sachar Committee]] (2006) there are about 500,000 registered Wakfs with {{convert|600000|acre|km2}} land in India, and [[Rs.]] 60&amp;nbsp;billion book value.&lt;ref name="summary_hindu"&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2324/stories/20061215004700400.htm Community on the margins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w&gt;[http://centralwakfcouncil.org/ Wakf] [[Central Wakf Council, India]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
The ''waqf'' institutions were not popular in all parts of the Muslim world. In West Africa, very few examples of the institution can be found, and were usually limited to the area around [[Timbuktu]] and [[Djenné]] in [[Massina Empire]]. Instead, Islamic west African societies placed a much greater emphasis on non-permanent acts of charity. According to expert Illife, this can be explained by West Africa's tradition of "personal largesse." The imam would make himself the collection and distribution of charity, thus building his personal prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Feierman, 1998, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hamas, all of historic Palestine is an Islamic waqf, which translates as a "prohibition from surrendering or sharing".&lt;ref&gt;Max Abrahms, Why Terrorism Does Not Work, International Security, Vol. 31, No. 2 (Fall 2006), pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding of schools and hospitals==
[[File:Haseki-Huerrem-Sultan-waqf Jerusalem.png|thumb|150px|An Old Waqf Document]]
After the Islamic waqf law and [[madrassah]] foundations were firmly established by the 10th century, the number of [[Bimaristan]] hospitals multiplied throughout Islamic lands. By the 11th century, many Islamic cities had several hospitals. The waqf trust institutions funded the hospitals for various expenses, including the wages of doctors, [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam|ophthalmologists]], surgeons, [[chemist]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[Domestic worker|domestics]] and all other staff, the purchase of foods and [[wikt:medicine|medicines]]; hospital equipment such as beds, mattresses, bowls and perfumes; and repairs to buildings. The waqf trusts also funded medical schools, and their [[revenue]]s covered various expenses such as their maintenance and the payment of teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last1=Micheau |first1=Francoise |title=The Scientific Institutions in the Medieval Near East |pages=999–1001 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]] |editor1-last=Rashed |editor1-first=Roshdi |editor2-last=Morelon |editor2-first=Régis |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-02063-8}}&lt;!--specific pages 999–1001, whole section 985–1007--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with trust law==
The ''waqf'' in [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which developed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] from the 7th to 9th centuries, bears a notable resemblance to the English [[trust law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every ''waqf'' was required to have a ''waqif'' (founder), ''mutawillis'' (trustee), ''[[qadi]]'' (judge) and beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1237–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under both a ''waqf'' and a trust, "property is reserved, and its [[usufruct]] appropriated, for the benefit of specific individuals, or for a general charitable purpose; the corpus becomes [[Inalienable rights|inalienable]]; [[Estate (law)|estates]] for life in favor of successive beneficiaries can be created" and "without regard to the law of [[inheritance]] or the rights of the heirs; and continuity is secured by the successive appointment of trustees or ''mutawillis''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|p=1246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only significant distinction between the Islamic ''waqf'' and English trust was "the express or implied reversion of the ''waqf'' to charitable purposes when its specific object has ceased to exist",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1246–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this difference only applied to the ''waqf ahli'' (Islamic family trust) rather than the ''waqf khairi'' (devoted to a charitable purpose from its inception). Another difference was the English vesting of "legal estate" over the trust property in the trustee, though the "trustee was still bound to administer that property for the benefit of the beneficiaries." In this sense, the "role of the English trustee therefore does not differ significantly from that of the ''mutawalli''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|p=1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal trust law developed in England at the time of the [[Crusades]], during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Court of Chancery, under the principles of equity, enforced the rights of absentee Crusaders who had made temporary assignments of their lands to caretakers.  It has been speculated that this development may have been influenced by the ''waqf'' institutions in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hudson|2003|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1244–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wine]] shipping laws in the United States''' differ between [[U.S. state|states]]. About half of the states permit some form of direct shipping from [[Winery|wineries]] to consumers, although various regulations apply to these cases, and laws in both the sender's and receiver's [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]] may apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wineinstitute.org/initiatives/stateshippinglaws |title=State Shipping Laws |publisher=The Wine Institute |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, vendors are often limited to 24 nine-liter cases of wine shipped annually to any person for personal use, and shipment of wine to [[Dry county|dry counties]] is illegal.

==IMPORT Laws by state==

===Alabama===
Direct shipments of wine are generally prohibited in [[Alabama]]. However, individual consumers may receive such shipments by obtaining prior written approval from the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. The shipment must be consigned, with freight charges prepaid, directly to the individual in care of an [[Alcoholic beverage control state|ABC store]].

===Alaska===
Wine can be shipped from [[Alaska]] to all states, except for certain boroughs in-state and certain counties in Massachusetts, Tennessee and West Virginia.&lt;ref name=FedEx&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fedex.com/cgi-bin/wineShipping.cgi?State=AK |title=Wine Shipping State Pairing Guide |publisher=[[FedEx]] |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2012}}

===Arizona===
Consumers in [[Arizona]] are limited to two cases shipped directly to them annually. Effective September 18, 2003, [[Arizona]] has an "On-Site Law," requiring any consumer accepting a direct shipment of wine to have physically visited the winery during the past calendar year, paying for all future orders in person. However, wineries producing fewer than 20,000 gallons of wine per year can apply for a direct-to-consumer permit for unlimited on-site and off-site sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wi.shipcompliant.com/StateDetail.aspx?StateID=31 |title=State Shipping Laws: Arizona |publisher=The Wine Institute |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arkansas===
Direct shipment of wine is prohibited in [[Arkansas]] for off-site sales; consumers may place on-site orders for shipment at wineries.

===California===
Wine can be shipped from [[California]] to all states, except for certain counties in Alaska, Massachusetts, Tennessee and West Virginia.&lt;ref name=FedEx/&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2012}} The California Wine Export Program provides electronic reports and documentation on export markets, as well as general information on [[export]]ing wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calwinexport.com/statistics-and-research |title=Statistics &amp; Research |publisher=California Wine Export Program |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado===
Since July 1, 2006, wineries shipping to [[Colorado]] are required to obtain a direct shipping permit. There are no limits on the amount of shipments individuals can receive for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wi.shipcompliant.com/StateDetail.aspx?StateID=7 |title=State Shipping Laws: Colorado |publisher=The Wine Institute |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delaware===
Direct shipment of wine is allowed in [[Delaware]].

===Idaho===
Since July 1, 2006, wineries have been required have a permit and pay taxes to ship directly to consumers in [[Idaho]]. Wineries must also register with the Idaho Tax Commission and abide by monthly reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wi.shipcompliant.com/StateDetail.aspx?StateId=9 |title=State Shipping Laws: Idaho |publisher=The Wine Institute |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kentucky===
Carriers refuse to ship wine directly to [[Kentucky]] consumers, due to the difficulty of distinguishing [[Dry county|dry areas]] from "wet" ones. Shipping wine to dry areas in Kentucky is a [[felony]] offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wi.shipcompliant.com/StateDetail.aspx?StateID=50 |title=State Shipping Laws: Kentucky |publisher=The Wine Institute |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisiana===
Wineries shipping directly to [[Louisiana]] consumers must pay sales tax and possess a direct-to-consumer permit from the Louisiana Department of Revenue. In order to qualify for direct-to-consumer shipping, the wine(s) in question must not be distributed by any wholesaler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wine Shipping in the U.S. - Wine Shipping Laws State by State|url=http://buyingguide.winemag.com/wine-shipping-laws/|publisher=Wine Enthusiast Magazine|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maryland===
[[Governor of Maryland|Governor]] [[Martin O'Malley]] signed legislation on May 10, 2011 to legalize direct shipment of wine in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legiscan.com/MD/bill/SB248/2011 |title=Legislative Detail: MD Senate Bill 248 - 2011 Regular Session |publisher=e-Lobbyist |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law went into effect on July 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/local/politics/2011/07/wine_shipping_legal_today_enti.html |title=Maryland Politics: Wine shipping, legal today, entices 30-plus wineries |publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=1 July 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts===
On January 14, 2010, the case of FWC v. Jenkins in [[Boston]] struck down limits on wine shipments to [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wineinstitute.org/currentevents/09132010 Summary] of FWC v. Jenkins in Massachusetts with additional links.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite that ruling, wine shipments to Massachusetts were largely impossible until January 1, 2015, when direct shipping from wineries to Massachusetts became allowed by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massachusetts Section 162|url=http://www.mass.gov/bb/gaa/fy2015/os_15/h162.htm|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Direct Wine Shipping No Longer Bottled Up in the Bay State|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2014/07/14/direct-wine-shipping-massachusetts-budget|publisher=Boston Magazine|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensing is required for shippers and there is a yearly limit per customer of 12 cases from each winery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wine Institute|url=https://www.wineinstitute.org/resources/pressroom/07112014|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minnesota===
Wineries may ship, for personal use and not for resale, not more than two cases of wine, containing a maximum of nine liters per case, in any calendar year to any resident of [[Minnesota]] age 21 or over. Minnesota began allowing direct shipping by all licensed wineries in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wineinstitute.shipcompliant.com/StateDetail.aspx?StateId=12 |title=State Shipping Laws: Minnesota|publisher=The Wine Institute |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mississippi===
Direct shipment of wine is prohibited in [[Mississippi]].

===Montana===
Carriers [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] do not ship wine to consumers in Montana, because as of October 1, 2001, state law requires consumers to have a [[connoisseur]]'s license to receive such shipments. Buyers are limited to 12 cases from out of state wineries per year, and wineries must register with the state to ship to connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wi.shipcompliant.com/StateDetail.aspx?StateID=56 |title=State Shipping Laws: Montana |publisher=The Wine Institute |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2013, the Governor of Montana signed Montana House Bill 402 into law.  The new law, which takes effect October 1, 2013, replaces the State's flawed "Connoisseur License" system and allows registered wineries to sell and ship wine directly to Montana consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wineinstitute.org/initiatives/stateshippinglaws/currentevents/04182013 |title=Montana Enacts Workable Direct Shipping Law |publisher=The Wine Institute |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind''''', 474 U.S. 481 (1986), is a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in which the Court ruled that the [[Establishment Clause]] did not prevent the [[state of Washington]] from providing financial vocational assistance to a blind man who sought to study at a Christian college to become a pastor, missionary, or youth pastor. The Court ruled that the Establishment Clause does not prevent financial assistance from a state vocational rehabilitation program from being used for religious instruction.

==Background==
Larry Witters was eligible under Washington state law to receive financial assistance to pursue vocational instruction. At the time, he was attending a private Bible college with the intent to pursue a career as a pastor, missionary, or youth minister. The Commission for the Blind denied him aid on the basis that the Washington State Constitution barred state funds from being used to assist an individual in pursuit of a career or degree in theology. The [[Washington Supreme Court]] sustained the Commission's decision but used the [[US Constitution]] as the basis for its decision.

==Decision==
In a 9-0 holding,&lt;ref name="Oyez"&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1985/1985_84_1070 Oyez Project&lt;/ref&gt; the Court ruled in favor of Witters. The Court reasoned that the test established in ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' was applicable and that aid to Witters would meet the ''Lemon'' test. The Court found that there was a clear secular purpose to the law.  Also, the Court ruled that the primary effect of the statute was an effect on Witters, not religion.  Finally, the case was ruled to have no entanglement with religion since the decision as to where the aid money would be spent was made solely by the individual, not by any government agency so the Establishment Clause was not violated.&lt;ref name="leagle"&gt;{{ussc|name=Witters v.

'''Workers' compensation''' is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue their employer for the [[tort]] of negligence. The trade-off between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as "the compensation bargain". One of the problems that the compensation bargain solved is the problem of employers becoming insolvent as a result of high damage awards. The system of collective liability was created to prevent that, and thus to ensure security of compensation to the workers. Individual immunity is the necessary corollary to collective liability.

While plans differ among jurisdictions, [[Provision (contracting)|provision]] can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of [[disability insurance]]), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of [[health insurance]]), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment.

General damage for [[pain and suffering]], and [[punitive damages]] for employer [[negligence]], are generally not available in workers' compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in the case. These laws were first enacted in Europe and Oceania, with the United States following shortly thereafter.

== Origin and international comparison ==
Laws regarding workers compensation vary by country, but the Workers’ Accident Insurance system put into place by [[Otto von Bismarck]] in 1881 is often cited as a model for Europe and later the United States.&lt;ref name="tradeoff"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insurancejournal.com/blogs/academy-journal/2015/03/19/360273.htm|title=Workers' Compensation History: The Great Tradeoff!|date=2015-03-19|work=Insurance Journal|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statutory no-default compensation ===
Workers' compensation statutes are intended to eliminate the need for litigation and the limitations of common law remedies by having employees give up the potential for pain- and suffering-related awards, in exchange for not being required to prove [[tort]] (legal fault) on the part of their employer. The laws provide employees with monetary awards to cover loss of wages directly related to the accident as well as to compensate for permanent physical impairments and medical expenses.

The laws also provide benefits for dependents of those workers who are killed in work-related accidents or illnesses. Some laws also protect employers and fellow workers by limiting the amount an injured employee can recover from an employer and by eliminating the liability of co-workers in most accidents. US state statutes establish this framework for most employment. US federal statutes are limited to federal employees or to workers employed in some significant aspect of interstate commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/workers_compensation|title=Workers' Compensation|last=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205074742/http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/workers_compensation|archivedate=5 February 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exclusive remedy provision states that workers compensation is the sole remedy available to injured workers, thus preventing employees from also making tort liability claims against their employers.

=== Common law remedies ===
In common law nations, the system was motivated by an "unholy trinity" of tort defenses available to employers, including contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and the fellow servant rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haupt|first=Mary Kati|date=2016|title=Workers' Compensation Law &amp; the Remedial Waiver|url=https://lawpublications.barry.edu/barrylrev/vol21/iss2/4/|journal=Barry Law Review|language=en|volume=21|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law imposes obligations on employers to provide a safe workplace, provide safe tools, give warnings of dangers, provide adequate co-worker assistance (fit, trained, suitable "fellow servants") so that the worker is not overburdened, and promulgate and enforce safe work rules.&lt;ref name="hood"&gt;J. Hood, B. Hardy, and L. Simpson. ''Workers' Compensation and Employee Protection Laws'' (St. Paul: West Academic Publishing, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims under the common law for worker injury are limited by three defenses afforded employers:

* The Fellow Servant Doctrine is that employer can be held harmless to the extent that injury was caused in whole or in part by a peer of the injured worker.
*Contributory negligence allows an employer to be held harmless to the extent that the injured employee failed to use adequate precautions required by ordinary prudence.
*Assumption of risk allows an employer to be held harmless to the extent the injured employee voluntarily accepted the risks associated with the work.&lt;ref name="hood" /&gt;

==By nation==

===Australia===
As Australia experienced a relatively influential [[Australian labour movement|labour movement]] in the late 19th and early 20th century, statutory compensation was implemented very early in Australia. Each territory has its own legislation and its own governing body.

A typical example is  [[WorkSafe Victoria|Work Safe Victoria]], which manages Victoria's workplace safety system. Its responsibilities include helping employees avoid workplace injuries occurring, enforcement of Victoria's occupational and safety laws, provision of reasonably priced workplace injury insurance for employers, assisting injured workers back into the workforce, and managing the workers' compensation scheme by ensuring the prompt delivery of appropriate services and adopting prudent financial practices.&lt;ref&gt;About WorkSafe Victoria – WorkSafe Victoria is the manager of Victoria's workplace safety system.

Broadly, the responsibilities of WorkSafe are the following:
    * help avoid workplace injuries occurring
    * enforce Victoria's occupational health and safety laws
    * provide reasonably priced workplace injury insurance for employers
    * help injured workers back into the workforce
    * manage the workers' compensation scheme by ensuring the prompt delivery of appropriate services and adopting prudent financial practices.

Compensation law in New South Wales has recently (2013) been overhauled by the state government. In a push to speed up the process of claims and to reduce the amount of claims, a threshold of 11% WPI (whole person impairment) was implemented.

Workers' compensation regulators for each of the states and territories are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcalawyers.com.au/australian-labour-law/ |title=Australian Labour Law |publisher=Henry Carus &amp; Associates |accessdate=8 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028052732/http://www.hcalawyers.com.au/australian-labour-law/ |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
The National Social Insurance Institute (in Portuguese, Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social – INSS) provides insurance for those who contribute. It is a public institution that aims to recognize and grant rights to its policyholders. The amount transferred by the INSS is used to replace the income of the worker taxpayer, when he or she loses the ability to work, due to sickness, disability, age, death, [[involuntary unemployment]], or even pregnancy and imprisonment. During the first 15 days the worker's salary is paid by the employer and after that by the INSS, as long as the inability to work lasts. Although the worker's income is guaranteed by the INSS, the employer is still responsible for any loss of working capacity, temporary or permanent, when found negligent or when its economic activity involves risk of accidents or developing labour related diseases.

===Canada===
Workers' compensation was Canada's first social program to be introduced as it was favoured by both workers' groups and employers hoping to avoid lawsuits. The system arose after an inquiry by Ontario Chief Justice [[William Ralph Meredith|William Meredith]] who outlined a system in which workers were to be compensated for workplace injuries, but must give up their right to sue their employers. It was introduced in the various provinces at different dates. Ontario was first in 1915, Manitoba in 1916, and British Columbia in 1917. It remains a provincial responsibility and thus the rules vary from province to province. In some provinces, such as Ontario's [[Workplace Safety and Insurance Board]], the program also has a preventative role ensuring workplace safety. In British Columbia, the occupational health and safety mandate (including the powers to make regulation, inspect and assess administrative penalties) is legislatively assigned to the Workers' Compensation Board of British Columbia [[WorkSafeBC]]. In most provinces the workers' compensation board or commission remains concerned solely with insurance. The workers' compensation insurance system in every province is funded by employers based on their payroll, industry sector and history of injuries (or lack thereof) in their workplace  (usually referred to as "experience rating").

The law paid indemnity to all private wage earners and apprentices, including those who work in the agricultural and horticultural sectors and marine industries, family helpers and students with work-related injuries, for up to 13 weeks. Workers who are totally disabled get continued benefits at 67 percent after 13 weeks, paid by the accident funds, financed entirely by employers.

The German compensation system has been taken as a model for many nations.

=== India ===
''Main article'' : [http://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/TheWorkmenAct1923(1).pdf The Workmen's Compensation Act 1923]

The [http://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/TheWorkmenAct1923(1).pdf Indian worker's compensation law 1923] was introduced on 5 March 1923. It includes Employer's liability compensation, amount of compensation.  Workmen Compensation Insurance covers employees under Workmen Compensation Act, Fatal Accident Act and common law.

Adopted before Malaysia's independence from the UK, it is now used only by non-Malaysian workers, since citizens are covered by the national social security scheme.

===Mexico===
{{main|Worker's compensation (Mexico)}}
The Mexican Constitution of 1917 defined the obligation of employers to pay for illnesses or accidents related to the workplace. It also defined social security as the institution to administer the right of workers, but only until 1943 was the Mexican Social Security Institute created ([http://www.imss.gob.mx/ IMSS]). Since then, IMSS manages the Work Risks Insurance in a vertically integrated fashion: registration of workers and firms, collection, classification of risks and events, and medical and rehabilitation services. A reform in 1997 defined that contributions are related to the experience of each employer. Public sector workers are covered by social security agencies with corporate and operative structures similar to those of IMSS.

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], all companies that employ staff and in some cases others, must pay a levy to the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]], a [[Crown entity]], which administers New Zealand's universal [[No-fault insurance|no-fault]] accidental injury scheme. The scheme provides financial compensation and support to citizens, residents, and temporary visitors who have suffered personal injuries.

===United Kingdom===
Great Britain followed the German model. [[Joseph Chamberlain]], leader of the Liberal Unionist party and coalition with the Conservatives, designed a plan that was enacted under the Salisbury government in 1897. the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1897]] was a key domestic achievement. It served its social purpose at no cost to the government, since compensation was paid for by insurance which employers were required to take out. The system operated from 1897 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Hanes, ''The First British Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; It was expanded to include industrial diseases by the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906]] and replaced by a state compensation scheme under the [[National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946]]. Since 1976, this state scheme has been set out in the UK's Social Security Acts.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W.J. Bartrip, ''Workmen's Compensation in Twentieth Century Britain: Law, History, and Social Policy'' (Gower, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Work related safety issues in the UK are supervised by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) who provide the framework by which employers and employees are able to comply with statutory rules and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/|title=HSE: Information about health and safety at work|author=|date=|website=www.hse.gov.uk|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318033425/http://www.hse.gov.uk/|archivedate=18 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the following, all employers are obliged to purchase compulsory Employer's Liability Insurance in accordance with the Employer's Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. The current minimum limit of indemnity required is £5,000,000 per occurrence. Market practice is to usually provide a minimum £10,000,000 with inner limits to £5,000,000 for certain risks, e.g. workers on oil rigs and acts of terrorism.

These employers do not require Employer's Liability Insurance:
* local authorities (other than [[Civil parish|parish councils]])
* joint boards or committees whose members include members of local authorities
* police authorities
* nationalised industries or their subsidiaries
* certain bodies which are financed out of public funds
* employers of crews on offshore installations, ships or hovercraft, if they are covered instead with a mutual insurance association of ship owners or ship owners and others
* a health service body or NHS Trust&lt;ref&gt;Industrial engineering projects: practice and procedures for capital, By Joint Development Board (Great Britain), pp. 142–43 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7K8pSs_Y8WAC&amp;lpg=PA142dq=Employers%20who%20do%20not%20require%20Employers%20Liability%20Compulsory%20Insurance%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Employees" are defined as anyone who has entered into or works under a contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer. The contract may be for manual labour, clerical work or otherwise, it may be written or verbal and it may be for full-time or part-time work.

These persons are not classed as employees and, therefore, are exempt:
* persons who are not employees (for example independent contractors who are not the employees of the person engaging them)
* people employed in any activity which is not a business (such as domestic servants)
* people who are related to the employer – husband, wife, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother sister, half-brother or half-sister
* people who are not normally resident in the United Kingdom and who are working there for fewer than 14 consecutive days.

Employees need to establish that their employer has a legal liability to pay compensation. This will principally be a breach of a statutory duty or under the tort of negligence. In the event that the employer is insolvent or no longer in existence, compensation can be sought directly from the insurer under the terms of the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 2010.

For the history of worker's compensation in the UK, see [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1897]] and following acts.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrip, ''Workmen's Compensation in Twentieth Century Britain: Law, History, and Social Policy'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Workers' compensation (United States)}}
In the United States, some form of workers compensation is typically compulsory in most states (depending upon the features of the organization), with the notable exception of [[Texas]] as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.employers.com/resources/blog/2014/is-workers-compensation-insurance-required-in-all-states|title=Is Workers Compensation Insurance Required in all states|last=|first=|date=|website=www.employers.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124214945/https://www.employers.com/resources/blog/2014/is-workers-compensation-insurance-required-in-all-states|archive-date=2018-11-24|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of compulsory requirements, businesses may purchase insurance voluntarily, and in the United States policies typically include Part One for compulsory coverage and Part Two for non-compulsory coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irmi.com/term/insurance-definitions/workers-compensation-and-employers-liability-policy|title=Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Policy {{!}} Insurance Glossary Definition {{!}} IRMI.com|website=www.irmi.com|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1949, every state had enacted a workers' compensation program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eh.net/encyclopedia/workers-compensation/ eh.net Fishback] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619023347/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/workers-compensation/ |date=19 June 2017 }} Includes extended data tables.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states, workers compensation claims are handled by [[Administrative law judge|administrative law judges]], who often act as [[Trier of fact|triers of fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B.|first=Torrey, David|date=2012|title=Master or Chancellor?

Workers compensation statutes which emerged in the early 1900s were struck down as unconstitutional until 1911 when Wisconsin passed a law was not struck down; by 1920, 42 states had passed workers compensation laws.&lt;ref name="tradeoff"/&gt;
