      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1549">The [[California]] Direct Access Standards setting process in 1997 identified the need to standardize the [[Electricity meter|electric meter]] label identifier so as to create a unique identifier for every electric meter in the United States. The AEP meter label format is a recommended solution for this need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ora.ca.gov/wk-group/dai/dai4/Unident.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924003655/http://www.ora.ca.gov/wk-group/dai/dai4/Unident.doc |archivedate=2006-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
AEP meter label format follows [[ANSI C12.10]] requirements for format of the electric meter labels.  (See below)  The format for the [[barcode]] label is:

     AABYYYYYYYYYZZZZZ

where
        AA  is the meter test code
         B  is an identifier for the meter manufacturer
 YYYYYYYYY  is the manufacturer’s serial number or utility number
     ZZZZZ  is user specified

==Usage==
The meter test code is used by calibration equipment manufacturers to automatically set up their equipment to calibrate a given meter.  The user scans in the AEP barcode on the meter, and the calibrator will use the correct [[voltage]] and test [[ampere|amps]]. The last five characters are user specified, and many [[electric utilities]] use these characters for an inventory code or date of manufacture.

'''''Adam’s Task: Calling Animals by Name''''' by philosopher, poet, and animal trainer [[Vicki Hearne]] describes an innovative and metaphysical approach to training animals. Based on studies of literary criticism, philosophy, and extensive hands-on experience in training, Hearne asserts that animals (specifically those that commonly cohabit or interact with humans) are far more intelligent than most people assume. In fact, they are capable of developing an understanding of “the good,” a moral code that influences their motives and actions. In response to her studies and experiments, Hearne developed an entirely new system of animal training that contradicts modern animal behavioral research and yet, she insists through many examples, is astonishingly effective.

''Adam's Task'' was Hearne's first—and probably best-known—book, though she authored several other successful titles, including ''Animal Happiness'' and ''Bandit''. The focus of ''Adam's Task'' is on the complexities of human-animal communication and the importance of seeing domestic animals as they truly are—not as anthropomorphized creatures whom we see however we wish to see them. Some of the training methods described in the book have drawn criticism from various factions of animal activists, but Hearne stresses that she is striving for intellectual and moral integrity in all of her studies, and many agree that her obvious love for animals speaks in her defense.

The ''Boston Globe'' calls ''Adam’s Task'' “A beautiful, wonderful book of the sort that permanently refreshes thought and feeling.” The ''New York Times'' says “When Ms. Hearne relates a dog or horse story, the animals become full-fledged characters, as brightly delineated as people created by Dickens or Twain.”

''Adam's Task'' was first published by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] in 1986. It is now available from [[Skyhorse Publishing]] with a new introduction by [[Donald McCaig]].

[[File:Zeppellin NT amk.JPG|thumb|A modern airship, [[Zeppelin NT]] ''D-LZZF'' in 2010]]

An '''airship''' or '''dirigible balloon''' is a type of [[aerostat]] or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airship|title=Definition of AIRSHIP|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerostats gain their lift from large gasbags filled with a [[lifting gas]] that is less dense than the surrounding air.

[[File:Brockhaus-Efron Aeronavtika.jpg|thumb|upright|Dirigible airships compared with related aerostats, from a turn-of-the-20th-century encyclopedia]]
In early dirigibles, the lifting gas used was [[hydrogen gas|hydrogen]], due to its high lifting capacity and ready availability. [[Helium]] gas has almost the same lifting capacity and is not flammable, unlike hydrogen, but is rare and relatively expensive. Significant amounts were first discovered in the United States and for a while helium was only used for airships in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Discovery of Helium in Natural Gas at the University of Kansas | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/heliumnaturalgas.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most airships built since the 1960s have used helium, though some have used hot air.&lt;ref group="note" &gt;A few airships after [[World War II]] still used hydrogen. The first British airship to use helium was the [[Chitty Bang Bang (airship)|''Chitty Bang Bang'']] of 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The envelope of an airship may form a single gasbag, or may contain a number of internal gas-filled cells.  An airship also has engines, crew, and optionally also payload accommodation, typically housed in one or more "gondolas" suspended below the envelope.

The main types of airship are [[non-rigid airship|non-rigid]], [[semi-rigid airship|semi-rigid]], and [[rigid airship|rigid]].&lt;ref name="ege" /&gt; Non-rigid airships, often called "blimps", rely on internal pressure to maintain their shape. Semi-rigid airships maintain the envelope shape by internal pressure, but have some form of supporting structure, such as a fixed keel, attached to it. Rigid airships have an outer structural framework that maintains the shape and carries all structural loads, while the lifting gas is contained in one or more internal gasbags or cells.&lt;ref&gt;Mowthorpe, C. E. S. ''Battlebags, British Airships of the First World War'', Phoenix Mill, United Kingdom. Alan Sutton Publishing, 1995, p. xx. {{ISBN|0-7509-0989-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigid airships were first flown by [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin|Count Zeppelin]] and the vast majority of rigid airships built were manufactured by the firm he founded. As a result, rigid airships are often called [[zeppelin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=zeppelin|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airships were the first aircraft capable of controlled powered flight, and were most commonly used before the 1940s; their use decreased over time as their capabilities were surpassed by those of aeroplanes. Their decline was accelerated by a series of high-profile accidents, including the 1930 crash and burning of British ''[[R101]]'' in France, the 1933 and 1935 storm-related crashes of the twin [[airborne aircraft carrier]] U.S. Navy helium-filled rigids, the {{USS|Akron|ZRS-4|6}} and [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|USS ''Macon'']] respectively, and the 1937 burning of the [[hydrogen]]-filled ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]''. From the 1960s, helium airships have been used in applications where the ability to hover in one place for an extended period outweighs the need for speed and manoeuvrability, such as advertising, tourism, camera platforms, geological surveys, and [[Observation aircraft|aerial observation]].

==Terminology==

===Airship===
During the pioneer years of aeronautics, terms such as "airship", "air-ship", "air ship" and "ship of the air" meant any kind of navigable or dirigible flying machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth172915/ US patent 467069] "Air-ship" referring to a compound aerostat/rotorcraft.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezekiel Airship]] (1902) [http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/History_of_the_Airplane/History_of_the_Airplane_Intro/History_of_the_Airplane_Intro.htm wright-brothers.org][http://altereddimensions.net/2012/burrell-cannon-flies-first-airplane altereddimensions.net] "airship,"- referring to an HTA aeroplane.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gustavewhitehead.org/news_journalism/1901_-_flying.html The Bridgeport Herald, August 18, 1901] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803021718/http://gustavewhitehead.org/news_journalism/1901_-_flying.html |date=August 3, 2013 }} - "air ship" referring to Whitehead's aeroplane.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooley Airship of 1910, also called the Cooley monoplane.[http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/Aviations_Attic/UFOs/UFOs.htm]{{cite web|url=http://celticowboy.com/Round%20Aircraft%20Designs.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402075442/http://celticowboy.com/Round%20Aircraft%20Designs.htm|archivedate=2012-04-02|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-09-07}}- a heavier-than-air monoplane.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frater, A.; ''The Balloon Factory'', Picador (2009), Page 163. - Wright brothers' "airship."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=879 George Griffith, ''The angel of the Revolution'', 1893] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154830/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=879 |date=2014-02-22 }} - "air-ship," "vessel" referring to a VTOL compound rotorcraft (not clear from the reference if it might be an aerostat hybrid.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 [[Frederick Handley Page]] was reported as referring to "ships of the air," with smaller passenger types as "air yachts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=AS19190224.2.104 Auckland Star, 24 February 1919] "Ships of the air," "Air yachts" - passenger landplanes large and small&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as "ships of the air" or "flying-ships".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17455790 The Sydney Morning Herald, Monday 11 April 1938] -"ship of the airs," "flying-ship," referring to a large flying-boat.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/america-by-air/online/innovation/innovation16.cfm Smithsonian, America by air] "Ships of the Air" referring to Pan Am's Boeing Clipper flying-boat fleet.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the term "airship" is used only for powered, dirigible balloons, with sub-types being classified as rigid, semi-rigid or non-rigid.&lt;ref name="ege" /&gt; Semi-rigid architecture is the more recent, following advances in deformable structures and the exigency of reducing weight and volume of the airships. They have a minimal structure that keeps  the shape jointly with overpressure of the gas envelope.&lt;ref&gt;Liao, L., &amp; Pasternak, I. (2009). A review of airship structural research and development. Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 45(4), 83-96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930091277.pdf Tuckerman, L. B. (1926). Inertia factors of ellipsoids for use in airship design.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerostat===
An ''aerostat'' is an [[aircraft]] that remains aloft using buoyancy or static lift, as opposed to the [[Heavier-than-air aircraft|aerodyne]], which obtains lift by moving through the air. Airships are a type of aerostat.&lt;ref name="ege"&gt;Ege (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''aerostat'' has also been used to indicate a tethered or [[moored balloon]] as opposed to a free-floating balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=07EA994A2F49A80A15E17252C57AC109?authRejection=true&amp;url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F3207%3FredirectedFrom%3Daerostat|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerostats today are capable of lifting a payload of 3,000 pounds to an altitude of more than 4.5 kilometers above sea level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Integrated Maritime Surveillance Systems|last=Ince|first=A. Nejat|last2=Topuz|first2=Ercan|last3=Panayirci|first3=Erdal|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media, LLC|year=1998|isbn=9781461374046|location=New York|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also stay in the air for extended periods of time, particularly when powered by an on-board generator or if the tether contains electrical conductors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to this capability, aerostats can be used as platforms for telecommunication services. For instance, Platform Wireless International Corporation announced in 2001 that it would use a tethered 1,250-pound airborne payload to deliver cellular phone service to a 140-mile region in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2591179/mobile-wireless/giant-aerostats-developed-for-rural-cell-phone-service.html|title=Giant Aerostats Developed For Rural Cell Phone Service|last=Brewin|first=Bob|work=Computerworld|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tactical Communications for the Digitized Battlefield|last=Ryan|first=Michael|last2=Frater|first2=Michael|publisher=Artech House|year=2002|isbn=9781580533232|location=Boston, MA|pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]]'s ABSOLUTE project was also reportedly exploring the use of tethered aerostat stations to provide telecommunications during disaster response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130618-google-balloon-wireless-communication-internet-hap-satellite-stratosphere-loon-project/|title=Google's Loon Project Puts Balloon Technology in Spotlight|last=Handwerk|first=Brian|date=2013-06-18|work=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dirigible===
Airships were originally called ''dirigible balloons'', from the [[French language|French]] ''ballon dirigeable'' or shortly ''dirigeable'' (meaning "steerable", from the French ''diriger'' – to direct, guide or steer). This was the name that inventor [[Henri Giffard]] gave to his machine that made its first flight on 24 September 1852.

===Blimp===
A blimp is a non-rigid aerostat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWJBDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=A+blimp+is+a+non-rigid+aerostat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr1a-av-HUAhUG1mMKHYZIASEQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20blimp%20is%20a%20non-rigid%20aerostat&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of Aircraft and Rocket Propulsion|last=El-Sayed|first=Ahmed F.|date=2016-05-25|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781447167969|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In American usage it refers specifically to a non-rigid type of dirigible balloon or airship.{{citation needed|date=February 2014|reason=often asserted by Wikipedians, never yet reliably and authoritatively referenced}} In British usage it refers to any non-rigid aerostat, including [[barrage balloon]]s and other [[kite balloon]]s, having a streamlined shape and stabilising tail fins.&lt;ref&gt;Wragg, D,; ''Historical Dictionary of Aviation'', History Press (2008) Page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zeppelin===
The term zeppelin is a [[genericized trademark]] that originally referred to airships manufactured by the German [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin|Zeppelin Company]], which built and operated the first rigid airships in the early years of the twentieth century.{{citation needed|date=April 2014|reason=Where are the RS for the "genericised trademark" claim?}} The initials LZ, for {{lang|de|Luftschiff Zeppelin}} (German for "Zeppelin airship"), usually prefixed their craft's serial identifiers.

Streamlined rigid (or semi-rigid) airships are usually referred to as "Zeppelin", because of the fame that this company has acquired due to the number of airships it produced.&lt;ref&gt;De Syon, G. (2001). Zeppelin!: Germany and the airship, 1900–1939. JHU Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartcup, G. (1974).

===Hybrid airship===
Hybrid airships fly with a positive aerostatic contribution, usually equal to the empty weight of the system, and the variable payload is sustained by propulsion or aerodynamic contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Buerge, B. T. (2009). The Suitability of Hybrid vs. Conventional Airships for Persistent Surveillance Missions.

==Classification==
Airships are classified according to their method of construction into rigid, semi-rigid and non-rigid types.&lt;ref name="ege" /&gt;

===Rigid airships===
{{Main article|Rigid airship}}
A rigid airship has a rigid framework covered by an outer skin or envelope. The interior contains one or more gasbags, cells or balloons to provide lift. Rigid airships are typically unpressurised and can be made to virtually any size. Most, but not all, of the German [[Zeppelin]] airships have been of this type.

===Semi-rigid airships===
{{Main article|Semi-rigid airship}}
A semi-rigid airship has some kind of supporting structure but the main envelope is held in shape by the internal pressure of the lifting gas. Typically the airship has an extended, usually articulated keel running along the bottom of the envelope to stop it kinking in the middle by distributing suspension loads into the envelope, while also allowing lower envelope pressures.

===Non-rigid airships===
{{Main article|blimp}}
Non-rigid airships are often called "blimps". Most, but not all, of the American [[Goodyear blimp|Goodyear airship]]s have been blimps.

A non-rigid airship relies entirely on internal gas pressure to retain its shape during flight. Unlike the rigid design, the non-rigid airship's gas envelope has no compartments. It typically has smaller internal bags or "ballonets" containing air, however. At sea level, these are filled with air. As altitude is increased, the lifting gas expands and air from the ballonets is expelled through valves to maintain the hull's shape. To return to sea level, the process is reversed: air is forced back into the ballonets by both scooping air from the engine exhaust and using auxiliary blowers.

==Construction==
[[File:Usn-airships.jpg|thumb|U.S. Navy airships and balloons, 1931: in the background, ZR-3, in front of it, (l to r) J-3 or 4, K-1, ZMC-2, in front of them, "Caquot" observation balloon, and in foreground free balloons used for training.]]
The two main parts of an airship are its gas-containing envelope and a gondola or similar structure slung beneath and containing crew and other equipment. The engines may be mounted in the gondola or elsewhere off the envelope.

===Structure===
{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}
The basic structure of an airship may be rigid, semi-rigid or non-rigid, as described.

===Envelope===
The envelope itself is the structure, including textiles that contains the buoyant gas. Internally two ballonets placed in the front part and in the rear part of the hull contains air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airshipposter.de/files/2012_cambridge_university_-_airship_technology_-_second_edition.pdf|title=Khoury, G. A. (2012). Airship technology (Vol. 10). Cambridge University Press.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding one or more gas-bags or ballonets within it.

The problem of the exact determination of the pressure on an airship envelope is still problematic and has fascinated major scientists such as [[Theodor Von Karman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://authors.library.caltech.edu/47901/1/19930094841.pdf Von Karman, Theodor. "Calculation of pressure distribution on airship hulls." (1930).]&lt;/ref&gt;  over history.

Fins at the rear of the envelope stabilize the airship, allowing it to fly straight. On some smaller designs these fins are themselves part of a gas bag and gain their shape only when inflated.

A few airships have been [[Metal-clad airship|metal-clad]], with rigid and nonrigid examples made. Each kind used a thin gastight metal envelope, rather than the usual rubber-coated fabric envelope. Only four metal-clad ships are known to have been built, and only two actually flew: [[David Schwarz (aviation inventor)|Schwarz]]'s first aluminum rigid airship of 1893 collapsed,&lt;ref name=Dooley&gt;[[#Dooley|Dooley]], A.185-A.186 citing Robinson, pp.2–3 collapsed on inflation&lt;/ref&gt; while his second flew;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dooley|Dooley]], A.193 (at Tempelhof, Berlin in 1897, landed but then collapsed)&lt;/ref&gt; the nonrigid [[ZMC-2]] built for the U.S. Navy flew from 1929 to 1941 when it was scrapped as too small for operational use on anti-submarine patrols;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasgi.org/zmc2.htm NAS Grosse Ile], NASGIVM. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; while the 1929 nonrigid Slate Aircraft Corporation ''City of Glendale'' collapsed on its first flight attempt.&lt;ref&gt;National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution. 2008.

===Lifting gas===
Early airships used [[hydrogen]] as their [[lifting gas]], which is the lightest available. Typically, hydrogen was generated during the filling process, by reacting dilute sulphuric acid with metal filings. The first hydrogen balloon in 1783 used iron filings, while the British [[British Army Dirigible No 1|Nulli Secundus]] of 1907 used zinc.

Later, the United States began to use [[helium]] because it is non-flammable and has 92.7% of the buoyancy (lifting power) of hydrogen. Following a series of airship disasters in the 1930s, and especially the [[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]] disaster where the airship burst into flames, hydrogen fell into disuse.

[[Thermal airship]]s use a heated lifting gas, usually air, in a fashion similar to [[hot air balloon]]s. The first to do so was flown in 1973 by the British company [[Cameron Balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;"Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1980-81", Pages 609–610&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gondola===
[[File:Modern airship gondola.jpg|thumb|A gondola fitted with twin propellers]]
The term "gondola" is used to describe a crew car of an airship, slung beneath the centre of the envelope. These may be short, for cockpit and landing gear alone, or longer to provide passenger space. Early gondolas were open structures slung beneath the envelope, while later ones were enclosed and hung directly from the internal framing. A nonrigid blimp carries all of its passengers within a gondola. Rigid airships may have further passenger or cargo space inside the envelope. The large airship ''Graf Zeppelin'' was noted for its distinctively short passenger gondola, mounted far forward so as to improve ground clearance. The majority of crew accommodation and cargo holds were placed inside the envelope.

===Propulsion and control===
Small airships carry their engine(s) in their gondola. Where there were multiple engines on larger airships, these were placed in separate nacelles, termed ''power cars'' or ''engine cars''.&lt;ref name="Brew, 1998, engine cars" &gt;{{cite book

  |isbn=1-84037-023-8
  |pages=41, 43, 92
}}&lt;/ref&gt; To allow asymmetric thrust to be applied for maneuvering, these power cars were mounted towards the sides of the envelope, away from the centre line gondola. This also raised them above the ground, reducing the risk of a propeller strike when landing. Widely spaced power cars were also termed ''wing cars'', from the use of "wing" to mean being on the side of something, as in a theater, rather than the [[wing|aerodynamic device]].&lt;ref name="Brew, 1998, engine cars" /&gt; These engine cars carried a crew during flight who maintained the engines as needed, but who also worked the engine controls, throttle etc., mounted directly on the engine. Instructions were relayed to them from the pilot's station by a [[engine order telegraph|telegraph system]], as on a ship.&lt;ref name="Brew, 1998, engine cars" /&gt;

While elevators and swivelling propellers provide fine control of altitude, larger changes of height used to be controlled by either venting gas to lose altitude or dropping ballast to gain altitude. Large airships typically carried several water tanks fore and aft, allowing them to adjust longitudinal trim as well as height. Some modern designs instead pump lifting gas between the gas bags and storage cylinders.

==Environmental benefits==

The main advantage of airships with respect to any other vehicle is of environmental nature. They require less energy to remain in flight, if compared to any other air vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040021326.pdf Colozza, A., &amp; Dolce, J.

====17th-18th centuries====
In 1670 the [[Jesuit]] Father [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]], sometimes referred to as the "Father of [[Aeronautics]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Francesco Lana-Terzi, S.J. (1631-1687); The Father of Aeronautics | url=http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/scientists/lana.htm | accessdate = 24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a description of an "Aerial Ship" supported by four copper spheres from which the air was evacuated. Although the basic principle is sound, such a craft was unrealizable then and remains so to the present day, since external air pressure would cause the spheres to collapse unless their thickness was such as to make them too heavy to be buoyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Would a balloon filled with vacuum instead of helium float? | url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question194.htm | accessdate = 24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothetical craft constructed using this principle is known as a ''[[Vacuum airship]]''.

A more practical dirigible airship was described by Lieutenant [[Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier]] in a paper entitled "''Mémoire sur l’équilibre des machines aérostatiques''" (Memorandum on the equilibrium of aerostatic machines) presented to the [[French Academy]] on 3 December 1783. The 16 water-color drawings published the following year depict a {{convert|260|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} streamlined envelope with internal ballonnets that could be used for regulating lift: this was attached to a long carriage that could be used as a boat if the vehicle was forced to land in water. The airship was designed to be driven by three propellers and steered with a sail-like aft rudder. In 1784 [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] fitted a hand-powered propeller to a balloon, the first recorded means of propulsion carried aloft. In 1785 he crossed the [[English Channel]] in a balloon equipped with flapping wings for propulsion and a birdlike tail for steering.&lt;ref&gt;Winter &amp; Degner (1933), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

====19th century====

The [[timeline of aviation – 19th century|19th century]] saw continued attempts to add methods of propulsion to balloons. The Australian [[William Bland]] sent designs for his "Atmotic Airship" to the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] held in London in 1851, where a model was displayed. This was an elongated balloon with a steam engine driving twin propellers suspended underneath. The lift of the balloon was estimated as 5&amp;nbsp;tons and the car with the fuel as weighing 3.5&amp;nbsp;tons, giving a payload of 1.5&amp;nbsp;tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2032274|title=AIRSHIP HONOURS FOR AUSTRALIA. - BLAND'S REMARKABLE INVENTION MORE THAN 70 YEARS AGO. - The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957) - 13 Sep 1924|work=nla.gov.au|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/visions-of-a-flying-machine/2006/05/10/1146940613357.html|title=Visions of a flying machine - National - smh.com.au|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bland believed that the machine could be driven at {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and could fly from Sydney to London in less than a week.&lt;!--This figure is nonsense: London–Sidney is c. 10,500 mi--&gt;

In 1852 [[Henri Giffard]] became the first person to make an engine-powered flight when he flew {{convert|27|km|abbr=on}} in a [[Giffard dirigible|steam-powered airship]].&lt;ref&gt;Winter &amp; Degner (1933), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Airships would develop considerably over the next two decades. In 1863 [[Solomon Andrews (inventor)|Solomon Andrews]] flew his aereon design, an unpowered, controllable dirigible in Perth Amboy, New Jersey and offered the device to the U.S. Military during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, Stephen D.

This concept used changes in lift to provide propulsive force, and did not need a powerplant. In 1872, the French naval architect [[Henri Dupuy de Lôme|Dupuy de Lome]] launched a large navigable balloon, which was driven by a large propeller turned by eight men.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brooks1992|Brooks 1992]] p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed during the [[Franco-Prussian war]] and was intended as an improvement to the balloons used for communications between Paris and the countryside during the [[Siege of Paris (1870–1871)|siege of Paris]], but was completed only after the end of the war.

In 1872 [[Paul Haenlein]] flew an airship with an internal combustion engine running on the coal gas used to inflate the envelope, the first use of such an engine to power an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Winter &amp; Degner (1933), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mattos"&gt;Bento S.

In 1883 the first electric-powered flight was made by [[Gaston Tissandier]], who fitted a {{convert|1.5|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] electric motor to an airship.

The first fully controllable free flight was made in 1884 by [[Charles Renard]] and [[Arthur Constantin Krebs]] in the [[French Army]] airship ''[[La France (airship)|La France]]''.

In 1897, an airship with an aluminum envelope was built by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]-[[Croatian people|Croatian]] engineer [[David Schwarz (aviation inventor)|David Schwarz]]. It made its first flight at [[Tempelhof International Airport|Tempelhof field]] in Berlin after Schwarz had died.

In 1897—99 Konstantin Danilewsky, medical doctor and inventor from [[Kharkiv]] (now [[Ukraine]], then [[Russian Empire]]), built four muscle-powered airships, of gas volume 150—180 cub.m. About 200 ascents were made within a framework of experimental flight program, at two locations, with no significant incidents &lt;ref&gt;Bill Welker.

===Early 20th century===
[[File:First Zeppelin ascent.jpg|thumb|LZ1, Count Zeppelin's first airship]]
In July 1900, the Luftschiff [[Zeppelin LZ1]] made its first flight. This led to the most successful airships of all time: the Zeppelins, named after [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin|Count von Zeppelin]] who began working on rigid airship designs in the 1890s, leading to the flawed LZ1 in 1900 and the more successful [[Zeppelin LZ2|LZ2]] in 1906. The Zeppelin airships had a framework composed of triangular lattice girders covered with fabric that contained separate gas cells. At first multiplane tail surfaces were used for control and stability: later designs had simpler [[Cruciform tail|cruciform]] tail surfaces. The engines and crew were accommodated in "gondolas" hung beneath the hull driving propellers attached to the sides of the frame by means of long drive shafts. Additionally, there was a passenger compartment (later a [[bomb bay]]) located halfway between the two engine compartments.

[[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] was a wealthy [[Brazil]]ian who lived in France and had a passion for flying. He designed 18 balloons and dirigibles before turning his attention to fixed-winged aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Niccoli, R. ''The Book of Flight: From the flying machines of Leonardo da Vinci to the conquest of space'', New York, Friedman/Fairfax, 2002, p. 24. {{ISBN|978-1-58663-716-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 19 October 1901 he flew his airship ''[[Santos-Dumont number 6|Number 6]]'', a small semi-rigid with a detached keel, from the [[Parc Saint Cloud]] to and around the [[Eiffel Tower]] and back in under thirty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Toland (1957), pp. 25–37.&lt;/ref&gt; This feat earned him the [[Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe|Deutsch de la Meurthe]] prize of 100,000 [[franc]]s. Many inventors were inspired by Santos-Dumont's small airships and a veritable airship craze began worldwide. Many airship pioneers, such as the American [[Thomas Scott Baldwin]], financed their activities through passenger flights and public demonstration flights. [[Stanley Spencer (aeronaut)|Stanley Spencer]] built the first British airship with funds from advertising baby food on the sides of the envelope.&lt;ref name="Christchurch Star"&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TS19031231.2.12&amp;cl=&amp;srpos=0&amp;e=-------10-PubMetaTS-1-byDA---2%2522cashmere+road%2522-- Papers Past - Christchurch Star, 31 December 1903, ''WAYS OF AIRSHIPS'' (p. 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Walter Wellman]] and [[Melvin Vaniman]], set their sights on loftier goals, attempting two polar flights in 1907 and 1909, and two trans-Atlantic flights in 1910 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Toland (1957), pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1911 AstraTorres airshipNo1 crop.jpg|right|thumb|An Astra-Torres airship]]
In 1902, the Spanish engineer [[Leonardo Torres Quevedo]] published details of an innovative airship design in Spain and France. With a non-rigid body and internal bracing wires, it overcame the flaws of these types of aircraft as regards both rigid structure (zeppelin type) and flexibility, providing the airships with more stability during flight, and the capability of using heavier engines and a greater passenger load. In 1905, helped by Captain A. Kindelán, he built the airship "España" at the [[Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha|Guadalajara]] military base. Next year he patented his design without attracting official interest. In 1909 he patented an improved design that he offered to the French [[Société Astra|Astra]] company, who started mass-producing it in 1911 as the [[Astra-Torres airship]]. The distinctive three-lobed design was widely used during the Great War by the Entente powers.

Other airship builders were also active before the war: from 1902 the French company [[Lebaudy Frères]] specialized in semirigid airships such as the ''[[Lebaudy Patrie|Patrie]]'' and the ''[[Lebaudy République|République]]'', designed by their engineer Henri Julliot, who later worked for the American company [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]]; the German firm [[Schütte-Lanz]] built the wooden-framed SL series from 1911, introducing important technical innovations; another German firm [[Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft]] built the ''[[August von Parseval|Parseval]]-Luftschiff'' (PL) series from 1909,&lt;ref name=LuegerLuftschiff&gt;[[#Lueger1920|Lueger 1920]], pp.404–412, [http://www.zeno.org/Lueger-1904/A/Luftschiff Luftschiff]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian [[Enrico Forlanini]]'s firm had built and flown the first two [[Forlanini airships]].&lt;ref name=Lig&gt;[[#Lig|Ligugnana, Sandro]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 1902, the inventor and [[Brazil]]ian aeronaut [[Augusto Severo de Albuquerque Maranhao]] and his French mechanic, Georges Saché, died when they were flying over [[Paris]] in the airship called Pax. A marble plaque at number 81 of the Avenue du Maine in Paris, celebrates the location of Augusto Severo accident.&lt;ref name=severodeath&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/M500050/Death-of-the-aeronaut-Auguste-Severo-and-his-mechanic-George-Sache?img=2&amp;search=Sache&amp;bool=phrase|title=Death of the aeronaut Auguste Severo and his mechanic George Sache|work=lookandlearn.com|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=severo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cabanus.e-monsite.com/pages/les-dirigeables/la-belle-epoque-1890-1905.html|title=La belle époque. 1890-1905.|work=e-monsite.com|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Catastrophe of the Balloon "Le Pax"]] is a 1902 short silent film recreation of the catastrophe, directed by [[Georges Méliès]].

In Britain, the Army built their first dirigible, the [[British Army Dirigible No 1|''Nulli Secundus'']], in 1907. The Navy ordered the construction of an experimental rigid in 1908. Officially known as [[HMA No. 1|His Majesty's Airship No. 1]] and nicknamed the ''Mayfly'', it broke its back in 1911 before making a single flight. Work on a successor did not start until 1913.

In 1910 [[Walter Wellman]] unsuccessfully attempted an aerial crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the airship ''[[America (airship)|America]]''.

===World War I===
{{Main article|German strategic bombing during World War I}}
[[File:German airship bombing Warsaw.JPG|thumb|German airship [[List of Schütte-Lanz airships#SL2|Schütte Lanz SL2]] [[Aerial bombing of cities|bombing]] [[Warsaw]] in 1914.]]
The prospect of airships as bombers had been recognized in Europe well before the airships were up to the task. [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War in the Air]]'' (1908) described the obliteration of entire fleets and cities by airship attack. The Italian forces became the first to use dirigibles for a military purpose during the [[Italo–Turkish War]], the first bombing mission being flown on 10 March 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200298.html With the Dirigibles at Tripoli][[Flight International|''Flight'']] 30 March 1912&lt;/ref&gt;  It was [[World War I]], however, that marked the airship's real debut as a weapon. The Germans, French and Italians all used airships for scouting and tactical bombing roles early in the war, and all learned that the airship was too vulnerable for operations over the front. The decision to end operations in direct support of armies was made by all in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Ventry &amp; Koesnik (1982), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1973), pp. 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in the German military believed they had found the ideal weapon with which to counteract British naval superiority and strike at Britain itself, while more realistic airship advocates believed the zeppelin's value was as a long range scout/attack craft for naval operations. Raids on England began in January 1915 and peaked in 1916: following losses to the British defenses only a few raids were made in 1917–18, the last in August 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 1994, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeppelins proved to be terrifying but inaccurate weapons. Navigation, target selection and bomb-aiming proved to be difficult under the best of conditions, and the cloud cover that was frequently encountered by the airships reduced accuracy even further. The physical damage done by airships over the course of the war was insignificant, and the deaths that they caused amounted to a few hundred.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Christopher and Cheesman, E. F. ''The Air Defence of Great Britain 1914–1918''. London: Putnam, 1984. {{ISBN|0-370-30538-8}}. p.449&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the raid caused a significant diversion of British resources to defense efforts. The airships were initially immune to attack by aircraft and anti-aircraft guns: as the pressure in their envelopes was only just higher than ambient air, holes had little effect. But following the introduction of a combination of [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] and [[High-explosive incendiary|explosive]] ammunition in 1916, their flammable hydrogen lifting gas made them vulnerable to the defending aeroplanes. Several were shot down in flames by British defenders, and many others destroyed in accidents. New designs capable of reaching greater altitude were developed, but although this made them immune from attack it made their bombing accuracy even worse.

Countermeasures by the British included sound detection equipment, searchlights and anti-aircraft artillery, followed by night fighters in 1915. One tactic used early in the war, when their limited range meant the airships had to fly from forward bases and the only zeppelin production facilities were in [[Friedrichshafen]], was the bombing of airship sheds by the British [[Royal Naval Air Service]]. Later in the war, the development of the [[aircraft carrier]] led to the first successful carrier-based air strike in history: on the morning of 19 July 1918, seven [[Sopwith Camel|Sopwith 2F.1 Camels]] were launched from {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} and [[Tondern raid|struck the airship base at Tondern]], destroying zeppelins L&amp;nbsp;54 and L&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1994), pp. 340–341.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Army had abandoned airship development in favour of aeroplanes before the start of the war, but the Royal Navy had recognized the need for small airships to counteract the submarine and mine threat in coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;Higham (1961), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in February 1915, they began to develop the [[SS class blimp|SS]] (Sea Scout) class of blimp. These had a small envelope of {{convert|1,699|-|1,982|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} and at first used aircraft [[fuselage]]s without the wing and tail surfaces as control cars. Later, more advanced blimps with purpose-built gondolas were used. The [[NS class blimp|NS class]] (North Sea) were the largest and most effective non-rigid airships in British service, with a gas capacity of {{convert|10200|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}, a crew of 10 and an endurance of 24 hours. Six {{convert|230|lb|sing=on|abbr=on}} bombs were carried, as well as three to five machine guns. British blimps were used for scouting, mine clearance, and [[convoy]] patrol duties. During the war, the British operated over 200 non-rigid airships.&lt;ref&gt;Mowthorpe, Ces, ''Battlebags'', Stroud, Gloucs, Allan Sutton Publishing, 1995, p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Several were sold to Russia, France, the United States, and Italy. The large number of trained crews, low attrition rate and constant experimentation in handling techniques meant that at the war's end Britain was the world leader in non-rigid airship technology.

The Royal Navy continued development of rigid airships until the end of the war. Eight rigid airships had been completed by the armistice, ([[No. 9r]], four [[23 class airship|23 Class]], two [[R23X class airship|R23X Class]] and one [[R31 class airship|R31 Class]]), although several more were in an advanced state of completion by the war's end.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Abbott and Nick Walmsley, British Airships in Pictures: An Illustrated History, House of Lochar 1998, {{ISBN|1-899863-48-6}} (pp.59–69)&lt;/ref&gt; Both France and Italy continued to use airships throughout the war. France preferred the non-rigid type, whereas Italy flew 49 semi-rigid airships in both the scouting and bombing roles.&lt;ref&gt;Ventry &amp; Koesnik (1982), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeroplanes had essentially replaced airships as bombers by the end of the war, and Germany's remaining zeppelins were destroyed by their crews, scrapped or handed over to the Allied powers as war reparations. The British rigid airship program, which had mainly been a reaction to the potential threat of the German airships, was wound down.

===The interwar period===

A number of nations operated airships between the two world wars. Britain, the United States and Germany were the only constructors of rigid airships, with Italy and France making limited use of Zeppelins handed over as war reparations. Italy, the Soviet Union, the United States and Japan mainly operated semi-rigid airships.

Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was not allowed to build airships of greater capacity than a million cubic feet. Two small passenger airships, [[Zeppelin LZ 120 Bodensee|LZ&amp;nbsp;120 ''Bodensee'']] and its sister ship LZ&amp;nbsp;121 ''Nordstern'', were built immediately after the war but were confiscated following the sabotage of the wartime Zeppelins that were to have been handed over as war reparations: ''Bodensee'' was given to Italy and ''Nordstern'' to France. On May 12, 1926, the Italian semi-rigid airship ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'' was the first aircraft to fly over the [[North Pole]].

The British [[R33 class airship|R33]] and [[R34 (airship)|R34]] were near-identical copies of the German L&amp;nbsp;33, which had come down almost intact in Yorkshire on 24 September 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Higham (1961), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being almost three years out of date by the time they were launched in 1919, they became two of the most successful airships in British service. The creation of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in early 1918 created a hybrid British airship program. The RAF was not interested in airships while the [[Admiralty]] was, so a deal was made where the Admiralty would design any future military airships and the RAF would handle manpower, facilities and operations.&lt;ref name="Higham, Robin 1961, pg. 176"&gt;Higham (1961), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 2 July 1919, R34 began the first double crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] by an aircraft. It landed at [[Mineola, Long Island]] on 6 July after 108&amp;nbsp;hours in the air; the return crossing began on 8 July and took 75 hours. This feat failed to generate enthusiasm for continued airship development, and the British airship program was rapidly wound down.

During World War One, the U.S. Navy acquired its first airship, the DH-1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Popular%20Mechanics%20June%201916&amp;pg=PA819#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%20June%201916&amp;f=true|title=Popular Mechanics|first=Hearst|last=Magazines|date=4 October 2016|publisher=Hearst Magazines|accessdate=4 October 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was destroyed while being inflated shortly after delivery to the Navy. After the war, the U.S. Navy contracted to buy the [[ZR-2|R 38]], which was being built in Britain, but before it was handed over it was destroyed because of a structural failure during a test flight.&lt;ref&gt;Higham 1961, pp. 222–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

America then started constructing the  {{USS|Shenandoah|ZR-1|6}}, designed by the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] and based on the [[List of Zeppelins#LZ 96|Zeppelin L&amp;nbsp;49]].&lt;ref&gt;Swanborough, G. and Bowyers, P.

A second airship, {{USS|Los Angeles|ZR-3|6}}, was built by the Zeppelin company as compensation for the airships that should have been handed over as war reparations according to the terms of the Versailles Treaty but had been sabotaged by their crews. This construction order saved the Zeppelin works from the threat of closure. The success of the ''Los Angeles'', which was flown successfully for eight years, encouraged the U.S. Navy to invest in its own, larger airships. When the ''Los Angeles'' was delivered, the two airships had to share the limited supply of helium, and thus alternated operating and overhauls.&lt;ref&gt;Althoff, William F., ''USS Los Angeles'', Washington DC, Brassey's, 2004, p. 48, {{ISBN|1-57488-620-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 [[Charles Dennistoun Burney|Sir Dennistoun Burney]] suggested a plan for a subsidised air service throughout the [[British Empire]] using airships (the Burney Scheme).&lt;ref name="Higham, Robin 1961, pg. 176" /&gt; Following the coming to power of [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in 1924, the scheme was transformed into the [[Imperial Airship Scheme]], under which two airships were built, one by a private company and the other by the [[Royal Airship Works]] under Air Ministry control. The two designs were radically different. The "capitalist" ship, the ''[[R100]]'', was more conventional, while the "socialist" ship, the [[R101]], had many innovative design features. Construction of both took longer than expected, and the airships did not fly until 1929. Neither airship was capable of the service intended, though the R100 did complete a proving flight to Canada and back in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Countryman, Barry, ''R100 in Canada'', Erin, Ontario, Boston Mills, 1982, {{ISBN|0-919822-36-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 1930, however, the R101, which had not been thoroughly tested after major modifications, crashed on its maiden voyage at Beauvais in France killing 48 of the 54 people aboard. Among the dead were the craft's chief designer and the Secretary of State for Air. The disaster put an end to further British airship development.

The [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 lifted the restrictions on German airship construction, and the Zeppelin company started construction of the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'' (LZ&amp;nbsp;127)]], the largest airship that could be built in the company's existing shed, and intended to stimulate interest in passenger airships. The ''Graf Zeppelin'' burned ''[[blau gas]]'', similar to [[propane]], stored in large gas bags below the hydrogen cells, as fuel. Since its density was similar to that of air, it avoided the weight change as fuel was used, and thus the need to [[valve]] hydrogen. The ''Graf Zeppelin'' was a great success and had an impressive safety record, flying over {{convert|1600000|km|mi|abbr=on}} (including the first circumnavigation of the globe by air) without a single passenger injury.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, Douglas, ''Dr. Eckener's Dream Machine''. New York: Henry Hold, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8050-6458-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:NH43901-enhanced.jpg|thumb|USS ''Akron'' over [[Lower Manhattan]], summer 1933]]
The U.S. Navy experimented with the use of airships as [[airborne aircraft carrier]]s, developing an idea pioneered by the British. The USS ''Los Angeles'' was used for initial experiments, and the {{USS|Akron|ZRS-4|6}} and {{USS|Macon|ZRS-5|2}}, the world's largest at the time, were used to test the principle in naval operations. Each carried four [[F9C Sparrowhawk]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] in its hangar, and could carry a fifth on the trapeze. The idea had mixed results. By the time the Navy started to develop a sound doctrine for using the ZRS-type airships, the last of the two built, USS ''Macon'', had been lost. The seaplane had become more capable, and was considered a better investment.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1965), pp. 171–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the U.S. Navy lost all three U.S.-built rigid airships to accidents. USS ''Shenandoah'' flew into a [[severe thunderstorm]] over [[Noble County, Ohio]] while on a poorly planned publicity flight on [[1925 in aviation|3 September 1925]]. It broke into pieces, killing 14 of its crew. USS ''Akron'' was caught in a severe storm and flown into the surface of the sea off the shore of New Jersey on [[1933 in aviation|3 April 1933]]. It carried no life boats and few life vests, so 73 of its crew of 76 died from drowning or hypothermia. USS ''Macon'' was lost after suffering a structural failure offshore near [[Point Sur Lighthouse]] on [[1935 in aviation|12 February 1935]]. The failure caused a loss of gas, which was made much worse when the aircraft was driven over pressure height causing it to lose too much helium to maintain flight.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1965), pp. 157–161.&lt;/ref&gt; Only two of its crew of 83 died in the crash thanks to the inclusion of life jackets and inflatable rafts after the ''Akron'' disaster.

The [[Empire State Building]] was completed in 1931 with a dirigible mast, in anticipation of passenger airship service. Various entrepreneurs experimented with commuting and shipping freight via airship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=|date=2010-02-26|title=Intercity Dirigible Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s the German Zeppelins successfully competed with other means of transport. They could carry significantly more passengers than other contemporary aircraft while providing amenities similar to those on ocean liners, such as private cabins, observation decks, and dining rooms. Less importantly, the technology was potentially more energy-efficient than heavier-than-air designs. Zeppelins were also faster than ocean liners. On the other hand, operating airships was quite involved. Often the crew would outnumber passengers, and on the ground large teams were necessary to assist mooring and very large hangars were required at airports.

[[File:Hindenburg burning.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' catches fire, 6 May 1937]]
By the mid-1930s only Germany still pursued airship development. The Zeppelin company continued to operate the ''Graf Zeppelin'' on passenger service between Frankfurt and [[Recife]] in Brazil, taking 68 hours. Even with the small ''Graf Zeppelin'', the operation was almost profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, Douglas, ''Dr. Eckener's Dream Machine''. New York, Henry Hold, 2001, p. 235, {{ISBN|0-8050-6458-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1930s work started to build an airship designed specifically to operate a passenger service across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, Harold G., with Robinson, Douglas H., ''Graf Zeppelin &amp; Hindenburg'', Washington DC, Smithsonian Institution Press, 1985, p. 83, {{ISBN|0-87474-364-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'' (LZ 129)]] completed a successful 1936 season, carrying passengers between [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]] and Germany. 1937 started with the most spectacular and widely remembered airship accident. Approaching the Lakehurst [[mooring mast]] minutes before landing on 6 May 1937, the ''Hindenburg'' burst into flames and crashed. Of the 97 people aboard, 36 died: 13 passengers, 22 aircrew, and one American ground-crewman. The disaster happened before a large crowd, was filmed and a [[Herbert Morrison (announcer)|radio news reporter]] was recording the arrival. This was a disaster that theater goers could see and hear in [[newsreels]]. The ''Hindenburg'' disaster shattered public confidence in airships, and brought a definitive end to their "golden age". The day after the ''Hindenburg'' crashed, the ''Graf Zeppelin'' landed at the end of its flight from Brazil. This was the last international passenger airship flight.

''Hindenburg''{{'}}s sister ship, the [[LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin II'' (LZ 130)]], could not carry commercial passengers without helium, which the United States refused to sell to Germany during wartime. The ''Graf Zeppelin'' made several test flights and conducted some electronic espionage until 1939 when it was grounded due to the beginning of the war. The two ''Graf Zeppelins'' were scrapped in the spring of 1940.

Development of airships continued only in the United States, and to a smaller extent, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had several semi-rigid and non-rigid airships. The semi-rigid dirigible [[SSSR-V6 OSOAVIAKhIM]] was among the largest of these craft, and it set the longest endurance flight at the time of over 130 hours. It crashed into a mountain in 1938, however, killing 13 of the 19 people on board. While this was a severe blow to the Soviet airship program, they continued to operate non-rigid airships until 1950.

===World War II===
While Germany determined that airships were obsolete for military purposes in the coming war and concentrated on the development of aeroplanes, the United States pursued a program of military airship construction even though it had not developed a clear [[military doctrine]] for airship use. When the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, bringing the United States into [[World War II]], the U.S. Navy had 10 nonrigid airships:
*4 ''K''-class: ''K-2'', ''K-3'', ''K-4'' and ''K-5'' designed as patrol ships, all built in 1938.
*3 ''L''-class: ''L-1'', ''L-2'' and ''L-3'' as small training ships, produced in 1938.
*1 ''G''-class, built in 1936 for training.
*2 ''TC''-class that were older patrol airships designed for land forces, built in 1933. The U.S. Navy acquired both from the United States Army in 1938.
[[File:Goodyear ZNPK (K-28) Puritan (2834542477).jpg|thumb|Control car (gondola) of the Goodyear ZNPK (K-28) later operated by Goodyear as Puritan VI]]

Only ''K''- and ''TC''-class airships were suitable for combat and they were quickly pressed into service against Japanese and German [[submarine]]s, which were then sinking American shipping within visual range of the American coast. U.S. Navy command, remembering airship's anti-submarine success in World War I, immediately requested new modern antisubmarine airships and on 2 January 1942 formed the ZP-12 patrol unit based in [[Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst|Lakehurst]] from the four ''K'' airships. The ZP-32 patrol unit was formed from two ''TC'' and two ''L'' airships a month later, based at [[Moffett Federal Airfield|NAS Moffett Field]] in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. An airship training base was created there as well. The status of submarine-hunting Goodyear airships in the early days of [[World War II]] has created significant confusion. Although various accounts refer to airships ''Resolute'' and ''Volunteer'' as operating as "privateers" under a [[Letter of Marque]], Congress never authorized a commission, nor did the President sign one.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Richard, Reconsidering the [[Letter of Marque]]: Utilizing Private Security Providers Against Piracy (April 1, 2010).

[[File:mcastustin1.jpg|thumb|left|A view of six helium-filled blimps being stored in one of the two massive [[hangar]]s located at [[Marine Corps Air Station Tustin|NAS Santa Ana]], during World War II.]]
In the years 1942–44, approximately 1,400 airship pilots and 3,000 support crew members were trained in the military airship crew training program and the airship military personnel grew from 430 to 12,400. The U.S. airships were produced by the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] factory in [[Akron, Ohio]]. From 1942 till 1945, 154 airships were built for the U.S. Navy (133 ''K''-class, 10 ''L''-class, seven ''G''-class, four ''M''-class) and five ''L''-class for civilian customers (serial numbers ''L-4'' to ''L-8'').

The primary airship tasks were patrol and [[convoy]] escort near the American coastline. They also served as an organization centre for the convoys to direct ship movements, and were used in naval search and rescue operations. Rarer duties of the airships included aerophoto reconnaissance, naval mine-laying and mine-sweeping, parachute unit transport and deployment, cargo and personnel transportation. They were deemed quite successful in their duties with the highest combat readiness factor in the entire U.S. air force (87%).

During the war, some 532 ships without airship escort were sunk near the U.S. coast by enemy submarines. Only one ship, the tanker ''Persephone'', of the 89,000 or so in convoys escorted by blimps was sunk by the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Vaeth, J. Gordon, ''Blimps &amp; U-Boats'', Anapolis, MD, U.S. Naval Institute Press, 1992, pp. 20–21, {{ISBN|1-55750-876-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airships engaged submarines with [[depth charge]]s and, less frequently, with other on-board weapons. They were excellent at driving submarines down, where their limited speed and range prevented them from attacking convoys. The weapons available to airships were so limited that until the advent of the [[homing torpedo]] they had little chance of sinking a submarine.&lt;ref name="Vaeth, J. Gordon 1992"&gt;Vaeth, J. Gordon, ''Blimps &amp; U-Boats'', Anapolis, MD, U.S. Naval Institute Press, 1992, {{ISBN|1-55750-876-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one airship was ever destroyed by [[U-boat]]: on the night of 18/19 July 1943, the ''K-74'' from ZP-21 division was patrolling the coastline near Florida. Using [[radar]], the airship located a surfaced German submarine. The ''K-74'' made her attack run but the U-boat opened fire first. ''K-74''{{'}}s [[depth charge]]s did not release as she crossed the U-boat and the ''K-74'' received serious damage, losing gas pressure and an engine but landing in the water without loss of life. The crew was rescued by patrol boats in the morning, but one crewman, Aviation Machinist's Mate Second Class Isadore Stessel, died from a [[shark]] attack. The U-Boat, {{Ship|German|submarine U-134|1941|2}}, was slightly damaged and the next day or so was attacked by aircraft, sustaining damage that forced it to return to base. It was finally sunk on 24 August 1943 by a British [[Vickers Wellington]] near [[Vigo, Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010612154236/http://www.history.navy.mil/download/lta-08.pdf U.S. Navy LTA history].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/boats/u134.htm U-134 history], ''Uboat.net''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleet Airship Wing One operated from Lakehurst, New Jersey, Glynco, Georgia, Weeksville, North Carolina, [[South Weymouth NAS]] Massachusetts, [[Brunswick NAS]] and Bar Harbor Maine, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and Argentia, Newfoundland.

[[File:USN ZP-14 Blimp at RAF Gibraltar 1944.jpg|thumb|K-class blimps of USN Blimp Squadron ZP-14 conducted antisubmarine warfare operations at the Strait of Gibraltar in 1944-45.]]
Some Navy blimps saw action in the European war theater. In 1944-45, the U.S. Navy moved an entire squadron of eight Goodyear [[K class blimp]]s (K-89, K-101, K-109, K-112, K-114, K-123, K-130, &amp; K-134) with flight and maintenance crews from [[Weeksville Dirigible Hangar|Weeksville Naval Air Station]] in North Carolina to [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey]], [[French Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naval-airships.org/resources/documents/NAN_vol93_no2_KShips_feature.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Their mission was to locate and destroy German U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] where [[magnetic anomaly detection]] (MAD) was viable. PBY aircraft had been searching these waters but MAD required low altitude flying that was dangerous at night for these aircraft. The blimps were considered a perfect solution to establish a [[24/7]] MAD barrier (fence) at the Straits of Gibraltar with the PBYs flying the day shift and the blimps flying the night shift. The first two blimps (K-123 &amp; K-130) left [[Naval Air Station South Weymouth|South Weymouth NAS]] on 28 May 1944 and flew to [[Naval Station Argentia|Argentia, Newfoundland]], the [[Lajes Field|Azores]], and finally to [[Kenitra Airport|Port Lyautey]] where they completed the first transatlantic crossing by nonrigid airships on 1 June 1944. The blimps of USN Blimp Squadron ZP-14 (Blimpron 14, aka ''The Africa Squadron'') also conducted mine-spotting and mine-sweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escorts including the convoy carrying United States President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] to the [[Yalta Conference]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Don,[http://www.warwingsart.com/LTA/zp-14.html Blimp Squadron 14], ''WarWingsArt.com''. Retrieved 16 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Airships from the ZP-12 unit took part in the sinking of the last U-Boat before German capitulation, sinking the ''U-881'' on 6 May 1945 together with destroyers Atherton and Mobery.

Other airships patrolled the [[Caribbean]], Fleet Airship Wing Two, Headquartered at [[NAS Richmond, Florida]], covered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] from Richmond and [[Key West, Florida]], [[Houma, Louisiana]], as well as [[Hitchcock, Texas|Hitchcock]] and [[Brownsville, Texas]]. FAW 2 also patrolled the northern Caribbean from San Julian,{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=where is this San Julian located, there are several, and cite would be helpful}} the Isle of Pines (now called [[Isla de la Juventud]]) and [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]] as well as [[Vernam Field]], [[Jamaica]].

Navy blimps of Fleet Airship Wing Five, (ZP-51) operated from bases in [[Trinidad]], [[British Guiana]] and [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname (Dutch colony)|Suriname]]. Fleet Airship Wing Four operated along the coast of [[Brazil]]. Two squadrons, VP-41 and VP-42 flew from bases at [[Amapá]], [[Igarapé-Açu]], [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]] [[Fortaleza]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Recife]], [[Maceió]], [[Ipitanga]] (near [[Salvador, Bahia]]), [[Caravelas]], [[Vitória, Espírito Santo|Vitória]] and the hangar built for the ''Graf Zeppelin'' at [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro]].

Fleet Airship Wing Three operated squadrons, ZP-32 from Moffett Field, ZP-31 at NAS Santa Ana, and ZP-33 at [[Naval Air Station Tillamook|NAS Tillamook, Oregon]]. Auxiliary fields were at [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]], [[Lompoc, California|Lompoc]], [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]] and [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], California, [[North Bend, Oregon|North Bend]] and [[Astoria, Oregon]], as well as [[Shelton, Washington|Shelton]] and [[Quillayute Airport|Quillayute]] in Washington.

From 2 January 1942 until the end of war airship operations in the Atlantic, the blimps of the Atlantic fleet made 37,554 flights and flew 378,237 hours. Of the over 70,000 ships in convoys protected by blimps, only one was sunk by a submarine while under blimp escort.&lt;ref name="Vaeth, J. Gordon 1992" /&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] flew a single airship during the war. The ''W-12'', built in 1939, entered service in 1942 for paratrooper training and equipment transport. It made 1432 flights with 300&amp;nbsp;[[tonne|metric tons]] of cargo until 1945. On 1 February 1945, the Soviets constructed a second airship, a ''Pobeda''-class (''Victory''-class) unit (used for mine-sweeping and wreckage clearing in the Black Sea) that crashed on 21 January 1947. Another ''W''-class - W-12bis ''Patriot'' - was commissioned in 1947 and was mostly used until the mid 1950s for crew training, parades and propaganda.

===Postwar period===
[[File:Goodyear blimp.jpg|thumb|left|One of the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]]'s [[Goodyear Blimp|blimp]] fleet]]
Although airships are no longer used for major cargo and passenger transport, they are still used for other purposes such as [[advertising]], [[sightseeing]], surveillance, research and [[advocacy]].

In the 1980s, [[Per Lindstrand]] and his team introduced the ''GA-42'' airship, the first airship to use [[Aircraft flight control system#Fly-by-wire control systems|fly-by-wire flight control]], which considerably reduced the pilot's workload.

The world's largest [[thermal airship]] ({{convert|300,000|ft3|m3|abbr=off|lk=off|disp=x|; }}) was constructed by the [[Per Lindstrand]] company for French botanists in 1993. The ''AS-300'' carried an underslung raft, which was positioned by the airship on top of tree canopies in the rain forest, allowing the botanists to carry out their treetop research without significant damage to the rainforest. When research was finished at a given location, the airship returned to pick up and relocate the raft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindstrandtech.com/thermal_airships.html ''Thermal Airships''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003191341/http://www.lindstrandtech.com/thermal_airships.html |date=October 3, 2013 }}, Lindstrand Technologies.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2004, [[Lindstrand Technologies]] supplied the world's first fully functional unmanned airship to the Ministry of Defense in Spain. This airship carried a {{convert|42|kg|lb}} classified payload and its surveillance mission was also classified. Four years later, this airship, which is designated ''GA-22'', still flies on an almost daily basis.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In June 1987, the U.S. Navy awarded a US$168.9&amp;nbsp;million contract to [[Westinghouse Electric]] and [[Airship Industries]] of the UK to find out whether an airship could be used as an airborne platform to detect the threat of sea-skimming missiles, such as the [[Exocet]].&lt;ref name=nyt870606&gt;{{Cite news | agency = Reuters | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/06/business/navy-awards-blimp-order.html | title = Navy Awards Blimp Order | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 6 June 1987 | accessdate = 6 November 2007 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The ''CA-80'' airship, which was produced in 2000 by Shanghai Vantage Airship Manufacture Co., Ltd., had a successful trial flight in September 2001. This was designed for the purpose of advertisement and propagation, air-photo, scientific test, tour and surveillance duties. It was certified as a grade-A Hi-Tech introduction program (№ 20000186) in Shanghai. The CAAC authority granted a type design approval and certificate of airworthiness for the airship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Vantage Ship |url=http://www.vantageship.com/en_ca80data.htm |title=CA-80 Blimp |year=2000 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In the 1990s the Zeppelin company returned to the airship business. Their new model, designated the [[Zeppelin NT]], made its maiden flight on 18 September 1997.  {{as of|2009}} there were four NT aircraft flying, a fifth was completed in March 2009 and an expanded NT-14 (14,000&amp;nbsp;cubic meters of helium, capable of carrying 19 passengers) was under construction. One was sold to a Japanese company, and was planned to be flown to Japan in the summer of 2004. Due to delays getting permission from the Russian government, the company decided to transport the airship to Japan by sea. One of the four NT craft is in South Africa carrying diamond detection equipment from De Beers, an application at which the very stable low vibration NT platform excels. The project included design adaptations for high temperature operation and desert climate, as well as a separate [[mooring mast]] and a very heavy mooring truck. NT-4 belonged to [[Airship Ventures]] of Moffett Field, Mountain View in the San Francisco Bay Area, and provided sight-seeing tours.

[[Blimp]]s are used for advertising and as TV camera platforms at major sporting events. The most iconic of these are the [[Goodyear Blimp]]s. Goodyear operates three blimps in the United States, and [[American Blimp Corporation|The Lightship Group]], now The AirSign Airship Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airsign.com|title=Aerial Advertising &amp; Airplane Banner Towing - AirSign|website=www.airsign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; operates up to 19 advertising blimps around the world. [[Airship Management Services]] owns and operates three [[Skyship 600]] blimps. Two operate as advertising and security ships in North America and the Caribbean. [[Airship Ventures]] operated a Zeppelin NT for advertising, passenger service and special mission projects. They were the only airship operator in the U.S. authorized to fly commercial passengers, until closing their doors in 2012.

[[Skycruise Switzerland AG]] owns and operates two [[Skyship 600]] blimps. One operates regularly over Switzerland used on sightseeing tours.
[[File:Spiritofdubai.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Spirit of Dubai]] approaches its motorized [[mooring mast]]]]
The Switzerland-based Skyship 600 has also played other roles over the years. For example, it was flown over [[Athens]] during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as a security measure. In November 2006, it carried advertising calling it ''The [[Spirit of Dubai]]'' as it began a publicity tour from London to Dubai, UAE on behalf of [[The Palm Islands]], the world's largest man-made islands created as a residential complex.

In May 2006, the U.S. Navy began to fly airships again after a hiatus of nearly 44 years. The program uses a single [[American Blimp Company]] A-170 nonrigid airship, with designation [[American Blimp MZ-3|MZ-3A]]. Operations focus on crew training and research, and the platform integrator is [[Northrop Grumman]]. The program is directed by the [[Naval Air Systems Command]] and is being carried out at [[NAES Lakehurst]], the original centre of U.S. Navy lighter-than-air operations in previous decades.

In November 2006 the U.S. Army bought an A380+ airship from [[American Blimp Corporation]] through a Systems level contract with [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The airship started flight tests in late 2007, with a primary goal of carrying {{convert|2500|lb|abbr= on}} of payload to an altitude of {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr= on}} under [[remote control]] and [[autonomous waypoint navigation]]. The program will also demonstrate carrying {{convert|1000|lb|abbr= on}} of payload to {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} The platform could be used for [[Multi-Intelligence]] collections. In 2008, the ''CA-150'' airship was launched by Vantage Airship. This is an improved modification of model ''CA-120'' and completed manufacturing in 2008. With larger volume and increased passenger capacity, it is the largest manned nonrigid airship in China at present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Vantage Ship |url=http://www.vantageship.com/en_zairenfeiting.htm |title=CA-150 Blimp |year=2008 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

An airship was prominently featured in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond film]] ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', released in 1985. The Skyship 500 had the livery of Zorin Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IMDb | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090264/ | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

====Postwar projects====
Hybrid designs such as the [[Helistat|Heli-Stat]] airship/helicopter, the [[Aereon]] aerostatic/aerodynamic craft, and the [[AeroLift CycloCrane|CycloCrane]] (a hybrid aerostatic/rotorcraft), struggled to take flight. The Cyclocrane was also interesting in that the airship's envelope rotated along its longitudinal axis.

In 2005, a short-lived project of the U.S. [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) was [[Walrus HULA]], which explored the potential for using airships as long-distance, heavy lift craft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/news/2005/walrus.pdf "Contractors for Walrus Program announced"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206102354/http://www.darpa.mil/news/2005/walrus.pdf |date=2016-02-06 }}, press release, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, 26 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2005/10/us-cbo-gives-ok-to-hula-airships-for-airlift/index.php "US CBO Gives OK to HULA Airships for Airlift"], ''Defense Industry Daily'', 21 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of the research program was to determine the feasibility of building an airship capable of carrying {{convert|500|ST|t|abbr=on}} of payload a distance of {{convert|12000|mi|abbr=on}} and land on an unimproved location without the use of external [[wikt:ballast|ballast]] or ground equipment (such as masts). In 2005, two contractors, [[Lockheed Martin]] and [[US Aeros Airships]] were each awarded approximately $3 million to do feasibility studies of designs for WALRUS. Congress removed funding for Walrus HULA in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/walrus-hunted-to-extinction-by-congress-darpa-02102/ |title=WALRUS Hunted to Extinction By Congress, DARPA? |date=4 April 2006 |publisher=Defense Industry Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ill|A-NSE|fr}}, a French company, manufactures and operates airships and aerostats. For 2 years, A-NSE has been testing its airships for the French Army. Airships and aerostats are operated to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support. Their airships include many innovative features such as water ballast take-off and landing systems, variable geometry envelopes and thrust–vectoring systems.[[File:A-N400.jpg|thumb|A-N400 (A-NSE company)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meretmarine.com/fr/content/vers-un-retour-du-dirigeable-pour-les-missions-de-surveillance-maritime |title=Vers un retour du dirigeable pour les missions de surveillance maritime ? |language= fr |publisher=Mer et Marine |date=2011-10-17 |accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U..S government has funded two major projects in the high altitude arena. The [[Composite Hull High Altitude Powered Platform]] (CHHAPP) is sponsored by [[U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command]]. This aircraft is also sometimes called ''HiSentinel High-Altitude Airship''. This prototype ship made a five-hour test flight in September 2005. The second project, the [[high-altitude airship]] (HAA), is sponsored by DARPA. In 2005, DARPA awarded a contract for nearly $150&amp;nbsp;million to Lockheed Martin for prototype development. First flight of the HAA was planned for 2008 but suffered programmatic and funding delays. The HAA project evolved into the High Altitude Long Endurance-Demonstrator (HALE-D). The U.S. Army and Lockheed Martin launched the first-of-its kind HALE-D on July 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2mYxoPGghA |title=HALE-D Short B-Roll |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attaining an altitude of {{convert|32000|ft|abbr=on}}, due to an anomaly, the company decided to abort the mission.

On 31 January 2006 Lockheed Martin made the first flight of their secretly built [[hybrid airship]] designated the [[P-791]]. The design is very similar to the [[SkyCat]], unsuccessfully promoted for many years by the British company [[Airship Industries#ATG and its successors|Advanced Technologies Group]] (ATG). Although Lockheed Martin is developing a design for the DARPA [[WALRUS HULA]] project, it claimed that the P-791 is unrelated to WALRUS. Nonetheless, the design represents an approach that may well be applicable to WALRUS. Some believe that Lockheed Martin had used the secret P-791 program as a way to get a head start on the other WALRUS competitor, [[US Aeros Airships]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Passenger transport===
[[File:Zeppelin NT im Flug.jpg|thumb|A [[Zeppelin NT]] airship]]
In the 1990s, the successor of the original Zeppelin company in [[Friedrichshafen]], the ''Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH'', reengaged in airship construction. The first experimental craft (later christened ''Friedrichshafen'') of the type "[[Zeppelin NT]]" flew in September 1997. Though larger than common blimps, the ''Neue Technologie'' (New Technology) zeppelins are much smaller than their giant ancestors and not actually Zeppelin-types in the classical sense. They are sophisticated semirigids. Apart from the greater payload, their main advantages compared to blimps are higher speed and excellent maneuverability. Meanwhile, several ''Zeppelin NT'' have been produced and operated profitably in joyrides, research flights and similar applications.

In June 2004, a Zeppelin NT was sold for the first time to a Japanese company, Nippon Airship Corporation, for tourism and advertising mainly around Tokyo. It was also given a role at the [[Expo 2005|2005 Expo]] in [[Aichi]]. The aircraft began a flight from Friedrichshafen to Japan, stopping at [[Geneva]], Paris, [[Rotterdam]], [[Munich]], Berlin, [[Stockholm]] and other European cities to carry passengers on short legs of the flight. Russian authorities denied overflight permission, however, so the airship had to be dismantled and shipped to Japan rather than following the historic ''Graf Zeppelin'' flight from Germany to Japan.

In 2008, [[Airship Ventures|Airship Ventures Inc.]] began operations from [[Moffett Federal Airfield]] near [[Mountain View, California]] and until November 2012 offered tours of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] for up to 12 passengers.

===Exploration===
In November 2005, [[De Beers]], a diamond mining company, launched an airship exploration program over the remote [[Kalahari desert]]. A [[Zeppelin NT]], equipped with a Bell Geospace [[gravity gradiometer]], was used to find potential diamond mines by scanning the local geography for low-density rock formations, known as [[kimberlite pipes]]. On 21 September 2007, the airship was severely damaged by a whirlwind while in Botswana. One crew member, who was on watch aboard the moored craft, was slightly injured but released after overnight observation in hospital.
&lt;!-- Preceding sections were moved from Zeppelin but need merging and cleanup here.--&gt;

===Thermal airships===
[[File:Prallluftschiff 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Thermal airship]] (manufacturer GEFA-FLUG/Germany)]]

Several companies, such as [[Cameron Balloons]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, build [[Thermal airship|hot-air airships]]. These combine the structures of both hot-air balloons and small airships. The envelope is the normal cigar shape, complete with tail fins, but is inflated with hot air instead of helium to provide the lifting force. A small gondola, carrying the pilot and passengers, a small engine, and the burners to provide the hot air are suspended below the envelope, beneath an opening through which the burners protrude.

Hot-air airships typically cost less to buy and maintain than modern helium-based [[blimp]]s, and can be quickly deflated after flights. This makes them easy to carry in trailers or trucks and inexpensive to store. They are usually very slow moving, with a typical top speed of 25–30&amp;nbsp;km/h (15–20&amp;nbsp;mph, 6.7–8.9&amp;nbsp;m/s). They are mainly used for advertising, but at least one has been used in [[rainforest]]s for wildlife observation, as they can be easily transported to remote areas.

===Unmanned remotes===
[[Remote control|Remote-controlled]] (RC) airships, a type of [[unmanned aerial system]] (UAS), are sometimes used for commercial purposes such as advertising and aerial video and photography as well as recreational purposes. They are particularly common as an advertising mechanism at indoor stadiums. While RC airships are sometimes flown outdoors, doing so for commercial purposes is illegal in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/uas/reg/media/frnotice_uas.pdf FAA Docket FAA-2006-25714] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620011126/http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/uas/reg/media/frnotice_uas.pdf |date=June 20, 2007 }}, Federal Aviation Authority.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial use of an unmanned airship must be certified under part 121.{{clarify|date=September 2016}}

==Current design projects==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2008}}
[[File:Giant Aircraft Comparison.svg|thumb|right|260px|The largest airship, the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]] at 245 meters length and 41 meters diameter, dwarfs the size of the largest historic and modern passenger and cargo aeroplanes.]]
Today, with large, fast, and more cost-efficient [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopters]], it is unknown whether huge airships can operate profitably in regular passenger transport though, as energy costs rise, attention is once again returning to these lighter-than-air vessels as a possible alternative. At the very least, the idea of comparatively slow, "majestic" cruising at relatively low altitudes and in comfortable atmosphere certainly has retained some appeal. There have been some niches for airships in and after World War II, such as long-duration observations, [[Anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] patrol, platforms for TV camera crews, and [[advertising]]; these, however, generally require only small and flexible craft, and have thus generally been better fitted for cheaper (non-passenger) blimps.

===Heavy lifting===
It has periodically been suggested that airships could be employed for [[cargo transport]], especially delivering extremely heavy loads to areas with poor infrastructure over great distances. This has also been called roadless trucking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dynalifter.com/Dynaliftercom/RoadlessTrucking.htm "Roadless trucking"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523073252/http://www.dynalifter.com/Dynaliftercom/RoadlessTrucking.htm |date=May 23, 2009 }}, Dynalifter.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, airships could be used for heavy lifting over short distances (e.g. on construction sites); this is described as heavy-lift, short-haul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deagel.com/news/Boeing-and-SkyHook-International-to-Build-JHL-40-Heavy-Lift-Rotorcraft_n000004518.aspx "Boeing and SkyHook International to Build JHL-40 Heavy-Lift Rotorcraft"], press release, 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the airships are [[heavy hauler]]s. One recent enterprise of this sort was the ''[[Cargolifter]]'' project, in which a hybrid (thus not entirely Zeppelin-type) airship even larger than ''Hindenburg'' was projected. Around 2000, CargoLifter AG built the world's largest self-supporting hall, measuring {{convert|360|m|ft|abbr= on}} long, {{convert|210|m|ft|abbr= on}} wide and {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}} high about {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Berlin. In May 2002, the project was stopped for financial reasons; the company had to file [[bankruptcy]]. The enormous CargoLifter hangar was later converted to house the [[Tropical Islands Resort]].&lt;ref name=Lasker2016/&gt; Although no rigid airships are currently used for heavy lifting, [[hybrid airship]]s are being developed for such purposes. [[AEREON 26]], tested in 1971, was described in [[John McPhee]]'s ''The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed''.

An impediment to the large-scale development of airships as heavy haulers has been figuring out how they can be used in a cost-efficient way. In order to have a significant economic advantage over ocean transport, cargo airships must be able to deliver their payload faster than ocean carriers but more cheaply than airplanes. William Crowder, a fellow at the [[Logistics Management Institute]], has calculated that cargo airships are only economical when they can transport 500 to 1,000 tons, approximately the same as a super-jumbo aircraft.&lt;ref name=Lasker2016/&gt; The large initial investment required to build such a large airship has been a hindrance to production, especially given the risk inherent in a new technology. The chief commercial officer of the company hoping to sell the [[LMH1|LMH-1]], a cargo airship currently being developed by [[Lockheed Martin]], believes that airships can be economical in hard-to-reach locations such as mining operations in northern Canada that currently require [[ice road]]s.&lt;ref name=Lasker2016&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/29/a-new-generation-of-airships-is-born|title=Helium Dreams|last=Laskas|first=Jeanne Marie|date=2016-02-29|newspaper=The New Yorker|issn=0028-792X|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal-clad airships===
{{Main article|Metal-clad airship}}
A metal-clad airship has a very thin metal envelope, rather than the usual fabric. The shell may be either internally braced or [[monocoque]] as in the [[ZMC-2]], which flew many times in the 1920s, the only example ever to do so. The shell may be gas-tight as in a non-rigid blimp, or the design may employ internal gas bags as in a rigid airship. Compared to a fabric envelope the metal cladding is expected to be more durable.

===Hybrid airships===
{{Main article|Hybrid airship}}
A [[hybrid airship]] is a general term for an aircraft that combines characteristics of heavier-than-air (aeroplane or helicopter) and lighter-than-air technology. Examples include helicopter/airship hybrids intended for heavy lift applications and dynamic lift airships intended for long-range cruising. It should be noted that most airships, when fully loaded with cargo and fuel, are usually ballasted to be heavier than air, and thus must use their propulsion system and shape to create aerodynamic lift, necessary to stay aloft. All airships can be operated to be slightly heavier than air at periods during flight ([[Descent (aircraft)|descent]]). Accordingly, the term "hybrid airship" refers to craft that obtain a significant portion of their lift from aerodynamic lift or other [[Kinetic energy|kinetic]] means.

For example, the [[Aeroscraft]] is a buoyancy assisted air vehicle that generates lift through a combination of aerodynamics, thrust vectoring and gas buoyancy generation and management, and for much of the time will fly heavier than air. Aeroscraft is [[Worldwide Aeros Corp|Worldwide Aeros Corporation's]] continuation of [[DARPA]]'s now cancelled [[Walrus HULA]] (Hybrid Ultra Large Aircraft) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Aeroscraft.com | url=http://www.aeroscraft.com/ | accessdate = 24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Patroller P3 hybrid airship developed by Advanced Hybrid Aircraft Ltd, BC, Canada, is a relatively small (85,000 feet3 = 2,400 m3) buoyant craft, manned by the crew of 5 and with the endurance of up to 72 hours. The flight-tests with the 40% RC scale model proved that such a craft can be launched and landed without a large team of strong ground-handlers.&lt;ref&gt;Vollrath, Jurgen.

===Airships in space exploration===
[[File:NASA Cloud City on Venus.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendering of a NASA manned floating outpost on Venus]]
Airships have been proposed as a potential cheap alternative to surface rocket launches for achieving Earth orbit. [[JP Aerospace]] have proposed the Airship to Orbit project, which intends to float a multi-stage airship up to [[mesosphere|mesospheric]] altitudes of 55&amp;nbsp;km (180,000&amp;nbsp;ft) and then use ion propulsion to accelerate to [[orbital speed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpaerospace.com/atohandout.pdf|title=Airship to Orbit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At these heights, air resistance would not be a significant problem for achieving such speeds. The company has not yet built any of the three stages.

[[NASA]] have proposed the [[High Altitude Venus Operational Concept]], which comprises a series of five missions including manned missions to the atmosphere of [[Venus]] in airships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sacd.larc.nasa.gov/branches/space-mission-analysis-branch-smab/smab-projects/havoc/| title=HAVOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0az7DEwG68A/| title=A way to explore Venus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gizmag.com/nasa-havoc-concept-manned-mission-to-venus/35311//| title=NASA concept would send astronauts to Venus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/tech/2014/12/20/nasa-havoc-venus.nasa-langley-research-cente//| title=NASA's floating 'habitat' above Venus?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressures on the surface of the planet are too high for human habitation, but at a specific altitude the pressure is equal to that found on Earth and this makes Venus a potential target for human [[Colonization of Venus|colonization]].

==Comparison with heavier-than-air aircraft==
The advantage of airships over aeroplanes is that [[Buoyancy|static lift]] sufficient for flight is generated by the lifting gas and requires no engine power. This was an immense advantage before the middle of [[World War I]] and remained an advantage for long-distance or long-duration operations until [[World War II]]. Modern concepts for high-altitude airships include [[Solar cell|photovoltaic cells]] to reduce the need to land to refuel, thus they can remain in the air until consumables expire.

The disadvantages are that an airship has a very large reference area and comparatively large [[drag coefficient]], thus a larger drag force compared to that of aeroplanes and even helicopters. Given the large frontal area and wetted surface of an airship, a practical limit is reached around {{convert|80|–|100|mph|km/h|order=flip}}. Thus airships are used where speed is not critical.

The lift capability of an airship is equal to the buoyant force minus the weight of the airship. This assumes standard air-temperature and pressure conditions. Corrections are usually made for water vapor and impurity of lifting gas, as well as percentage of inflation of the gas cells at liftoff.&lt;ref&gt;Ausrotas, R. A., "Basic Relationships for LTA Technical Analysis," MIT Flight Transportation Library, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Based on specific lift (lifting force per unit volume of gas), the greatest static lift is provided by hydrogen (11.15&amp;nbsp;N/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 71&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/1000&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;ft) with helium (10.37&amp;nbsp;N/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 66&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/1000&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;ft) a close second.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, D. M., Basic Aerostatics &amp;ndash; A Tutorial, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; At 6.13&amp;nbsp;N/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (39&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/1000&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;ft), steam is a distant third. Other cheap gases, such as methane, carbon monoxide, ammonia and natural gas{{Citation needed|reason=Both methane &amp; ammonia have lower molar mass than water, so all other things equal, they (&amp; probably natural gas) should be lighter than steam|date=November 2011}} have even less lifting capacity and are flammable, toxic, corrosive, or all three ([[neon]] is even more costly than helium, with less lifting capacity). Operational considerations such as whether the lift gas can be economically vented and produced in flight for control of buoyancy (as with hydrogen) or even produced as a byproduct of propulsion (as with steam) affect the practical choice of lift gas in airship designs.

In addition to static lift, an airship can obtain a certain amount of dynamic lift from its engines. Dynamic lift in past airships has been about 10% of the static lift. Dynamic lift allows an airship to "take off heavy" from a runway similar to fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. This requires additional weight in engines, fuel, and landing gear, however, negating some of the static lift capacity.

The altitude at which an airship can fly largely depends on how much lifting gas it can lose due to expansion before [[Mechanical equilibrium|stasis]] is reached. The ultimate altitude record for a rigid airship was set in 1917 by the L-55 under the command of Hans-Kurt Flemming when he forced the airship to {{convert|24000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} attempting to cross France after the "Silent Raid" on London. The L-55 lost lift during the descent to lower altitudes over Germany and crashed due to loss of lift.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1994), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; While such waste of gas was necessary for the survival of airships in the later years of World War I, it was impractical for commercial operations, or operations of helium-filled military airships. The highest flight made by a hydrogen-filled passenger airship was {{convert|5500|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} on the ''Graf Zeppelin's'' around-the-world flight.&lt;ref&gt;"Honors to Dr. Hugo Eckener: The First Airship Flight Around the World", ''National Geographic'', Vol. LVII, No. 6, June 1930, p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt; The practical limit for rigid airships was about {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}}, and for pressure airships around {{convert|8000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.{{Citation needed|reason=Contradicts preceding Graf Zeppelin sentence. Also, limits were determined from fuel and cargo load: reduce fuel and cargo and maximum safe altitude can increase, and vice versa.|date=July 2008}}

Modern airships use dynamic helium volume. At sea-level altitude, helium takes up only a small part of the hull, while the rest is filled with air. As the airship ascends, the helium inflates with reduced outer pressure, and air is pushed out and released from the downward valve. This allows an airship to reach any altitude with balanced inner and outer pressure if the buoyancy is enough. Some civil aerostats could reach {{convert|100000|ft|m|abbr=on}} without explosion due to overloaded inner pressure.{{Citation needed|reason=Highly dubious, is this a typo? 100000 feet is {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} where atmosphere is about 1% the sea level density,([[:Image:Atmosphere model.png]]) so helium in an over-pressured blimp would be heavier than the surrounding air. Maybe a non-dirigible balloon is meant?|date=July 2008}}

The greatest disadvantage of the airship is size, which is essential to increasing performance. As size increases, the problems of ground handling increase geometrically.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brooks1992|Brooks 1992]] pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; As the German Navy changed from the [[Zeppelin P Class|P class]] of 1915 with a volume of over {{convert|1100000|cuft|m3|abbr=on|order=flip}} to the larger [[Zeppelin Q Class|Q class]] of 1916, the [[Zeppelin R Class|R class]] of 1917, and finally the [[Zeppelin W Class|W class]] of 1918, at almost {{convert|2200000|cuft|m3|abbr=on|order=flip}} ground handling problems reduced the number of days the Zeppelins were able to make patrol flights. This availability declined from 34% in 1915, to 24.3% in 1916 and finally 17.5% in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1994), p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

So long as the power-to-weight ratios of aircraft engines remained low and [[Brake specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] high, the airship had an edge for long-range or -duration operations. As those figures changed, the balance shifted rapidly in the aeroplane's favour. By mid-1917, the airship could no longer survive in a combat situation where the threat was aeroplanes. By the late 1930s, the airship barely had an advantage over the aeroplane on intercontinental over-water flights, and that advantage had vanished by the end of World War II.

This is in face-to-face tactical situations. Currently, a [[High-altitude airship]] project is planned to survey hundreds of kilometres as their operation radius, often much farther than the normal engagement range of a military aeroplane.{{Clarify|date=July 2008}} &lt;!-- rephrase for comprehension --&gt; For example, a [[radar]] mounted on a vessel platform {{convert|30|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} high has radio horizon at {{convert|20|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} range, while a radar at {{convert|18000|m|ft|abbr=on}} altitude has radio horizon at {{convert|480|km|abbr=on}} range. This is significantly important for detecting low-flying cruise missiles or fighter-bombers.

==Safety==
The most commonly used lifting gas, helium, is [[Inert gas|inert]] and therefore presents no fire risk.&lt;ref name="stwertka"&gt;Stwertka, Albert, ''Guide to the Elements: Revised Edition''. New York; Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 24. {{ISBN|0-19-512708-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of vulnerability tests were done by the UK Defence Evaluation and Research Agency DERA on a [[Skyship 600]]. Since the internal gas pressure was maintained at only 1–2% above the surrounding air pressure, the vehicle proved highly tolerant to physical damage or to attack by small-arms fire or missiles. Several hundred high-velocity bullets were fired through the hull, and even two hours later the vehicle would have been able to return to base. Ordnance passed through the envelope without causing critical helium loss. In all instances of light armament fire evaluated under both test and live conditions, the airship was able to complete its mission and return to base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldskycat.com/images/SkyCat.pdf High Safety Level (page 5) and Structural Vulnerability Tests (page 7)].

==Description of operation==
The following is the most likely means of operation from the description given.&lt;ref name="Nelson Examiner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PennyM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkie"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="Les manuscrits"&gt;{{cite book|title=Les manuscrits de Léonard de Vinci |volume=Folio 32|publisher=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/stream/lesmanuscritsdel02lo/lesmanuscritsdel02lo_djvu.txt|language=French|pages=\  L'ARCHITONNERRE, INVENTION D'ARCHIMEDE (CANON A VAPEUR)'}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conventional muzzle loading [[cannon]] had a strong metal tube connecting the vented end, where the fuse would normally be placed,  to a copper [[boiler]], terminating below the water level inside but describing an inverted U above it in the manner of a [[syphon]]. A fire of charcoal heated the vented end of the cannon and the boiler so that the metal of the cannon's end became red hot and the boiler was boiling vigorously. Steam was allowed to escape from the boiler through an opening with a screwed  thread so there was no buildup of pressure. To fire the cannon a cap was screwed tightly into the boiler opening, triggering an immediate buildup of steam pressure in the boiler. This forced the boiling water along the syphon tube into the cannon's base. Here it met the red hot cannon walls and flashed into steam, the pressure of the sudden release of steam forced the cannonball out of the muzzle.

==Leonardo's own description==
Account from the ''Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle'', 1842:&lt;ref name="Nelson Examiner"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Steam-Engine. — M. Delecluze has lately made a discovery among the manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci, carrying back a knowledge of the steam-engine to at least as far back as the 15th century. He has published in the ''Artiste'' a notice on the life of Leonardo da Vinci, to which he adds a fac-simile of a page from one of his manuscripts, and on which are five sketches with the pen, representing the details of the apparatus of a steam-gun, with an explanatory note upon what he designates under the name of the " ''Architonnerre''," and of which note the following is a translation : — " Invention of Archimedes. — The ''Architonnerre'' is a machine of fine copper, which throws balls with a loud report and great force. It is used in the following manner : — One third of this instrument contains a large quantity of charcoal fire. When the water is well heated, a screw at the top of the vessel which contains the water must be made quite tight. On closing the screw above, all the water will escape below, will descend into the heated portion of the instrument, and be immediately converted into a vapour so abundant and powerful, that it is wonderful to see its fury and hear the noise it produces. This machine will carry a ball of a talent in, weight." It is worthy of remark that Leonardo  da Vinci- far from claiming the merit of this invention for himself or the men of his time- attributes it to Archimedes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The weight of the cannonball is described as one talent. A Roman [[talent (measurement)|talent]] was {{convert|32.3|kg|lb}}, although the amount varied across the ancient world by a few kilos.&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;"[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=81&amp;letter=W&amp;search=weights%20and%20measures#217 III. Measures of Weight:]",''JewishEncyclopedia.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bastora Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] currently being constructed on the Bastora River near Gomespan in [[Erbil Governorate]], Iraq. It is located about {{Convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Erbil]]. The primary purpose of the dam is water supply for irrigation but it will support a small 2.4 MW [[hydroelectric]] power station. It is expected to irrigate {{Convert|4000|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. Construction on the {{Convert|85|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[roller-compacted concrete]] dam began in 2013 and it is expected to be complete in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bastora Dam and Irrigation Project|url=http://www.elconcorde.com/elconcorde/construction/project/iconic/Bastora%20Dam%20and%20Irrigation%20Project|publisher=El Concorde Construction|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCC Database (Search "Bastora Dam")|url=http://www.rccdams.co.uk/database_results.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923140552/http://www.rccdams.co.uk/database_results.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 September 2006|publisher=Malcolm Dunstan &amp; Associates|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6410">''' Beta-alumina solid electrolyte''' ('''BASE''') is a [[fast ion conductor]] material used as a [[semipermeable membrane|membrane]] in several types of molten salt [[electrochemical cell]]. Currently there is no known substitute available.&lt;ref name="Lu et al. 2010" /&gt; &lt;ref name="Sudworth and Tilley 1985" /&gt;

β&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;-Alumina (''beta prime-prime alumina'') is an [[Isomorphism (crystallography)|isomorphic]] form of [[aluminium oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a hard polycrystalline [[ceramic]], which, when prepared as an [[electrolyte]], is complexed with a mobile [[ion]], such as [[Sodium|Na]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Potassium|K]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Lithium|Li]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Silver|Ag]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Lead|Pb]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Strontium|Sr]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  or [[Barium|Ba]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the application. Beta-alumina is a good conductor of its mobile ion yet allows no non-ionic (i.e., electronic) conductivity.

Sodium beta alumina is a [[non-stoichiometric]] [[sodium aluminate]] known for its rapid transport of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This material selectively passes sodium ions while blocking other species, including liquid sodium and liquid sulfur. It is a ceramic which can be formed and sintered by commercially available techniques and its conductivity at operating temperatures &amp;ndash; 250 to 300 degrees Celsius &amp;ndash; compares favorably with electrolytes used in conventional battery systems such as sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide. The crystal structure of the Na-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; provides an essential rigid framework with channels along which the ionic species of the solid can migrate. Ion transport involves hopping from site to site along these channels.

BASE was first developed by researchers at the [[Ford Motor Company]], in the search for a storage device for [[electric vehicle]]s while developing the [[sodium-sulfur battery]].&lt;ref name="J. T. Kummer Prog. Solid State"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SAE 1967"/&gt; The NaS battery consists of sulfur at the positive electrode and sodium at the negative electrode as active materials, and sodium-conducting beta alumina ceramic as the electrolyte separating both electrodes.&lt;ref name="Lu et al. 2010" /&gt;
This sealed battery is kept at approximately 300 degrees Celsius and is operated under the condition that the active materials at both electrodes are liquid and its electrolyte is solid. It is only at temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius or more, that it is possible for the negative sodium electrode to completely coat, or "wet," the ceramic electrolyte.&lt;ref name="Lu et al. 2010" /&gt; At lower temperatures, molten sodium has issues in covering the surface of the beta alumina ceramic. This causes sodium to curl up akin to a drop of oil in water, reducing surface area contact and making the battery less efficient. At such high temperatures, since both active materials have high surface area contact and internal resistance becomes low enough, the NaS battery shows excellent performance. As a secondary battery, which allows reversible charging and discharging, the NaS battery can be continuously used. Several commercial installations use this type of battery for load leveling.

The sodium sulfur battery was a topic of intense worldwide interest during the 1970s and 1980s, but interest in the technology for vehicle use diminished for a variety of technical and economic reasons. In contrast, its "successor", the [[Molten salt battery#ZEBRA battery|sodium nickel chloride battery]], is now entering the commercialization phase. The sodium nickel chloride battery (or ZEBRA battery, so-called for the Zeolite Battery Research Africa Project) has been under development for almost 20 years.&lt;ref name="Yao + Kummer 1967" /&gt;

When BASE is used  in a sodium nickel chloride (ZEBRA) cell, several requirements must be met. It must have a low resistivity, typically 4 [[Ohm|&amp;Omega;]][[Centimetre|cm]] at 350&amp;nbsp;°C, and a [[Strength of materials|strength]] in excess of 200 [[megapascal|MPa]]. It must be produced in the form of a thin-walled (1.25&amp;nbsp;mm), convoluted tube by low-cost production methods, and it must maintain a stable cell resistance for up to 10 years. These requirements have mostly been met by a variation of the [[sol-gel]] process.

BASE is also used in [[alkali-metal thermal to electric converter]]s (AMTECs). An AMTEC is a high efficiency device for directly converting heat to electricity. An AMTEC operates as a thermally regenerative electrochemical cell by expanding sodium through the pressure differential across the  (BASE) membrane. BASE electrolytes have been used in some [[molten-carbonate fuel cell]]s, as well as other liquid electrode/solid electrolyte [[fuel cell]] designs.

'''Bird tracking''' provides a way to assess the habitat range and behavior of [[bird]]s without ever seeing the bird.  Bird tracking falls under the category of [[tracking (hunting)|tracking]] and is related to [[Animal tracks|animal tracking]]. A guide to bird tracking has been published.&lt;ref name=Elbroch&gt;{{cite book|title=Bird Tracks &amp; Sign : A Guide to North American Species|author1=Mark Elbroch |author2=Eleanor Marks |author3=C. Diane Boretos |date=2001|publisher=Stackpole Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bird tracking is a tool used by [[natural history|naturalists]] to assess what birds are present in an [[ecosystem]] even if the bird is rarely seen.

==Data collection==
In the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the United States, a program called NatureMapping collects data by educating the public and having them pool their data in a [[citizen science]] application.  Data can be collected in the field using a handheld palm pilot and GPS system that streamlines the collection process.  This free program is called CyberTracker.  In order to make sure that data is reliable, a tracker [[evaluation]] system has been put in place through the [[CyberTracker]] organization.

Not to be confused with ''[[Black Gold (2011 Qatari film)]]''

'''''Black Gold''''' is a 2011 drama film co-produced and directed by [[Jeta Amata]]. One local [[Niger Delta]] community's struggle against their own government and a multi-national oil corporation who has plundered their land and destroyed the environment. The film was reissued in 2012 with the title ''[[Black November]]'', with 60% of the scenes reshot and additional scenes included to make the film "more current".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/01/jeta-amata-nollywood-s-gift-to-hollywood | title=Is Jeta Amata Nollywood's gift to Hollywood? | publisher=The Guardian | work=Guardian Newspaper | date=1 February 2012 | accessdate=30 June 2014 | author=Hoad, Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bubble chamber''' is a vessel filled with a [[superheating|superheated]] [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[liquid]] (most often [[liquid hydrogen]]) used to detect [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles moving through it. It was invented in 1952 by [[Donald A. Glaser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, Glaser was inspired by the bubbles in a glass of [[beer]]; however,  in a 2006 talk, he refuted this story, although saying that while beer was not the inspiration for the bubble chamber, he did experiments using beer to fill early [[prototype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

While bubble chambers were extensively used in the past, they have now mostly been supplanted by [[wire chamber]]s and [[spark chamber]]s. Notable bubble chambers include the [[Big European Bubble Chamber]] (BEBC) and [[Gargamelle]].

__TOC__
==Function and use==
[[Image:Bubble-chamber.svg|thumb|right|225px|A bubble chamber]]

The bubble chamber is similar to a [[cloud chamber]], both in application and in basic principle. It is normally made by filling a large cylinder with a liquid heated to just below its [[boiling point]].  As particles enter the chamber, a [[piston]] suddenly decreases its pressure, and the liquid enters into a superheated, [[metastable]] phase.  Charged particles create an ionization track, around which the liquid vaporizes, forming microscopic [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s. Bubble density around a track is proportional to a particle's energy loss.

Bubbles grow in size as the chamber expands, until they are large enough to be seen or photographed. Several cameras are mounted around it, allowing a three-dimensional image of an event to be captured. Bubble chambers with resolutions down to a few [[micrometers|micrometers (μm)]] have been operated.

The entire chamber is subject to a constant magnetic field, which causes charged particles to travel in [[helix|helical]] paths whose radius is determined by their [[charge-to-mass ratio]]s and their velocities. Since the magnitude of the charge of all known charged, long-lived subatomic particles is the same as that of an [[electron]], their radius of curvature must be proportional to their [[momentum]]. Thus, by measuring their radius of curvature, their momentum can be determined.

Notable discoveries made by bubble chamber include the discovery of [[neutral current|weak neutral current]]s at [[Gargamelle]] in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;

 |publisher=[[CERN]]
 |accessdate=2009-10-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which established the soundness of the [[electroweak theory]] and led to the discovery of the [[W and Z bosons]] in 1983 (at the [[UA1 experiment|UA1]] and [[UA2 experiment]]s). Recently, bubble chambers have been used in research on [[Weakly interacting massive particles|Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP)]]s, at SIMPLE, [[COUPP]],  [[PICASSO]] and more recently, [[SNOLAB#Experiments|PICO]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
Although bubble chambers were very successful in the past, they are of limited use in modern very-high-energy experiments for a variety of reasons:

* The need for a photographic readout rather than three-dimensional electronic data makes it less convenient, especially in experiments which must be reset, repeated and analyzed many times.
* The superheated phase must be ready at the precise moment of collision, which complicates the detection of short-lived particles. 
* Bubble chambers are neither large nor massive enough to analyze high-energy collisions, where all products should be contained inside the detector. 
* The high-energy particles may have path radii too large to be accurately measured in a relatively small chamber, thereby hindering precise estimation of momentum.

Due to these issues, bubble chambers have largely been replaced by [[wire chamber]]s, which allow particle [[energy|energies]] to be measured at the same time. Another alternative technique is the [[spark chamber]].

== Historical Occurrence ==

The mineral was recorded in 1955 on three bronze artifacts from [[ancient Egypt]], which were being held in the [[Fogg Art Museum]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. Chalconatronite was found inside of two bronze figures (one depicting a seated [[Sekhmet]], and another one depicting a group of cats and kittens&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="art"/&gt;) from around the late [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Nubian Dynasty]] or early [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Saite Period]]. Another chalconatronite specimen was found under a bronze censer from the late [[Coptic period|Coptic Period]].&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; The chalconatronite found on the censer formed over [[cuprite]] and some [[atacamite]] crystals, which are associated minerals.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="art" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frondel|first=Clifford|last2=Gettens|first2=Rutherford J.|date=1955-07-08|title=Chalconatronite, a New Mineral from Egypt|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/122/3158/75|journal=Science|language=en|volume=122|issue=3158|pages=75–76|doi=10.1126/science.122.3158.75|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17748802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3239">'''Conspicuous conservation''' is an idea that grew out of [[conspicuous consumption]]. It refers to the relatively recent phenomenon of engaging in activities that are environmentally friendly in order to obtain or signal a higher social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/07/07/hey-baby-is-that-a-prius-you%E2%80%99re-driving/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123114928/http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/07/07/hey-baby-is-that-a-prius-you%E2%80%99re-driving/ |archivedate=2013-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 1978 article by Ronald D. White, the concept of "conspicuous conservation" was first used by economist Seymour Sacks.&lt;ref&gt;White, Ron D., 1978. Growth versus Conservation: A Veblenian Perspective. Journal of Economic Issues 12: 427-433.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Mikulina, then-executive director of the Hawaii Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], mentioned the term in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Mikulina Goes to Washington 'sort of,' Honolulu Weekly, Sep. 14, 2005. http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2005/09/diary-09-14-05/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heco.com/vcmcontent/IntegratedResource/IRP/PDF/HECO_IRP4_AG05_060807_12_Transcript.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140421081928/http://www.heco.com/vcmcontent/IntegratedResource/IRP/PDF/HECO_IRP4_AG05_060807_12_Transcript.pdf |archivedate=April 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blueplanetfoundation.org/files/mikulina_pv_thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and articles in 2007 also referred the concept.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/business/04hybrid.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/Heffner%20Article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The term was invoked separately in 2010 by [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]] researchers Sexton and Sexton.&lt;ref name=Sexton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sexton|first=Steven |author2=Sexton, Alison|title=Conspicuous Conservation: The Prius Effect and WTP for Environmental Bona Fides|journal=Working Paper|date=December 31, 2010 |url=http://areweb.berkeley.edu/fields/erep/seminar/Prius_Effect_V1.5.1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladas Griskevicius]], [[Joshua M. Tybur]], and [[Bram Van den Bergh]] (2010) argue that buying "green products" can be construed as [[altruistic]]. Because altruistic behavior might function as a [[costly signal]] of [[social status]], conspicuous conservation can be interpreted as a signal of high status. Experiments showed that activating status motives led people to choose green products over more luxurious non-green products. The status motive increases the willingness to buy green products in public (but not in private) settings and in settings where green products cost more than non-green products. According to the authors, status competition can thus be used to promote pro-environmental behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Vladas Griskevicius, Joshua M.

An '''electric skateboard''' is a [[personal transporter]] based on a [[skateboard]]. The speed is controlled by a hand-held throttle or weight-shifting and the direction of travel is adjusted by tilting the board to one side or the other.

==History==
===Early incarnations===
The [[MotoBoard]], which was gasoline-powered was released in the summer of 1975,&lt;ref name=MagnetoHistory/&gt; but were banned in California due to their noise and pollution in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learntorideaskateboard.com/SK8Laws.pdf|title=SK8Laws.pdf|work=Learn to ride a skateboard|access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oppenheimer|first1=Tracy|title=The Fight Against California's Electric Skateboard Ban|url=http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/08/04/electric-skateboards-banned|website=Reason.comn|publisher=Reason Foundation|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern electric devices===
Louie Finkle of [[Seal Beach, California]] is often cited as an originator of the modern electric skateboard, offering his first wireless electric skateboard in 1997&lt;ref name=AlteredHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alteredusa.com/history/|title=Altered ExKate History|publisher=Altered AxKate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MagnetoHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=https://magnetoelectricskateboard.com/blogs/news/74644805-the-history-of-the-electric-skateboard|title=History Of Electric Skateboarding / Electric Longboard|work=magnetoelectricskateboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[patent]] filed in April 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|5893425A|US Patent 5893425A Remote control electric powered skateboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it wasn't until the 2004-6 that electric motors and batteries were available with sufficient [[torque]] and efficiency to power boards effectively.&lt;ref name=AlteredHistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fiikelectricskateboards.co.uk/about|title=About us|work=Fiik Skateboards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 ZBoard raised nearly 30 times their target for a balance controlled electric skateboard on [[kickstarter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/benf/the-zboard-the-weight-sensing-electric-skateboard/description|title=The ZBoard: The Weight-sensing Electric Skateboard|date=April 2012|work=KickStarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was well received at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in Las Vegas in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/11/3867410/zboard-electric-skateboard-riding-ces-2013|title=I rode the ZBoard in Las Vegas and it changed my life|work=The Verge|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2024604/skate-through-2013-on-your-very-own-zboard.html|title=Skate through 2013 on your very own ZBoard (video)|work=PC World|date=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2015 campaign on [[Indiegogo]] was 86 time over-subscribed, raising $1m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zboard-2-the-most-advanced-electric-skateboard#/updates|title=ZBoard 2: The Most Advanced Electric Skateboard|work=Indiegogo|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and operation==
[[File:Electric skateboard(800,600,400watt).jpg|thumb|Electric skateboards of various sizes]]
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
It was originally designed for local transport, but now offer a more serious "Off Road" model as a new thrill sport. The Off Road style boards are able to traverse grass, gravel, dirt and hard sand with ease and are often seen at low tide on the beach.

==Detailed information about battery and range==
{{original research inline|date=June 2017}}
{{overly detailed|section=yes|date=January 2016}}
The typical range for an 800-watt unit with a [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] battery is between 16 and 20&amp;nbsp;km (9–12 miles). 600&amp;nbsp;W units achieve 20% less range than their 800&amp;nbsp;W counterparts, and units using the older [[Sealed lead acid#Gel battery|sealed lead acid]] batteries achieve 30% less range than those using the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. The maximum speed of a typical electric skateboard is about {{convert|25|–|40|km/h|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-ride.ca/Electric_Vehicles_Info/How_to_select_skateboard.htm |title=How to Select an Electric Skateboard |publisher=E-Ride |accessdate=2010-08-24 |date=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many manufacturers now offer 12 [[Amp-hour|Ah]] LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; packs as an optional upgrade over the more standard SLA battery packs, which reduces the weight of the boards by 10&amp;nbsp;kg (LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; packs weigh in at 5&amp;nbsp;kg compared to the 15&amp;nbsp;kg of the standard SLA pack). This results in a lighter, more agile board. Additionally, discharge chemistry of a LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; battery allows the motor to run at top speed constantly until the battery is exhausted, compared to the initial high current from an SLA battery which quickly tapers off as it discharges. Furthermore, a high quality 12&amp;nbsp;Ah-rated LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pack can realistically deliver 9–10&amp;nbsp;Ah, compared to a 12&amp;nbsp;Ah-rated SLA pack which realistically delivers 7–8&amp;nbsp;Ah due to the high energy demands of an electric skateboard's motor (typically 25–35 amps when riding at high speed, over rough or sloping terrain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenskate.co.nz/battery-discharge-stats/ |title=Battery Discharge Stats |publisher=Electric Skateboards NZ |date=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By increasing the battery capacity to 20&amp;nbsp;Ah (using small-factor LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cells), ranges of 30 kilometers or more can be achieved even when riding at constant high speed.
In 2016, four companies started to offer electric skateboards with the ability to run over 30&amp;nbsp;km with an 8Ah battery unlike their predecessors who offer up to 25&amp;nbsp;km and cost almost double.

'''Eletropaulo''' ({{lang-pt|Eletropaulo Metropolitana - Electricidade de São Paulo S.A}})  is a major [[Brazil]]ian power distributor in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], created in the breakup of the old state-owned power distribution company '''Eletropaulo''' that monopolized electricity distribution in São Paulo from 1981 to 1999. The similarity of the names makes most old customers call it simply Eletropaulo.

The company has around 5.8 million customers - nearly 20 million people - in an area of 4,526 kilometers ², in 24 municipalities in the metropolitan area of [[São Paulo]], including the city itself;

Ownership of ''Eletropaulo'' is shared between AES (which owns 17% of the company) and the [[Brazilian Development Bank]] (which owns 19%). Its stock is traded on [[BM&amp;F Bovespa|B3]], and was part of the [[Índice Bovespa|Ibovespa]] index.

==History==
Electrical power infrastructure in São Paulo was originally developed in the first half of the 20th century by the [[São Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company]], a company financed with foreign capital and legally domiciled in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.  After 1912, this company was part of the [[holding company]] Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company (usually known in Brazil simply as "Light"), which eventually changed its name to Brascan (for "Brasil" + "Canada").  At the end of the 1970s, the company's Brazilian assets transferred to Brazilian ownership, first to private hands and then (in 1981) to the government of the state of São Paulo.  The Canadian company, which had in the meantime diversified to other areas, still exists under the name [[Brookfield Asset Management]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2052">[[File:Cabinetmaking frameless cabinet.svg|right|thumb|200px|A frameless cabinet]] '''Frameless construction''' in [[cabinetmaking]] refers to the construction of cabinets using flat panels of [[engineered wood]] — usually [[particle board]], [[plywood]] or [[medium-density fibreboard]] — rather than the traditional [[frame and panel]] construction.

A common construction method for frameless cabinets originated in Europe after World War II and is known as the ''32-mm system'' or ''European system''.&lt;ref name=jimchrist/&gt;  This nomenclature is derived from the 32-[[millimetre]] spacing between the system holes used for construction and installation of hardware typically used for doors, drawers and shelves. There are numerous 32mm based cabinet systems, one such system is Hettich's [[System 32 (furniture)|System 32]]. In North America it is also often referred to as "European Cabinetry" popular due to its simplicity of construction, clean lines and low cost.

With frameless (AKA full access) cabinets, thicker sides (boxes) keep the cabinet much more stable and avoids the use of a front frame, such as found in [[Face frame|face-frame]] cabinets. By eliminating the front frame, you can have more room to get large objects inside with more usable space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.masterbrand.com/get-started/design-your-room/cabinet-construction/frameless-cabinets|title=Framed vs. Frameless Cabinets|website=www.masterbrand.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; speculate that a [[fifth force]] might exist, but this is not widely accepted nor proven.

Each of the known fundamental interactions can be described mathematically as a ''[[field (physics)|field]]''. The gravitational force is attributed to the curvature of [[spacetime]], described by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[general theory of relativity]]. The other three are discrete [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]], and their interactions are mediated by [[elementary particle]]s described by the [[Standard Model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/standard-model/|title=The Standard Model of Particle Physics {{!}} symmetry magazine|website=www.symmetrymagazine.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[particle physics]].

Within the Standard Model, the strong  interaction is carried by a particle called the [[gluon]], and is responsible for [[quark]]s binding together to form [[hadron]]s, such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s.  As a residual effect, it creates the [[nuclear force]] that binds the latter particles to form [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. The weak interaction is carried by particles called [[W and Z bosons]], and also acts on the nucleus of [[atom]]s, mediating [[radioactive decay]].  The electromagnetic force, carried by the [[photon]], creates [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, which are responsible for the attraction between orbital [[electron]]s and atomic nuclei which holds atoms together, as well as [[chemical bonding]] and [[electromagnetic wave]]s, including [[visible light]], and forms the basis for electrical technology. Although the electromagnetic force is far stronger than  gravity, it tends to cancel itself out within large objects, so over the largest distances (on the scale of planets and galaxies), gravity tends to be the dominant force.

All four fundamental forces are believed to be related, and to unite into a single force at high energies on a minuscule scale, the [[Planck scale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/the-planck-scale|title=The Planck scale|work=symmetry magazine|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[particle accelerator]]s cannot produce the enormous energies required to experimentally probe this.  Efforts to devise a common theoretical framework that would explain the relation between the forces are perhaps the greatest goal of [[theoretical physicist]]s today.  The weak and electromagnetic forces have already been unified with the [[electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]] of [[Sheldon Glashow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/glashow/auto-biography/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Abdus Salam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/salam/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/weinberg/auto-biography/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which they received the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics.  Progress is currently being made in uniting the electroweak and strong fields within a [[Grand Unified Theory]] (GUT).  A bigger challenge is to find a way to [[Quantization (physics)|quantize]] the gravitational field, resulting in a theory of [[quantum gravity]] (QG) which would unite gravity in a common theoretical framework with the other three forces.  Some theories, notably [[string theory]], seek both QG and GUT within one framework, unifying all four fundamental interactions along with [[mass generation]] within a [[theory of everything]] (ToE).

==History==
===Classical theory===
In his 1687 theory, [[Isaac Newton]] postulated space as an infinite and unalterable physical structure existing before, within, and around all objects while their states and relations unfold at a constant pace everywhere, thus [[absolute space and time]]. Inferring that all objects bearing mass approach at a constant rate, but collide by impact proportional to their masses, Newton inferred that matter exhibits an attractive force. His [[law of universal gravitation]] mathematically stated it to span the entire universe instantly (despite absolute time), or, if not actually a force, to be instant interaction among all objects (despite absolute space.) As conventionally interpreted, Newton's theory of motion modelled a ''[[central force]]'' without a communicating medium.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's absolute space was a medium, but not one transmitting gravitation.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Newton's theory violated the first principle of [[mechanical philosophy]], as stated by [[Descartes]], ''No [[action at a distance]]''. Conversely, during the 1820s, when explaining magnetism, [[Michael Faraday]] inferred a ''field'' filling space and transmitting that force. Faraday conjectured that ultimately, all forces unified into one.

In 1873, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] unified electricity and magnetism as effects of an electromagnetic field whose third consequence was light, travelling at constant speed in a vacuum. The [[classical electrodynamics|electromagnetic field theory]] contradicted predictions of Newton's theory of motion, unless physical states of the [[luminiferous aether]]—presumed to fill all space whether within matter or in a vacuum and to manifest the electromagnetic field—aligned all phenomena and thereby held valid the [[Galilean relativity|Newtonian principle relativity or invariance]].

===The Standard Model===
{{Main article|Standard Model}} {{See also|Standard Model (mathematical formulation)}}
[[Image:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|thumb|350px|The [[Standard Model]] of elementary particles, with the [[fermion]]s in the first three columns, the [[gauge boson]]s in the fourth column, and the [[Higgs boson]] in the fifth column]]
The Standard Model of particle physics was developed throughout the latter half of the 20th century. In the Standard Model, the electromagnetic, strong, and weak interactions associate with [[elementary particles]], whose behaviours are modelled in [[quantum mechanics]] (QM). For predictive success with QM's [[Probability|probabilistic]] outcomes, [[particle physics]] conventionally models QM [[event (particle physics)|events]] across a field set to [[special theory of relativity|special relativity]], altogether relativistic quantum field theory (QFT).&lt;ref&gt;Meinard Kuhlmann, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=physicists-debate-whether-world-made-of-particles-fields-or-something-else "Physicists debate whether the world is made of particles or fields—or something else entirely"], ''Scientific American'', 24 Jul 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Force particles, called [[gauge boson]]s—''force carriers'' or ''[[messenger particles]]'' of underlying fields—interact with matter particles, called [[fermion]]s. [[Baryonic matter|Everyday matter]] is atoms, composed of three fermion types: [[quark|up-quarks and down-quarks]] constituting, as well as electrons orbiting, the atom's nucleus. Atoms interact, form [[molecule]]s, and manifest further properties through electromagnetic interactions among their electrons absorbing and emitting photons, the electromagnetic field's force carrier, which if unimpeded traverse potentially infinite distance. Electromagnetism's QFT is [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).

The electromagnetic interaction was modelled with the weak interaction, whose force carriers are [[W and Z bosons]], traversing the minuscule distance, in electroweak theory (EWT). Electroweak interaction would operate at such high temperatures as soon after the presumed [[Big Bang]], but, as the early universe cooled, [[symmetry breaking|split]] into electromagnetic and weak interactions. The strong interaction, whose force carrier is the [[gluon]], traversing minuscule distance among quarks, is modeled in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). EWT, QCD, and the [[Higgs mechanism]], whereby the [[Higgs field]] manifests [[Higgs boson]]s that interact with some quantum particles and thereby endow those particles with mass comprise [[particle physics]]' [[Standard Model]] (SM). Predictions are usually made using calculational approximation methods, although such [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] is inadequate to model some experimental observations (for instance [[bound state]]s and [[soliton]]s.) Still, physicists widely accept the Standard Model as science's most experimentally confirmed theory.

[[Beyond the Standard Model]], some theorists work to unite the electroweak and [[strong interaction|strong]] interactions within a [[Grand Unified Theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krauss|first=Lawrence M.|title=A Brief History of the Grand Unified Theory of Physics|url=http://nautil.us/issue/46/balance/a-brief-history-of-the-grand-unified-theory-of-physics|journal=Nautilus}}&lt;/ref&gt; (GUT). Some attempts at GUTs hypothesize "shadow" particles, such that every known [[fermion|matter particle]] associates with an undiscovered [[Gauge boson|force particle]], and vice versa, altogether [[supersymmetry]] (SUSY). Other theorists seek to quantize the gravitational field by the modelling behaviour of its hypothetical force carrier, the [[graviton]] and achieve quantum gravity (QG). One approach to QG is [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG). Still other theorists seek both QG and GUT within one framework, reducing all four fundamental interactions to a [[Theory of Everything]] (ToE). The most prevalent aim at a ToE is [[string theory]], although to model [[fermion|matter particles]], it added [[supersymmetry|SUSY]] to [[Gauge boson|force particles]]—and so, strictly speaking, became [[superstring theory]]. Multiple, seemingly disparate superstring theories were unified on a backbone, [[M-theory]]. Theories beyond the Standard Model remain highly speculative, lacking great experimental support.

==Overview of the fundamental interactions==
[[Image:Particle overview.svg|thumb|400px|An overview of the various families of elementary and composite particles, and the theories describing their interactions. Fermions are on the left, and Bosons are on the right.]]

In the [[Model (abstract)|conceptual model]] of fundamental interactions, [[matter]] consists of [[fermion]]s, which carry [[Physical property|properties]] called [[charge (physics)|charge]]s and [[spin (physics)|spin]] ±{{Frac|1|2}} (intrinsic [[angular momentum]] ±{{frac|''ħ''|2}}, where ħ is the [[reduced Planck constant]]). They attract or repel each other by exchanging [[boson]]s.

The interaction of any pair of fermions in perturbation theory can then be modelled thus:

: Two fermions go in → ''interaction'' by boson exchange → Two changed fermions go out.

The exchange of bosons always carries [[energy]] and [[momentum]] between the fermions, thereby changing their speed and direction. The exchange may also transport a charge between the fermions, changing the charges of the fermions in the process (e.g., turn them from one type of fermion to another). Since bosons carry one unit of angular momentum, the fermion's spin direction will flip from +{{Frac|1|2}} to −{{Frac|1|2}} (or vice versa) during such an exchange (in units of the [[reduced Planck's constant]]).

Because an interaction results in fermions attracting and repelling each other, an older term for "interaction" is [[force]].

According to the present understanding, there are four fundamental interactions or forces: [[gravitation]], electromagnetism, the [[weak interaction]], and the strong interaction. Their magnitude and behaviour vary greatly, as described in the table below. Modern physics attempts to explain every observed [[natural phenomenon|physical phenomenon]] by these fundamental interactions. Moreover, reducing the number of different interaction types is seen as desirable. Two cases in point are the [[unified field theory|unification]] of:
*[[Electric force|Electric]] and [[magnetic force]] into electromagnetism;
*The [[electromagnetic interaction]] and the weak interaction into the electroweak interaction; see below.

Both magnitude ("relative strength") and "range", as given in the table, are meaningful only within a rather complex theoretical framework. It should also be noted that the table below lists properties of a conceptual scheme that is still the subject of ongoing research.

The modern (perturbative) [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] view of the fundamental forces other than gravity is that particles of matter ([[fermion]]s) do not directly interact with each other, but rather carry a charge, and exchange [[virtual particles]] ([[gauge boson]]s), which are the interaction carriers or force mediators. For example, photons mediate the interaction of [[electric charge]]s, and gluons mediate the interaction of [[color charge]]s.

==The interactions==
===Gravity===
{{Main article|Gravity}}
''Gravitation'' is by far the weakest of the four interactions at the atomic scale, where electromagnetic interactions dominate. But the idea that the weakness of gravity can easily be demonstrated by suspending a pin using a simple [[magnet]] (such as a refrigerator magnet) is fundamentally flawed. The only reason the magnet is able to hold the pin against the gravitational pull of the entire Earth is due to its relative proximity. There is clearly a short distance of separation between magnet and pin where a breaking point is reached, and due to the large mass of Earth this distance is disappointingly small.

Thus gravitation is very important for macroscopic objects and over macroscopic distances for the following reasons. Gravitation:
*Is the only interaction that acts on all particles having mass, energy and/or momentum
*Has an infinite range, like electromagnetism but unlike strong and weak interaction{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
*Cannot be absorbed, transformed, or shielded against
*Always attracts and never repels (see function of geodesic equation in [[general relativity]])

Even though electromagnetism is far stronger than gravitation, electrostatic attraction is not relevant for large celestial bodies, such as planets, stars, and galaxies, simply because such bodies contain equal numbers of protons and electrons and so have a net electric charge of zero. Nothing "cancels" gravity, since it is only attractive, unlike electric forces which can be attractive or repulsive. On the other hand, all objects having mass are subject to the gravitational force, which only attracts. Therefore, only gravitation matters on the large-scale structure of the universe.

The long range of gravitation makes it responsible for such large-scale phenomena as the structure of galaxies and [[black hole]]s and it retards the [[Universe#Big Bang model|expansion of the universe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Gravitation also explains astronomical phenomena on more modest scales, such as [[planet]]ary [[orbit]]s, as well as everyday experience: objects fall; heavy objects act as if they were glued to the ground, and animals can only jump so high.

Gravitation was the first interaction to be described mathematically. In ancient times, [[Aristotle]] hypothesized that objects of different masses fall at different rates. During the [[Scientific Revolution]], [[Galileo Galilei]] experimentally determined that this hypothesis was wrong under certain circumstances — neglecting the friction due to air resistance, and buoyancy forces if an atmosphere is present (e.g. the case of a dropped air-filled balloon vs a water-filled balloon) all objects accelerate toward the Earth at the same rate. Isaac Newton's [[law of Universal Gravitation]] (1687) was a good approximation of the behaviour of gravitation. Our present-day understanding of gravitation stems from Einstein's [[General Theory of Relativity]] of 1915, a more accurate (especially for [[cosmology|cosmological]] masses and distances) description of gravitation in terms of the [[geometry]] of [[spacetime]].

Merging general relativity and [[quantum mechanics]] (or [[quantum field theory]]) into a more general theory of [[quantum gravity]] is an area of active research. It is hypothesized that gravitation is mediated by a massless spin-2 particle called the [[graviton]].

Although general relativity has been experimentally confirmed (at least for weak fields {{which|date=November 2015}}) on all but the smallest scales, there are rival theories of gravitation. Those taken seriously by{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} the physics community all reduce to general relativity in some limit, and the focus of observational work is to establish limitations on what deviations from general relativity are possible.

Proposed [[extra dimensions]] could explain why the gravity force is so weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/physics/extra-dimensions-gravitons-and-tiny-black-holes|title=Extra dimensions, gravitons, and tiny black holes|date=20 January 2012|author=CERN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electroweak interaction===
{{Main article|Electroweak interaction}}
[[Electromagnetism]] and weak interaction appear to be very different at everyday low energies. They can be modelled using two different theories. However, above unification energy, on the order of 100 [[GeV]], they would merge into a single electroweak force.

Electroweak theory is very important for modern [[cosmology]], particularly on how the [[universe]] evolved. This is because shortly after the Big Bang, the temperature was approximately above 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], the electromagnetic force and the weak force were merged into a combined electroweak force.

For contributions to the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interaction between [[particle physics|elementary particles]], Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Sander |last=Bais |year=2005| title=The Equations. Icons of knowledge| isbn=0-674-01967-9}} p.84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electromagnetism====
{{Main article|Electromagnetism}}
Electromagnetism is the force that acts between [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles. This phenomenon includes the [[electrostatic force]] acting between charged particles at rest, and the combined effect of electric and [[Magnetism|magnetic]] forces acting between charged particles moving relative to each other.

Electromagnetism has infinite range  like gravity, but is vastly stronger, and therefore describes a number of macroscopic phenomena of everyday experience such as [[friction]], [[rainbows]], [[lightning]], and all human-made devices using [[electric current]], such as television, [[laser]]s, and [[computer]]s. Electromagnetism fundamentally determines all macroscopic, and many atomic levels, properties of the [[chemical element]]s, including all [[chemical bond]]ing.

In a four kilogram (~1 gallon) jug of water there are

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 4000 \ \mbox{g}\,H_2 O \cdot \frac{1 \ \mbox{mol}\,H_2 O}{18 \ \mbox{g}\,H_2 O} \cdot \frac{10 \ \mbox{mol}\,e^{-}}{1 \ \mbox{mol}\,H_2 O} \cdot \frac{96,485 \ \mbox{C}\,}{1 \ \mbox{mol}\,e^{-}} = 2.1 \times 10^{8} C \ \, \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

of total electron charge. Thus, IF we could separate ALL the positive(+) charges into 1 gallon jug and separate ALL the negative (-)
charges into the other gallon jug and IF we place two such jugs a meter apart, the electrons in one of the jugs will attract those in the other jug with a force of

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; {1 \over 4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{(2.1 \times 10^{8} C)^2}{(1 m)^2} = 4.1 \times 10^{26} N.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This force is larger than the planet Earth would weigh if weighed on another Earth. The [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] in one jug also repel those in the other with the same force. However, these repulsive forces are canceled by the attraction of the electrons in jug A with the nuclei in jug B and the attraction of the nuclei in jug A with the electrons in jug B, resulting in no net force. Electromagnetic forces are tremendously stronger than gravity but cancel out so that for large bodies gravity dominates.

Electrical and magnetic phenomena have been observed since ancient times, but it was only in the 19th century [[James Clerk Maxwell]] discovered that electricity and magnetism are two aspects of the same fundamental interaction. By 1864, [[Maxwell's equations]] had rigorously quantified this unified interaction. Maxwell's theory, restated using [[vector calculus]], is the classical theory of electromagnetism, suitable for most technological purposes.

The constant speed of light in a vacuum (customarily described with a lowercase letter "c") can be derived from Maxwell's equations, which are consistent with the theory of special relativity. [[Einstein]]'s 1905 theory of [[special relativity]], however, which flows from the observation that the [[speed of light]] is constant no matter how fast the observer is moving, showed that the theoretical result implied by Maxwell's equations has profound implications far beyond electromagnetism on the very nature of time and space.

In another work that departed from classical electro-magnetism, Einstein also explained the [[photoelectric effect]] by utilizing Max Planck's discovery that light was transmitted in 'quanta' of specific energy content based on the frequency, which we now call [[photon]]s. Starting around 1927, [[Paul Dirac]] combined [[quantum mechanics]] with the relativistic theory of [[electromagnetism]]. Further work in the 1940s, by [[Richard Feynman]], [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Julian Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], completed this theory, which is now called [[quantum electrodynamics]], the revised theory of electromagnetism. Quantum electrodynamics and quantum mechanics provide a theoretical basis for electromagnetic behavior such as [[quantum tunneling]], in which a certain percentage of electrically charged particles move in ways that would be impossible under the classical electromagnetic theory, that is necessary for everyday electronic devices such as [[transistors]] to function.

====Weak interaction====
{{Main article|Weak interaction}}
The ''weak interaction'' or ''weak nuclear force'' is responsible for some nuclear phenomena such as [[beta decay]]. Electromagnetism and the weak force are now understood to be two aspects of a unified [[electroweak interaction]] — this discovery was the first step toward the unified theory known as the [[Standard Model]]. In the theory of the electroweak interaction, the carriers of the weak force are the massive [[gauge boson]]s called the [[W and Z bosons]]. The weak interaction is the only known interaction which does not conserve [[parity (physics)|parity]]; it is left-right asymmetric. The weak interaction even [[CP-violation|violates CP symmetry]] but does [[CPT symmetry|conserve CPT]].

===Strong interaction===
{{Main article|Strong interaction}}
The ''strong interaction'', or ''strong nuclear force'', is the most complicated interaction, mainly because of the way it varies with distance. At distances greater than 10 [[femtometers]], the strong force is practically unobservable. Moreover, it holds only inside the atomic nucleus.

After the nucleus was discovered in 1908, it was clear that a new force, today known as the nuclear force, was needed to overcome the [[Electrostatics|electrostatic repulsion]], a manifestation of electromagnetism, of the positively charged protons. Otherwise, the nucleus could not exist. Moreover, the force had to be strong enough to squeeze the protons into a volume whose diameter is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; [[metre|m]], much smaller than that of the entire atom. From the short range of this force, [[Hideki Yukawa]] predicted that it was associated with a massive particle, whose mass is approximately 100 MeV.

The 1947 discovery of the [[pion]] ushered in the modern era of particle physics. Hundreds of hadrons were discovered from the 1940s to 1960s, and an [[Regge theory|extremely complicated theory]] of hadrons as strongly interacting particles was developed. Most notably:
*The pions were understood to be oscillations of [[Vacuum expectation value|vacuum condensates]];
*[[Jun John Sakurai]] proposed the rho and omega [[vector boson]]s to be [[Yang–Mills theory|force carrying particles]] for approximate symmetries of [[isospin]] and [[hypercharge]];
*[[Geoffrey Chew]], Edward K. Burdett and [[Steven Frautschi]] grouped the heavier hadrons into families that could be understood as vibrational and rotational excitations of [[string theory|strings]].

While each of these approaches offered deep insights, no approach led directly to a fundamental theory.

[[Murray Gell-Mann]] along with [[George Zweig]] first proposed fractionally charged quarks in 1961. Throughout the 1960s, different authors considered theories similar to the modern fundamental theory of [[quantum chromodynamics|quantum chromodynamics (QCD)]] as simple models for the interactions of quarks. The first to hypothesize the gluons of QCD were [[Moo-Young Han]] and [[Yoichiro Nambu]], who introduced the [[quark color]] charge and hypothesized that it might be associated with a force-carrying field. At that time, however, it was difficult to see how such a model could permanently confine quarks. Han and Nambu also assigned each quark color an integer electrical charge, so that the quarks were fractionally charged only on average, and they did not expect the quarks in their model to be permanently confined.

In 1971, Murray Gell-Mann and [[Harald Fritzsch]] proposed that the Han/Nambu color gauge field was the correct theory of the short-distance interactions of fractionally charged quarks. A little later, [[David Gross]], [[Frank Wilczek]], and [[David Politzer]] discovered that this theory had the property of [[asymptotic freedom]], allowing them to make contact with [[deep inelastic scattering|experimental evidence]]. They concluded that QCD was the complete theory of the strong interactions, correct at all distance scales. The discovery of asymptotic freedom led most physicists to accept QCD since it became clear that even the long-distance properties of the strong interactions could be consistent with experiment if the quarks are permanently confined.

Assuming that quarks are confined, [[Mikhail Shifman]], [[Arkady Vainshtein]] and [[Valentine Zakharov]] were able to compute the properties of many low-lying hadrons directly from QCD, with only a few extra parameters to describe the vacuum. In 1980, [[Kenneth G. Wilson]] published computer calculations based on the first principles of QCD, establishing, to a level of confidence tantamount to certainty, that QCD will confine quarks. Since then, QCD has been the established theory of the strong interactions.

QCD is a theory of fractionally charged quarks interacting by means of 8 bosonic particles called gluons. The gluons interact with each other, not just with the quarks, and at long distances the lines of force collimate into strings. In this way, the mathematical theory of QCD not only explains how quarks interact over short distances but also the string-like behavior, discovered by Chew and Frautschi, which they manifest over longer distances.

===Beyond the Standard Model===
{{main article|Physics beyond the Standard Model}}
{{See also|Elementary particle#Beyond the Standard Model}}
Numerous theoretical efforts have been made to systematize the existing four fundamental interactions on the model of electroweak unification.

Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) are proposals to show that the three fundamental interactions described by the Standard Model are all different manifestations of a single interaction with [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] that break down and create separate interactions below some extremely high level of energy. GUTs are also expected to predict some of the relationships between constants of nature that the Standard Model treats as unrelated, as well as predicting [[gauge coupling unification]] for the relative strengths of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces (this was, for example, verified at the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] in 1991 for [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|supersymmetric]] theories).{{Specify}}

Theories of everything, which integrate GUTs with a quantum gravity theory face a greater barrier, because no quantum gravity theories, which include [[string theory]], [[loop quantum gravity]], and [[twistor theory]], have secured wide acceptance. Some theories look for a graviton to complete the Standard Model list of force-carrying particles, while others, like loop quantum gravity, emphasize the possibility that time-space itself may have a quantum aspect to it.

Some theories beyond the Standard Model include a hypothetical [[fifth force]], and the search for such a force is an ongoing line of experimental research in physics. In [[supersymmetric]] theories, there are particles that acquire their masses only through supersymmetry breaking effects and these particles, known as [[Moduli (physics)|moduli]] can mediate new forces. Another reason to look for new forces is the discovery that the [[expansion of the universe]] is accelerating (also known as [[dark energy]]), giving rise to a need to explain a nonzero [[cosmological constant]], and possibly to other modifications of [[general relativity]]. Fifth forces have also been suggested to explain phenomena such as [[Charge parity|CP]] violations, [[dark matter]], and [[dark flow]].

In December 2015, two observations in the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] hinted at the existence of a new particle six times heavier than the [[Higgs boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3675893/Is-Large-Hadron-Collider-set-reveal-secrets-universe-Dark-matter-breakthrough-fifth-fundamental-force-finally-revealed-researchers-prepare-publish-latest-findings.html|title=Is the Large Hadron Collider set to reveal secrets of the universe?|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after obtaining more experimental data, the anomaly appeared to not be significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth Gibney |title=Hopes for revolutionary new LHC particle dashed |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=August 5, 2016 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/hopes-for-revolutionary-new-lhc-particle-dashed-1.20376 |accessdate=August 18, 2016|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20376|bibcode=2016Natur.536..133G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Greedy Lying Bastards''''' is a 2012 American [[documentary film]] directed by [[Craig Rosebraugh]]. The film explores the phenomenon of [[climate change denial]].

==Content==
''Greedy Lying Bastards'' investigates the [[climate change]] misinformation campaign waged by the [[petroleum industry]] and its funded [[think tank]]s. The film exposes how a small number of well-paid spokespeople have worked to confuse the public and lawmakers on the issue. Both [[ExxonMobil]] and [[Koch Industries]] are identified in the film as two of the worst culprits funding the denial campaign.  In addition to exposing the denial campaign, ''Greedy Lying Bastards'' tells the stories of those currently impacted by changing climate. These include residents of [[Kivalina, Alaska|Kivalina]], [[Alaska]] who are faced with relocation due to erosion of shorelines caused from rising temperatures and those in [[Tuvalu]] facing [[sea level rise]]. The film also covers the [[2012 Colorado wildfires]], drought in [[Kansas]] (part of the wider [[2010–13 Southern United States and Mexico drought]]) and [[Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arizona Reporter'': [http://www.azreporter.com/news/index.php?itemid=2097 GREEDY LYING BASTARDS, REVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Greedy Lying Bastards'' was directed, produced and narrated by [[Craig Rosebraugh]]. He co-wrote the film with two-time [[Emmy Award]] winning editor Patrick Gambuti, Jr., who also served as editor. [[Daryl Hannah]] was an executive producer and [[Michael Brook]], who wrote the score for [[An Inconvenient Truth]], was the composer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jan/20/greedy-lying-bastards-oil-filmmaker&lt;/ref&gt;

In making the film Rosebraugh sought to "undertake a project that would uncover the hidden agenda of the oil industry and provide answers as to why we as a nation fail to implement clean energy policies and take effective action on important problems such as climate change."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wthr.com/story/20936434/greedy-lying-bastards-to-open-nationally-on-march-8-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The film began production in 2009 and finished late in 2012.

==Release==
''Greedy Lying Bastards'' was released theatrically in North America on March 8, 2013, where it grossed $45,000.&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt;  Disinformation released it on home video January 14, 2014, and it grossed another $73,537 in North American sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Greedy-Lying-Bastards#tab=summary|title=Greedy Lying Bastards|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 69% of 35 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.2/10.  The site's consensus reads: "It's not particularly subtle, but ''Greedy Lying Bastards'' is effective in questioning the motives of climate change deniers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/greedy_lying_bastards_2012/|title=Greedy Lying Bastards  (2013)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Metacritic]] rated it 56/100 based on 14 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/greedy-lying-bastards|title=Greedy Lying Bastards|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grid parity''' (or '''socket parity''') occurs when an [[alternative energy]] source can generate power at a [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE) that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from [[Mains electricity|the electricity grid]]. The term is most commonly used when discussing [[renewable energy]] sources, notably [[solar power]] and [[wind power]]. Grid parity depends upon whether you are calculating from the point of view of a utility or of a retail consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is Grid Parity? |url=http://www.renewable-energy-advisors.com/learn-more-2/what-is-grid-parity/ |publisher=Renewable Energy Advisors |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without [[subsidy|subsidies]] or government support. It is widely believed that a wholesale shift in generation to these forms of energy will take place when they reach grid parity.

Germany was one of the first countries to reach parity for [[solar PV]] in 2011 and 2012 for [[Photovoltaic power station|utility-scale solar]] and [[rooftop solar PV]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer-recentfacts-2015-01-07"&gt;

Wind power reached grid parity in some places in Europe in the mid 2000s, and has continued to reduce in price.

== Overview ==
The price of electricity from the grid is complex. Most power sources in the developed world are generated in industrial scale plants developed by private or public consortia. The company providing the power and the company delivering that power to the customers are often separate entities who enter into a [[Power Purchase Agreement]] that sets a fixed rate for all of the power delivered by the plant. On the other end of the wire, the [[local distribution company]] (LDC) charges rates that will cover their power purchases from the variety of producers they use.

This relationship is not straightforward; for instance, an LDC may buy large amounts of [[Base load power plant|base load power]] from a [[Nuclear power#Nuclear power plant|nuclear plant]] at a low fixed cost and then buy [[peaking power plant|peaking power]] only as required from [[Gas turbine#Industrial gas turbines for power generation|natural gas peakers]] at a much higher cost, perhaps five to six times. Depending on their billing policy, this might be billed to the customer at a flat rate combining the two rates the LDC pays, or alternately based on a [[time-based pricing]] policy that tries to more closely match input costs with customer prices.

As a result of these policies, the exact definition of "grid parity" varies not only from location to location, but customer to customer and even hour to hour.

For instance, [[wind power]] connects to the grid on the distribution side (as opposed to the customer side). This means it competes with other large forms of industrial-scale power like hydro, nuclear or coal-fired plants, which are generally inexpensive forms of power. Additionally, the generator will be charged by the distribution operator to carry the power to the markets, adding to their levelized costs.

Solar has the advantage of scaling easily from systems as small as a single [[solar panel]] placed on the customer's roof. In this case the system has to compete with the post-delivery ''retail'' price, which is generally much higher than the wholesale price at the same time.

It is also important to consider changes in grid pricing when determining whether or not a source is at parity. For instance, the introduction of time-of-use pricing and a general increase in power prices in [[Mexico]] during 2010 and 2011 has suddenly made many forms of renewable energy reach grid parity. A drop in power prices, as has happened in some locations due to the [[late-2000s recession]], can likewise render systems formerly at parity no longer interesting.

In general terms, fuel prices continue to increase, while renewable energy sources continue to reduce in up-front costs. As a result, widespread grid parity for wind and solar are generally predicted for the time between 2015 and 2020.

[[File:EU-PV-LCOE-Projection.png|thumb|Projection of [[levelized cost of electricity]] for [[solar PV]] in Europe&lt;ref name="EPIA2011Sep" /&gt;]]

=== Pricing solar ===
[[File:Swansons-law.svg|thumb|[[Swanson's law]] states that with every doubling of cumulative production of panels, there has been a 20 percent reduction in the cost of panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Is-there-really-a-Swansons-Law |title=Swanson's Law and Making US Solar Scale Like Germany |work=Greentech Media |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Grid parity is most commonly used in the field of [[solar power]], and most specifically when referring to [[solar photovoltaic]]s (PV). As PV systems do not use fuel and are largely maintenance-free, the [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE) is dominated almost entirely by the [[capital cost]] of the system. With the assumption that the [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]] will be similar to the [[inflation rate]] of grid power, the levelized cost can be calculated by dividing the original capital cost by the total amount of electricity produced over the system's lifetime.

As the LCOE of solar PV is dominated by the capital costs, and the capital costs by the panels, the wholesale prices of [[PV module]]s are the main consideration when tracking grid parity. A 2015 study shows price/kWh dropping by 10% per year since 1980, and predicts that solar could contribute 20% of total electricity consumption by 2030, whereas the [[International Energy Agency]] predicts 16% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699 |title=How predictable is technological progress? |publisher= |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2015.11.001 |author= J. Doyne Farmer, François Lafond |date=2 November 2015 |volume=45 |journal=Research Policy |pages=647–665}} License: cc. Note: Appendix F. A trend extrapolation of solar energy capacity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of electricity from these sources dropped about 25 times between 1990 and 2010. This rate of price reduction [[Growth_of_photovoltaics#Solar_overcapacity_.282009.E2.80.932013.29|accelerated between late-2009 and mid-2011 due to oversupply]]; the wholesale cost of solar modules dropped approximately 70%.&lt;ref name=Pearce /&gt; These pressures have demanded efficiencies throughout the construction chain, so total installed cost has also been strongly lowered.  Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down 99 percent, to 68¢ per watt in February 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/|title=Musk vs. Buffett: The Billionaire Battle to Own the Sun|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The downward move in pricing continues. [[Palo Alto]] California signed a wholesale  purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.  And in sunny [[Dubai]] large-scale solar generated electricity sold in 2016 for just $0.0299 per kWh -- "competitive with any form of fossil-based electricity — and cheaper than most."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-4-solar-power-stocks-will-leave-fossil-fuels-in-the-dust-2016-07-18?link=MW_popular|title=These 4 solar-power stocks will leave fossil fuels in the dust]&lt;/ref&gt;

The average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the Solarbuzz group fell from $3.50/watt to $2.43/watt over the course of 2011, and a decline to prices below $2.00/watt seems inevitable.&lt;ref name=quigg /&gt; Solarbuzz tracks retail prices, which includes a large mark-up over wholesale prices, and systems are commonly installed by firms buying at the wholesale price. For this reason, total installation costs are commonly similar to the retail price of the panels alone. Recent total-systems installation costs are around $2500/kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; in [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarwirtschaft.de/preisindex Bundesverband Solarwirtschaft Installation Cost of Photovoltaics]&lt;/ref&gt; or $3,250 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/how-much-do-solar-panels-cost-uk How Much Do Solar Panels Cost in the UK?]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, the capital cost of PV has fallen well below that of nuclear power and is set to fall further.&lt;ref name=quigg /&gt;

All that remains to calculate the LCOE is the expected production. Modules are generally warranted for 25 years and suffer only minor degradation during that time, so all that is needed to predict the generation is the local [[insolation]]. According to [http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/calculators/PVWATTS/version1/ PVWatts] a one-kilowatt system in [[Matsumoto, Nagano]] will produce 1187 [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) of electricity a year. Over a 25-year lifetime, the system will produce about 29,675&amp;nbsp;kWh (not accounting for the small effects of system degradation, about 0.25% a year). If this system costs $5,000 to install ([[Price per watt|$5 per watt]]), very conservative compared to worldwide prices, the LCOE = 5,000/29,675 ~= 17 cents per kWh. This is lower than the average Japanese residential rate of ~19.5 cents, which means that, in this simple case which skips the necessary [[time value of money]] calculation, PV has reached grid parity for residential users in Japan.

=== Reaching parity ===
Deciding whether or not PV is at grid parity is more complex than other sources, due to a side-effect of one of its main advantages. Compared to most sources, like wind turbines or hydro dams, PV can scale successfully to systems as small as one panel or as large as millions. In the case of small systems, they can be installed at the customer's location. In this case the LCOE competes against the ''retail'' price of grid power, which includes all upstream additions like transmission fees, taxes, etc. In the example above, grid parity has been reached in Nagano. However, retail prices are generally higher than wholesale prices, so grid parity may not have been reached for the very same system installed on the supply-side of the grid.

In order to encompass all of these possibilities, Japan's [[New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization|NEDO]] defines the grid parity in three phases:&lt;ref name="NEDO_PV2030plus"&gt;[http://www.nedo.go.jp/content/100116421.pdf Outline of the Roadmap PV2030+, NEDO, June 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117120805/http://www.nedo.go.jp/content/100116421.pdf |date=2012-01-17 }} (mostly in Japanese, but has an English summary from p. 17)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1st phase grid parity: residential grid-connected PV systems
* 2nd phase grid parity: industrial/transport/commercial sectors
* 3rd phase grid parity: general power generation
These categories are ranked in terms of the price of power they displace; residential power is more expensive than commercial wholesale. Thus, it is expected that the 1st phase would be reached earlier than the 3rd phase.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this report was based on the prediction that prices would fall 36 to 51% between 2010 and 2020, a decrease that actually took place during the year the report was authored. The parity line was claimed to have been crossed in Australia in September 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-07/solar-industry-celebrates-grid-parity/2875592/?site=sydney "Solar industry celebrates grid parity"], ABC News, 7 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and module prices have continued to fall since then.

Stanwell Corporation, an electricity generator owned by the Queensland government made a loss in 2013 from its 4,000&amp;nbsp;MW of coal and gas fired generation. The company attributed this loss to the expansion of rooftop solar generation which reducing the price of electricity during the day, on some days the price per MWh (usually $40–$50 Australian dollars) was almost zero.&lt;ref name="Stanwell blames solar for decline in fossil fuel baseload"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanwell blames solar for decline in fossil fuel baseload|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/stanwell-blames-solar-for-decline-in-fossil-fuel-baseload-54543|website=reneweconomy.com.au|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solar has won.

=== Rapid uptake ===
{{further|Growth of photovoltaics}}
Photovoltaics are now starting to compete in some places without subsidies. [[Shi Zhengrong]] has said that, as of 2012, unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with [[fossil fuels]] in [[Solar power in India|India]], [[Solar power in Hawaii|Hawaii]], Italy and Spain. As PV system prices decline it is inevitable that subsidies will end. "Solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=F4031B1C-52B9-11E1-A6A2-002128040CF6 |title=China’s visible solar power success |author=Mark Clifford |date=Feb 8, 2012 |work=MarketWatch }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/02/death-to-pv-subsidies |title=Death to PV Subsidies |author=Tim Keating |date=3 February 2012 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Was it *actually* able to fulfill this promise?|date=February 2018}} In fact, recent evidence suggest that photovoltaic grid parity has already been reached in countries of the Mediterranean basin (Cyprus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Towards grid parity in insular energy systems: The case of photovoltaics (PV) in Cyprus |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513010689 |author1=Paris A.

Predictions that a power source becomes self-supporting when parity is reached appear to be coming true. According to many measures, PV is the fastest growing source of power in the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For large-scale installations, prices below $1.00/watt are now common. In some locations, PV has reached grid parity, the cost at which it is competitive with coal or gas-fired generation. More generally, it is now evident that, given a carbon price of $50/ton, which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/kWh, solar PV will be cost-competitive in most locations. The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations, totalling about 23&amp;nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]] in 2011. Although some consolidation is likely in 2012, as firms try to restore profitability, strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade. Already, by one estimate, total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation.&lt;ref name=quigg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-end-the-nuclear-renaissance-6325?page=1 |title=The End of the Nuclear Renaissance |author=John Quiggin |date=January 3, 2012 |work=National Interest }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dramatic price reductions in the PV industry have been causing a number of other power sources to become less interesting. Nevertheless, there remains the widespread belief that [[concentrating solar power]] (CSP) will be even less expensive than PV, although this is suitable for industrial-scale projects only, and thus has to compete at wholesale pricing. One company stated in 2011 that CSP costs $0.12/kWh to produce in Australia, and expects this to drop to $0.06/kWh by 2015 due to improvements in technology and reductions in equipment [[manufacturing costs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desertec-australia.org/content-oz/concentratingsolarpower.html Introduction to Concentrating Solar Power. Desertec-Australia.org website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greentech Media]] predicts that LCOE of CSP and PV power will lower to $0.07–$0.12/kWh by 2020 in California.&lt;ref name="GTM"&gt;[http://www.greentechmedia.com/images/wysiwyg/research-blogs/GTM-LCOE-Analysis.pdf Cost and LCOE by Generation Technology, 2009-2020, GTM Research, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wind power ==
Grid parity also applies to wind power where it varies according to wind quality and existing distribution infrastructure. ExxonMobil predicts wind power real cost will approach parity with natural gas and coal without carbon sequestration and be cheaper than natural gas and coal with carbon sequestration by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;ExxonMobil Corporation. "The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030". Retrieved February 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind turbines reached grid parity in some areas of Europe in the mid-2000s, and in the US around the same time. Falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2124487/onshore-wind-reach-grid-parity-2016 "Onshore wind to reach grid parity by 2016"], BusinessGreen&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a significant amount of the wind power resource in North America remains above grid parity due to the long transmission distances involved.

'''Haugaland Kraft''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[power company]] formed in 1998 as a merger between Haugesund Energi and Karmsund Kraftlag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haugaland Kraft AS|url=https://snl.no/Haugaland_Kraft_AS|website=snl.no|publisher=[[Store norske leksikon]]|accessdate=4 May 2017|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haugaland Kraft is owned by the municipalities of [[Karmøy]], [[Haugesund]], [[Tysvær]], [[Vindafjord]], [[Bokn]], [[Sveio]] and [[Utsira]].

The company produces and distributes [[electric power]] (mainly [[hydroelectricity]]) to customers. In recent years, the company has been exploring possibilities of building [[wind power]] stations, but it has proven to be difficult to get concession from local authorities for such plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avslår vindkraftverk på Døldarheia|url=https://www.h-avis.no/vindafjord/nyheter/siste-nytt/avslar-vindkraftverk-pa-doldarheia/s/2-2.921-1.8497645|website=www.h-avis.no|publisher=[[Haugesunds Avis]]|accessdate=4 May 2017|date=2 July 2014|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also offers [[broadband]] services.

The head office is located in [[Haugesund]].

Laminar flow is a flow regime characterized by high [[momentum diffusion]] and low momentum [[convection]].

When a fluid is flowing through a closed channel such as a pipe or between two flat plates, either of two types of flow may occur depending on the velocity and viscosity of the fluid: laminar flow or [[Turbulence|turbulent flow]]. Laminar flow tends to occur at lower velocities, below a threshold at which it becomes turbulent. Turbulent flow is a less orderly flow regime that is characterised by [[eddies]] or small packets of fluid particles, which result in lateral mixing.&lt;ref name="Geankoplis, Christie John 2003"/&gt; In non-scientific terms, laminar flow is ''smooth'', while turbulent flow is ''rough''.

==Relationship with the Reynolds number==
The type of flow occurring in a fluid in a channel is important in fluid-dynamics problems and subsequently affects [[heat transfer|heat]] and [[mass transfer]] in fluid systems. The [[dimensionless number|dimensionless]] [[Reynolds number]] is an important parameter in the equations that describe whether fully developed flow conditions lead to laminar or turbulent flow. The Reynolds number is the ratio of the [[inertial force]] to the [[Shear stress|shearing force]] of the fluid: how fast the fluid is moving relative to how [[viscosity|viscous]] it is, irrespective of the scale of the fluid system. Laminar flow generally occurs when the fluid is moving slowly or the fluid is very viscous. As the Reynolds number increases, such as by increasing the flow rate of the fluid, the flow will transition from laminar to turbulent flow at a specific range of Reynolds numbers, the [[laminar–turbulent transition]] range depending on small disturbance levels in the fluid or imperfections in the flow system. If the Reynolds number is very small, much less than 1, then the fluid will exhibit [[Stokes flow|Stokes]], or creeping, flow, where the viscous forces of the fluid dominate the inertial forces.

The specific calculation of the Reynolds number, and the values where laminar flow occurs, will depend on the geometry of the flow system and flow pattern. The common example is [[flow conditioning|flow through a pipe]], where the Reynolds number is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rho u D_\text{H}}{\mu} = \frac{u D_\text{H}}{\nu} = \frac{Q D_\text{H}}{\nu A}, &lt;/math&gt;

where:

For such systems, laminar flow occurs when the Reynolds number is below a critical value of approximately 2,040, though the transition range is typically between 1,800 and 2,100.&lt;ref name=Recrit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avila|first=K.|first2=D.|last2=Moxey|first3=A.|last3=de Lozar|first4=M.|last4=Avila|first5=D.|last5=Barkley|first6=B.|last6=Hof|title=The Onset of Turbulence in Pipe Flow|journal=Science|date=July 2011|volume=333|issue=6039|pages=192–196|doi=10.1126/science.1203223|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6039/192|bibcode=2011Sci...333..192A|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904003951/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6039/192|archivedate=2011-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For fluid systems occurring on external surfaces, such as flow past objects suspended in the fluid, other definitions for Reynolds numbers can be used to predict the type of flow around the object. The particle Reynolds number Re&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; would be used for particle suspended in flowing fluids, for example. As with flow in pipes, laminar flow typically occurs with lower Reynolds numbers, while turbulent flow and related phenomena, such as [[vortex shedding]], occur with higher Reynolds numbers.

==Examples==
[[Image:Laminar flow.gif|thumb|right|In the case of a moving plate in a liquid, it is found that there is a layer (lamina) that moves with the plate, and a layer next to any stationary plate that is stationary.]]
[[Image:Laminar flow profile.gif|thumb|left|The velocity profile associated with laminar flow resembles a deck of cards. This flow profile of a fluid in a pipe shows that the fluid acts in layers that slide over one another.]]
A common application of laminar flow is in the smooth flow of a viscous liquid through a tube or pipe. In that case, the velocity of flow varies from zero at the walls to a maximum along the cross-sectional centre of the vessel. The flow profile of laminar flow in a tube can be calculated by dividing the flow into thin cylindrical elements and applying the viscous force to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another example is the flow of air over an aircraft [[wing]]. The [[boundary layer]] is a very thin sheet of air lying over the surface of the wing (and all other surfaces of the aircraft). Because air has [[viscosity]], this layer of air tends to adhere to the wing. As the wing moves forward through the air, the boundary layer at first flows smoothly over the streamlined shape of the [[airfoil]]. Here, the flow is laminar and the boundary layer is a [[Boundary layer|laminar layer]]. [[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]] applied the concept of the laminar boundary layer to airfoils in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Laminar airflow is used to separate volumes of air, or prevent airborne contaminants from entering an area. [[Laminar flow cabinet|Laminar flow hoods]] are used to exclude contaminants from sensitive processes in science, electronics and medicine. [[Air door|Air curtains]] are frequently used in commercial settings to keep heated or refrigerated air from passing through doorways. A [[laminar flow reactor]] (LFR) is a [[Chemical reactor|reactor]] that uses laminar flow to study chemical reactions and process mechanisms.

Normally on [[particleboard|particle]] or [[fiberboard]]s giving a good-looking and resistant surface for use as [[furniture]], [[decoration panel]]s and [[flooring]].&lt;ref name=PST&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= 108–111|chapter= 5|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
A [[laminate]] consists of a single or multiple layers, each having its own distinct function. The base is most often [[particleboard|particle]]- or [[fiberboard]]s, then some layers of absorbent [[kraft paper]]. The last layers are a ''decor paper'' covered with an ''overlay''. The lamination papers are covered with an inert [[resin]], often [[melamine]], which is cured to form a hard [[Composite material|composite]] with the structure of paper. The laminates may also have a [[wikt:lining#Noun|lining]] on the back side of ''laminating kraft'' to compensate for the tension created by the top side lamination.

Cheaper particle boards may have only a lining of laminating kraft to give surface washability and resistance to wear.

The ''decor paper'' can also be processed under heat and low/high pressure to create a melamine laminated sheet, that has several applications.

===Absorbent kraft paper===
The absorbent kraft paper is a normal [[kraft paper]] with controlled [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbency]], which means a high degree of [[porosity]]. It is made of clean low [[Kappa number|kappa]] hardwood kraft with good [[Uniformity (chemistry)|uniformity]]. The [[grammage]] is 80 - 120 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and normally 2-4 plies are used.&lt;ref name=PST /&gt;

===Decor paper===
The decor paper is the most critical of the lamination papers as it gives the visual appearance of the laminate. The impregnation [[resin]] and [[cellulose]] have about the same [[refraction index]] which means that the cellulose fibers of the [[paper]] appear as a shade and only the [[dyestuff]]s and [[pigment]]s are visible. Due to this the decor paper demands extreme cleanness and is produced only on small [[paper machine]]s with [[grammage]] 50 - 150 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=PST /&gt;

===Overlay===
The overlay paper have [[grammage]] of 18 – 50&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is made of pure [[cellulose]], thus it must be made of well delignified [[pulp (paper)|pulp]]. It becomes transparent after impregnation letting the appearance of the decor paper come through.

===Laminating kraft===
The laminating kraft have a [[grammage]] of 70 - 150 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is a smooth dense [[kraft paper]].&lt;ref name=PST /&gt;

The '''[[natural environment]]''' commonly referred to simply as the '''environment''', is all living and non-living things that occur [[nature|naturally]] on Earth or some part of it (e.g. the natural environment in a country). This includes complete [[ecological]] units that function as natural systems without massive human intervention, including all [[vegetation]], animals, microorganisms, rocks, atmosphere and [[natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]] that occur within their boundaries. And it includes universal natural [[natural resource|resources]] and [[physical phenomena]] that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as [[energy]], [[radiation]], [[electric charge]], and [[magnetism]], not originating from human activity.

The '''litter''' is a class of [[wheel]]less [[vehicle]]s, a type of [[human-powered transport]], for the transport of persons. Examples of litter vehicles include '''palki''' or '''पालकी''' ([[India]]), '''পালকি''' ([[Bengal]]), '''lectica''' ([[ancient Rome]]), '''kiệu''' ([[Vietnam]], 轎), '''sedan chair''' ([[United Kingdom|Britain]]), '''litera''' ([[Spain]]), '''palanquin''' ([[France]], [[India]]), '''jiao'''  ([[China]], 轎), '''liteira''' ([[Portugal]]), '''wo''' (วอ, Chinese style known as '''kiao''' เกี้ยว) ([[Thailand]]), '''gama''' ([[Korea]]), '''koshi''',  '''ren''', '''Norimono''', and '''[[kago]]''', ([[Japan]], 駕籠), '''tahtırevan''' ([[Turkey]]) and '''sankayan''' ([[Philippines]]). 

Smaller litters may take the form of open chairs or beds carried by two or more carriers, some being enclosed for protection from the elements. Larger litters, for example those of the Chinese emperors, may resemble small rooms upon a platform borne upon the shoulders of a dozen or more people. To most efficiently carry a litter, porters either place the [[carrying pole]]s directly upon their shoulders or use a [[yoke]] to transfer the load from the carrying poles to the shoulders.

A simple litter, often called a king carrier, consists of a [[Sling (furniture)|sling]] attached along its length to poles or stretched inside a frame. The poles or frame are carried by porters in front and behind. Such simple litters are common on battlefields and emergency situations, where terrain prohibits wheeled vehicles from carrying away the dead and wounded.

Litters can also be created by the expedient of the lashing of poles to a [[chair]]. Such litters, consisting of a simple cane chair with maybe an umbrella to ward off the elements and two stout bamboo poles, may still be found in Chinese mountain resorts such as the [[Huangshan Mountains]] to carry tourists along scenic paths and to viewing positions inaccessible by other means of transport.

A more luxurious version consists of a bed or couch, sometimes enclosed by [[curtain]]s, for the passenger or passengers to lie on. These are carried by at least two porters in equal numbers in front and behind, using wooden rails that pass through [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] on the sides of the couch. The largest and heaviest types would be carried by draught animals.

[[File:Senhora escravos 1860.jpg|thumb|250px|Lady in litter being carried by her slaves, [[São Paulo (state)|province of São Paulo]] in [[Brazil]], c. 1860.]]
Another form, commonly called a '''sedan chair''', consists of a [[chair]] or windowed [[cabin (ship)|cabin]] suitable for a single occupant, also carried by at least two porters in front and behind, using wooden rails that pass through brackets on the sides of the chair. These porters were known in [[London]] as "chairmen". These have been very rare since the 19th century, but such enclosed portable litters have been used as an [[elite]] form of [[transport]] for centuries, especially in cultures where women are kept secluded.

Sedan chairs, in use until the 19th century, were accompanied at night by [[link-boy]]s who carried torches.&lt;ref name="sedan"&gt;[http://www.thisisbath.com/ Bath Chronicle] (December 2, 2002) ''Sedan Chairs Ride Again.'' Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Where possible, the link boys escorted the fares to the chairmen, the passengers then being delivered to the door of their lodgings.&lt;ref name="sedan"/&gt; Several houses in [[Bath, Somerset]], [[England]] still have the link extinguishers on the exteriors, shaped like outsized candle snuffers&lt;ref name="sedan"/&gt; ([[:File:Link extinquisher.jpg|photo]]). In the 1970s, entrepreneur and Bathwick resident, John Cuningham, revived the sedan chair service business for a brief amount of time.&lt;ref name="sedan"/&gt;

==Antiquity==
In [[pharaoh|pharaonic]] [[Egypt]] and many oriental realms such as [[India]] and [[China]], the ruler and divinities (in the form of an idol like lord [[Krishna]]) were often transported in a litter in public, frequently in procession, as during state ceremonial or religious festivals.

The instructions for how to construct the [[Ark of the covenant#Construction and description|Ark of the Covenant]] in the [[Book of Exodus]] resembles a litter.

In [[Ancient Rome]], a litter called ''lectica'' or "sella" often carried members of the imperial family, as well as other dignitaries and other members of the rich elite, when not mounted on horseback.

The habit must have proven quite persistent, for the [[Third Council of Braga]] in 675 AD saw the need to order that bishops, when carrying the relics of martyrs in procession, must walk to the church, and not be carried in a chair, or litter, by deacons clothed in white.

In the Catholic Church, Popes were carried the same way in [[Sedia gestatoria]], which was replaced later by the [[Popemobile]].

A '''palanquin''' is a covered litter, usually for one passenger. It is carried by an even number of bearers (between two and eight, but most commonly four) on their shoulders, by means of a pole projecting fore and aft.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Palanquin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |chapter=Palanquin  |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Palanquin |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/exhibit/IAIy535Ha2n-Kw |title=1850's Palki (Palanquin) |publisher=Heritage Transport Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived from the Sanskrit ''palyanka'', meaning bed or couch. The Malay and Javanese form is  ''palangki'', in Hindi and Bengali, ''palki''. The Portuguese apparently added a nasal termination to these to make ''palanquim''. English adopted it from Portuguese as "palanquin".&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;

Palanquins vary in size and grandeur. The smallest and simplest, a cot or frame suspended by the four corners from a bamboo pole and borne by two bearers, is called a '''''doli'''''.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobson-Jobson313"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yule |first1=Henry |author-link1=Henry Yule |last2=Burnell |first2=Arthur Coke |author-link2=Arthur Coke Burnell |date=1903 |editor-last=Crooke |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Crooke |title=Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive |url=https://archive.org/stream/hobsonjobson029985mbp#page/n366/mode/1up |location=London |publisher=John Murray |page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger palanquins are rectangular wooden boxes eight feet long, four feet wide, and four feet high, with openings on either side screened by curtains or shutters.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; Interiors are furnished with bedding and pillows. Ornamentation reflects the social status of the traveller. The most ornate palanquins have [[lacquer]] paintwork and cast bronze finials at the ends of the poles. Designs include foliage, animals, and geometric patterns.&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt;

[[Ibn Batutta]] describes them as being "carried by eight men in two lots of four, who rest and carry in turn.  In the town there are always a number of these men standing in the bazaars and at the sultan's gate and at the gates of other persons for hire."  Those for "women are covered with silk curtains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=186,318}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Palanquins are mentioned in literature as early as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' (c. 250{{nbsp}}BC).&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt; Indian women of rank always travelled by palanquin.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; The conveyance proved popular with European residents in India, and was used extensively by them. [[Pietro Della Valle]], a 17th-century Italian traveller, wrote:

{{quote|text=Going in ''Palanchino'' in the Territories of the ''Portugals'' in ''India'' is prohibited to men, because indeed 'tis a thing too effeminate, nevertheless, as the ''Portugals'' are very little observers of their own Laws, they began at first to be tolerated upon occasion of the Rain, and for favours, or presents, and afterwards became so common that they are us'd almost by everybody throughout the whole year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Della Valle |first=Pietro |date=1892 |orig-year=First translated 1664 |editor-last=Grey |editor-first=Edward |translator-last=Havers |translator-first=George |title=The Travels of Pietro Della Valle in India from the old English translation of 1664 by G.

Being transported by palanquin was pleasant.&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt; Owning one and keeping the staff to power it was a luxury affordable even to low-paid clerks of the [[East India Company]]. Concerned that this indulgence led to neglect of business in favor of "rambling", in 1758 the Court of Directors of the company prohibited its junior clerks from purchasing and maintaining palanquins.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobson-Jobson659-661"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yule |first1=Henry |author-link1=Henry Yule |last2=Burnell |first2=Arthur Coke |author-link2=Arthur Coke Burnell |date=1903 |editor-last=Crooke |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Crooke |title=Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive |url=https://archive.org/stream/hobsonjobson029985mbp#page/n714/mode/1up |location=London |publisher=John Murray |page=659–661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the time of the British in India, ''dolis'' served as military ambulances, used to carry the wounded from the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Hobson-Jobson313" /&gt;

In the early 19th century, the most prevalent mode of long distance transport for the affluent was by palanquin.&lt;ref name="Hobson-Jobson659-661" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodd1859"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dodd |first=George |author-link=George Dodd (19th-century writer) |date=1859 |title=The History of the Indian Revolt, and of the Expeditions to Persia, China, and Japan, 1856-7-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post office could arrange, with a few days notice, relays of bearers to convey a traveller's palanquin between ''[[Stagecoach|stages]]'' or stations.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodd1859" /&gt; The distance between these in the government's ''[[dak (mail service)|dak]]'' ([[Hindi]]: "mail")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yule |first1=Henry |author-link1=Henry Yule |last2=Burnell |first2=Arthur Coke |author-link2=Arthur Coke Burnell |date=1903 |editor-last=Crooke |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Crooke |title=Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive |url=https://archive.org/stream/hobsonjobson029985mbp#page/n352/mode/1up |location=London |publisher=John Murray |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; system averaged about {{convert|10|mi}}, and could be covered in three hours. A relay's usual complement consisted of two torch-bearers, two luggage-porters, and eight palanquin-bearers who worked in gangs of four, although all eight might pitch in at steep sections. A passenger could travel straight through or break their journey at [[dak bungalow]]s located at certain stations.&lt;ref name="Dodd1859" /&gt;

Until the mid-19th century, "most people in Calcutta kept a plankin and a set of bearers",&lt;ref name="Hobson-Jobson659-661" /&gt; but they fell out of favor for long journeys as steamers, railways, and roads suitable for wheeled transport were developed.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt; By the beginning of the 20th century they were nearly "obsolete among the better class of Europeans".&lt;ref name="Hobson-Jobson659-661" /&gt; [[Pulled rickshaw|Rickshaws]], introduced in the 1930s, supplanted them for trips around town.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;

Modern use of the palanquin is limited to ceremonial occasions. A ''doli'' carries the bride in a [[Indian wedding|traditional wedding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anand |first=Jatin |date=21 November 2016 |title=Big, fat weddings getting trim |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/Big-fat-weddings-getting-trim/article16662665.ece |newspaper=The Hindu |access-date=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they may be used to carry religious images in Hindu processions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pattanaik |first=Devdutt |date=27 November 2016 |title=Pilgrim nation: The Goddess Meenakshi of Madurai |url=http://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/others/sunday-read/Pilgrim-nation-The-Goddess-Meenakshi-of-Madurai/articleshow/55639722.cms |newspaper=Mumbai Mirror |access-date=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In [[Han Dynasty|Han China]] the elite travelled in light bamboo seats supported on a carrier's back like a backpack. In the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]] and the Northern and Southern [[Song Dynasty|Song Dynasties]], wooden carriages on poles appear in painted landscape scrolls.

A commoner used a [[wooden]] or [[bamboo]] ''civil litter'' ({{zh|s=民轎|p=min2 jiao4}}), while the [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] class used an ''official litter'' ({{zh|s=官轎|p=guan1 jiao4|links=no}}) enclosed in silk curtains.

The chair with perhaps the greatest importance was the bridal chair. A traditional bride is carried to her [[wedding]] ceremony by a "shoulder carriage" ({{zh|s=肩輿|p=jiān yú|links=no}}), usually hired. These were [[lacquer]]ed in an auspicious shade of red, richly ornamented and [[gilding|gilded]], and were equipped with red silk curtains to screen the bride from onlookers.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;
[[Image:HK Sedanchair.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Public sedan chair in Hong Kong, ca 1870]]
Sedan chairs were once the only public conveyance in Hong Kong, filling the role of cabs. Chair stands were found at all hotels, wharves, and major crossroads. Public chairs were licensed, and charged according to tariffs which would be displayed inside.&lt;ref name=thomson&gt;[http://irc.aa.tufs.ac.jp/thomson/vol_1/mother/104.html A Hong Kong Sedan Chair], Illustrations of China and Its People, John Thomson 1837–1921, (London, 1873–1874)&lt;/ref&gt; Private chairs were an important marker of a person's status. Civil officers' status was denoted by the number of bearers attached to his chair.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt; Before [[Hong Kong]]'s [[Peak Tram]] went into service in 1888, wealthy residents of [[Victoria Peak|The Peak]] were carried on sedan chairs by [[coolies]] up the steep paths to their residence including [[Richard Graves MacDonnell|Sir Richard MacDonnell's]] (former [[Governor of Hong Kong]]) [[summer home]], where they could take advantage of the cooler climate. Since 1975 an annual sedan chair race has been held to benefit the [[Matilda International Hospital]] and commemorate the practice of earlier days.

===Korea===
In Korea, royalty and aristocrats were carried in wooden litters called '''gama'''. Gamas were primarily used by royalty and government officials. There were six types of gama, each assigned to different government official rankings. In traditional weddings, the bride and groom are carried to the ceremony in separate gamas. Because of the difficulties posed by the mountainous terrain of the Korean peninsula and the lack of paved roads, gamas were preferred over wheeled vehicles.

===Japan===
[[Image:Kisokaido08 Kumagai.jpg|thumb|200px|Kago in [[Ukiyo-e]] by [[Keisai Eisen]], print of Kumagai-shuku, part of [[The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō]] series]]
As the population of Japan increased, less and less land was available as grazing for the upkeep of horses. With the availability of horses restricted to martial uses, human powered transport became more important and prevalent.

'''[[Kago]]''' ([[Kanji]]: 駕籠, [[Hiragana]]: かご) were often used in Japan to transport the non-samurai citizen. '''[[Commons:Category:Norimono (Japanese Palaquin)|Norimono]]''' were used by the warrior class and nobility, most famously during the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] period when regional samurai were required to spend a part of the year in Edo (Tokyo) with their families, resulting in yearly migrations of the rich and powerful ([[Sankin-kōtai]]) to and from the capital along the central backbone road of Japan.

Somewhat similar in appearance to kago are the [[mikoshi|portable shrines]] that are used to carry the "god-body" ([[goshintai]]), the central totemic core normally found in the [[honden|most sacred area]] of [[Jinja (Shinto)|Shinto Shrines]], on a tour to and from a shrine during some [[matsuri|religious festivals]].

===Vietnam===

Traditional Vietnam employed two distinct types of litters, the ''cáng'' and the ''kiệu''. The ''cáng'' is a basic bamboo pole with the rider reclining in a [[hammock]]. More elaborate cáng had an adjustable woven bamboo shade to shelter the occupant. Dignitaries would have an entourage to carry parasols.

The ''kiệu'' resemble more of the sedan chair, enclosed with a fixed elaborately carved roof and doors. While the cáng has become obsolete, the ''kiệu'' is retained in certain traditional rituals a part of a temple devotional procession.

===Thailand===
[[File:Woh.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Elaborate royal Thai Wo, "พระวอสีวิกากาญจน์" (Phra Wo Si Wika Kan)]]
In Thailand, the royalty were also carried in wooden litters called '''wo''' ("พระวอ" Phra Wo, literally, "Royal Sedan") for large ceremonies. Wos were elaborately decorated litters that were delicately carved and colored by gold leaf. Stained glass is also used to decorate the litters. Presently, Royal Wos and carriages are only used for royal ceremonies in Thailand. They are exhibited in the Bangkok National Museum.

In traditional [[Javanese people|Javanese]] society, the generic palanquin or ''joli'' was a wicker chair with a canopy, attached to two poles, and borne on men's shoulders, and was available for hire to any paying customer.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlin, Jacob'' Missionary Journals and Letters: Written During Eleven Years' Residence and Travels Amongst the Chinese, Siamese, Javanese, Khassias, and Other Eastern Nations'' Nisbet: 1844: 384 pages, pp 251:&lt;/ref&gt; As a status marker, gilded throne-like palanquins, or ''jempana'', were originally reserved solely for royalty, and later co-opted by the Dutch, as a status marker: the more elaborate the palanquin, the higher the status of the owner. The ''joli'' was transported either by hired help, by nobles' peasants, or by slaves.&lt;br /&gt;
Historically, the palanquin of a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] king (''raja''), prince (''pangeran''), lord (''raden mas'') or other noble (''bangsawan'') was known as a ''jempana''; a more throne-like version was called a ''pangkem''. It was always part of a large military procession, with a yellow (the Javanese colour for royalty) square canopy. The ceremonial parasol (''payung'') was held above the palanquin, which was carried by a bearer behind and flanked by the most loyal bodyguards, usually about 12 men, with [[pike (weapon)|pikes]], [[sabre]]s, [[lance]]s, [[musket]]s, [[keris]] and a variety of disguised blades. In contrast, the canopy of the [[Sumatra]]n palanquin was oval-shaped and draped in white cloth; this was reflective of greater cultural permeation by Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Locher-Scholten |first1=Elsbeth |last2=Jackson |first2=Beverley |date=2004 |title=Sumatran sultanate and colonial state: Jambi and the rise of Dutch imperialism, 1830–1907 |publisher=SEAP Publications |page= |isbn=0-87727-736-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=February 2017}} Occasionally, a weapon or heirloom, such as an important keris or tombak, was given its own palanquin. In Hindu culture in [[Bali]] today, the tradition of using palanquins for auspicious statues, weapons or heirlooms continues, for funerals especially; in more elaborate rituals, a palanquin is used to bear the body, and is subsequently cremated along with the departed.

===Philippines===
In pre-colonial Philippines, litters were a way of transportation for the elite; [[Datu]]s or sovereign princes and their wives use a Sankayan or Sakayan, a wooden or bamboo throne called with elaborate and intricate carvings carried by their servants. Also among their retinue were umbrella-bearers, to shade the royalty and nobility from the intense heat.

Princes or princesses who were sequestered from the world were called [[Binukot]] or Binocot (“set apart”). A special type of royal, these individuals were forbidden to walk on the ground or be exposed to the general populace. When they needed to go anywhere, they were veiled and carried in a hammock or a basket-like litter similar to bird’s nests carried by their slaves. Longer journeys required that they be borne inside larger, covered palanquins with silk covers, with some taking the form of a miniature hut.

In Southern Ghana the Akan and the [[Ga–Dangme people|Ga-Dangme]] carry their chiefs and kings in palanquins when they appear in their state [[durbar (court)|durbar]]s. When used in such occasions these palanquins may be seen as a substitutes of a state coach in Europe or a horse used in Northern Ghana. The chiefs of the Ga (''mantsemei'') in the [[Greater Accra Region]] ([[Ghana]]) use also figurative palanquins which are built after a chief's family symbol or totem. But these day the [[figurative palanquin]]s are very seldom used. They are related with the [[fantasy coffin|figurative coffins]] which have become very popular among the Ga in the last 50 years. Since these figurative coffins were shown 1989 in the exhibition "Les magicians de la terre" in the Centre Pompidou in Paris they were shown in many art museums around the world.&lt;ref name="Tschumi2013"&gt;[[Regula Tschumi]]: ''The [[Figurative palanquin|Figurative Palanquins]] of the Ga.

===Angola===
From at least the 15th century until the 19th century, litters of varying types known as ''tipoye'' were used in the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] as a mode of transportation for the elites. Seat-style litters with a single pole along the back of the chair carried by two men (usually slaves) were topped with an umbrella. Lounge-style litters in the shape of a bed were used to move one to two people with a porter at each corner. Due to the tropical climate, horses were not native to the area nor could they survive very long once introduced by the Portuguese. Human portage was the only mode of transportation in the region and became highly adept with missionary accounts claiming the litter transporters could move at speeds 'as fast as post horses at the gallop'.&lt;ref&gt;George Balandier "Daily Life in the Kingdom of the Kongo" (1968), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RobertAdamDesignofaSedanChairforQueenCharlotte1775.jpg|thumb|left|200px| A sedan chair designed by [[Robert Adam]] for [[Queen Charlotte]], 1775.]]
Portuguese and Spanish navigators and colonisers encountered litters of various sorts in [[India]], [[Mexico]], and [[Peru]]. Such novelties, imported into [[Spain]], spread into [[France]] and then to [[United Kingdom |Britain]]. All the European names for these devices  ultimately derive from the root ''sed-'', as in Latin ''sedere'', "to sit," which gave rise to ''seda'' ("seat") and its diminutive ''sedula'' ("little seat"), the latter of which was contracted to ''sella'', the traditional Classical Latin name for a chair, including a carried chair.&lt;ref&gt;T. Atkinson Jenkins. "Origin of the Word Sedan", Hispanic Review, Vol. 1, No. 3 (July 1933), pp. 240-242.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A History of Madeira, 1821, P 107.jpg|thumb|Hammock litters with porters in [[Madeira]], Portugal, 1821]]
In Europe this mode of transportation met with instant success. [[Henry VIII of England]] (reigned 1509-1547) was carried around in a sedan chair—it took four strong chairmen to carry him towards the end of his life—but the expression "sedan chair" did not appear in print until 1615. It does not seem{{or|date=December 2018}} to take its name from the city of [[Sedan, France| Sedan]]. Trevor Fawcett notes (see link) that British travellers [[Fynes Moryson]] (in 1594) and [[John Evelyn]] (in 1644–5) remarked on the ''seggioli'' of [[Naples]] and [[Genoa]], which were chairs for public hire slung from poles and carried on the shoulders of two porters.

From the mid-17th century, visitors taking the waters at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] would be conveyed in a chair enclosed in baize curtains, especially if they had taken a heated bath and were going straight to bed to sweat. The curtains kept off a possibly fatal draft. These were not the proper sedan chairs "to carry the better sort of people in visits, or if sick or infirmed" ([[Celia Fiennes]]).{{cn|date=December 2018}} In the 17th and 18th centuries, the chairs stood in the main hall of a well-appointed city residence, where a lady could enter and be carried to her destination without setting foot in a filthy street. The [[neoclassicism |neoclassical]] sedan chair made for [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz |Queen Charlotte]] (Queen Consort from 1761 to 1818) remains at [[Buckingham Palace]].

By the mid-17th century, sedans for hire had become a common mode of transportation. London had "chairs" available for hire in 1634, each assigned a number and the chairmen licensed because the operation was a monopoly of a courtier of King [[Charles I of England |Charles I]]. Sedan chairs could pass in streets too narrow for a carriage and were meant{{by whom?|date=December 2018}} to alleviate the crush of coaches in London streets, an early instance of [[traffic congestion]]. A similar system  later operated in [[Scotland]]. In 1738 a fare system was established for Scottish sedans, and the regulations covering chairmen in Bath are reminiscent of the modern [[taxicab| Taxi]] Commission's rules. A trip within a city cost six pence and a day's rental was four shillings. A sedan was even used as an ambulance in Scotland's Royal Infirmary.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

Chairmen moved at a good clip. In Bath they had the right-of-way: pedestrians hearing "By your leave" behind them knew to flatten themselves against walls or railings as the chairmen hustled through. There were often{{quantify|date=December 2018}} disastrous accidents, upset chairs, and broken glass-paned windows.

=== In the Americas ===
The wealthy also used sedan chairs in the cities of colonial America.{{cn|date=December 2018}} And an ailing 81-year-old [[Benjamin Franklin]] travelled to meetings of the United States [[Constitutional Convention (United States) | Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 in a sedan chair.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = Of the fifty-five delegates, Franklin is by far the oldest at eighty-one. His health is not good. On the day the convention opened he was too sick to come. Later he was carried from his home to the meetings in a sedan chair - like a carriage without wheels, held aloft by four men. The bumpy ride of a carriage would have been too uncomfortable.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial practice===
In various colonies, litters of various types were maintained under native traditions, but often adopted by the white colonials as a new ruling and/or socio-economic elite, either for practical reasons (often comfortable modern transport was unavailable, e.g. for lack of decent roads) and/or as a status symbol. During the 17-18th centuries, palanquins (see above) were very popular among European traders in [[Bengal]], so much so that in 1758 an order was issued prohibiting their purchase by certain lower-ranking employees.&lt;ref&gt;koron{{better source|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The end of a tradition===
In Great Britain, in the early 19th century, the public sedan chair began to fall out of use, perhaps because streets were better paved or perhaps because of the rise of the more comfortable, companionable and affordable [[hackney carriage]]. In [[Glasgow]], the decline of the sedan chair is illustrated by licensing records which show twenty-seven sedan chairs in 1800, eighteen in 1817, and ten in 1828. During that same period the number of registered hackney carriages in Glasgow rose to one hundred and fifty.

===The traveling "silla" of Latin America===
{{Main|sillero}}
[[Image:SillaCatherwood.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|"Riding in a Silla", [[Chiapas]], c. 1840]]
A similar but simpler palanquin was used by the elite in parts of 18th- and 19th-century [[Latin America]]. Often simply called a ''silla'' (Spanish for seat or chair), it consisted of a simple wooden chair with an attached tumpline. The occupant sat in the chair, which was then affixed to the back of a single porter, with the [[tumpline]] supported by his head. The occupant thus faced backwards during travel. This style of palanquin was probably due to the steep terrain and rough or narrow roads unsuitable to European-style sedan chairs. Travellers by ''silla'' usually employed a number of porters, who would alternate carrying the occupant.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}} The porters were known as '''silleros''', '''cargueros''' or '''silleteros''' (sometimes translated as "saddle-men").

A chair borne on the back of a porter, almost identical to the ''silla'', is used in the mountains of China for ferrying older tourists and visitors up and down the mountain paths. One of these mountains where the ''silla'' is still used is the [[Huangshan Mountains]] of [[Anhui]] province in Eastern China.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

A '''living stump''' is created when a live [[tree]] is cut, burned, eaten, or infected, causing its cambium to die above the root system. Stumps are generally characterized as having a thin outer layer of living cells that surround a hollow central cavity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Donald W.|date=1963|title=Living Stumps of Tsuga canadensis (L.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11494">'''Low rolling resistance tires''' are designed to reduce the energy loss as a tire rolls, decreasing the required rolling effort &amp;mdash; and in the case of automotive applications, improving vehicle [[fuel efficiency]]. Approximately 5–15% of the fuel consumed by a typical car may be used to overcome [[rolling resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/fuel_economy_tires_light.html Low Rolling Resistance Tires] (Website). Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy. Retrieved on 2007-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 [[California Energy Commission]] (CEC) preliminary study estimated that adoption of low-rolling resistance tires could save 1.5–4.5% of all gasoline consumption, but that current data were also insufficient to compare safety and other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/reports/2003-01-31_600-03-001F-VOL1.PDF California State Fuel-Efficient Tire Report: Volume I] California Energy Commission, July 2003. Retrieved on 2007-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

A United States [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) study in 2009 found that if 2% of the replacement tires would reduce their rolling resistance by 5%, there would be 7.9 million gallons fuel and 76,000 metric tons of CO2 saved annually.  [[Image:Tire Rolling Resistance Torque Method.jpg|thumb|(SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) performed on new tires.]]

== Measuring rolling resistance in tires ==

Rolling resistance can be expressed by the rolling resistance coefficient (RRC or C&lt;sub&gt;rr&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. A lower coefficient means the tires will use less energy to travel a certain distance. The coefficient is mostly considered as independent of speed, but for precise calculations it is tabled at several speeds or an additional speed-dependent part is used. The [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests ([[SAE J1269]] and [[SAE J2452]]) are usually performed on new tires.

When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014.&lt;ref name="trb"&gt;[http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr286.pdf "Tires and Passenger Vehicle Fuel Economy: Informing Consumers, Improving Performance -- Special Report 286."], National Academy of Sciences, Transportation Research Board, 2006. Retrieved on 2007-08-11&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/AFM_tire_crr.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with coast-down tests. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds.
In 2009 The CEC used a rating called Rolling Resistance Force RRF.  RRF and RRC, rolling resistance coefficient are very similar. Difference is taking the RRF and dividing it by the load(weight) to get RRC. So a Michelin Harmony tire rated at 9.45 RRF at 1000 pounds load would be .0095 RRC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/transportation/tire_efficiency/documents/2009-04-08_workshop/presentations/5%20-%20Rating%20System%20Presentation%204-8-09%20-%20Tim%20Robinson.pdf California Energy Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310053854/http://www.energy.ca.gov/transportation/tire_efficiency/documents/2009-04-08_workshop/presentations/5%20-%20Rating%20System%20Presentation%204-8-09%20-%20Tim%20Robinson.pdf |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://saturn.lynnautorepair.com/2009%20Rolling%20Resistance%20Efficiency%20Ratings%20for%2077%20Tires 77 tires RRF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225065836/http://saturn.lynnautorepair.com/2009%20Rolling%20Resistance%20Efficiency%20Ratings%20for%2077%20Tires |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], [[Transport Canada]] tests will be conducted on a number of different tires mounted on 15 and 16-inch rims – the most common tire sizes in Canada – to determine how rolling resistance is influenced by vehicle size, tire width and profile. Results will be used to inform Canadians about the types of low rolling resistance tires available in Canada, and whether they can help reduce fuel consumption and pollutants from passenger vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/programs/environment-etv-lowresistance-eng-116.htm Transport Canada LRR Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117182144/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/programs/environment-etv-lowresistance-eng-116.htm |date=2011-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
SAE J2452 is a standard defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers to define the rolling resistance of tires.

The rolling resistance coefficient (RRC) indicates the amount of force required to overcome the hysteresis of the material as the tire rolls. Tire pressure, vehicle weight and velocity all play a role in how much force is lost to rolling resistance.

The basic model equation for SAE J2452 is:

        Rolling Resistance ( N / Lbs) = Pα x Zβ x (a + bxV + cxVxV)

where:

        P is the tire inflation pressure ( kPa / psi)
        Z is the applied load for vehicle weight ( N /Lbs)
        V is the vehicle speed ( km/h / mph)
        alpha, beta, a, b, c are the coefficients for the model.

The units of the coefficients are matched to the units used in the model, i.e. ( metric / Imperial)

This model is newer than SAE J1269 and provides more accuracy over a range of different vehicle loads (weight), tire pressures and vehicle speeds.

== Standard equipment ==

Because fuel efficiency is an important selling point for most hybrid vehicles, they are often equipped with low-rolling resistance tires. Electric vehicles are also often equipped with low-rolling resistance tires to maximize their range.

Auto manufacturers in the [[United States]] typically equip new vehicles with tires that have lower rolling resistance than their average after-market replacements, in order to meet [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.tdiclub.com/showthread.php?t=111009 Low Rolling Resistance Tires...Which is Best? - TDIClub Forums&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

These include [[Conti Contact]], [[Michelin Energy]], [[Bridgestone Ecopia]], and [[Goodyear Eagle LS]] tires. For Indian roads, [[Madras Rubber Factory]](MRF) offers the MRF ZSLK range of eco-friendly car tires with low rolling resistance.

== Available tires ==

Some tires available in 2003 ranked by coefficient from lowest (least wasteful), according to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] [[Transportation Research Board]] Special Report 286&lt;ref name="trb" /&gt; and the March 2003 [[Green Seal]] report on the topic.&lt;ref name="Green Seal Report"&gt;[http://www.greenseal.org/resources/reports/CGR_tire_rollingresistance.pdf Green Seal Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with conventional tires ==

Depending on the specific technique and materials used by the manufacturers, tire life may be as good as conventional tires, and traction may also be as good.&lt;ref name="trb" /&gt;

A [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] newsletter says "LRR tires also meet the same federal standards for treadwear, traction, and temperature resistance as regular tires." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/publications/earthwise/sp04-earthwise-low-rolling-resistance-tires.html Earthwise: Updates from the Union of Concerned Scientists, Volume 6, Number 2, Spring 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115212157/http://www.ucsusa.org/publications/earthwise/sp04-earthwise-low-rolling-resistance-tires.html |date=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older Low-rolling resistance tires may reduce ability to grip, especially when taking corners, and may also wear out more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/tm/displayStory.cfm?story_id=15009201|title=Rolling out the changes|date=Dec 2, 2009|accessdate=11 December 2009|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional Requirements ==
[[California]] has rolling resistance requirements that went into effect in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/01/03/california-has-low-resistance-tire-laws/ California has low-resistance tire laws - AutoblogGreen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was passed in 2003 and the standards and reporting requirements were finalized in 2007.

[[United Nations]] require a regulation too: "Tire Rolling Sound Emissions, Adhesion on Wet Surfaces, and Rolling Resistance | UN Regulation No. 117".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GAR {{!}} Tire Noise, Wet Adhesion, and Rolling Resistance|url = http://globalautoregs.com/rules/128|website = globalautoregs.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox meitnerium}}
'''Meitnerium''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Mt''' and [[atomic number]] 109. It is an extremely [[radioactive]] [[synthetic element]] (an element not found in nature, but can be created in a laboratory). The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a [[half-life]] of 7.6&amp;nbsp;seconds, although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may have a longer half-life of 67&amp;nbsp;seconds. The [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] near [[Darmstadt]], Germany, first created this element in 1982. It is named after [[Lise Meitner]].

In the [[periodic table]], meitnerium is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7 element|7th period]] and is placed in the [[group 9 element]]s, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[iridium]] in group 9 as the seventh member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Meitnerium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, [[cobalt]], [[rhodium]], and iridium.

==History==
[[File:Lise Meitner (1878-1968), lecturing at Catholic University, Washington, D.C., 1946.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Meitnerium was named after the physicist [[Lise Meitner]], one of the discoverers of nuclear fission.]]

===Discovery===
Meitnerium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first synthesized]] on August 29, 1982 by a German research team led by [[Peter Armbruster]] and [[Gottfried Münzenberg]] at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung|Institute for Heavy Ion Research]] (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) in [[Darmstadt]].&lt;ref name=82Mu01&gt;{{cite journal|title=Observation of one correlated α-decay in the reaction &lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;Fe on &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi→&lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;109|doi=10.1007/BF01420157|year=1982|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik A|volume=309|issue=1|pages=89|last1=Münzenberg|first1=G.|last2=Armbruster|first2=P.|last3=Heßberger|first3=F.

===Naming===
[[File:Bohrium hassium meitnerium ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|Naming ceremony conducted at the GSI on 7 September 1992 for the namings of elements 107, 108, and 109 as nielsbohrium, hassium, and meitnerium]]
Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], meitnerium should be known as ''eka-[[iridium]]''. In 1979, during the [[Transfermium Wars]] (but before the synthesis of meitnerium), IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ''unnilennium'' (with the corresponding symbol of ''Une''),&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1979|volume=51|pages=381–384|title=Recommendations for the naming of elements of atomic numbers greater than 100|doi=10.1351/pac197951020381|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[systematic element name]] as a [[placeholder name|placeholder]], until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it "element 109", with the symbol of ''E109'', ''(109)'' or even simply ''109'', or used the proposed name "meitnerium".&lt;ref name="Haire"/&gt;

The naming of meitnerium was discussed in the [[Transfermium Wars|element naming controversy]] regarding the names of elements 104 to 109, but ''meitnerium'' was the only proposal and thus was never disputed.&lt;ref name="IUPAC94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IUPAC97"/&gt; The name ''meitnerium'' (Mt) was suggested by the GSI team in September 1992 in honor of the Austrian physicist [[Lise Meitner]], a co-discoverer of [[protactinium]] (with [[Otto Hahn]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Isotopes==
{{For|a detailed list of information on the discovery of each individual meitnerium isotope|Isotopes of meitnerium}}
Meitnerium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of meitnerium have been reported with atomic masses 266, 268, 270, and 274–278, two of which, meitnerium-268 and meitnerium-270, have known but unconfirmed [[metastable state]]s. A ninth isotope with atomic mass 282 is unconfirmed. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, although some undergo spontaneous fission.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

All meitnerium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter. The most stable known meitnerium isotope, &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Mt, is also the heaviest known; it has a half-life of 7.6&amp;nbsp;seconds. (The unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;Mt is yet heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of 67&amp;nbsp;seconds.) A metastable [[nuclear isomer]], &lt;sup&gt;270m&lt;/sup&gt;Mt, has been reported to also have a half-life of over a second. The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;276&lt;/sup&gt;Mt and &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Mt have half-lives of 0.72 and 0.44&amp;nbsp;seconds respectively.

==Predicted properties==
===Chemical===
Meitnerium is the seventh member of the 6d series of [[transition metals]]. Since element 112 ([[copernicium]]) has been shown to be a [[group 12 element|group 12]] metal, it is expected that all the elements from [[rutherfordium|104]] to [[roentgenium|111]] would continue a fourth transition metal series, with meitnerium as part of the [[platinum group metal]]s.&lt;ref name="DoiX" /&gt; Calculations on its [[ionization potential]]s and [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] are similar to that of its lighter homologue [[iridium]], thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other [[group 9 element]]s, [[cobalt]], [[rhodium]], and iridium.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

Prediction of the probable chemical properties of meitnerium has not received much attention recently. Meitnerium is expected to be a [[noble metal]]. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in [[aqueous solution]]s. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in [IrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) and the [MtO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation, although [IrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds.&lt;ref name="Mt(IX)"/&gt; The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state.&lt;ref name="MtX4"/&gt; It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to [[darmstadtium]] (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

===Physical and atomic===
Meitnerium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[face-centered cubic]] [[crystal structure]], similarly to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] iridium.&lt;ref name=bcc/&gt; It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 37.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which would be the second-highest of any of the 118 known elements, second only to that predicted for its neighbor [[hassium]] (41&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of only 22.61&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This results from meitnerium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough meitnerium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; Meitnerium is also predicted to be [[paramagnetic]].&lt;ref name="paramagnetic"/&gt;

Theoreticians have predicted the covalent radius of meitnerium to be 6 to 10&amp;nbsp;pm larger than that of iridium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/chem.200901472|title=Molecular Double-Bond Covalent Radii for Elements Li—E112|date=2009|last1=Pyykkö |first1=Pekka|last2=Atsumi|first2=Michiko|journal=Chemistry: A European Journal|volume=15|issue=46|pages=12770}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atomic radius of meitnerium is expected to be around 128&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt;

==Experimental chemistry==

Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the meitnerium isotopes and have automated systems experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of meitnerium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements; some of the separation techniques used for [[bohrium]] and [[hassium]] could be reused.

The [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] attempted to synthesize the isotope &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Mt in 2002–2003 for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium because it was expected that it might be more stable than the isotopes around it as it has 162 [[neutron]]s, a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] for deformed nuclei; its half-life was predicted to be a few seconds, long enough for a chemical investigation.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smolańczuk |first1=R. |date=1997 |journal=Phys.

&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[physical chemist]] famous for his work with [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], over a period of 25 years, in measuring [[Heat of combustion|reaction heat]] of chemical compounds and determining their corresponding [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. Together, their 1923 textbook ''"Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances"'' became a classic work in the field of [[chemical thermodynamics]].

In 1932, Merle Randall authored two scientific papers with [[Mikkel Frandsen]]: ''“The [[Standard electrode potential|Standard Electrode Potential]] of Iron and the [[Activity coefficient|Activity Coefficient]] of [[Ferrous chloride|Ferrous Chloride]],”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The [[standard electrode potential]] of [[iron]] and the [[activity coefficient]] of [[ferrous chloride]]|author1=Merle Randall |author2=Mikkel Frandsen |journal=J.

==Education==
Randall completed his Ph.D. at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1912 with a dissertation on ''“Studies in Free Energy”''.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Merle (1912). ''Studies in Free Energy''. Ph.D. Thesis/dissertation — Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related==
Based on work by [[Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]], it was known that chemical reactions proceeded to an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] determined by the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the substances taking part. Using this theory, Gilbert Lewis spent 25 years determining free energies of various substances. In 1923, he and Randall published the results of this study and formalizing chemical thermodynamics.

According to the Belgian thermodynamicist [[Ilya Prigogine]], their influential 1923 textbook led to the replacement of the term “[[chemical affinity|affinity]]” by the term “[[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]” in much of the English-speaking world.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''meta''-Diethynylbenzene dianion}}
The '''''meta''-diethynylbenzene dianion''' is a structural isomer of the ''ortho''-diethynylbenzene dianion. The ''meta''-diethynylbenzene dianion is not as strong as [[ortho-Diethynylbenzene dianion|''ortho''-diethynylbenzene dianion]], but it is still the second-strongest [[superbase]]. Like the ''ortho''-diethynylbenzene dianion, the ''meta''-diethynylbenzene dianion exists in the gas state, contrary to the other bases and superbases which exist in the solution state. In the ''meta''-diethynylbenzene dianion, the two negatively charged [[ethynyl]] (−{{chem|C|2|H|2|-}}) groups are bonded to the first and third carbon atoms of the [[benzene ring]]. But in the ''ortho''-diethynylbenzene dianion, the ethynyl groups are bonded to the first and second carbon atoms of the benzene ring. Like Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion, Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion has no known use.

== Synthesis ==
 
;Step 1: A sample of ''meta''-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is taken.

;Step 2: In this next step, the parent compound is subjected through [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI) and consequently, loses two Hydrogen atoms and therefore, acquires a charge of −2. The new compound's chemical formula is  [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

;Step 3: The ionized parent compound [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is subjected to [[collision-induced dissociation]] (CID), because of which, one of the carboxylate anion loses a Carbon dioxide molecule to become  [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.

;Step 4: The ''meta''-[C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  compound is again subjected to collision-induced dissociation, because of which, the other carboxylate anion loses the other Carbon dioxide molecule and becomes ''meta''-[C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

;Step 5: Therefore, the ''meta-''diethynylbenzene dianion [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is formed, having lost, in total, two hydrogen atoms and two molecules of [[carbon dioxide]].

The same process can generate either ''ortho''-diethynylbenzene dianion and Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion depending on which isomer of the original compound is used.

===Summary===
: &lt;chem&gt;\overset{}{C6H4(C3HO2)2 -&gt;[\ce{ESI}][] [C6H4(C3O2)2]^{2-} -&gt;[\ce{CID}][] [C6H4(C5O2)]^{2-} -&gt;[\ce{CID}][] [C6H4(C2)2]^{2-}}&lt;/chem&gt;

[[File:Pompey's Pillar at Alexandria (1911) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|Pompey's Pillar in 1911.]]
'''Pompey's Pillar''' ({{lang-ar|عمود السواري
|}}) is a [[Roman triumphal column]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]],  the largest of its type constructed outside the [[Roman Empire|imperial]] capitals of [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]],&lt;ref name="Thiel 2006, 251–254"&gt;Thiel 2006, pp. 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; located at the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]]. The only known free-standing column in [[Roman Egypt]] which was not composed of [[column|drums]],&lt;ref name="Thiel 2006, 251–254"/&gt; it is one of the [[List of ancient monoliths|largest ancient monoliths]] and one of the [[List of largest monoliths in the world|largest monolithic columns ever erected]].

==Construction==
The [[monolithic column shaft]] measures 20.46 m in height with a diameter of 2.71 m at its base.&lt;ref name="Adam 1977, 50f."&gt;Adam 1977, pp. 50f.&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of the single piece of red [[Aswan]] [[granite]] is estimated at 285 [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name="Adam 1977, 50f."/&gt; The column is 26.85 m high including its base and [[Capital (architecture)|capital]].&lt;ref name="Adam 1977, 50f."/&gt; Other authors give slightly deviating dimensions.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;According to Thiel, the single-piece column is 20.75 m high (28.7 m including base and [[pedestal]]), with a diameter of 2.7–2.8 m (pp. 252f.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Erroneously dated to the time of [[Pompey]], the [[Corinthian column]] was actually built in 297 AD, commemorating the victory of [[Roman emperor]] [[Diocletian]] over an Alexandrian revolt.&lt;ref name="Adam 1977, 50f."/&gt;

==Anecdotes==
Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] visited Alexandria in 1326 AD. He describes the pillar and recounts the tale of an archer who shot an arrow tied to a string over the column. This enabled him to pull a rope tied to the string over the pillar and secure it on the other side in order to climb over to the top of the pillar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7470/|title=Ibn Battuta’s Rihla|date=1 January 1904|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early 1803, British commander John Shortland of [[Hector (1784)|HMS ''Pandour'']] flew a kite over Pompey's Pillar. This enabled him to get ropes over it, and then a rope ladder. On February 2, he and John White, ''Pandour{{'}}''s Master, climbed it. When they got to the top they displayed the Union Jack, drank a toast to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], and gave three cheers. Four days later they climbed the pillar again, erected a staff, fixed a weather vane, ate a beef steak, and again toasted the king.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 27, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pseudocapacitance''' is the [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] storage of electricity in an [[Supercapacitor|electrochemical capacitor]] ([[Pseudocapacitor]]).

Faradaic pseudocapacitance only occurs together with static [[double-layer capacitance]]. Pseudocapacitance and double-layer capacitance both contribute inseparable to the total capacitance value.

The amount of pseudocapacitance depends on the surface area, material and structure of the electrodes. Pseudocapacitance may contribute more capacitance than double-layer capacitance for the same surface area by 100x.&lt;ref name="conway1" /&gt;

The amount of [[electric charge]] stored in a pseudocapacitance is linearly proportional to the applied [[voltage]]. The unit of pseudocapacitance is [[farad]].

== Redox reactions ==

=== Differences ===

==== Rechargeable batteries ====
Redox reactions in [[Rechargeable battery|batteries]] with faradaic charge-transfer between an electrolyte and the surface of an electrode were characterized decades ago. These [[chemical process]]es are associated with [[chemical reaction]]s of the electrode materials usually with attendant [[Phase transition|phase changes]]. Although these chemical processes are relatively reversible, battery charge/discharge cycles often irreversibly produce unreversed chemical reaction products of the reagents. Accordingly, the cycle-life of rechargeable batteries is usually limited. Further, the reaction products lower [[power density]].  Additionally, the chemical processes are relatively slow, extending charge/discharge times.

==== Electro-chemical capacitors ====
[[File:Electric double-layer (BMD model) NT.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Schematic representation of a double layer on an electrode (BMD) model. 1. Inner Helmholtz plane, (IHP), 2. Outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), 3. Diffuse layer, 4. Solvated ions (cations) 5. Specifically adsorbed ions (redox ion, which contributes to the pseudocapacitance), 6. Molecules of the electrolyte solvent]]

A fundamental difference between redox reactions in batteries and in electrochemical capacitors (supercapacitors) is that in the latter, the reactions are a very fast sequence of reversible processes with electron transfer without any phase changes of the electrode molecules. They do not involve making or breaking [[chemical bond]]s. The [[Solvation|de-solvated]] atoms or ions contributing the pseudocapacitance simply cling&lt;ref name="Garthwaite" /&gt; to the atomic structure of the electrode and charges are distributed on surfaces by physical [[adsorption]] processes. Compared with batteries, supercapacitor faradaic processes are much faster and more stable over time, because they leave only traces of reaction products. Despite the reduced amount of these products, they cause capacitance degradation. This behavior is the essence of pseudocapacitance.

Pseudocapacitive processes lead to a charge-dependent, linear capacitive behavior, as well as the accomplishment of non-faradaic double-layer capacitance in contrast to batteries, which have a nearly charge-independent behavior. The amount of pseudocapacitance depends on the surface area, material and structure of the electrodes. The pseudocapacitance may exceed the value of double-layer capacitance for the same surface area by 100x.&lt;ref name="conway1" /&gt;

== Capacitance functionality ==
[[File:Intercalactionrp.png|thumb|right|Intercalated metal atoms between planar graphite layers]]
[[File:Figure5CDC.jpg|thumb|right|Confinement of solvated ions in pores, such as those present in carbide-derived carbon (CDC). As the pore size approaches the size of the solvation shell, the solvent molecules are removed, resulting in larger ionic packing density and increased charge storage capability.]]Applying a voltage at the capacitor terminals moves the polarized [[ion]]s or charged atoms in the electrolyte to the opposite polarized electrode. Between the surfaces of the electrodes and the adjacent electrolyte an electric [[Double layer (interfacial)|double-layer]] forms. One layer of ions on the electrode surface and the second layer of adjacent polarized and solvated ions in the electrolyte move to the opposite polarized electrode. The two ion layers are separated by a single layer of electrolyte molecules. Between the two layers, a [[Static electricity|static]] [[electric field]] forms that results in [[double-layer capacitance]]. Accompanied by the electric double-layer, some [[Solvation|de-solvated]] electrolyte ions pervade the separating solvent layer and are [[Adsorbtion|adsorbed]] by the electrode's surface atoms. They are specifically adsorbed and deliver their charge to the electrode. In other words, the ions in the electrolyte within the Helmholtz double-layer also act as [[electron donor]]s and transfer electrons to the electrode atoms, resulting in a [[faradaic current]]. This faradaic [[Charge-transfer complex|charge transfer]], originated by a fast sequence of reversible [[redox]] reactions, [[Capacitive deionization|electrosorptions]] or [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] processes between electrolyte and the electrode surface is called pseudocapacitance.&lt;ref name="Conway-Pell" /&gt;

Depending on the electrode's structure or surface material, pseudocapacitance can originate when specifically adsorbed [[ion]]s pervade the double-layer, proceeding in several one-[[electron]] stages. The electrons involved in the faradaic processes are transferred to or from the electrode's [[Valence electron|valence-electron]] states ([[Atomic orbital|orbitals]]) and flow through the external circuit to the opposite electrode where a second double-layer with an equal number of opposite-charged ions forms. The electrons remain in the strongly ionized and electrode surface's "electron hungry" transition-metal ions and are not transferred to the adsorbed ions. This kind of pseudocapacitance has a linear function within narrow limits and is determined by the [[Electric potential|potential-dependent]] degree of surface coverage of the adsorbed anions. The storage capacity of the pseudocapacitance is limited by the finite quantity of [[reagent]] or of available surface.

Systems that give rise to pseudocapacitance:&lt;ref name="Conway-Pell" /&gt;
* [[Redox]] system: Ox + ze‾ ⇌ Red
* [[Intercalation (chemistry)|Intercalation]] system: {{chem|Li|+}} in "{{chem|Ma|2}}"
* [[Capacitive deionization|Electrosorption]], underpotential deposition of metal adatoms or H: {{chem|M|+}} + ze‾ + S ⇌ SM  or {{chem|H|+}} + e‾ + S ⇌ SH (S = surface lattice sites)

All three types of electrochemical processes have appeared in supercapacitors.&lt;ref name="Conway-Pell"&gt;B.E. Conway, W.G. Pell, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/tvbpuql70x5uetay/ Double-layer and pseudocapacitance types of electrochemical capacitors and their applications to the development of hybrid components]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway-Birss"&gt;B. E. Conway, V. Birss, J. Wojtowicz, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775396024743 The role and the utilization of pseudocapacitance for energy storage by supercapacitors], Journal of Power Sources, Volume 66, Issues 1–2, May–June 1997, Pages 1–14&lt;/ref&gt;

When discharging pseudocapacitance, the charge transfer is reversed and the ions or atoms leave the double-layer and spread throughout the electrolyte.

=== Materials ===

Electrodes' ability to produce pseudocapacitance strongly depends on the electrode materials' chemical affinity to the ions adsorbed on the electrode surface as well as on the electrode pore structure and dimension. Materials exhibiting redox behavior for use as pseudocapacitor electrodes are [[transition-metal oxides]] inserted by doping in the conductive electrode material such as active carbon, as well as conducting polymers such as [[polyaniline]] or derivatives of [[polythiophene]] covering the electrode material.

==== Transition metal oxides/sulfides ====

These materials provide high pseudocapacitance and were thoroughly studied by Conway.&lt;ref name="conway1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway Transition"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conway |first=B. E. |title=Transition from ‘Supercapacitor’ to ‘Battery’ Behavior in Electrochemical Energy Storage |journal=J. Electrochem. Soc. |volume=138 |number=6 |date=May 1991 |pages=1539–1548 |doi=10.1149/1.2085829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many oxides of transition metals like [[ruthenium]] ({{chem|RuO|2}}), [[iridium]] ({{chem|IrO|2}}), [[iron]] ({{chem|Fe|3|O|4}}), [[manganese]] ({{chem|MnO|2}}) or sulfides such as [[titanium sulfide]] ({{chem|TiS|2}}) or their combinations generate faradaic electron–transferring reactions with low conducting resistance.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jayalakshmi, K. Balasubramanian, Simple Capacitors to Supercapacitors - An Overview, Int. J. Electrochem. Sci., 3 (2008) 1196 – 1217, [http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol3/3111196.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruthenium dioxide]] ({{chem|RuO|2}}) in combination with [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}) electrolyte provides one of the best examples of pseudocapacitance, with a charge/discharge over a window of about 1.2&amp;nbsp;V per electrode. Furthermore, the reversibility on these transition metal electrodes is excellent, with a cycle life of more than several hundred-thousand cycles. Pseudocapacitance originates from a coupled, reversible redox reaction with several oxidation steps with overlapping potential. The electrons mostly come from the electrode's [[valence orbital]]s. The electron transfer reaction is very fast and can be accompanied with high currents.

The electron transfer reaction takes place according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RuO_2 + xH^+ + xe^- \leftrightarrow RuO_{2-x}(OH)_x}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le 2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon-Gogotsi"&gt;P. Simon, Y.Gogotsi,  [http://www.ifc.dicp.ac.cn/library/cailiao/pdf1/Materials%20for%20electrochemical%20capacitors.pdf Materials for electrochemical capacitors,  nature materials], VOL 7, NOVEMBER 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During charge and discharge, {{chem|H|+}} ([[proton]]s) are incorporated into or removed from the {{chem|RuO|2}} [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]], which generates storage of electrical energy without chemical transformation. The OH groups are deposited as a molecular layer on the electrode surface and remain in the region of the Helmholtz layer. Since the measurable voltage from the redox reaction is proportional to the charged state, the reaction behaves like a capacitor rather than a battery, whose voltage is largely independent of the state of charge.

==== Conducting polymers ====
Another type of material with a high amount of pseudocapacitance is electron-conducting polymers. [[Conductive polymer]] such as [[polyaniline]], [[polythiophene]], [[polypyrrole]] and [[polyacetylene]] have a lower reversibility of the redox processes involving faradaic charge transfer than transition metal oxides, and suffer from a limited stability during cycling.&lt;ref name="Volfkovich"&gt;Yu.M. Volfkovich, A.A. Mikhailin, D.A. Bograchev, V.E. Sosenkin and V.S. Bagotsky, [http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/26963/InTech-Studies_of_supercapacitor_carbon_electrodes_with_high_pseudocapacitance.pdf Studies of Supercapacitor Carbon Electrodes with High Pseudocapacitance], A. N. Frumkin Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia, Dr. Ujjal Kumar Sur (Ed.), {{ISBN|978-953-307-830-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such electrodes employ electrochemical doping or dedoping of the polymers with anions and cations. Highest capacitance and power density are achieved with a n/p-type polymer configuration, with one negatively charged (n-doped) and one positively charged (p-doped) electrode.

===Structure===
Pseudocapacitance may originate from the electrode structure, especially from the material pore size. The use of [[carbide-derived carbon]]s (CDCs) or [[carbon nanotube]]s (CNTs) as electrodes provides a network of small pores formed by nanotube entanglement. These [[nanoporous]] materials have diameters in the range of &lt;2&amp;nbsp;nm that can be referred to as intercalated pores. Solvated ions in the electrolyte are unable to enter these small pores, but de-solvated ions that have reduced their ion dimensions are able to enter, resulting in larger ionic packing density and increased charge storage. The tailored sizes of pores in nano-structured carbon electrodes can maximize ion confinement, increasing specific capacitance by faradaic {{chem|H|2}} adsorption treatment. Occupation of these pores by de-solvated ions from the electrolyte solution occurs according to (faradaic) intercalation.&lt;ref name="Pandolfo"&gt;A.G. Pandolfo,  A.F.

===Verification===
[[File:Voltagram-Engl.png|thumb|right|200px|A cyclic voltammogram shows the fundamental difference of the current curves between static capacitors and pseudocapacitors]]

Pseudocapacitance properties can be expressed in a [[Cyclic voltammetry|cyclic voltammogram]]. For an ideal double-layer capacitor, the current flow is reversed immediately upon reversing the potential yielding a rectangular-shaped voltammogram, with a current independent of the electrode potential. For double-layer capacitors with resistive losses, the shape changes to a [[parallelogram]]. In faradaic electrodes the electrical charge stored in the capacitor is strongly dependent on the potential, therefore, the voltammetry characteristics deviate from the parallelogram due to a delay while reversing the potential, ultimately coming from kinetic charging processes.&lt;ref name="Frackowiak1"&gt;Elzbieta Frackowiak, Francois Beguin, PERGAMON, Carbon 39 (2001) 937–950, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622300001834 Carbon materials for the electrochemical storage of energy in Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/36546/why-does-an-ideal-capacitor-give-rise-to-a-rectangular-cyclic-voltammogram-cv Why does an ideal capacitor give rise to a rectangular cyclic voltammogram]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Renewable Fuels Association''' (RFA) represents the ethanol industry promoting policies, regulations, and research and development initiatives that will lead to the increased production and use of [[ethanol fuel]]. First organized in 1981, RFA serves as a voice of advocacy for the ethanol industry, providing research data and industry analysis to its members, to the public via the media, to the [[United States Congress]], as well as to related federal and state agencies.

== Organization ==
RFA's chairman is Neil Koehler of Pacific Ethanol, Inc. and the vice-chairman is Jeanne McCaherty of Guardian Energy, LLC.&lt;ref name=leadership /&gt; The RFA has offices in both St. Louis, Missouri and Washington, the District of Columbia.

===Staff===

==== Geoff Cooper ====
Geoff Cooper is RFA’s President and CEO, a position he’s held since October 2018.&lt;ref name=staff /&gt; Previously he served as RFA Executive Vice President.  In addition to overseeing market analysis and policy research, he provides regulatory support and strategic planning for the association and its members. Geoff also focuses on issues related to lifecycle analysis, sustainability and ethanol co-products. Prior to joining RFA, Geoff served as Director of Ethanol Programs for the [[National Corn Growers Association]]. In this role, he led research and promotional efforts to increase the production and use of corn-based ethanol. Previously, Geoff served as a Captain in the U.S. Army, specializing in bulk petroleum supply and logistics. A Wyoming native, Geoff graduated from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. He earned his master’s degree at Webster University in St. Louis.

==Issues==

===Renewable Volume Obligations (RVO)===
The RFA argues that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) abused its waiver authority by setting RVOs lower than the statutory minimums. They say Congress clearly intended for the law to apply according to supply that could be available rather than demand. They contend that the EPA has conflated the two. Under the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] (EISA), the statutory standard for 2017 is 24 billion gallons. The EPA only set an RVO of 18.8 billion gallons of biofuel for 2017. This was up from 18.4 billion gallons in 2016. Ethanol supporters and oil companies alike criticized this target.&lt;ref name="Industry"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dinneen |first=Bob |date=22 May 2016 |title=It's Time for the RFS to get ‘Back on Track’ |url=http://www.ethanolproducer.com/articles/13328/its-time-for-the-rfs-to-get-undefinedback-on-trackundefined |newspaper=Ethanol Producer Magazine |location=United States |access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green jobs===
The RFA considers employment in the ethanol industry to be a primary example of "green jobs." The 2010 US Ethanol Industry Salary Survey determined that employees about 500,000 people with 75% of such workers making more than $50,000 per year and 99% receiving health benefits. The RFA points out that these jobs, heavily concentrated in rural areas, provide a much-needed economic boost to otherwise depressed places.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-dinneen/ethanol-industry-green-jo_b_437607.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===E85===
{{As of|2014|12}}, almost half of new vehicles produced by [[Chrysler]], [[Ford]], and [[General Motors]] are [[flex-fuel]], meaning roughly one-quarter of all new vehicles sold by 2015 are capable of using up to E85. However, obstacles to widespread use of E85 fuel remain. A 2014 analysis by the Renewable Fuels Association found that oil companies prevent or discourage affiliated retailers from selling E85 through rigid franchise and branding agreements, restrictive supply contracts, and other tactics. The report showed independent retailers are five times more likely to offer E85 than retailers carrying an oil company brand.&lt;ref name=RFAOutlook2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/c5088b8e8e6b427bb3_cwm626ws2.pdf |title=Going Global - 2015 Ehtanol Industry Outlook |author=Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) |publisher=RFA |date=2015|accessdate=2015-11-22}} ''See page 22.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committees ==
The RFA convenes four concern-specific committees.
* Technical Committee
: focuses heavily on fuel specifications and standards such as ASTM International, National Conference of Weights and Measures, ISO, Canadian General Standards Board, and other international fuel requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethanolrfa.org/pages/committees#TC RFA TC Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental Compliance Committee
: examines and provides guidance on the myriad of environmental regulations pertaining to ethanol production facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethanolrfa.org/pages/committees#EC RFA Committee ECC]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Co-Products Committee
: focuses on issues relevant to all ethanol co-products, from research and educational programs to regulatory issues and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethanolrfa.org/pages/committees#MC RFA Committee CPC]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plant and Employee Safety Committee
: works with federal, state and local governments as well as industry partners, to bring attention to hazardous materials regulations and other safety requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethanolrfa.org/pages/committees#PESC RFA Committee PESC]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arctic ice.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Broken pieces of Arctic sea ice with a snow cover.]]
'''Sea ice''' arises as [[seawater]] freezes. Because [[ice]] is less [[density|dense]] than water, it floats on the ocean's surface (as does [[fresh water]] ice, which has an even lower density). Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth's surface and about 12% of the world's oceans.&lt;ref name="Wadhams"&gt;{{cite web |title= How Does Arctic Sea Ice Form and Decay? |publisher= NOAA |work= Arctic theme page |url= http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_wadhams.html |last=Wadhams |first=Peter |date=1 Jan 2003 |accessdate=25 April 2005 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306040652/http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_wadhams.html |archive-date=2005-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite book |first=Willy F. |last=Weeks |title=On Sea Ice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9S55O6WzuL8C&amp;pg=PA2 |date=2010 |publisher=University of Alaska Press |isbn=978-1-60223-101-6 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shokr&amp;Sinha"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shokr |first1=Mohammed |first2=Nirmal |last2=Sinha |title=Sea Ice - Physics and Remote Sensing |date=2015 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-1119027898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the world's sea ice is enclosed within the polar ice packs in the Earth's [[polar region]]s: the [[Arctic ice pack]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Antarctic ice pack]] of the [[Southern Ocean]]. Polar packs undergo a significant yearly cycling in surface extent, a natural process upon which depends the [[Arctic ecology]], including the [[Arctic sea ice ecology and history|ocean's ecosystems]]. Due to the action of winds, currents and temperature fluctuations, sea ice is very dynamic, leading to a wide variety of ice types and features. Sea ice may be contrasted with [[iceberg]]s, which are chunks of [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] or [[glacier]]s that [[Ice calving|calve]] into the ocean. Depending on location, sea ice expanses may also incorporate icebergs.

== General features and dynamics ==
[[File:Sea ice Drawing General features.svg|thumb|upright=2|Hypothetical sea ice dynamics scenario showing some of the most common sea ice features.]]
Sea ice does not simply grow and melt. During its lifespan, it is very dynamic. Due to the combined action of winds, currents, water temperature, and air temperature fluctuations, sea ice expanses typically undergo a significant amount of deformation. Sea ice is classified according to whether or not it is able to drift, and according to its age.

=== Fast ice versus drift (or pack) ice ===
Sea ice can be classified according to whether or not it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline (or between [[shoal]]s or to grounded [[iceberg]]s). If attached, it is called landfast ice, or more often, [[fast ice]] (from ''fastened''). Alternatively, and unlike fast ice, [[drift ice]] occurs further offshore in very wide areas, and encompasses ice that is free to move with currents and winds. The physical boundary between fast ice and drift ice is the ''fast ice boundary''. The drift ice zone may be further divided into a ''shear zone'', a ''marginal ice zone'' and a ''central pack''.&lt;ref name="Lepp"&gt;{{cite book |first=Matti |last=Leppr̃anta |title=The Drift Of Sea Ice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJwub7E6VDcC |date=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-40881-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drift ice consists of ''floes'', individual pieces of sea ice {{convert|20|m|ft}} or more across. There are names for various floe sizes: ''small'' – {{convert|20 to 100|m|ft|abbr=on}}; ''medium'' – {{convert|100 to 500|m|ft|abbr=on}}; ''big'' – {{convert|500 to 2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}; ''vast'' – {{convert|2 to 10|km|mi}}; and ''giant'' – more than {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NSIDC&gt;{{harvnb|NSIDC All About Sea Ice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECGlossary"&gt;{{harvnb|Environment Canada Ice Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pack ice'' is used either as a synonym to ''drift ice'',&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; or to designate drift ice zone in which the floes are densely packed.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; The overall sea ice cover is termed the ''ice canopy'' from the perspective of submarine navigation.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;

=== Classification based on age ===
Another classification used by scientists to describe sea ice is based on age, that is, on its development stages. These stages are: ''new ice'', ''nilas'', ''young ice'', ''first-year'' and ''old''.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;

==== New ice, nilas and young ice ====
[[File:Nilas Sea Ice.JPG|thumb|Nilas in [[Baffin Bay]]]]
''New ice'' is a general term used for recently frozen sea water that does not yet make up solid ice. It may consist of [[frazil ice]] (plates or spicules of ice suspended in water), [[slush]] (water saturated snow), or ''shuga'' (spongy white ice lumps a few centimeters across). Other terms, such as [[grease ice]] and [[pancake ice]], are used for ice crystal accumulations under the action of wind and waves.

''Nilas'' designates a sea ice crust up to {{convert|10|cm|in}} in thickness. It bends without breaking around waves and swells. Nilas can be further subdivided into ''dark nilas'' – up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness and very dark, and ''light nilas'' – over {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness and lighter in color.

''Young ice'' is a transition stage between nilas and first-year ice, and ranges in thickness from {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}, Young ice can be further subdivided into ''grey ice'' – {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness, and ''grey-white ice'' – {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness. Young ice is not as flexible as nilas, but tends to break under wave action. In a compression regime, it will either raft (at the grey ice stage) or ridge (at the grey-white ice stage).

==== First-year sea ice ====
[[File:FYvsSYvsMY.svg|thumb|Distinction between 1st year sea ice (FY), 2nd year (SY), multiyear (MY) and old ice.]]
''First-year sea ice'' is ice that is thicker than ''young ice'' but has no more than one year growth. In other words, it is ice that grows in the fall and winter (after it has gone through the ''new ice — nilas — young ice'' stages and grows further) but does not survive the spring and summer months (it melts away). The thickness of this ice typically ranges from {{convert|0.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; First-year ice may be further divided into ''thin'' ({{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|70|cm|ft|abbr=on}}), ''medium'' ({{convert|70|cm|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120|cm|ft|abbr=on}}) and ''thick'' (&gt;{{convert|120|cm|ft|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"&gt;{{harvnb|WMO Sea-Ice Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old sea ice ====
''Old sea ice'' is sea ice that has survived at least one melting season (''i.e.'' one summer). For this reason, this ice is generally thicker than first-year sea ice. Old ice is commonly divided into two types: ''second-year ice'', which has survived one melting season, and ''multiyear ice'', which has survived more than one. (In some sources,&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; ''old ice'' is more than 2-years old.) Multi-year ice is much more common in the [[Arctic]] than it is in the [[Antarctic]].&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadhams2"&gt;{{cite book |first=P. |last=Wadhams |title=Ice in the Ocean |date=2000 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-90-5699-296-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that sea ice in the south drifts into warmer waters where it melts. In the Arctic, much of the sea ice is land-locked.

=== Driving forces ===
While [[fast ice]] is relatively stable (because it is attached to the shoreline or the seabed), [[Drift ice|drift (or pack) ice]] undergoes relatively complex deformation processes that ultimately give rise to sea ice's typically wide variety of landscapes. Wind is thought to be the main driving force along with ocean currents.&lt;ref name="Wadhams"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; The [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis force]] and sea ice surface tilt have also been invoked.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; These driving forces induce a state of stress within the drift ice zone. An [[Drift ice|ice floe]] converging toward another and pushing against it will generate a state of ''compression'' at the boundary between both. The ice cover may also undergo a state of ''tension'', resulting in divergence and fissure opening. If two floes drift sideways past each other while remaining in contact, this will create a state of ''[[shear (geology)|shear]]''.

=== Deformation ===
Sea ice deformation results from the interaction between ice floes, as they are driven against each other. The end result may be of three types of features:&lt;ref name="ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; 1) [[Finger rafting|Rafted ice]], when one piece is overriding another; 2) [[Pressure ridge (ice)|Pressure ridges]], a line of broken ice forced downward (to make up the ''keel'') and upward (to make the ''sail''); and 3) ''[[Hummock]]'', an hillock of broken ice that forms an uneven surface. A ''shear ridge'' is a pressure ridge that formed under shear – it tends to be more linear than a ridge induced only by compression.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; A ''new ridge'' is a recent feature — it is sharp-crested, with its side sloping at an angle exceeding 40 degrees. In contrast, a ''weathered ridge'' is one with a rounded crest and with sides sloping at less than 40 degrees.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; [[Stamukha|Stamukhi]] are yet another type of pile-up but these are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary. They result from the interaction between [[fast ice]] and the drifting pack ice.

''Level ice'' is sea ice that has not been affected by deformation, and is therefore relatively flat.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;

=== Leads and polynyas ===
[[Lead (sea ice)|Leads]] and [[polynyas]] are areas of open water that occur within sea ice expanses even though air temperatures are below freezing, and provide a direct interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which is important for the wildlife. Leads are narrow and linear – they vary in width from meter to km scale. During the winter, the water in leads quickly freezes up. They are also used for navigation purposes – even when refrozen, the ice in leads is thinner, allowing icebreakers access to an easier sail path, and submarines to surface more easily. Polynyas are more uniform in size than leads and are also larger – two types are recognized: 1) ''Sensible-heat polynyas'', caused by the upwelling of warmer water and 2) ''Latent-heat polynyas'', resulting from persistent winds from the coastline.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;

==Formation==
{{main|Sea ice growth processes}}
[[File:Seaice.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of sea ice forming near [[St. Matthew Island]] in the Bering Sea.]]

Only the top layer of water needs to cool to the freezing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=drgjDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Only+the+top+layer+of+water+needs+to+cool+to+the+freezing+point#v=onepage&amp;q=Only%20the%20top%20layer%20of%20water%20needs%20to%20cool%20to%20the%20freezing%20point&amp;f=false|title=Microclimate and Local Climate|last=Barry|first=Roger G.|last2=Blanken|first2=Peter D.|date=2016-05-23|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316652336|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convection of the surface layer involves the top {{convert|100|–|150|m|abbr=on}}, down to the [[pycnocline]] of increased density.

In calm water, the first sea ice to form on the surface is a skim of separate crystals which initially are in the form of tiny discs, floating flat on the surface and of diameter less than {{convert|0.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Each disc has its c-axis vertical and grows outwards laterally. At a certain point such a disc shape becomes unstable, and the growing isolated crystals take on a hexagonal, stellar form, with long fragile arms stretching out over the surface. These crystals also have their c-axis vertical. The dendritic arms are very fragile, and soon break off, leaving a mixture of discs and arm fragments. With any kind of turbulence in the water, these fragments break up further into random-shaped small crystals which form a suspension of increasing density in the surface water, an ice type called [[frazil ice|frazil or grease ice]]. In quiet conditions the frazil crystals soon freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice; in its early stages, when it is still transparent — that is the ice called ''nilas''. Once nilas has formed, a quite different growth process occurs, in which water freezes on to the bottom of the existing ice sheet, a process called ''congelation'' growth. This growth process yields first-year ice.

In rough water, fresh sea ice is formed by the cooling of the ocean as heat is lost into the atmosphere. The uppermost layer of the ocean is [[supercooling|supercooled]] to slightly below the freezing point, at which time tiny ice platelets (frazil ice) form. With time, this process leads to a mushy surface layer, known as [[grease ice]]. Frazil ice formation may also be started by [[snow]]fall, rather than supercooling. Waves and wind then act to compress these ice particles into larger plates, of several meters in diameter, called [[pancake ice]]. These float on the [[ocean surface]], and collide with one another, forming upturned edges. In time, the pancake ice plates may themselves be rafted over one another or frozen together into a more solid ice cover, known as consolidated pancake ice. Such ice has a very rough appearance on top and bottom.

If sufficient snow falls on sea ice to depress the freeboard below sea level, sea water will flow in and a layer of ice will form of mixed snow/sea water. This is particularly common around [[Antarctica]].

[[Russia]]n scientist [[Vladimir Wiese|Vladimir Vize]] (1886–1954) devoted his life to study the Arctic ice pack and developed the ''Scientific Prediction of Ice Conditions Theory'', for which he was widely acclaimed in academic circles. He applied this theory in the field in the [[Kara Sea]], which led to the discovery of [[Vize Island]].

==Yearly freeze and melt cycle==

[[Image:Arctic-ice-with-labels.png|thumb|Volume of arctic sea ice over time using a polar coordinate system draw method (time goes counter clockwise; one cycle per year)]]

The annual freeze and melt cycle is set by the annual cycle of solar insolation and of ocean and atmospheric temperature, and of variability in this annual cycle.

In the Arctic, the area of ocean covered by sea ice increases over winter from a minimum in September to a maximum in March or sometimes February, before melting over the summer. In the Antarctic, where the seasons are reversed, the annual minimum is typically in February and the annual maximum in September or October, and the presence of sea ice abutting the calving fronts of [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]] has been shown to influence glacier flow and potentially the stability of the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic Ice Sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Chad A.|last2=Young|first2=Duncan A.|last3=Gwyther|first3=David E.|last4=Galton-Fenzi|first4=Benjamin K.|last5=Blankenship|first5=Donald D.|date=2018-09-06|title=Seasonal dynamics of Totten Ice Shelf controlled by sea ice buttressing|url=https://www.the-cryosphere.net/12/2869/2018/|journal=The Cryosphere|language=English|volume=12|issue=9|pages=2869–2882|doi=10.5194/tc-12-2869-2018|issn=1994-0416|via=|bibcode=2018TCry...12.2869G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massom|first=Robert A.|last2=Scambos|first2=Theodore A.|last3=Bennetts|first3=Luke G.|last4=Reid|first4=Phillip|last5=Squire|first5=Vernon A.|last6=Stammerjohn|first6=Sharon E.|date=2018|title=Antarctic ice shelf disintegration triggered by sea ice loss and ocean swell|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0212-1|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=558|issue=7710|pages=383–389|doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0212-1|pmid=29899449|issn=0028-0836|via=|bibcode=2018Natur.558..383M}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The growth and melt rate are also affected by the state of the ice itself. During growth, the ice thickening due to freezing (as opposed to dynamics) is itself dependent on the thickness, so that the ice growth slows as the ice thickens.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; Likewise, during melt, thinner sea ice melts faster. This leads to different behaviour between multiyear and first year ice. In addition, [[melt pond]]s on the ice surface during the melt season lower the [[albedo]] such that more solar radiation is absorbed, leading to a feedback where melt is accelerated. The presence of melt ponds is affected by the [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the sea ice- i.e. whether meltwater can drain- and the [[topography]] of the sea ice surface, i.e. the presence of natural basins for the melt ponds to form in. First year ice is flatter than multiyear ice due to the lack of dynamic ridging, so ponds tend to have greater area. They also have lower albedo since they are on thinner ice, which blocks less of the solar radiation from reaching the dark ocean below.

==Monitoring and observations==
{{main|Measurement of sea ice}}
{{see also|Arctic sea ice decline|Arctic sea ice decline#Ice-free summer|Antarctic sea ice}}

Changes in sea ice conditions are best demonstrated by the rate of melting over time. A composite record of Arctic ice demonstrates that the floes' retreat began around 1900, experiencing more rapid melting beginning within the past 50 years {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Satellite study of sea ice began in 1979, and became a much more reliable measure of long-term changes in sea ice. In comparison to the extended record, the sea-ice extent in the polar region by September 2007 was only half the recorded mass that had been estimated to exist within the 1950–1970 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=6|last=Polyak |first=Leonid|author2=Richard B.

[[Arctic]] sea ice extent ice hit an all-time low in September 2012, when the ice was determined to cover only 24% of the Arctic Ocean, offsetting the previous low of 29% in 2007. Predictions of when the first [[Arctic sea ice decline#Ice-free summer|"ice free" Arctic summer]] might occur vary.

[[Antarctic sea ice]] extent gradually increased in the period of satellite observations, which began in 1979, until a rapid decline in southern hemisphere spring of 2016.

==Relationship to global warming and climate change==
[[File:Ponds on the Ocean, ICESCAPE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|As ice melts, the liquid water collects in depressions on the surface and deepens them, forming these melt ponds in the [[Arctic]]. These fresh water ponds are separated from the salty sea below and around it, until breaks in the ice merge the two.]]
Sea ice provides an ecosystem for various polar species, particularly the [[polar bear]], whose environment is being threatened as global warming causes the ice to melt more as the Earth's temperature gets warmer. Furthermore, the sea ice itself functions to help keep polar climates cool, since the ice exists in expansive enough amounts to maintain a cold environment. At this, sea ice's relationship with global warming is cyclical; the ice helps to maintain cool climates, but as the global temperature increases, the ice melts, and is less effective in keeping those climates cold. The bright, shiny surface ([[albedo]]) of the ice also serves a role in maintaining cooler polar temperatures by reflecting much of the sunlight that hits it back into space. As the sea ice melts, its surface area shrinks, diminishing the size of the reflective surface and therefore causing the earth to absorb more of the sun's heat. As the ice melts it lowers the albedo thus causing more heat to be absorbed by the Earth and further increase the amount of melting ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/k12/.albedo |title=Albedo |work=Climate Education Modules for K-12 |publisher=NC State University |access-date=2017-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529115402/https://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/k12/.albedo |archivedate=29 May 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the size of the [[ice floes]] is affected by the seasons, even a small change in global temperature can greatly affect the amount of sea ice, and due to the shrinking reflective surface that keeps the ocean cool, this sparks a cycle of ice shrinking and temperatures warming. As a result, the polar regions are the most susceptible places to climate change on the planet.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;

Furthermore, sea ice affects the movement of ocean waters. In the [[freezing]] process, much of the salt in ocean water is squeezed out of the frozen crystal formations, though some remains frozen in the ice. This salt becomes trapped beneath the sea ice, creating a higher concentration of salt in the water beneath ice floes. This concentration of salt contributes to the salinated water's [[density]], and this cold, denser water sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This cold water moves along the ocean floor towards the equator, while warmer water on the ocean surface moves in the direction of the poles. This is referred to as "[[Thermohaline circulation|conveyor belt]] motion", and is a regularly occurring process.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;

==Modelling==
In order to gain a better understanding about the variability, numerical sea ice models are used to perform [[Sensitivity analysis|sensitivity studies]]. The two main ingredients are the [[ice dynamics]] and the thermodynamical properties (see [[Sea ice emissivity modelling]], [[Sea ice growth processes]] and [[Sea ice thickness]]).

Many [[global climate model]]s (GCMs) have sea ice implemented in their numerical simulation scheme in order to capture the [[Ice-albedo feedback]] correctly. Examples include:
* The Louvain-la-Neuve Sea Ice Model is a numerical model of sea ice designed for climate studies and operational oceanography developed at [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. It is coupled to the ocean general circulation model OPA (Ocean Parallélisé) and is freely available as a part of the [[Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean]].
* The [[MIT General Circulation Model]] is a [[Global climate model|global circulation model]] developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] includes a package for sea-ice. The code is freely available there.
* The [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] develops the Community Sea Ice Model.
* The [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] has a project called Los Alamos Sea Ice Model. The project is [[open source]] and designed as a component of GCM, although it provides a standalone mode.
* The Finite-Element Sea-Ice Ocean Model developed at [[Alfred Wegener Institute]] uses an [[unstructured grid]].

The [[Coupled model intercomparison project]] offers a standard protocol for studying the output of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. The coupling takes place at the atmosphere-ocean interface where the sea ice may occur.

In addition to global modeling, various regional models deal with sea ice. Regional models are employed for seasonal forecasting experiments and for [[process study|process studies]].

==Ecology==
{{main|Sympagic ecology}}

Sea ice is part of the Earth's [[biosphere]]. When sea water freezes, the ice is riddled with brine-filled channels which sustain [[Sympagic ecology|sympagic organisms]] such as bacteria, algae, copepods and annelids, which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and specialised fish like the [[Bald notothen]], fed upon in turn by larger animals such as [[Emperor penguins]] and [[Minke whales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acecrc.sipex.aq/access/page/?page=d664da82-b244-102a-8ea7-0019b9ea7c60 |title=Sea Ice Ecology |website=Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment (SIPEX) |publisher=Antarctic Climate &amp; Ecosystems CRC |accessdate=23 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320075657/http://www.acecrc.sipex.aq/access/page/?page=d664da82-b244-102a-8ea7-0019b9ea7c60 |archive-date=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SEMARNAT logo 2012.svg|thumb]]
The '''Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources''' (in [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]: '''''Se'''cretaría del '''M'''edio '''A'''mbiente y '''R'''ecursos '''Nat'''urales, '''SEMARNAT''''') is Mexico's [[minister of the environment|environment ministry]]. Its head, the Secretary of the Environment, is a member of the [[Mexican Executive Cabinet|federal executive cabinet]] and is appointed by the [[President of Mexico|President of the Republic]]. {{as of|2015}} the appointed Secretary of the Environment in the cabinet of [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] is [[Rafael Pacchiano Alamán]] who was preceded by [[Juan José Guerra Abud]], who was in the position from 1 December 2012 to 27 August 2015.

The Secretariat is charged with the mission of protecting, restoring, and conserving the ecosystems, natural resources, assets and environmental services of Mexico with the goal of fostering sustainable development.

The '''Sasol Solar Challenge''' is a South African endurance challenge for solar-powered vehicles, with classes for [[hybrid vehicle]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, and [[biofuel]]-powered [[vehicle]]s as well. Recognised by the International Solarcar Federation, the first challenge was run in 2008, and every two years thereafter. The event covers roughly 2,500 km, but has set loops for teams to repeat, with the potential to do 5,000 km. The current record, held by Dutch team Nuon, is 4,716 km, set in 2016 in their car [[Nuna]]. The challenge route may change from year to year, and it is planned to run from Pretoria to Stellenbosch in 2018.

==Objective==
The primary objective is to design, manage, build and race [[Solar energy|solar power]]ed-vehicles across South Africa. The challenge sees a collaboration between pupils, students, private individuals and various industry and government partners, to work together to have a safe, technology-rich event. Moreover, the challenge is seen as an educational tool to focus on and communicate about science and technology to the broad public.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8394">A '''switched capacitor''' is an [[electronic circuit]] element used for [[discrete-time signal|discrete-time]] [[signal processing]]. It works by moving charges into and out of [[capacitor]]s when [[switch]]es are opened and closed. Usually, non-overlapping signals are used to control the switches, so that not all switches are closed simultaneously. [[Electronic filter|Filter]]s implemented with these elements are termed "switched-capacitor filters", and depend only on the ratios between capacitances. This makes them much more suitable for use within [[integrated circuit]]s, where accurately specified resistors and capacitors are not economical to construct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/FilterBkgrnd/SwitchedCap.html ''Switched Capacitor Circuits''], Swarthmore College course notes, accessed 2009-05-02&lt;/ref&gt;

==The switched-capacitor resistor==
[[File:Schematic of switching capacitor.svg|right|thumb|Switched-capacitor resistor]]
The simplest switched-capacitor (SC) circuit is the switched-capacitor resistor, made of one capacitor C and two switches S{{sub|1}} and S{{sub|2}} which connect the capacitor with a given frequency alternately to the input and output of the SC. Each switching cycle transfers a charge &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; from the input to the output at the switching frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The charge ''q'' on a capacitor ''C'' with a voltage ''V'' between the plates is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;q = CV\ &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the voltage across the capacitor. Therefore, when S{{sub|1}} is closed while S{{sub|2}} is open, the charge stored in the capacitor C{{sub|S}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;q_{\text{IN}} = C_S V_{\text{IN}}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

When S{{sub|2}} is closed, some of that charge is transferred out of the capacitor, after which the charge that remains in capacitor C{{sub|S}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;q_{\text{OUT}} = C_S V_{\text{OUT}}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the charge moved out of the capacitor to the output is:
:&lt;math&gt;q = q_{\text{IN}}-q_{\text{OUT}} = C_S(V_{\text{IN}}-V_{\text{OUT}})\ &lt;/math&gt;

Because this charge ''q'' is transferred at a rate ''f'', the rate of transfer of charge per unit time is:
:&lt;math&gt;I = qf.\ &lt;/math&gt;
(A continuous transfer of charge from one node to another is equivalent to a current, so ''I'' (the symbol for electric current) is used.)

Substituting for ''q'' in the above, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;I = C_S(V_{\text{IN}}-V_{\text{OUT}})f\ &lt;/math&gt;

Let ''V'' be the voltage across the SC from input to output. So:
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_{\text{IN}} - V_{\text{OUT}}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

So the equivalent resistance ''R'' (i.e., the voltage&amp;ndash;current relationship) is:
:&lt;math&gt;R = {V \over I} = {1 \over {C_S f}}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the SC behaves like a [[resistor]] whose value depends on capacitance ''C{{sub|S}}'' and switching frequency ''f''.

The SC resistor is used as a replacement for simple resistors in [[integrated circuit]]s because it is easier to fabricate reliably with a wide range of values. It also has the benefit that its value can be adjusted by changing the switching frequency (i.e., it is a programmable resistance). See also: [[operational amplifier applications]].

This same circuit can be used in discrete time systems (such as analog to digital converters) as a track and hold circuit. During the appropriate clock phase, the capacitor samples the analog voltage through switch one and in the second phase presents this held sampled value to an electronic circuit for processing.

==The parasitic-sensitive integrator==
[[File:Parasitic_sensitive_integrator.svg|right|400px|thumb|A simple switched-capacitor parasitic-sensitive integrator]]
Often switched-capacitor circuits are used to provide accurate voltage gain and integration by switching a sampled capacitor onto an op-amp with a capacitor &lt;math&gt;C_{fb}&lt;/math&gt; in feedback. One of the earliest of these circuits is the parasitic-sensitive integrator developed by the Czech engineer Bedrich Hosticka.&lt;ref&gt;B. Hosticka, R. Brodersen, P. Gray, "MOS Sampled Data Recursive Filters Using Switched Capacitor Integrators", IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol SC-12, No.6, December 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Here is an analysis. Denote by &lt;math&gt;T = 1 / f&lt;/math&gt; the switching period. In capacitors,
:&lt;math&gt;\text{charge} = \text{capacitance} \times \text{voltage}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, when S1 opens and S2 closes (they are never both closed at the same time), we have the following:

1) Because &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; has just charged:
:&lt;math&gt; Q_s(t) = C_s \cdot V_s(t)\, &lt;/math&gt;

2) Because the feedback cap, &lt;math&gt;C_{fb}&lt;/math&gt;, is suddenly charged with that much charge (by the op amp, which seeks a virtual short circuit between its inputs):
:&lt;math&gt; Q_{fb}(t) = Q_s(t-T) + Q_{fb}(t-T)\, &lt;/math&gt;

Now dividing 2) by &lt;math&gt;C_{fb}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; V_{fb}(t) = \frac {Q_s(t-T)}{C_{fb}} + V_{fb}(t-T)\, &lt;/math&gt;

And inserting 1):
:&lt;math&gt; V_{fb}(t) = \frac {C_s}{C_{fb}} \cdot V_s(t-T) + V_{fb}(t-T)\, &lt;/math&gt;

This last equation represents what is going on in &lt;math&gt;C_{fb}&lt;/math&gt; - it increases (or decreases) its voltage each cycle according to the charge that is being "pumped" from &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; (due to the op-amp).

However, there is a more elegant way to formulate this fact if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is very short. Let us introduce &lt;math&gt;dt\leftarrow T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dV_{fb}\leftarrow V_{fb}(t)-V_{fb}(t-dt)&lt;/math&gt; and rewrite the last equation divided by dt:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac {dV_{fb}(t)}{dt} = f \frac {C_s}{C_{fb}} \cdot V_s(t)\, &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the op-amp output voltage takes the form:
:&lt;math&gt; V_{OUT}(t) = -V_{fb}(t) = - \frac{1}{\frac{1}{fC_s}C_{fb}} \int V_s(t)dt \, &lt;/math&gt;

This is an [[operational amplifier applications#Inverting integrator|inverting integrator]] with an "equivalent resistance" &lt;math&gt;R_{eq} = \frac{1}{fC_s}&lt;/math&gt;. This allows its ''on-line'' or ''runtime'' adjustment (if we manage to make the switches oscillate according to some signal given by e.g. a microcontroller).

==The parasitic insensitive integrator==

===Use in discrete-time systems===
The delaying parasitic insensitive integrator has a wide use in discrete time electronic circuits such as biquad filters, anti-alias structures, and delta-sigma data converters. This circuit implements the following z-domain function:
:&lt;math&gt; H(z) = \frac{1}{z-1}&lt;/math&gt;

==The multiplying digital to analog converter==
[[File:MDAC.png|right|frame|A 1.5 bit multiplying digital to analog converter]]
One useful characteristic of switched-capacitor circuits is that they can be used to perform many circuit tasks at the same time, which is difficult with non-discrete time components. The multiplying digital to analog converter (MDAC) is an example as it can take an analog input, add a digital value &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; to it, and multiply this by some factor based on the capacitor ratios. The output of the MDAC is given by the following:
:&lt;math&gt; V_{Out} = \frac {V_{i} \cdot (C_{1}+C_{2}) - (d-1) \cdot V_{r} \cdot C_{2} + V_{os} \cdot (C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{p})} {C_{1} + \frac {(C_{1} + C_{2} + C_{p})} {A} } &lt;/math&gt;

The MDAC is a common component in modern pipeline analog to digital converters as well as other precision analog electronics and was first created in the form above by Stephen Lewis and others at Bell Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Lewis et al., "A 10-bit, 20Msample/s Analog to Digital Converter", IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, March 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of switched-capacitor circuits==
Switched-capacitor circuits are analysed by writing down charge conservation equations, as in this article, and solving them with a computer algebra tool. For hand analysis and for getting more insight into the circuits, it is also possible to do a [[Signal-flow graph]] analysis, with a method that is very similar for switched-capacitor and continuous-time circuits &lt;ref&gt;H. Schmid and A. Huber, "Analysis of switched-capacitor circuits using driving-point signal-flow graphs", Analog Integr Circ Sig Process (2018).

{{Infobox titanium}}
'''Titanium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ti''' and [[atomic number]] 22. It is a lustrous [[transition metal]] with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to [[corrosion]] in [[sea water]], [[aqua regia]], and [[chlorine]].

Titanium was discovered in [[Cornwall]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], by [[William Gregor]] in 1791, and was named by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] after the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] of [[Greek mythology]]. The element occurs within a number of [[mineral]] deposits, principally [[rutile]] and [[ilmenite]], which are widely distributed in the [[Earth's crust]] and [[lithosphere]], and it is found in almost all living things, water bodies, rocks, and soils.&lt;ref name="EBC"/&gt; The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the [[Kroll process|Kroll]]&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; and [[Hunter process]]es. The most common compound, [[titanium dioxide]], is a popular [[photocatalysis|photocatalyst]] and is used in the manufacture of white pigments.&lt;ref name="HistoryAndUse"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krebs|first=Robert E.|title=The History and Use of Our Earth's Chemical Elements: A Reference Guide|edition=2nd|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=[[Westport, CT]]|isbn=978-0-313-33438-2|date=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yb9xTj72vNAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other compounds include [[titanium tetrachloride]] (TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), a component of [[smoke screen]]s and [[catalyst]]s; and [[Titanium(III) chloride|titanium trichloride]] (TiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is used as a catalyst in the production of [[polypropylene]].&lt;ref name="EBC"/&gt;

Titanium can be [[alloy]]ed with [[iron]], [[aluminium]], [[vanadium]], and [[molybdenum]], among other elements, to produce strong, lightweight alloys for aerospace ([[jet engine]]s, [[missile]]s, and [[spacecraft]]), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, [[desalination plant]]s, pulp, and paper), automotive, agri-food, medical [[prostheses]], orthopedic [[implant (medicine)|implants]], dental and endodontic instruments and files, [[dental implant]]s, sporting goods, jewelry, [[mobile phone]]s, and other applications.&lt;ref name="EBC"/&gt;

The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donachie|1988|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some [[steel]]s, but less dense.&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p738"&gt;{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=738}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two [[allotropy|allotropic]] forms&lt;ref name="TICE6th"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Titanium |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |edition=6th |date=2000–2006 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |url=http://www.answers.com/Titanium |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7876-5015-5 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118151229/http://www.answers.com/Titanium |archivedate=18 November 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and five naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of this element, &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Ti through &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, with &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ti being the most [[natural abundance|abundant]] (73.8%).&lt;ref name="EnvChem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/periodic/Ti-pg2.html#Nuclides|title=Periodic Table of Elements: Ti – Titanium|accessdate=26 December 2006|author=Barbalace, Kenneth L.|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they have the same number of [[valence electron]]s and are in the same [[group (periodic table)|group]] in the [[periodic table]], titanium and [[zirconium]] differ in many chemical and physical properties.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
As a [[metal]], titanium is recognized for its high [[strength-to-weight ratio]].&lt;ref name="TICE6th"/&gt; It is a strong metal with low [[density]] that is quite [[ductility|ductile]] (especially in an [[oxygen]]-free environment),&lt;ref name="EBC"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Titanium|date=2006|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9072643/titanium|accessdate=29 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; lustrous, and metallic-white in [[color]].&lt;ref name="Stwertka1998"/&gt; The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650&amp;nbsp;°C or 3,000&amp;nbsp;°F) makes it useful as a [[refractory metals|refractory metal]]. It is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and has fairly low [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]].&lt;ref name="EBC"/&gt;

Commercially pure (99.2% pure) [[titanium alloy#Grades of titanium|grades]] of titanium have [[ultimate tensile strength]] of about 434 [[megapascal|MPa]] (63,000 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p738"/&gt; as the most commonly used [[6061 aluminium alloy|6061-T6 aluminium alloy]]. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., [[Titanium Beta C|Beta C]]) achieve tensile strengths of over 1,400 MPa (200,000 psi).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donachie|1988|loc=Appendix J, Table J.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, titanium loses strength when heated above {{convert|430|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p734"&gt;{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanium is not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can [[galling|gall]] unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a [[fatigue limit]] that guarantees longevity in some applications.&lt;ref name="Stwertka1998"/&gt;

The metal is a dimorphic [[allotropy|allotrope]] of an hexagonal α form that changes into a body-centered cubic (lattice) β form at {{convert|882|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/&gt; The [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] of the α form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the β form regardless of temperature.&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/&gt;

===Chemical properties===
[[File:Titanium in water porbiax diagram.png|thumb|left|The [[Pourbaix diagram]] for titanium in pure water, perchloric acid, or sodium hydroxide&lt;ref name="medusa"&gt;Puigdomenech, Ignasi (2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130605034847/http://www.kth.se/che/medusa ''Hydra/Medusa Chemical Equilibrium Database and Plotting Software''], KTH Royal Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like [[aluminium]] and [[magnesium]], titanium metal and its alloys [[oxidize]] immediately upon exposure to air. Titanium readily reacts with oxygen at {{convert|1200|°C|°F}} in air, and at {{convert|610|°C|°F}} in pure oxygen, forming [[titanium dioxide]].&lt;ref name="TICE6th"/&gt; It is, however, slow to react with water and air at ambient temperatures because it forms a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passive]] oxide coating that protects the bulk metal from further oxidation.&lt;ref name="EBC"/&gt; When it first forms, this protective layer is only 1–2 [[nanometre|nm]] thick but continues to grow slowly; reaching a thickness of 25&amp;nbsp;nm in four years.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p453"/&gt;

Atmospheric passivation gives titanium excellent resistance to corrosion, almost equivalent to [[platinum]]. Titanium is capable of withstanding attack by dilute [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]s, chloride solutions, and most organic acids.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pitting Corrosion of Titanium|journal=J.

Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At {{convert|550|°C|°F}}, it combines with chlorine.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.&lt;ref name="HistoryAndUse"/&gt;

Titanium is one of the few elements that burns in pure nitrogen gas, reacting at {{convert|800|°C|°F}} to form [[titanium nitride]], which causes embrittlement.&lt;ref name="titaniumindustry"&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial Applications of Titanium and Zirconium|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0Adr4zleybgC&amp;pg=PA112|page= 112|first= A.

Such pumps inexpensively and reliably produce extremely low pressures in [[ultra-high vacuum]] systems.

Titanium is the ninth-most [[abundance of elements in Earth's crust|abundant]] element in [[Earth]]'s crust (0.63% by [[mass]])&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p732"/&gt; and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present as oxides in most [[igneous rock]]s, in [[sedimentary rock|sediments]] derived from them, in living things, and natural bodies of water.&lt;ref name="EBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LANL"&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the [[United States Geological Survey]], 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p732"/&gt;

Common titanium-containing [[mineral]]s are [[anatase]], [[brookite]], [[ilmenite]], [[perovskite]], [[rutile]], and [[titanite]] (sphene).&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p453"&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akaogiite]] is an extremely rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt; Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Mozambique]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[South Africa]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p453"/&gt; About 186,000 tonnes of titanium [[metal sponge]] were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

The concentration of titanium is about 4 picomolar in the ocean. At 100&amp;nbsp;°C, the concentration of titanium in water is estimated to be less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; M at pH 7. The identity of titanium species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its low solubility and the lack of sensitive spectroscopic methods, although only the 4+ oxidation state is stable in air. No evidence exists for a biological role, although rare organisms are known to accumulate high concentrations of titanium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/cr1002886 |pmid= 22074443 |title= Bioinorganic Chemistry of Titanium |journal= Chemical Reviews |volume= 112 |issue= 3 |pages= 1863 |year= 2012 |last1= Buettner |first1= K. M. |last2= Valentine |first2= A. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanium is contained in [[meteorite]]s, and it has been detected in the [[Sun]] and in [[stellar classification|M-type]] [[star]]s&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; (the coolest type) with a surface temperature of {{convert|3200|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p451"&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rock (geology)|Rocks]] brought back from the [[Moon]] during the [[Apollo 17]] mission are composed of 12.1% TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; It is also found in [[coal]] ash, [[plant]]s, and even the [[human]] body. Native titanium (pure metallic) is very rare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-7339.html Titanium]. Mindat&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of titanium}}
Naturally occurring titanium is composed of 5 stable [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, &lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, &lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, and &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, with &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ti being the most abundant (73.8% [[natural abundance]]). Eleven [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti with a [[half-life]] of 63 years; &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, 184.8 minutes; &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, 5.76 minutes; and &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, 1.7 minutes. All the other [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives less than 33 seconds and the majority, less than half a second.&lt;ref name="EnvChem"/&gt;

The isotopes of titanium range in [[atomic weight]] from 39.99 [[unified atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ti) to 57.966 u (&lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;Ti). The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta emission]]. The primary [[decay product]]s before &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ti are element 21 ([[scandium]]) isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 ([[vanadium]]) isotopes.&lt;ref name="EnvChem"/&gt;

Titanium becomes radioactive upon bombardment with [[deuterons]], emitting mainly [[positrons]] and hard [[gamma rays]].&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt;

{{Category see also|Titanium compounds|Titanium minerals}}
[[File:Titanium nitride coating.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.25|alt=A steel colored twist drill bit with the spiral groove colored in a golden shade.|TiN-coated [[drill]] bit]]
The +4 [[oxidation state]] dominates titanium chemistry,&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p958"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=958}}&lt;/ref&gt; but compounds in the +3 [[oxidation state]] are also common.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p970"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, titanium adopts an [[octahedral coordination geometry]] in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a notable exception. Because of its high oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit a high degree of [[covalent bond]]ing. Unlike most other transition metals, simple [[transition metal aquo complex|aquo Ti(IV) complexes]] are unknown.

===Oxides, sulfides, and alkoxides===
The most important oxide is TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which exists in three important [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]; [[anatase]], [[brookite]], and [[rutile]]. All of these are white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see [[rutile]]). They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six [[oxide]] ligands that link to other Ti centers.

The term ''[[titanate]]s'' usually refers to titanium(IV) compounds, as represented by [[barium titanate]] (BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). With a [[perovskite]] structure, this material exhibits [[piezoelectric]] properties and is used as a transducer in the interconversion of [[sound]] and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="TICE6th"/&gt; Many minerals are titanates, e.g. [[ilmenite]] (FeTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Star sapphire (jewel)|Star sapphires]] and [[ruby|rubies]] get their [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p453"/&gt;

A variety of reduced oxides ([[suboxide]]s) of titanium are known, mainly reduced [[stoichiometry|stoichiometries]] of [[titanium dioxide]] obtained by [[atmospheric plasma spraying]].Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, described as a Ti(IV)-Ti(III) species, is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with hydrogen at high temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Gang|last2=Huang|first2=Wan-Xia|last3=Yi|first3=Yong|title=Preparation and Optical Storage Properties of λTi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; Powder|journal=Journal of Inorganic Materials|date=26 June 2013|volume=28|issue=4|pages=425–430|doi=10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12309|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapour-coated with titanium dioxide: it evaporates as pure TiO, whereas TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable refractive index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1406.0622|last1=Bonardi|first1=Antonio|title=A new solution for mirror coating in $γ$-ray Cherenkov Astronomy|journal=Experimental Astronomy|volume=38|pages=1–9|last2=Pühlhofer|first2=Gerd|last3=Hermanutz|first3=Stephan|last4=Santangelo|first4=Andrea|date=2014|doi=10.1007/s10686-014-9398-x|bibcode=2014ExA....38....1B|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0622|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known is [[titanium(III) oxide|Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], with the [[corundum]] structure, and [[titanium(II) oxide|TiO]], with the rock salt structure, although often nonstoichiometric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[alkoxide]]s of titanium(IV), prepared by reacting TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with alcohols, are colourless compounds that convert to the dioxide on reaction with water. They are industrially useful for depositing solid TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via the [[sol-gel process]]. [[Titanium isopropoxide]] is used in the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the [[Sharpless epoxidation]].

Titanium forms a variety of sulfides, but only [[titanium disulfide|TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] has attracted significant interest. It adopts a layered structure and was used as a cathode in the development of [[lithium batteries]]. Because Ti(IV) is a [[HSAB theory|"hard cation"]], the sulfides of titanium are unstable and tend to hydrolyze to the oxide with release of hydrogen sulfide.

===Nitrides and carbides===
[[Titanium nitride]] (TiN) is a member of a family of refractory transition metal nitrides and exhibits properties similar to both covalent compounds including; thermodynamic stability, extreme hardness, thermal/electrical conductivity, and a high melting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saha|first=Naresh|date=|year=1992|title=Titanium nitride oxidation chemistry: An x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.351465|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=no. 7|issue=7|pages=3072–3079|via=|doi=10.1063/1.351465|bibcode=1992JAP....72.3072S}}&lt;/ref&gt; TiN has a hardness equivalent to [[sapphire]] and [[carborundum]] (9.0 on the [[Mohs Scale]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~schubert/Educational-resources/Materials-Hardness.pdf |title=The hardness scale introduced by Friederich Mohs |author=Schubert, E.F. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603075632/http://www.rpi.edu/~schubert/Educational-resources/Materials-Hardness.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often used to coat cutting tools, such as [[drill bit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Truini|first=Joseph|title=Drill Bits|journal=Popular Mechanics|volume=165|date=May 1988|issue=5|page=91|issn=0032-4558|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z-QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a gold-colored decorative finish and as a [[Copper-based chips#Barrier metal|barrier metal]] in [[semiconductor fabrication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baliga|first=B.

Titanium(III) and titanium(II) also form stable chlorides. A notable example is [[titanium(III) chloride]] (TiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is used as a [[catalyst]] for production of [[polyolefin]]s (see [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]) and a reducing [[reagent|agent]] in organic chemistry.

===Organometallic complexes===
{{Main|Organotitanium chemistry}}
Owing to the important role of titanium compounds as [[polymerization]] catalyst, compounds with Ti-C bonds have been intensively studied. The most common organotitanium complex is [[titanocene dichloride]] ((C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Related compounds include [[Tebbe's reagent]] and [[Petasis reagent]]. Titanium forms [[metal carbonyl|carbonyl complexes]], e.g. [[titanocene dicarbonyl|(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John F.

===Anticancer therapy===
Following the success of  [[cisplatin|platinum-based]] chemotherapy, titanium(IV) complexes were among the first non-platinum compounds to be tested for cancer treatment. The advantage of titanium compounds lies in their high efficacy and low toxicity. In biological environments, hydrolysis leads to the safe and inert titanium dioxide. Despite these advantages the first candidate compounds failed clinical trials. Further development resulted in the creation of potentially effective, selective, and stable titanium-based drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tshuva|first1=Edit Y.|last2=Miller|first2=Maya|editor1-last=Sigel|editor1-first=Astrid|editor2-last=Sigel|editor2-first=Helmut|editor3-last=Freisinger|editor3-first=Eva|editor4-last=Sigel|editor4-first=Roland K.

==History==
[[File:Martin Heinrich Klaproth.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Engraved profile image of a mid-age male with high forehead. The person is wearing a coat and a neckerchief.|[[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] named titanium for the [[titan (mythology)|Titans]] of [[Greek mythology]]]]

Titanium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] in 1791 by the [[clergy]]man and amateur geologist, [[William Gregor]], as an [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]] of a [[mineral]] in [[Cornwall]], Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p452"/&gt; Gregor recognized the presence of a new element in [[ilmenite]]&lt;ref name="HistoryAndUse"/&gt; when he found black sand by a stream and noticed the sand was attracted by a [[magnet]].&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p452"/&gt; Analyzing the sand, he determined the presence of two metal oxides: [[iron oxide]] (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify.&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p732"&gt;{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element, Gregor reported his findings to the [[Royal Geological Society of Cornwall]] and in the German science journal ''[[Crell's Annalen]]''.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p452"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregor, William (1791) "Beobachtungen und Versuche über den Menakanit, einen in Cornwall gefundenen magnetischen Sand" (Observations and experiments regarding menaccanite [i.e., ilmenite], a magnetic sand found in Cornwall), ''Chemische Annalen'' …, '''1''', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFAyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 40–54], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFAyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 103–119.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregor, William (1791) "Sur le menakanite, espèce de sable attirable par l'aimant, trouvé dans la province de Cornouilles" (On menaccanite, a species of magnetic sand, found in the county of Cornwall), ''Observations et Mémoires sur la Physique'', '''39''': [https://archive.org/stream/journaldephysiq23unkngoog#page/n77/mode/1up 72–78], [https://archive.org/stream/journaldephysiq23unkngoog#page/n159/mode/1up 152–160.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pqc5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Around the same time, [[Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein]] produced a similar substance, but could not identify it.&lt;ref name="HistoryAndUse"/&gt; The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by [[Prussia]]n chemist [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] in rutile from Boinik (German name Bajmócska), a village in Hungary (now Bojničky in Slovakia).&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p452"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaproth, Martin Heinrich (1795) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5zFGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA233#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Chemische Untersuchung des sogenannten hungarischen rothen Schörls"] (Chemical investigation of the so-called Hungarian red tourmaline [rutile]) in: ''Beiträge zur chemischen Kenntniss der Mineralkörper'' (Contributions to the chemical knowledge of mineral substances), vol. 1, (Berlin, (Germany): Heinrich August Rottmann, 233–244. From page 244: ''"Diesem zufolge will ich den Namen für die gegenwärtige metallische Substanz, gleichergestalt wie bei dem Uranium geschehen, aus der Mythologie, und zwar von den Ursöhnen der Erde, den Titanen, entlehnen, und benenne also diese neue Metallgeschlecht: Titanium; … "'' (By virtue of this I will derive the name for the present metallic substance — as happened similarly in the case of uranium — from mythology, namely from the first sons of the Earth, the Titans, and thus [I] name this new species of metal: "titanium"; … )&lt;/ref&gt; Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the [[titan (mythology)|Titans]] of [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p451"/&gt; After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed that it contained titanium.

The currently known processes for extracting titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly; it is not possible to reduce the ore by heating with [[carbon]] (as in iron smelting) because titanium combines with the carbon to produce [[titanium carbide]].&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p452"/&gt; Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by [[Matthew A. Hunter]] at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] by heating TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with [[sodium]] at 700–800&amp;nbsp;°C under great pressure&lt;ref name="Roza2008p9"&gt;{{harvnb|Roza|2008|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[batch production|batch process]] known as the [[Hunter process]].&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when [[William Justin Kroll]] proved that it can be produced by reducing [[titanium tetrachloride]] (TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[calcium]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p955"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later he refined this process with [[magnesium]] and even sodium in what became known as the [[Kroll process]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p955"/&gt; Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (e.g., [[FFC Cambridge]], [[Armstrong process|Armstrong]]), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HistoryAndUse"/&gt;

[[File:TitaniumMetal jpg.jpg|thumb|left|Titanium sponge, made by the [[Kroll process]]]]

Titanium of very high purity was made in small quantities when [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] and [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]] discovered the iodide, or [[crystal bar process|crystal bar]], process in 1925, by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapours over a hot filament to pure metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Arkel |first=A.

==Production and fabrication==
[[File:TitaniumUSGOV.jpg|thumb|alt=A small heap of uniform black grains smaller than 1mm diameter.|Titanium (mineral concentrate)]]
[[File:Titanium products.jpg|thumb|Basic titanium products: plate, tube, rods, and powder]]

The processing of titanium metal occurs in four major steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donachie|1988|loc=Ch. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction of titanium ore into "sponge", a porous form; melting of sponge, or sponge plus a master alloy to form an ingot; primary fabrication, where an ingot is converted into general mill products such as [[bar stock|billet]], bar, [[plate (metal)|plate]], [[sheet metal|sheet]], strip, and [[tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]]; and secondary fabrication of finished shapes from mill products.

{{Main|Kroll process}}
Because it cannot be readily produced by [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of its dioxide,&lt;ref name="Stwertka1998"&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide to the Elements|edition=Revised|first=Albert|last=Stwertka|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=1998|chapter=Titanium|pages= 81–82|isbn=978-0-19-508083-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3RWAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; titanium metal is obtained by reduction of [[titanium tetrachloride|TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium,&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p733"&gt;{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=733}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process.&lt;ref name="Roza2008p9"/&gt; To produce the TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to [[carbothermic reduction]] in the presence of [[chlorine]]. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by [[fractional distillation]], the TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] with 800&amp;nbsp;°C molten [[magnesium]] in an [[argon]] atmosphere.&lt;ref name="TICE6th"/&gt; Titanium metal can be further purified by the [[van Arkel–de Boer process]], which involves [[chemical vapor transport|thermal decomposition]] of titanium tetraiodide.

{{Main|FFC Cambridge process}}
A more recently developed batch production method, the FFC Cambridge process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=George Zheng|author2=Fray, Derek J. |author3=Farthing, Tom W. |title=Direct electrochemical reduction of titanium dioxide to titanium in molten calcium chloride|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=2000|volume=407|issue=6802|pmid=11014188|pages=361–364|doi=10.1038/35030069|bibcode= 2000Natur.407..361C}}&lt;/ref&gt; consumes titanium dioxide powder (a refined form of rutile) as feedstock and produces titanium metal, either powder or sponge. The process involves fewer steps than the Kroll process and takes less time.&lt;ref name="Roza2008p23"&gt;{{harvnb|Roza|2008|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; If mixed oxide powders are used, the product is an [[alloy]].

Common titanium alloys are made by reduction. For example, cuprotitanium (rutile with [[copper]] added is reduced), ferrocarbon titanium (ilmenite reduced with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in an electric furnace), and manganotitanium (rutile with manganese or manganese oxides) are reduced.&lt;ref name="TI_Encarta2005"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Titanium|encyclopedia=Microsoft Encarta|date=2005|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569280/Titanium.html|accessdate=29 December 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061027112633/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569280/Titanium.html |archivedate= 27 October 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of [[oxygen]] content, with grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%).&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p453"/&gt; The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, [[creep (deformation)|creep]] resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Book of ASTM Standards (Volume 02.04: Non-ferrous Metals)|date=2006|author=ASTM International|publisher=ASTM International|location=[[West Conshohocken, PA]]|pages=section 2|isbn=978-0-8031-4086-8|nopp=true|authorlink=ASTM International|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCGIPQAACAAJ}} {{cite book|title=Annual Book of ASTM Standards (Volume 13.01: Medical Devices; Emergency Medical Services)|date=1998|author=ASTM International|publisher=ASTM International|location=[[West Conshohocken, PA]]|pages=sections 2 &amp; 13|isbn=978-0-8031-2452-3|nopp=true|authorlink=ASTM International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ASTM specifications, titanium alloys are also produced to meet aerospace and military specifications (SAE-AMS, MIL-T), ISO standards, and country-specific specifications, as well as proprietary end-user specifications for aerospace, military, medical, and industrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donachie|1988|pp=13–16, Appendices H and J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanium powder is manufactured using a [[flow production]] process known as the [[Armstrong process]]&lt;ref name="Roza2008p25"&gt;{{harvnb|Roza|2008|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is similar to the batch production Hunter process. A stream of titanium tetrachloride gas is added to a stream of [[molten]] sodium metal; the products (sodium chloride [[salt]] and titanium particles) is filtered from the extra sodium. Titanium is then separated from the salt by water washing. Both sodium and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more titanium tetrachloride.&lt;ref name="ECI online"&gt;{{cite web|title=Titanium|url=http://www.essentialchemicalindustry.org/metals/titanium.html|website=The Essential Chemical Industry online|publisher=CIEC Promoting Science at the University of York|location=York, UK|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[welding]] of titanium must be done in an inert atmosphere of [[argon]] or [[helium]] to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases (oxygen, [[nitrogen]], and [[hydrogen]]).&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/&gt; Contamination causes a variety of conditions, such as [[embrittlement]], which reduce the integrity of the assembly welds and lead to joint failure.

Commercially pure flat product (sheet, plate) can be formed readily, but processing must take into account the fact that the metal has a "memory" and tends to spring back. This is especially true of certain high-strength alloys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AWS G2.4/G2.4M:2007 Guide for the Fusion Welding of Titanium and Titanium Alloys |date=2006 |publisher=American Welding Society |place=Miami |url=http://pdfcast.org/pdf/titanium-design-and-fabrication-handbook-for-industrial-applications |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210022045/http://pdfcast.org/pdf/titanium-design-and-fabrication-handbook-for-industrial-applications |archivedate=10 December 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Titanium design and fabrication handbook for industrial applications |date=1997 |author=Titanium Metals Corporation |publisher=Titanium Metals Corporation |location=Dallas |url=http://www.timet.com/design%26fabframe.html |authorlink=Titanium Metals Corporation |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209014255/http://www.timet.com/design%26fabframe.html |archivedate=9 February 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titanium cannot be [[solder]]ed without first pre-[[plating]] it in a metal that is [[solderability|solderable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solderability|url=http://www.efunda.com/materials/solders/solderability.cfm|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal can be machined with the same equipment and the same processes as [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/&gt;

[[File:Titanzylinder.jpg|thumb|right|A titanium cylinder of "grade 2" quality]]
Titanium is used in [[steel]] as an alloying element ([[ferro-titanium]]) to reduce [[crystallite|grain size]] and as a deoxidizer, and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content.&lt;ref name="EBC"/&gt; Titanium is often alloyed with aluminium (to refine grain size), [[vanadium]], copper (to harden), [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[molybdenum]], and other metals.&lt;ref name="ECE738"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hampel|first=Clifford A.|date=1968|title=The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements|page=738|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|isbn=978-0-442-15598-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titanium mill products (sheet, plate, bar, wire, forgings, castings) find application in industrial, aerospace, recreational, and emerging markets. Powdered titanium is used in [[pyrotechnics]] as a source of bright-burning particles.

Welded titanium pipe and process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) are used in the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in oil and gas downhole applications and [[nickel]] [[hydrometallurgy]] for their high strength (e. g.: titanium beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both.

Titanium is used in many sporting goods: tennis rackets, golf clubs, lacrosse stick shafts; cricket, hockey, lacrosse, and football helmet grills, and bicycle frames and components. Although not a mainstream material for bicycle production, titanium bikes have been used by racing teams and [[Adventure Cycling|adventure cyclists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Joseph R.|title=Metals Handbook|publisher=ASM International|date=1998|page=584|isbn=978-0-87170-654-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IpEnvBtSfPQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanium alloys are used in spectacle frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by [[farrier]]s because they are lighter and more durable.&lt;ref name="Donachie2000"&gt;{{harvnb|Donachie|1988|pp=11, 255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|42.5|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Monument to Yuri Gagarin]], the first man to travel in space ({{coord|55|42|29.7|N|37|34|57.2|E|region:CN-62_type:landmark|display=inline}}), as well as the {{convert|110|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Monument to the Conquerors of Space]] on top of the [[Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics|Cosmonaut Museum]] in Moscow are made of titanium for the metal's attractive colour and association with rocketry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gruntman|first=Mike|title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry|page=457|isbn=978-1-56347-705-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2XY9KXxF8OEC|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, VA|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41EqJFxjA4wC&amp;pg=PA408|title=Titanium |chapter= Appearance Related Applications|isbn=978-3-540-71397-5|author1=Lütjering, Gerd|author2=Williams, James Case|date=12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] and the [[Cerritos Millennium Library]] were the first buildings in Europe and North America, respectively, to be sheathed in titanium panels.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p454"&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titanium sheathing was used in the Frederic C. Hamilton Building in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/dam/|title=Denver Art Museum, Frederic C. Hamilton Building|accessdate=26 December 2006|publisher=SPG Media|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of titanium's superior strength and light weight relative to other metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread in the manufacture of firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s PowerBook line).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=8 August 2009|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/stats/powerbook_g4_400.html|title=Apple PowerBook G4 400 (Original – Ti) Specs|work=everymac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some upmarket lightweight and corrosion-resistant tools, such as shovels and flashlights, are made of titanium or titanium alloys.

===Jewelry===
[[File:Anodized titanium table.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Relation between voltage and color for anodized titanium. (Cateb, 2010).]]
Because of its durability, titanium has become more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, [[titanium ring]]s).&lt;ref name="Donachie2000"/&gt; Its inertness makes it a good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also [[Titanium gold|alloyed with gold]] to produce an alloy that can be marketed as [[carat (purity)|24-carat]] gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://goldbulletin.org/assets/file/goldbulletin/downloads/Gafner_4_22.pdf |title=The development of 990 Gold-Titanium: its Production, use and Properties |author=Gafner, G. |journal=Gold Bulletin |date=1989 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=112–122 |doi=10.1007/BF03214709 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129195740/http://goldbulletin.org/assets/file/goldbulletin/downloads/Gafner_4_22.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanium's durability, light weight, and dent and corrosion resistance make it useful for [[watch]] cases.&lt;ref name="Donachie2000"/&gt; Some artists work with titanium to produce sculptures, decorative objects and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=8 August 2009 |url=http://www.titanium-arts.com/home.html |title=Fine Art and Functional Works in Titanium and Other Earth Elements |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513171451/http://www.titanium-arts.com/home.html |archivedate=13 May 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanium may be [[anodising|anodized]] to vary the thickness of the surface oxide layer, causing optical [[interference fringe]]s and a variety of bright colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/ed/encycl/art-a02-anodizing.htm |title=Electrochemistry Encyclopedia |author=Alwitt, Robert S. |date=2002 |accessdate=30 December 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702001336/http://electrochem.cwru.edu/ed/encycl/art-a02-anodizing.htm |archivedate=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this coloration and chemical inertness, titanium is a popular metal for [[body piercing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorgoodskin.com/tp/bodypiercing/|work=doctorgoodskin.com |title=Body Piercing Safety |accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanium has a minor use in dedicated non-circulating coins and medals. In 1999, Gibraltar released world's first titanium coin for the millennium celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pobjoy.com/us/world-firsts|title=World Firsts {{!}} British Pobjoy Mint|website=www.pobjoy.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gold Coast Titans]], an Australian rugby league team, award a medal of pure titanium to their player of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turgeon |first=Luke |title=Titanium Titan: Broughton immortalised |url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2007/09/20/2947_gold-coast-titans.html |newspaper=The Gold Coast Bulletin |date=20 September 2007 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928082012/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2007/09/20/2947_gold-coast-titans.html |archivedate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical===
{{Main|Titanium biocompatibility}}
Because titanium is [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]] (non-toxic and not rejected by the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets ([[joint replacement]]) and [[dental implant]]s that can stay in place for up to 20 years.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p452"&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totaljoints.info/orthopaedic_metal_alloys.htm|title=Orthopaedic Metal Alloys|publisher=Totaljoints.info|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Titanium plaatje voor pols.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Medical screws and plate used for repair fracture of the wrist, scale is in centimeters.]]
Titanium has the inherent ability to [[osseointegration|osseointegrate]], enabling use in [[dental implants]] that can last for over 30 years. This property is also useful for [[internal fixator|orthopedic implant]] applications.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p452"/&gt; These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity ([[Young's modulus]]) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and [[periprosthetic]] bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still more than twice that of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010/09/titanium-foams-replace-injured-bones.jsp|title=Titanium foams replace injured bones|journal=Research News |date=1 September 2010|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavine, Marc S., ''[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6372/173.6?et_rid=374427768&amp;et_cid=1784931 Make no bones about titanium]'',
Science Magazine, 2018.01.08, Volume 359, Issue 6372, pp. 173-174
DOI: 10.1126/science.359.6372.173-f&lt;/ref&gt;

Because titanium is non-[[ferromagnetic]], patients with titanium implants can be safely examined with [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p452"/&gt;

Titanium is used for the [[surgical instrument]]s used in [[image-guided surgery]], as well as wheelchairs, crutches, and any other products where high strength and low weight are desirable.

Titanium dioxide [[nanoparticle]]s are widely used in electronics and the delivery of [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinsino|first=Annalisa|last2=Russo|first2=Roberta|last3=Bonaventura|first3=Rosa|last4=Brunelli|first4=Andrea|last5=Marcomini|first5=Antonio|last6=Matranga|first6=Valeria|date=2015-09-28|title=Titanium dioxide nanoparticles stimulate sea urchin immune cell phagocytic activity involving TLR/p38 MAPK-mediated signalling pathway|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|doi=10.1038/srep14492|pmc=4585977|pmid=26412401|page=14492|bibcode=2015NatSR...514492P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear waste storage===
Because of it is corrosion resistance, containers made of titanium have been studied for the long-term storage of nuclear waste. Containers lasting more than 100,000 years are thought possible with manufacturing conditions that minimize material defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1515/CORRREV.2000.18.4-5.331 |title= Hydrogen Absorption and the Lifetime Performance of Titanium Nuclear Waste Containers |journal= Corrosion Reviews |volume= 18 |issue= 4–5 |year= 2000 |last1= Shoesmith |first1= D. W. |last2= Noel |first2= J. J. |last3= Hardie |first3= D. |last4= Ikeda |first4= B. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A titanium "drip shield" could also be installed over containers of other types to enhance their longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proof of Safety at Yucca Mountain|journal=Science|date=2005|volume= 310|issue=5747|pages=447|author1=Carter, L. J. |author2=Pigford, T. J. |doi=10.1126/science.1112786 |pmid=16239463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioremediation==
The fungal species ''[[Marasmius oreades]]'' and ''[[Hypholoma capnoides]]'' can bioconvert titanium in titanium polluted soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2010/Corfu/EDUCATION/EDUCATION-04.pdf|title=The Mycoremediation of Metals Polluted Soils Using Wild Growing Species of Mushrooms|journal=Engineering Education|author1=Elekes, Carmen Cristina|author2=Busuioc, Gabriela|access-date=28 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231241/http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2010/Corfu/EDUCATION/EDUCATION-04.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
[[File:Kopiva.JPG|thumb|alt=The dark green dentated elliptic leaves of a nettle|[[Urtica dioica|Nettles]] contain up to 80 parts per million of titanium.]]
Titanium is non-toxic even in large doses and does not play any natural role inside the [[human body]].&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p451"/&gt; An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p451"/&gt; It does, however, sometimes [[bioaccumulation|bio-accumulate]] in tissues that contain [[silica]]. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and [[yellow nail syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berglund|first=Fredrik|author2=Carlmark, Bjorn |title=Titanium, Sinusitis, and the Yellow Nail Syndrome|journal=Biological Trace Element Research|date=October 2011|pmc=3176400|volume=143|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1007/s12011-010-8828-5|pmid=20809268}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown mechanism in [[plant]]s may use titanium to stimulate the production of [[carbohydrate]]s and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 [[part per million]] (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and [[horsetail]] and [[Urtica|nettle]] contain up to 80 ppm.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p451"/&gt;

As a powder or in the form of metal shavings, titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in [[air]], an explosion hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotell |first=Catherine Mary |author2=Sprague, J. A. |author3=Smidt, F. A. |title=ASM Handbook: Surface Engineering |publisher=ASM International |date=1994 |edition=10th |page=836 |isbn=978-0-87170-384-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RGtsPjqUwy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water and [[carbon dioxide]] are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire; [[fire classes|Class D]] dry powder agents must be used instead.&lt;ref name="HistoryAndUse"/&gt;

When used in the production or handling of [[chlorine]], titanium should not be exposed to dry chlorine gas because it may result in a titanium–chlorine fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Compressed Gas Association|title=Handbook of compressed gases|publisher=Springer|date=1999|edition=4th|page=323|isbn=978-0-412-78230-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WSLULtCG9JgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even wet chlorine presents a fire hazard when extreme weather conditions cause unexpected drying.

Titanium can catch fire when a fresh, non-oxidized surface comes in contact with [[liquid oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Robert E.|others=National Fire Prevention Association|title=Fire and Life Safety Inspection Manual|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|date=2002|edition=8th|page=45|isbn=978-0-87765-472-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2fHsoobsCNwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh metal may be exposed when the oxidized surface is struck or scratched with a hard object, or when mechanical strain causes a crack. This poses a limitation to its use in liquid oxygen systems, such as those in the aerospace industry. Because titanium tubing impurities can cause fires when exposed to oxygen, titanium is prohibited in gaseous oxygen respiration systems. Steel tubing is used for high pressure systems (3,000 p.s.i.) and aluminium tubing for low pressure systems.

A '''transformer''' is a static electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more [[Electrical network|circuits]]. A varying current in one coil of the transformer produces a varying [[magnetic flux]], which, in turn, induces a varying [[electromotive force]] (emf) or "[[voltage]]" across a second coil wound around the same core.
[[Electric power]] can be transferred between the two coils, without a metallic connection between the two circuits. [[Faraday's law of induction]] discovered in 1831 described the induced voltage effect in any secondary coil due to changing magnetic flux cutting it.

Transformers are used to increase or decrease the alternating voltages in electric power applications.

Since the invention of the first constant-potential transformer in 1885, transformers have become essential for the [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electric power distribution|distribution]], and utilization of alternating current electrical energy.&lt;ref name="Bedell (1942)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=864|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications. Transformers range in size from [[Radio Frequency|RF]] transformers less than a cubic centimeter in volume to units interconnecting the [[power grid]] weighing hundreds of tons.

'''Ideal transformer equations'''

By Faraday's law of induction:

&lt;math&gt;V_\text{P} = -N_\text{P} \frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; . . . (eq. 1){{efn|With turns of the winding oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field lines, the flux is the product of the [[magnetic flux density]] and the core area, the magnetic field varying with time according to the excitation of the primary. The expression dΦ/dt, defined as the derivative of magnetic flux Φ with time t, provides a measure of rate of magnetic flux in the core and hence of EMF induced in the respective winding. The negative sign in eq. 1 &amp; eq. 2 is consistent with Lenz's law and Faraday's law in that by convention EMF "induced by an ''increase'' of magnetic flux linkages is ''opposite'' to the direction that would be given by the [[Right-hand rule|right-hand rule]]."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skilling|1962|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V_\text{S} = -N_\text{S} \frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; . . . (eq. 2)

Where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Derivative|instantaneous]] [[voltage]], &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of turns in a winding, dΦ/dt is the [[derivative]] of the magnetic flux Φ through one turn of the winding over time ('''''t'''''), and subscripts &lt;sub&gt;'''P'''&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;'''S'''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes primary and secondary.

Combining the ratio of eq. 1 &amp; eq. 2:

Turns ratio &lt;math&gt;=\frac{V_\text{p}}{V_\text{S}} = \frac{N_\text{P}}{N_\text{S}}=a&lt;/math&gt; . . . (eq. 3)

Where for a step-down transformer ''a'' &gt; 1, for a step-up transformer ''a'' &lt; 1, and
for an [[isolation transformer]] ''a'' = 1.

By law of [[conservation of energy]], [[Apparent power|apparent]], [[real power|real]] and [[reactive power|reactive]] power are each conserved in the input and output:

&lt;math&gt;S=I_\text{P} V_\text{P} = I_\text{S} V_\text{S}&lt;/math&gt; . . . . (eq. 4)

Where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is conserved power and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is [[Electrical current|current]].

Combining eq. 3 &amp; eq. 4 with this endnote{{efn|Although ideal transformer's winding inductances are each infinitely high, the square root of winding inductances' ratio is equal to the turns ratio.}}&lt;ref name="Brenner18-1"&gt;{{harvnb|Brenner|Javid|1959|loc=§18-1 Symbols and Polarity of Mutual Inductance, pp.=589–590}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the ideal transformer [[identity function|identity]]:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_\text{P}}{V_\text{S}} = \frac{I_\text{S}}{I_\text{P}}=\frac{N_\text{P}}{N_\text{S}}=\sqrt{\frac{L_\text{P}}{L_\text{S}}}=a&lt;/math&gt; . (eq. 5)

Where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is winding self-inductance.

By [[Ohm's law]] and ideal transformer identity:

===Ideal transformer===
An ideal transformer is a theoretical, [[Linearity|linear]] transformer that is lossless and perfectly [[inductive coupling|coupled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IEV 131-12-78||loc=Ideal transformer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect coupling implies infinitely high core [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] and winding inductances and zero net [[magnetomotive force]].&lt;ref name="Brenner18-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Brenner|Javid|1959|loc=§18-6 The Ideal Transformer, pp.=598–600}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This also implies the following: Input impedance is infinite when secondary is open and zero when secondary is shorted; there is zero phase-shift through an ideal transformer; input and output power and reactive volt-ampere are each conserved; these three statements apply for any frequency above zero and periodic waveforms are conserved.&lt;ref name="Crosby1958-145"&gt;{{harvnb|Crosby|1958|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Transformer3d col3.svg|left|thumb|325px|Ideal transformer and induction law{{efn|Direction of transformer currents is according to [[Right-hand rule#Direction associated with a rotation|the Right-Hand Rule.]]}}]]

A&amp;nbsp;varying current in the transformer's primary winding attempts to create a varying magnetic flux in the transformer core and therefore a varying magnetic flux cutting the secondary winding. This varying flux at the secondary winding induces a varying [[electromotive force]] (EMF) or voltage in the secondary winding due to electromagnetic induction and the secondary current so produced creates a flux equal and opposite to that produced by the primary winding, in accordance with [[Lenz's law]]. The result is that there is zero net flux in the core.
The primary and secondary windings are wrapped around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability{{efn|Windings of real transformers are usually wound around very high permeability [[Magnetic core|ferromagnetic cores]] but can also be [[Transformer#Cores|air-core]] wound.}} so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a [[voltage source]] connected to the primary winding and load [[electrical impedance|impedance]] connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions and the core flux cancels to zero. (See also [[transformer#Polarity|Polarity]].)

According to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer,&lt;ref name="Hameyer2-1-2"&gt;{{harvnb|Hameyer|2004|loc=§2.1.2 Second Maxwell-Equation (Faraday's Law) in Section 2 - Basics, pp. 11&amp;ndash;12, equations 2-12 to 2-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a voltage is induced in each winding proportional to its number of windings. Thus, referring to the equations shown in the sidebox at right, according to Faraday's law, we have primary and secondary winding voltages defined by eq.&amp;nbsp;1 &amp; eq.&amp;nbsp;2, respectively.&lt;ref name="Heathcote1998-2"&gt;{{harvnb|Heathcote|1998|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary EMF is sometimes termed [[Counter-electromotive force|counter EMF]].&lt;ref name="Rajut (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rajput|first1=R.K.|title=Alternating current s|date=2002|publisher=Laxmi Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788170082224|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mcT2MXb1-4wC&amp;pg=PA107|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calvert2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Calvert|2001||}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Section [[Leakage inductance#Leakage factor and inductance|Leakage factor and inductance]] of [[Leakage inductance]] derives a transformer equivalent in terms of various measurable inductances (winding, self, leakage, magnetizing and mutual inductances) and turns ratio, which are collectively essential to rigorous counter EMF understanding.}} This is in accordance with [[Lenz's law]], which states that induction of EMF always opposes development of any such change in magnetic field.

The transformer winding voltage ratio is thus shown to be directly proportional to the winding turns ratio according to eq.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;ref name="Winders2002-20"&gt;{{harvnb|Winders, Jr.|2002|pp=20–21|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hameyer3-2"&gt;{{harvnb|Hameyer|2004|loc=§3.2 Definition of Transformer Ratio in Section 3 - Transformers, p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"The turn ratio of a transformer is the ratio of the number of turns in the high-voltage winding to that in the low-voltage winding." (Common usage has evolved over time from 'turn ratio' to 'turns ratio'.)}} However, some sources use the inverse definition.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Wilhelm C.|author2=Robbins, Allan H. |title=Circuit analysis : theory and practice|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Clifton Park, NY|isbn=978-1-1332-8100-9|page=990|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdMKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA990&amp;dq=turns+ratio+convention&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zGMkVP-WE4SoogSWkIHICw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=turns%20ratio%20convention&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A step-down transformer converts a high voltage to a lower voltage while a step-up transformer converts a low voltage to a higher voltage, an [[isolation transformer]] having 1:1 turns ratio with output voltage the same as input voltage.}}

According to the law of [[conservation of energy]], any load impedance connected to the ideal transformer's secondary winding results in conservation of apparent, real and reactive power consistent with&amp;nbsp;eq.&amp;nbsp;4.

The ideal transformer [[identity function|identity]] shown in eq.&amp;nbsp;5 is a reasonable approximation for the typical commercial transformer, with voltage ratio and winding turns ratio both being inversely proportional to the corresponding current ratio.

By [[Ohm's law]] and the ideal transformer identity:
* the secondary circuit load impedance can be expressed as eq.&amp;nbsp;6
* the apparent load impedance ''referred'' to the primary circuit is derived in eq.&amp;nbsp;7 to be equal to the turns ratio squared times the secondary circuit load impedance.&lt;ref name="Flanagan1993-1"&gt;{{harvnb|Flanagan|1993|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tcheslavski (2008)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Tcheslavski|first=Gleb V.|title=Slide 13 Impedance Transformation in Lecture 4: Transformers|accessdate=17 April 2013|book-title=ELEN 3441 Fundamentals of Power Engineering|publisher=Lamar University (TSU system member)|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real transformer===
[[File:Transformer Flux.svg|right|thumb|308x308px|Leakage flux of a transformer]]

====Deviations from ideal transformer====
The ideal transformer model neglects the following basic linear aspects in real transformers:

(a) Core losses, collectively called magnetizing current losses, consisting of&lt;ref name="Say1983"&gt;{{harvnb|Say|1983|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Magnetic core#Core loss|Hysteresis]] losses due to nonlinear magnetic effects in the transformer core, and
* [[Magnetic core#Core loss|Eddy current]] losses due to joule heating in the core that are proportional to the square of the transformer's applied voltage.

(b) Unlike the ideal model, the windings in a real transformer have non-zero resistances and inductances associated with:
* [[Joule heating|Joule losses]] due to resistance in the primary and secondary windings&lt;ref name="Say1983"/&gt;
* Leakage flux that escapes from the core and passes through one winding only resulting in primary and secondary reactive impedance.

(c) similar to an [[inductor]], parasitic capacitance and self-resonance phenomenon due to the electric field distribution. Three kinds of parasitic capacitance are usually considered and the closed-loop equations are provided &lt;ref&gt;L. Dalessandro, F. d. S. Cavalcante, and J. W. Kolar, "Self-Capacitance of High-Voltage Transformers," IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, vol. 22, no. 5, pp. 2081-2092, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Capacitance between adjacent turns in any one layer;
* Capacitance between adjacent layers;
* Capacitance between the core and the layer(s) adjacent to the core;

The transformer model with capacitance is quite complicated, and is rarely attempted; even the [[Media:TREQCCT.jpg|‘real’ transformer model’s equivalent circuit]] does not include the parasitic capacitance. However, the capacitance can be measured by comparing open-circuit inductance to a short-circuit inductance.{{explain|date=December 2017}}.
[[File:2. test setups.png|600px|center|transformer capacitance test]]

====Leakage flux====
{{Main|Leakage inductance}}

The ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.&lt;ref name="McLaren1984-68"&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1984|pp=68–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such flux is termed ''leakage flux'', and results in [[leakage inductance]] in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] with the mutually coupled transformer windings.&lt;ref name="calvert2001"/&gt; Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior [[voltage regulation]], causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.&lt;ref name="McLaren1984-68"/&gt; Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.

In some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] current it will supply.&lt;ref name="calvert2001"/&gt; Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit [[negative resistance]], such as [[electric arc]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-]] and [[sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-]] vapor lamps and [[neon sign]]s or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as [[arc welding|electric arc welders]].&lt;ref name="Say1983-485"&gt;{{harvnb|Say|1983|p=485|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terman|first=Frederick E.|title=Electronic and Radio Engineering| edition=4th |year=1955|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[saturable reactor]] exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.

Knowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel. It can be shown that if the percent impedance{{efn|Percent impedance is the ratio of the voltage drop in the secondary from no load to full load; and is here represented with the variable ''Z''.&lt;ref name="Heathcote1998-4"&gt;{{harvnb|Heathcote|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some texts, ''Z'' is used for absolute impedance instead.}} and associated winding leakage reactance-to-resistance (''X''/''R'') ratio of two transformers were hypothetically exactly the same, the transformers would share power in proportion to their respective volt-ampere ratings (e.g. 500&amp;nbsp;[[Kilovolt-ampere|kVA]] unit in parallel with 1,000&amp;nbsp;kVA unit, the larger unit would carry twice the current). However, the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant. Also, the Z impedance and X/R ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary, corresponding 1,000&amp;nbsp;kVA and 500&amp;nbsp;kVA units' values being, to illustrate, respectively, ''Z'' ≈ 5.75%, ''X''/''R'' ≈ 3.75 and ''Z'' ≈ 5%, ''X''/''R'' ≈ 4.75.&lt;ref name="Knowlton6-97"&gt;{{harvnb|Knowlton|1949|loc=§6-97 Nomenclature for Parallel Operation, pp. 585-586}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

====Equivalent circuit====
{{See also|Induction motor#Steinmetz equivalent circuit|l1=Steinmetz equivalent circuit}}

Referring to the diagram, a practical transformer's physical behavior may be represented by an [[equivalent circuit]] model, which can incorporate an ideal transformer.&lt;ref name="daniels1985-47"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|1985|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winding joule losses and leakage reactances are represented by the following series loop impedances of the model:
* Primary winding: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;
* Secondary winding: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;.
In normal course of circuit equivalence transformation, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; are in practice usually referred to the primary side by multiplying these impedances by the turns ratio squared, (''N''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;/''N''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Image:TREQCCT.jpg|thumb|500px|Real transformer equivalent circuit]]
Core loss and reactance is represented by the following shunt leg impedances of the model:
* Core or iron losses: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;
* Magnetizing reactance: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;.
''R''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; are collectively termed the ''magnetizing branch'' of the model.

Core losses are caused mostly by hysteresis and eddy current effects in the core and are proportional to the square of the core flux for operation at a given frequency.&lt;ref name="Say1983-142"&gt;{{harvnb|Say|1983|pp=142–143|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; to maintain mutual flux in the core. Magnetizing current is in phase with the flux, the relationship between the two being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits.&lt;ref name="Say1983-142"/&gt; With [[sinusoidal]] supply, core flux lags the induced EMF by&amp;nbsp;90°. With open-circuited secondary winding, magnetizing branch current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; equals transformer no-load current.&lt;ref name="daniels1985-47"/&gt;
[[File:Instrument Transformer.jpg|thumb|right|223x223px|Instrument transformer, with polarity dot and X1 markings on LV side terminal]]
The resulting model, though sometimes termed 'exact' equivalent circuit based on [[linearity]] assumptions, retains a number of approximations.&lt;ref name="daniels1985-47"/&gt; Analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances. This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances.

Transformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: [[open-circuit test]],{{efn|A standardized open-circuit or unloaded transformer test called the [[Epstein frame]] can also be used for the characterization of magnetic properties of soft magnetic materials including especially electrical steels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/mysearchajax?Openform&amp;key=60404-2&amp;sorting=&amp;start=1&amp;onglet=1 IEC Std 60404-2 Magnetic Materials &amp;ndash; Part 2: Methods of Measurement of the Magnetic Properties . . .]&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[short-circuit test]], winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.

===Transformer EMF equation===
{{anchor|Transformer universal EMF equation}}
If the flux in the core is purely [[sinusoidal]], the relationship for either winding between its '''[[root mean square|rms]] voltage''' ''E''&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; of the winding, and the supply frequency ''f'', number of turns ''N'', core cross-sectional area ''a'' in m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and peak magnetic flux density ''B''&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt; in Wb/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or T (tesla) is given by the universal EMF equation:&lt;ref name="Say1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="universalppts"&gt;{{harvnb|Universalppts||loc=EMF equations of a single phase transformer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; E_\text{rms} = {\frac {2 \pi f N a B_\text{peak}} {\sqrt{2}}} \approx 4.44 f N a B_\text{peak}&lt;/math&gt;

If the flux does not contain even [[harmonics]] the following equation can be used for '''half-cycle average voltage''' ''E''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; of any waveshape:

&lt;math&gt; E_\text{avg}= 4 f N a B_\text{peak} \!&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic transformer parameters==
===Polarity===
A [[dot convention]] is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings. Positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding's ‘dot’ end induces positive polarity voltage exiting the secondary winding's ‘dot’ end.&lt;ref name="Ula2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|Ula|Webb|2005|loc=172, 1017; §2.5.5 Transformers &amp; §10.1.3 The Ideal Transformer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kothari2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Kothari|Nagrath|2010|loc=p. 73, §3.7 Transformer Testing in Chapter 3 Transformers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brenner18-6-589"&gt;{{harvnb|Brenner|Javid|1959|loc=§18-6 The Ideal Transformer, p.=589}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|ANSI/IEEE Standard C57.13 defines polarity in terms of the relative instantaneous directions of the currents entering the primary terminals and leaving the secondary terminals during most of each half cycle, the word 'instantaneous' differentiating from say phasor current.&lt;ref name="Crompton (ND)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Polarity Markings on Instrument Transformers|url=http://www.cromptonusa.com/Polarity%20on%20Transformers.pdf|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANSI/IEEE C57.13"&gt;{{cite book|title=ANSI/IEEE C57.13, ANS Requirements for Instrument Transformers|year=1978 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2654|publisher=IEEE|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=0-7381-4299-9|page=4 (§3.26)}} (superseded, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|Transformer polarity can also be identified by terminal markings H0,H1,H2... on primary terminals and X1,X2, (and Y1,Y2, Z1,Z2,Z3... if windings are available) on secondary terminals.

The designated terminals H1,X1, (and Y1, Z1 if available) indicate same instantaneous polarities for each winding as in the dot convention.&lt;ref name="GE Digital (ND)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Connections - Polarity|url=http://www.gedigitalenergy.com/products/buyersguide/ct_sc.pdf|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|When a voltage transformer is operated with sinusoidal voltages in its normal frequency range and power level the voltage polarity at the output dot is the same (plus minus a few degrees) as the voltage polarity at the input dot.}}

Three-phase transformers used in electric power systems will have a nameplate that indicate the phase relationships between their terminals. This may be in the form of a [[phasor]] diagram, or using an alpha-numeric code to show the type of internal connection (wye or delta) for each winding.

===Effect of frequency===
The EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.&lt;ref name="Say1983"/&gt; By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor [[skin effect]] also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400&amp;nbsp;Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 400 Hz Electrical Systems | work = Aerospaceweb.org | url = http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0219.shtml | accessdate = May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, frequencies used for some [[railway electrification system]]s were much lower (e.g. 16.7&amp;nbsp;Hz and 25&amp;nbsp;Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early [[traction motor|electric traction motors]]. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages (e.g. 15&amp;nbsp;kV) were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.

[[File:Power Transformer Over-Excitation.gif|thumb|Power transformer over-excitation condition caused by decreased frequency; flux (green), iron core's magnetic characteristics (red) and magnetizing current (blue).]]
Operation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. For example, transformers may need to be equipped with 'volts per hertz' over-excitation, [[ANSI device number|ANSI function 24]], [[protective relay|relays]] to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.

One example is in traction transformers used for [[electric multiple unit]] and [[High-speed rail|high-speed]] train service operating across regions with different electrical standards.&lt;ref name="ttransfo"&gt;{{harvnb|IEV 811-36-02||loc=Traction transformer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50&amp;nbsp;Hz down to 16.7&amp;nbsp;Hz and rated up to 25&amp;nbsp;kV) while being suitable for multiple AC asynchronous motor and DC converters and motors with varying harmonics mitigation filtering requirements.

At much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small and cheap transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices and complex integrated circuits made switch-mode power supplies viable, to generate a high frequency from a much lower one ([[DC-to-DC converter|or DC]]), change the voltage level with a small transformer, and, if necessary, rectify the changed voltage.

Large power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.&lt;ref name="Gururaj (1963)"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gururaj| first=B.I.| title=Natural Frequencies of 3-Phase Transformer Windings| journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems|volume=82| issue=66|date=June 1963| pages=318–329| doi=10.1109/TPAS.1963.291359| url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?isnumber=4072786&amp;arnumber=4072800&amp;count=25&amp;index=12| bibcode=1963ITPAS..82..318G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy losses===
Transformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses. Transformers' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity. The efficiency of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent.&lt;ref name="De Keulenaer2001"&gt;{{harvnb|De Keulenaer|Chapman|Fassbinder|McDermott|2001||}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kubo| first = T.|last2 = Sachs| first2 = H.| last3 = Nadel| first3 = S.| title = Opportunities for New Appliance and Equipment Efficiency Standards| publisher = [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] | at = p. 39, fig. 1| year = 2001| url = http://www.aceee.org/research-report/a016| accessdate = June 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Experimental transformers using [[superconductivity|superconducting]] windings achieve efficiencies of 99.85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Riemersma| first = H.| title = Application of Superconducting Technology to Power Transformers| journal = IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems| volume = PAS-100| issue = 7| year = 1981| url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=0043264EA&amp;q=superconducting+transformer&amp;uid=790516502&amp;setcookie=yes| doi = 10.1109/TPAS.1981.316682| page = 3398| last2 = Eckels| first2 = P.| last3 = Barton| first3 = M.| last4 = Murphy| first4 = J.| last5 = Litz| first5 = D.| last6 = Roach| first6 = J.| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070901220758/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=0043264EA&amp;q=superconducting+transformer&amp;uid=790516502&amp;setcookie=yes| archivedate = 2007-09-01| df = | bibcode = 1981ITPAS.100.3398R}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As transformer losses vary with load, it is often useful to tabulate no-load loss, full-load loss, half-load loss, and so on. Hysteresis and [[eddy current]] losses are constant at all load levels and dominate overwhelmingly without load, while variable winding [[electrical resistance|joule losses]] dominating increasingly as load increases. The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing [[energy efficient transformer]]s for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality [[Electrical steel|silicon steel]], or even [[Electrical steel#Amorphous steel|amorphous steel]] for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost. The choice of construction represents a [[trade-off]] between initial cost and operating cost.&lt;ref name="Heathcote1998-41"&gt;{{harvnb|Heathcote|1998|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transformer losses arise from:
; '''Winding joule losses'''
:Current flowing through a winding's conductor causes [[joule heating]]. As frequency increases, skin effect and [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] causes the winding's resistance and, hence, losses to increase.
;[[magnetic core#Core loss|Core losses]]
:; '''Hysteresis losses'''
::Each time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost due to [[Magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]] within the core. According to Steinmetz's formula, the heat energy due to hysteresis is given by
:::&lt;math&gt;W_\text{h}\approx\eta\beta^{1.6}_{\text{max}}&lt;/math&gt;, and,

:: [[Eddy current]]s are produced in the metal transformer core and cause heating of the core. The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness.&lt;ref name="Heathcote1998-41"/&gt; Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of plates electrically insulated from each other, rather than a solid block; all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores.

==Construction==

===Cores ===
Closed-core transformers are constructed in 'core form' or 'shell form'. When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings are surrounded by the core, the transformer is shell form.&lt;ref name="Del Vecchio2002-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cform"&gt;{{harvnb|IEV 421-01-07||loc=Core-form transformer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sform"&gt;{{harvnb|IEV 421-01-09||loc=Shell-form transformer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils.&lt;ref name="Del Vecchio2002-10"&gt;{{harvnb|Del Vecchio|Poulin|Feghali|Shah|2002|pp=10–11, Fig. 1.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core form design tends to, as a general rule, be more economical, and therefore more prevalent, than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications at the lower end of their voltage and power rating ranges (less than or equal to, nominally, 230&amp;nbsp;kV or 75&amp;nbsp;MVA). At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent.&lt;ref name="Del Vecchio2002-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowlton6-41"&gt;{{harvnb|Knowlton|1949|loc=§6-41 The characteristic features, p. 562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRTSG (2005)"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hydroelectric Research and Technical Services Group|title=Transformers: Basics, Maintenance, and Diagnostics|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps113746/Trnsfrmr.pdf|publisher=U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation|accessdate=Mar 27, 2012|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US Army Corps of Engineers1994"&gt;{{harvnb|US Army Corps of Engineers|1994|loc=EM 1110-2-3006, Chapter 4 Power Transformers, p=4-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shell form design tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher MVA applications because, though more labor-intensive to manufacture, shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kVA-to-weight ratio, better short-circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage.&lt;ref name="US Army Corps of Engineers1994"/&gt;

====Laminated steel cores====
[[Image:Transformer.filament.agr.jpg|thumb|220px|Laminated core transformer showing edge of laminations at top of photo]]
Transformers for use at power or audio frequencies typically have cores made of high permeability [[silicon steel]].&lt;ref name="Hindmarsh1977-29"&gt;{{harvnb|Hindmarsh|1977|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steel has a permeability many times that of [[free space]] and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;{{harvnb|Gottlieb|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy current losses, and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires.&lt;ref name="allan"/&gt; Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use. Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.&lt;ref name="Kulkarni2004-36"&gt;{{harvnb|Kulkarni|Khaparde|2004|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[#Transformer universal EMF equation|transformer universal EMF equation]] implies an acceptably large core cross-sectional area to avoid [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]].&lt;ref name="Say1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="universalppts"/&gt;{{efn|IEC's IEV-121-12-59 defines magnetic saturation as the "state of a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic substance in which magnetic polarization or magnetization cannot be significantly increased by increasing the magnetic field strength."}}

The effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux, and so reduce their magnitude. Thinner laminations reduce losses,&lt;ref name="Hindmarsh1977-29"/&gt; but are more laborious and expensive to construct.&lt;ref name="McLyman2004-3-9"&gt;{{harvnb|McLyman|2004|pp=3-9 to 3-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thin laminations are generally used on high-frequency transformers, with some of very thin steel laminations able to operate up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.

[[Image:Laminering av kärna.svg|thumb|upright|Laminating the core greatly reduces eddy-current losses]]

One common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of [[E-shaped]] steel sheets capped with [[I-shaped]] pieces, leading to its name of 'E-I transformer'.&lt;ref name="McLyman2004-3-9"/&gt; Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap.&lt;ref name="McLyman2004-3-9"/&gt; They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.

A steel core's [[remanence]] means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed. When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high [[inrush current]] until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied AC waveform.&lt;ref name="Harlow2004-2"&gt;{{harvnb|Harlow|2004|loc=§2.1.7 &amp; §2.1.6.2.1 in Section §2.1 Power Transformers by H. Jin Sim and Scott H. Digby in Chapter 2 Equipment Types}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overcurrent protection devices such as [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]] must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass. On transformers connected to long, overhead power transmission lines, induced currents due to [[Geomagnetically induced current|geomagnetic disturbances]] during [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]] can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Distribution transformers can achieve low no-load losses by using cores made with low-loss high-permeability silicon steel or [[Amorphous#Metallic glass|amorphous (non-crystalline) metal alloy]]. The higher initial cost of the core material is offset over the life of the transformer by its lower losses at light load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Hasegawa| first = Ryusuke| title = Present Status of Amorphous Soft Magnetic Alloys| journal =Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials| volume =215-216| pages = 240–245| date = June 2, 2000| doi = 10.1016/S0304-8853(00)00126-8 | bibcode =2000JMMM..215..240H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solid cores====
Powdered iron cores are used in circuits such as switch-mode power supplies that operate above mains frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical [[resistivity]]. For frequencies extending beyond the [[Very high frequency|VHF band]], cores made from non-conductive magnetic [[ceramic]] materials called [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are common.&lt;ref name="McLyman2004-3-9"/&gt; Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the [[coupling coefficient (inductors)|coupling coefficient]] (and [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.

====Toroidal cores====
[[Image:Small toroidal transformer.jpg|thumb|right|Small toroidal core transformer]]
Toroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of [[silicon steel]] or [[permalloy]] wound into a coil, powdered iron, or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]].&lt;ref name="McLyman2004-3-1"&gt;{{harvnb|McLyman|2004|p=3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IEV 815-16-12||loc=Toroidal transformers}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strip construction ensures that the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's [[reluctance]]. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.&lt;ref name="Say1983-485"/&gt; The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating [[electromagnetic interference]].

Toroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see [[transformer#Classification parameters|Classification parameters]] below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.

Ferrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10&amp;nbsp;kVA, and practically none above 25&amp;nbsp;kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magneticsmagazine.com/main/articles/toroidal-line-power-transformers-power-ratings-tripled/|title=Toroidal Line Power Transformers. Power Ratings Tripled. {{!}} Magnetics Magazine|website=www.magneticsmagazine.com|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Air cores====
A physical core is not an absolute requisite and a functioning transformer can be produced simply by placing the windings near each other, an arrangement termed an "air-core" transformer. The air which comprises the magnetic circuit is essentially lossless, and so an air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.&lt;ref name="calvert2001"/&gt; The magnetizing inductance is drastically reduced by the lack of a magnetic core, resulting in large magnetizing currents and losses if used at low frequencies. A large number of turns can be used to increase magnetizing inductance, but doing so increases winding resistance and leakage inductance. Air-core transformers are unsuitable for use in power distribution.&lt;ref name="calvert2001"/&gt; They have however very high frequency capability, and are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Reuben| last = Lee| title = Air-Core Transformers| work = Electronic Transformers and Circuits| url = http://www.vias.org/eltransformers/lee_electronic_transformers_07b_22.html | accessdate=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which a satisfactory coupling coefficient is maintained by carefully overlapping the primary and secondary windings. Air cores are also used for [[Resonant inductive coupling|resonant transformers]] such as Tesla coils, where they can achieve reasonably low loss despite the low magnetizing inductance.

===Windings===
[[Image:Transformer-hightolow smaller.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Windings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage.]]
[[Image:transformer min stray field geometry.svg|thumb|left|250px|Cut view through transformer windings.]]

High-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided [[Litz wire]] to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses.&lt;ref name="dixon"&gt;{{Cite conference | first = Lloyd| last = Dixon| book-title = Magnetics Design Handbook| title = Power Transformer Design| url = http://focus.ti.com/lit/ml/slup126/slup126.pdf| year=2001| publisher = Texas Instruments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings.&lt;ref name="CEGB1982"/&gt; Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.&lt;ref name="CEGB1982"/&gt;

The windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.

Power-frequency transformers may have ''taps'' at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load [[tap changer]]s are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as [[arc furnace]] transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A [[Center tap|center-tapped transformer]] is often used in the output stage of an audio power [[amplifier]] in a [[Push-pull converter|push-pull circuit]]. Modulation transformers in [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] transmitters are very similar.

Dry-type transformer winding insulation systems can be either of standard open-wound 'dip-and-bake' construction or of higher quality designs that include [[vacuum|vacuum pressure impregnation]] (VPI), [[vacuum|vacuum pressure encapsulation]] (VPE), and [[Transformer types#Cast resin transformer|cast coil encapsulation]] processes.&lt;ref name="Lane (2007)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Keith (2007)|title=The Basics of Large Dry-Type Transformers|url=http://ecmweb.com/content/basics-large-dry-type-transformers|publisher=EC&amp;M|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the VPI process, a combination of heat, vacuum and pressure is used to thoroughly seal, bind, and eliminate entrained air voids in the winding polyester resin insulation coat layer, thus increasing resistance to corona. VPE windings are similar to VPI windings but provide more protection against environmental effects, such as from water, dirt or corrosive ambients, by multiple dips including typically in terms of final epoxy coat.&lt;ref name="Heathcote1998-720"&gt;{{harvnb|Heathcote|1998|pp=720–723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tank of liquid filled transformers often has radiators through which the liquid coolant circulates by natural convection or fins.

Some transformers, instead of being liquid-filled, have their windings enclosed in sealed, pressurized tanks and cooled by [[nitrogen]] or [[sulfur hexafluoride]] gas.&lt;ref name="Kulkarni2004-2"/&gt;

Experimental power transformers in the 500‐to‐1,000&amp;nbsp;kVA range have been built with [[liquid nitrogen]] or [[liquid helium|helium]] cooled [[superconductivity|superconducting]] windings, which eliminates winding losses without affecting core losses.&lt;ref name="Mehta (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mehta|first=S.P.|author2=Aversa, N.|author3=Walker, M.S.|title=Transforming Transformers [Superconducting windings]|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=Jul 1997|volume=34|issue=7|pages=43–49|doi=10.1109/6.609815|url=http://www.superpower-inc.com/files/T141+IEEE+Spectrum+XFR.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pansini1999-66"&gt;{{harvnb|Pansini|1999|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insulation drying===
Construction of oil-filled transformers requires that the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried of residual moisture before the oil is introduced. Drying is carried out at the factory, and may also be required as a field service. Drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core, by circulating externally heated transformer oil, or by vapor-phase drying (VPD) where an evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core. The VPD process most often uses kerosene as the heat exchanging fluid. In addition to decreasing the moisture content in the insulation, the kerosene acts as a cleaning solvent which takes out any dust and dirt from the insulation surfaces. Compared to a conventional hot air drying process, the vapor-phase drying process decreases the drying time by 40% to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saha|first1=Tapan Kumar|last2=Purkait|first2=Prithwiraj|title=Transformer Ageing: Monitoring and Estimation Techniques|date=2017|publisher=Wiley-IEEE Press|isbn=978-1-119-23996-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Transformer Drying - Hot Air Transformer Drying &amp; Vapor-Phase Transformer Drying|url=http://www.hering-vpt.com/products/vacuum-transformer-drying/|website=HERING VPT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For small transformers, resistance heating by injection of current into the windings is used. The heating can be controlled very well, and it is energy efficient. The method is called low-frequency heating (LFH) since the current used is at a much lower frequency than that of the power grid, which is normally 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. A lower frequency reduces the effect of inductance, so the voltage required can be reduced.&lt;ref name=Fink1978&gt;{{harvnb|Fink|Beatty|1978|pp=10–38 through 10–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LFH drying method is also used for service of older transformers.&lt;ref name=Figueroa&gt;{{cite web|last=Figueroa|first=Elisa|title=Low Frequency Heating Field Dry-Out of a 750 MVA 500 kV Auto Transformer|url=http://www.electricity-today.com/et/issue0109/transformer_field_dry-out.pdf|publisher=Electricity Today|date=Jan–Feb 2009|accessdate=Feb 28, 2012|display-authors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107034201/http://www.electricity-today.com/et/issue0109/transformer_field_dry-out.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bushings===
Larger transformers are provided with high-voltage insulated [[Bushing (electrical)|bushings]] made of polymers or porcelain. A large bushing can be a complex structure since it must provide careful control of the [[electric field gradient]] without letting the transformer leak oil.&lt;ref name="Ryan2004-416"&gt;{{harvnb|Ryan|2004|pp=416–417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Transformer-Limestone-Generating-Station.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Transformer at the [[Limestone Generating Station]] in [[Manitoba]], Canada]]
Since the high voltages carried in the wires are significantly greater than what is needed in-home, transformers are also used extensively in [[Consumer electronics|electronic products]] to decrease (or step-down) the supply voltage to a level suitable for the low voltage circuits they contain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-energy/how-electricity-grid-works|title=How the Electricity Grid Works|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformer also electrically isolates the end user from contact with the supply voltage.
Transformers are used to increase (or step-up) voltage before transmitting electrical energy over long distances through [[wire]]s. Wires have [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] which loses energy through joule heating at a rate corresponding to square of the current. By transforming power to a higher voltage transformers enable economical transmission of power and distribution. Consequently, transformers have shaped the [[Electrical power industry|electricity supply industry]], permitting generation to be located remotely from points of [[electrical load|demand]].&lt;ref name="Heathcote1998-1"&gt;{{harvnb|Heathcote|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All but a tiny fraction of the world's electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer.&lt;ref name="nailen"/&gt;

Signal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of [[amplifier]]s and to match devices such as [[microphone]]s and [[record player]]s to the input of amplifiers. Audio transformers allowed [[telephone]] circuits to carry on a [[Hybrid coil|two-way conversation]] over a single pair of wires. A [[balun]] transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has [[Balanced line|balanced voltages to ground]], such as between external cables and internal circuits. Transformers made to medical grade standards isolate the users from the direct current. These are found commonly used in conjunction with hospital beds, dentist chairs, and other medical lab equipment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Discovery of induction===

[[Electromagnetic induction]], the principle of the operation of the transformer, was discovered independently by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1831, [[Joseph Henry]] in 1832, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Electromagnetism|url=http://web.hep.uiuc.edu/home/serrede/P435/Lecture_Notes/A_Brief_History_of_Electromagnetism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Smithsonian Institution Archives|title=Electromagnetism|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/henry/electromagnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacPhersonRC"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ryan C.|last=MacPherson, Ph.D.|title="Joseph Henry: The Rise of an American scientist"|url=http://www.ryancmacpherson.com/publications/3-book-reviews/49-joseph-henry-the-rise-of-an-american-scientist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarnieri2013-56"&gt;{{harvnb|Guarnieri|2013|pp=56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between EMF and magnetic flux is an equation now known as [[Faraday's law of induction]]:

:&lt;math&gt; |\mathcal{E}| = \left|{{\mathrm{d}\Phi_\text{B}} \over \mathrm{d}t}\right|&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{E}|&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the EMF in Volts and Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnetic flux through the circuit in [[Weber (unit)|webers]].&lt;ref name="Chow171"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C&amp;pg=PA171|last= Chow|first= Tai L. |year=2006|title=Introduction to Electromagnetic Theory: A Modern Perspective| location=Sudbury, Mass.| publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers| page= 171| isbn=0-7637-3827-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday performed early experiments on induction between coils of wire, including winding a pair of coils around an iron ring, thus creating the first [[Toroid (geometry)|toroidal]] closed-core transformer.&lt;ref name="Guarnieri2013-56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faraday|first=Michael|year=1834|title=Experimental Researches on Electricity, 7th Series|authorlink=Michael Faraday|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=124|pages=77–122|doi=10.1098/rstl.1834.0008|url=https://archive.org/details/philtrans08694360}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he only applied individual pulses of current to his transformer, and never discovered the relation between the turns ratio and EMF in the windings.
[[Image:Induktionsapparat hg.jpg|thumb|left|Induction coil, 1900, Bremerhaven, Germany]]

===Induction coils===
{{main|Induction coil}}
[[Image:Faradays transformer.png|thumb|right|Faraday's ring transformer]]
The first type of transformer to see wide use was the [[induction coil]], invented by Rev. [[Nicholas Callan]] of [[Maynooth College]], Ireland in 1836.&lt;ref name="Guarnieri2013-56"/&gt; He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary EMF will be. Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating [[electrical contact]]s that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.

===First alternating current transformers===
By the 1870s, efficient [[Electric generator|generators]] producing [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an [[interrupter]].

In 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented&lt;ref name=Yablochkov1876&gt;{{harvnb|Yablochkov|1876|loc=FR Pat. 115793, p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMI1791&gt;{{harvnb|Subject-Matter Index|1883|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several [[Yablochkov candle|'electric candles']] (arc lamps) of his own design.&lt;ref name=maglab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|title=Stanley Transformer|publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]; [[University of Florida]]|accessdate=Jan 9, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119134626/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|archivedate=January 19, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the [[Ganz Works|Ganz factory]], Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.&lt;ref name="Guarnieri2013-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hughes1993-95&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1993|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucien Gaulard]] and John Dixon Gibbs first exhibited a device with an open iron core called a 'secondary generator' in London in 1882, then sold the idea to the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] company in the United States.&lt;ref name="allan"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Allan | first=D.J.| title = Power Transformers – The Second Century | journal = Power Engineering Journal|date=Jan 1991|volume=5|issue=1|pages=5–14|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=61984 | doi = 10.1049/pe:19910004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also exhibited the invention in Turin, Italy in 1884, where it was adopted for an electric lighting system.&lt;ref name=Uppenborn1889&gt;{{harvnb|Uppenborn|1889|pp=35–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early series circuit transformer distribution===
Induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to [[Electrical load|loads]]. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.&lt;ref name=Uppenborn1889/&gt;
Efficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the [[War of Currents]], and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.&lt;ref name="Coltman1988"&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|Jan 1988|pp=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1884, [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]] (ZBD), three engineers associated with the Ganz factory, had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage.&lt;ref name=Hughes1993-95/&gt; In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a) wound around iron wire ring core or b)&amp;nbsp;surrounded by iron wire core.&lt;ref name=Uppenborn1889/&gt; The two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day, which can as a class all be termed as either core form or shell form (or alternatively, core type or shell type), as in a) or b), respectively (see images).&lt;ref name="Del Vecchio2002-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowlton6-41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guarnieri2013-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Természet Világa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Károly|first=Simonyi|title=The Faraday Law With a Magnetic Ohm's Law|url=http://www.termeszetvilaga.hu/kulonsz/k011/46.html|publisher=Természet Világa|accessdate=Mar 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas (2000)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lucas|first=J.R.|title=Historical Development of the Transformer|url=http://www.elect.mrt.ac.lk/Transformer_history_2000.pdf|publisher=IEE Sri Lanka Centre|accessdate=Mar 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers, the first of these units having been shipped on September 16, 1884.&lt;ref name="Halacsy1961"&gt;{{harvnb|Halacsy|Von Fuchs|April 1961|pp=121–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40&amp;nbsp;Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.&lt;ref name="Halacsy1961"/&gt;

In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see [[transformer#Toroidal cores|Toroidal cores]] below). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs.&lt;ref name=Jeszenszky&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeszenszky|first=Sándor|title=Electrostatics and Electrodynamics at Pest University in the Mid-19th Century|url=http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V%26H%20Sect2/V%26H%20175-182.pdf|publisher=[[University of Pavia]]|accessdate=Mar 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1,400 to 2,000 V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 V initially preferred).&lt;ref name="Ideal (2008)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian Inventors and Their Inventions|url=http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008|publisher=Institute for Developing Alternative Energy in Latin America|accessdate=Mar 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322223457/http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008|archivedate=2012-03-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BUTE-OMIKK-BlathyOtto&gt;{{cite web|title=Bláthy, Ottó Titusz|url=http://www.omikk.bme.hu/archivum/angol/htm/blathy_o.htm|publisher=Budapest University of Technology and Economics, National Technical Information Centre and Library|accessdate=Feb 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces.&lt;ref name="Bláthy_HPO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bláthy, Ottó Titusz (1860–1939)|url=http://www.hpo.hu/English/feltalalok/blathy.html|publisher=Hungarian Patent Office

Transformers today are designed on the principles discovered by the three engineers. They also popularized the word 'transformer' to describe a device for altering the EMF of an electric current,&lt;ref name="Bláthy_HPO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfki.hu/~aznagy/lecture/lecture.htm|last=Nagy|first=Árpád Zoltán|title=Lecture to Mark the 100th Anniversary of the Discovery of the Electron in 1897 (preliminary text)| location=Budapest|date=Oct 11, 1996|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term had already been in use by 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Oxford English Dictionary|edition=2nd|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qt8JAAAAIAAJ| last=Hospitalier|first=Édouard|year= 1882|title=The Modern Applications of Electricity|translator= Julius Maier|location=New York|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co.|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the Ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for, the world's first [[power station]] that used AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=technology&amp;item=144| title=Ottó Bláthy, Miksa Déri, Károly Zipernowsky| publisher=IEC Techline| accessdate=Apr 16, 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206042832/http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=technology&amp;item=144| archivedate=2010-12-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[George Westinghouse]] had bought Gaulard and Gibbs' patents in 1885, the [[Edison Electric Light Company]] held an option on the US rights for the ZBD transformers, requiring Westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles. He assigned to [[William Stanley, Jr.|William Stanley]] the task of developing a device for commercial use in United States.&lt;ref name="Skrabec"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skrabec|first=Quentin R.|title=George Westinghouse: Gentle Genius|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2007|page=102|isbn=978-0-87586-508-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C3GYdiFM41oC&amp;pg=PA102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley's first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the EMF present in the secondary winding (see image).&lt;ref name="Stanley1886"/&gt; This design&lt;ref name="Coltman2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Coltman|Jan-Feb 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first used commercially in the US in 1886&lt;ref name="IEC History"&gt;{{cite book |author = International Electrotechnical Commission |authorlink = International Electrotechnical Commission |title = Otto Blathy, Miksa Déri, Károly Zipernowsky |work = IEC History |url = http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=technology&amp;item=144 |accessdate = May 17, 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101206042832/http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=technology&amp;item=144 |archivedate = December 6, 2010 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Westinghouse was intent on improving the Stanley design to make it (unlike the ZBD type) easy and cheap to produce.&lt;ref name="Coltman2002"/&gt;

Westinghouse, Stanley and associates soon developed an easier to manufacture core, consisting of a stack of thin 'E‑shaped' iron plates, insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material. Prewound copper coils could then be slid into place, and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit. Westinghouse applied for a patent for the new low-cost design in December 1886; it was granted in July 1887.&lt;ref name="Smil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Westinghouse|1887|loc=US Patent 366 362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early transformer designs===
In 1889, Russian-born engineer [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] developed the first [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] transformer at the [[Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft]] ('General Electricity Company') in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neidhöfer|first= Gerhard|others=In collaboration with VDE "History of Electrical Engineering" Committee|location= Berlin | isbn= 978-3-8007-3115-2|url=http://d-nb.info/990964361|title=Michael von Dolivo-Dobrowolsky and Three-Phase: The Beginnings of Modern e Technology and Power Supply |language=German|year=2008|publisher=VDE-Verl.|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, [[Nikola Tesla]] invented the [[Tesla coil]], an air-cored, dual-tuned resonant transformer for producing very [[high voltage]]s at high frequency.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Uth|first=Robert|title=Tesla Coil|date=Dec 12, 2000|work=Tesla: Master of Lightning|publisher=PBS.org|url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ins/lab_tescoil.html|accessdate=May 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tesla|1891|loc=US Patent 454 622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Audio frequency]] transformers ('[[repeating coil]]s') were used by early experimenters in the development of the [[telephone]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[File:TCTrompos.jpg|thumb|240px|Traditional wooden trompos]]
A '''Trompo'''  is a [[top]] which is spun by winding a length of [[twine|string]] around the body, and launching it so that lands spinning on its point. If the string is attached to a [[whip|stick]] the rotation can be maintained by whipping the side of the body. The string may also be wound around the point while the trompo is spinning in order to control its position or even lift the spinning top to another surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wooden Whipping Top|url=http://www.plimoth.com/kids-corner/toys-games/wooden-whipping-top.html|publisher=Plimoth Plantation is a not-for-profit 501 (c)3 organization|accessdate=25 Dec 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224064306/http://www.plimoth.com/kids-corner/toys-games/wooden-whipping-top.html|archivedate=24 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
These  [[toy]]s are popular in [[Latin America]] where the name ''trompo'' emerged, but there are very many different local names. In Spain, these toys may be called  ''trompo'' or ''peonza'', ''perinola'', and ''pirinola''. In the Philippines, they are called ''trumpo'' or ''turumpo'', while in Portugal they're called ''pião''.

In Japan, similar tops are known as ''koma'', with most cities having a particular design.

In Germany a ''Peitschenkreisel'' may also be called ''Doppisch, Dildop, Pindopp, Dilledopp, Triesel or Tanzknopf'' (roughly ''dancing top'')

In Morocco it's  called ''Trombia'' and it's  often made out of wood and painted in a reddish brown color.

==Form==
Trompos have an approximately pear-shaped body and are usually made of a hard wood such as [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[oak]] or [[beech]] although new resins and strong plastic materials have also been used. Whipping tops often have a more cylindrical shape to provide a bigger surface to be struck by the whip.

A trofeo has a button-shaped on top, usually bigger than the tip on which trompo spins, and generally made of the same material as the rest of the body.

The base of a trompo is a stud or spike which may have a groove or [[Rolling-element bearing|roller-bearing]] to facilitate lifting the spinning trompo with the whip or string without imposing much friction on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turnertoys.com/Tops/|title=Toys we grew up with|publisher=Turner Toys, Vermont USA|accessdate=25 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trompo surface may be painted or decorated, and some versions incorporate synthetic sound devices. The small size diameter and low [[mass]] of most trompos means that mechanical [[whistle]]s would cause excessive [[drag (physics)]] and reduce their spinning time.

The Philippine ''trumpo'' differs in the tip, which is straight and pointed. It usually looks like a nail embedded in a wooden spheroid. 

==Play==
[[File:Winding the trompo.ogv|thumb|240px|Winding the trompo]]
[[File:Basic throw.ogg|thumb|240px|Basic throw]]
Playing with a trompo consists of throwing the "trompo" and having it spin on the floor. Because of its shape, a trompo spins on its [[Coordinate axis|axis]] and swirls around its [[conic]] tip which is usually made of iron or steel. A trompo uses a [[pullstring|string]] wrapped around it to get the necessary spin needed. The player must roll the cord around the trompo from the metallic tip up. The user must then tie the string in a knot on the button-shaped tip before releasing it. When rolling the cord around the trompo it must be done so that the cord is tightly attached to it. The technique for throwing a trompo varies. One end of the cord must be rolled around the player's fingers and with the same hand the trompo must be held with the metallic tip facing upwards.

Championships are held in different Latin American countries, especially in [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Cuba]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Puerto Rico]] where it is very popular among children of the middle and lower classes.

In Mexico most trompos are sold made of plastic, with a metal tip, and sometimes they are made of wood. There is a popular game called "''picotazos",'' where the main goal is to destroy the opponents' trompo. Another game is where a circle is drawn on the ground and a coin is placed in the middle, and the goal here is to strike the coin.
  
In Puerto Rico, one of the ways trompos are played is similar to playing marbles, with trompos being within a circle drawn on sand, the object being to knock them out of the circle, this can be played for keeps or otherwise. Failure to spin or spin within the circle causes your trompo to be added to it and another person has a turn to spin. Frequently, trompos in Puerto Rico and [[Chile]] are modified to have a sharper point, where in a game the object can be to split the other players trompo.

[[José Miguel Agrelot]], a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] comedian, hosted a long-standing television program, ''"Encabulla y Vuelve y Tira"'', whose name described the action of throwing and spinning a trompo. One of his comedic characterizations, mischievous boy Torito Fuertes, was a one-time sponsor of a line of trompos.

The manner of playing the Filipino ''trumpo'' is basically the same, except that a knot is not tied into the tip before throwing it for the spin.

In [[fluid mechanics]] and [[continuum mechanics]], the '''velocity gradient''' describes how the [[velocity field|velocity]] of a fluid changes between different points within the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Chemical Engineering|author=Carl Schaschke|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199651450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the term can refer to the differences in velocity between layers of flow in a pipe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Infoplease: Viscosity: The Velocity Gradient|url =  https://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science-and-technology/physics/physics/viscosity/the-velocity-gradient}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is often used to mean the [[Spatial gradient|gradient]] of a flow's velocity with respect to its [[coordinate system#Common coordinate systems|coordinates]].&lt;ref name = "continuum"&gt;{{cite web|title = Velocity gradient at continuummechanics.org  |url = http://continuummechanics.org/cm/velocitygradient.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has implications in a variety of areas of [[physics]] and [[engineering]], including [[magnetohydrodynamics]], mining and water treatment.&lt;ref name = "MHD"&gt;

==A simple example==
Consider the velocity field of a fluid flowing through a [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]. The layer of fluid in contact with the pipe tends to be at rest with respect to the pipe. This is called the [[no slip condition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Review of fluid mechanics terminology|first1 = R.| last1 = Levicky| url =  http://faculty.poly.edu/~rlevicky/Handout2_6333.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the velocity difference between fluid layers at the centre of the pipe and at the sides of the pipe is sufficiently small, then the fluid flow is observed in the form of continuous layers. This type of flow is called [[laminar flow]].

The [[flow velocity]] difference between adjacent layers can be measured in terms of a velocity gradient, given by &lt;math&gt; \Delta u / \Delta y&lt;/math&gt;. Where &lt;math&gt;\Delta u&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in flow velocity between the two layers and &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt; is the [[distance]] between the layers.

== Dimensional analysis ==
By performing [[dimensional analysis]], the dimensions of velocity gradient can be determined. The dimensions of velocity are &lt;math&gt; M^{0} L^{1} T^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; , and the dimensions of distance are  &lt;math&gt; M^{0} L^{1} T^{0}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the velocity gradient can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \text{velocity}}{\Delta \text{distance}}&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, the velocity gradient has the same dimensions as this ratio, i.e. &lt;math&gt; M^{0} L^{0} T^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Velocity gradient in continuum mechanics==
In 3 dimensions, the gradient, &lt;math&gt;\nabla\bf{v}&lt;/math&gt; , of the velocity &lt;math&gt;\bf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is a second-order [[tensor]] which can be expressed as the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] L:

:&lt;math&gt;\bf{L} = \nabla\bf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
  {\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x}} &amp; {\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial y}} &amp; {\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial z}} \\
  {\frac{\partial v_y}{\partial x}} &amp; {\frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y}} &amp; {\frac{\partial v_y}{\partial z}\ } \\
  {\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial x}} &amp; {\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial y}} &amp; {\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bf{L}&lt;/math&gt; can be decomposed into the sum of a [[symmetric matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\textbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; and a [[skew-symmetric matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\textbf{W}&lt;/math&gt; as follows
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \bf{E} &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left(\bf{L} + \bf{L}^\textsf{T}\right) \\
  \bf{W} &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left(\bf{L} - \bf{L}^\textsf{T}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\textbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[strain rate tensor]] and describes the rate of stretching and shearing. &lt;math&gt;\textbf{W}&lt;/math&gt; is called the spin tensor and describes the rate of rotation.&lt;ref name = "stuart"&gt;{{cite book| last = Gonzalez|first = O.|last2 =  Stuart| first2 = A. M.| year = 2008| title = A First Course in Continuum Mechanics| series =  Cambridge Texts in Applied Mathematics| publisher = Cambridge University Press| pages = 134-135}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship between shear stress and the velocity field ==
[[Sir Isaac Newton]] proposed that [[shear stress]] is directly proportional to the velocity gradient:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics|last = Batchelor|  first = G.K.| isbn=9780521663960| series=Cambridge Mathematical Library| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Rla7OihRvUgC| year=2000| publisher=Cambridge University Press| pages = 145}} &lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\tau = \mu\frac{\partial u} {\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[constant of proportionality]], &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, is called the [[Viscosity#Definition|dynamic viscosity]].

== Applications ==
The study of velocity gradients is useful in analysing path dependent materials and in the subsequent study of stresses and strains; e.g., [[Plastic deformation]] of [[metals]].&lt;ref name = "continuum" /&gt; The near-wall velocity gradient of the unburned reactants flowing from a tube is a key parameter for characterising flame stability.&lt;ref name = "Mines" /&gt;{{rp|1-3}} The velocity gradient of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] can define conditions for the solutions to fundamental equations in magnetohydrodynamics.&lt;ref name = "MHD"/&gt;

'''Vernolic acid''' ('''leukotoxin''') is a [[long chain fatty acid]] that is [[monounsaturated]] and contains an [[epoxide]]. It is the ''cis'' epoxide derived from the C12–C13 alkene of [[linoleic acid]] and exists both the (+)- and (–)- [[optical isomers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PubChem|6449780}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/chebiOntology.do?chebiId=CHEBI:38300 | title = CHEBI:38300 - (−)-vernolic acid | work = Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) | publisher = European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an isomer of [[coronaric acid]], the two enantiomeric forms resulting instead by epoxidation at the C9–C10 alkene.&lt;ref&gt;{{PubChem|6246154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vernolic acid was first definitively characterized in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gunstone FD | year = 1954| title = Fatty acids. Part II. The nature of the oxygenated acid present in ''Vernonia anthelmintica'' (Willd.) seed oil | url = | journal = Journal of the Chemical Society | volume = 1954 | issue = | pages = 1611–1616 | doi = 10.1039/JR9540001611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the key component in vernonia oil, which is produced in abundance by the genera Vernonia and Euphorbia and is a potentially useful biofeedstock.

==Toxicity==
In a variety of mammalian species, vernolic acid is made by the metabolism of [[linoleic acid]] by certain [[cytochrome P450]] [[epoxygenase]] enzymes; under these circumstances it is termed leukotoxin because of its toxic effects on [[leukocytes]] and other cell types and of its ability to produce multiple organ failure and respiratory distress when injected into rodent animal models of the [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Linhartová I, Bumba L, Mašín J, Basler M, Osička R, Kamanová J, Procházková K, Adkins I, Hejnová-Holubová J, Sadílková L, Morová J, Sebo P | title = RTX proteins: a highly diverse family secreted by a common mechanism | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1076–112 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20528947 | pmc = 3034196 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2010.00231.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Spector_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spector AA, Kim HY | title = Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 356–65 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25093613 | pmc = 4314516 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.07.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These effects appear due to the conversion of vernolic acid to its dihydroxy counterparts, 12''S'',13''R''- and 12''R'',13''S''-dihydroxy-''cis''-9-octadecenoic acids by [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (this dihydroxy mixture has been termed leukotoxin diol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greene JF, Newman JW, Williamson KC, Hammock BD | title = Toxicity of epoxy fatty acids and related compounds to cells expressing human soluble epoxide hydrolase | journal = Chemical Research in Toxicology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 217–26 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10775319 | doi = 10.1021/tx990162c }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Spector_2015" /&gt;  Some studies suggest but have not yet proven that vernolic acid is responsible for or contributes to multiple organ failure, respiratory distress, and certain other cataclysmic diseases in humans (see [[epoxygenase]] subsection on linoleic acid).

==Vernonia oil==
Vernonia oil is extracted from the seeds of the ''[[Vernonia galamensis]]'' (or ironweed), a plant native to eastern [[Africa]].  The seeds contain about 40 to 42% oil of which 73 to 80% is vernolic acid.  The best varieties of ''V. anthelmintica'' contain about 30% less vernolic acid.  Products that can be made from vernonia oil include epoxies for manufacturing [[adhesive]]s, [[varnish]]es and [[paint]]s, and industrial coatings. Its low [[viscosity]] recommends its use as a nonvolatile [[solvent]] in [[oil-based paint]]s since it will become incorporated in the dry paint rather than evaporating into the air.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/afcm/vernonia.html | title = Alternative Field Crops Manual | chapter = Vernonia | vauthors = Teynor TM, Putnam DJ, Oplinger ES, Oelke EA, Kelling KA, Doll JD | accessdate = 2006-09-10  | date = February 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of vernonia oil offers potential [[Natural environment|environmental]] benefits, since its use could reduce emissions associated with man-made chemicals.

In its application as an [[epoxy]] oil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/v4-272.html | vauthors = Mohamed AI, Mebrahtu T, Andebrhan T | year = 1999 | title = Variability in oil and vernolic acid contents in the new Vernonia galamensis collection from East Africa | pages = 272–274 | veditors = Janick J | journal = Perspectives on new crops and new uses | accessdate = 2006-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; vernonia oil competes with [[soybean oil|soybean]] or [[linseed oil]], which supply most of the market for these applications. Its low [[viscosity]] makes it more desirable than fully [[epoxidation|epoxidized]] linseed or soybean oils. It is more comparable to partially epoxidized linseed or soybean oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muturi | first1 = Patrick | last2 = Wang | first2 = Danqing | last3 = Dirlikov | first3 = Stoil | name-list-format = vanc | title = Epoxidized vegetable oils as reactive diluents I.

==Other plant sources==
Vernolic acid is not commonly found in plants in significant quantities, but some plants which do contain it are ''[[Vernonia]]'', ''[[Stokesia (plant)|Stokesia]]'', ''[[Crepis]]'' (from the [[Asteraceae|daisy family]]), and ''[[Euphorbia]] [[Euphorbia lagascae|lagascae]]'' and ''[[Bernardia]] [[Bernardia pulchella|pulchella]]'' from the [[Euphorbiaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cahoon EB, Ripp KG, Hall SE, McGonigle B | title = Transgenic production of epoxy fatty acids by expression of a cytochrome P450 enzyme from Euphorbia lagascae seed | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 128 | issue = 2 | pages = 615–24 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11842164 | pmc = 148923 | doi = 10.1104/pp.010768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3235">'''Vitallium''' is a [[trademark]] for an [[alloy]] of 65% [[cobalt]], 30% [[chromium]], 5% [[molybdenum]], and other substances.  The alloy is used in [[dentistry]] and [[artificial joint]]s, because of its resistance to [[corrosion]].  It is also used for components of [[turbocharger]]s because of its [[hot strength|thermal resistance]]. Vitallium was developed by Albert W. Merrick for the Austenal Laboratories in 1932.

In 2016 Norman Sharp, a 91 year old British man, was recognised as having the world's oldest [[hip replacement]] implants. The two vitallium implants were implanted in November 1948 at the [[Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital]], under the newly formed [[National Health Service|NHS]]. The 67 year old implants had such an unusually long life, partly because they had not required the typical replacement of such implants, but also because of Mr Sharp's young age of 23 when they were implanted, owing to a childhood case of [[septic arthritis]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For high-temperature use in engines, particularly turbochargers, the first alloy used was [[Haynes International|Haynes]] [[Stellite]] Nº 21, similar to Vitallium. This was suggested by the British engineer, and denture wearer, [[Samuel Dalziel Heron|S.D. Heron]] during WWII. Although the characteristics of the material obviously suggested itself for making turbocharger blades, it was thought impossible to cast it to the precision needed. Heron demonstrated that it could be, by showing his Vitallium dentures.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite book

'''The Waist-hip ratio''' or '''waist-to-hip ratio''' ('''WHR''') is the [[dimensionless]] [[ratio]] of the circumference of the [[waist]] to that of the [[hip]]s.
This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (&lt;var&gt;W&lt;/var&gt; ÷ &lt;var&gt;H&lt;/var&gt;). For example, a person with a 30″ ({{convert|30|in|cm|disp=out}}) waist and 38″ ({{convert|38|in|cm|disp=out}}) hips has a waist-hip ratio of about 0.78.

The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and the risk of developing serious health conditions.
WHR correlates with fertility (with different optimal values in males and females).

== Measurement ==

=== WHO protocol ===
According to the [[World Health Organization]]'s data gathering protocol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/chp/steps/en/ |title=STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) | publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the waist circumference should be measured at the midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable ribs and the top of the [[iliac crest]], using a stretch‐resistant tape that provides a constant 100&amp;nbsp;g tension. Hip circumference should be measured around the widest portion of the buttocks, with the tape parallel to the floor.&lt;ref name=whoreport /&gt; Other organizations use slightly different standards. The United States [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] used results obtained by measuring at the top of the iliac crest. Waist measurements are usually obtained by laypersons by measurings around the waist at the [[navel]], but research has shown that these measurements may underestimate the true waist circumference.&lt;ref name=whoreport /&gt;

For both measurements, the individual should stand with feet close together, arms at the side and body weight evenly distributed, and should wear little clothing. The subject should be relaxed, and the measurements should be taken at the end of a normal respiration. Each measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1&amp;nbsp;cm of one another, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the two measurements exceeds 1&amp;nbsp;cm, the two measurements should be repeated.&lt;ref name=whoreport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501491_eng.pdf |title=Waist Circumference and Waist-Hip Ratio, Report of a WHO Expert Consultation |date=8–11 December 2008 | publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Practical measurement ===
Practically, however, the waist is more conveniently measured simply at the smallest circumference of the natural waist, usually just above the belly button, and the hip circumference may likewise be measured at its widest part of the buttocks or hip.&lt;ref&gt;In some places it is commonly accepted that a woman's waist is measured one inch (2.5cm) above her navel and that a man is measured one inch below his navel.  [http://www.healthcalculators.org/calculators/waist_hip.asp Waist To Hip Calculator] at University of Maryland Medical System. Retrieved Dec 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in case the waist is convex rather than concave, such as is the case in pregnancy, different body types, and obesity, the waist may be measured at a horizontal level 1&amp;nbsp;inch above the navel.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown JE, Potter JD, Jacobs DR, Kopher RA, Rourke MJ, Barosso GM, Hannan PJ, Schmid LA | title = Maternal Waist-to-Hip Ratio as a Predictor of Newborn Size: Results of the Diana Project | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 62–6 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8664403 | doi = 10.1097/00001648-199601000-00011 | jstor = 3702758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indicator of health ==
The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and the risk of developing serious health conditions. Research shows that people with "apple-shaped" bodies (with more weight around the waist) face more health risks than those with "pear-shaped" bodies who carry more weight around the hips.

WHR is used as a measurement of [[obesity]], which in turn is a possible indicator of other more serious health conditions. The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] states that [[abdominal obesity]] is defined as a waist-hip ratio above 0.90 for males and above 0.85 for females, or a [[body mass index]] (BMI) above 30.0.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501491_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) states that women with waist-hip ratios of more than 0.8, and men with more than 1.0, are at increased health risk because of their fat distribution.&lt;ref name="NIDDK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedieting.com/tools/waist_to_hip_ratio.htm|title=Waist to Hip Ratio|work=freedieting.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHR has been found to be a more efficient predictor of mortality in older people (&gt;75 years of age) than waist circumference or BMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Price GM, Uauy R, Breeze E, Bulpitt CJ, Fletcher AE | title = Weight, shape, and mortality risk in older persons: elevated waist-hip ratio, not high body mass index, is associated with a greater risk of death | journal = Am.

Of these three measurements, only the waist-hip ratio takes account of the differences in body structure. Hence, it is possible for two women to have vastly different body mass indices but the same waist–hip ratio, or to have the same body mass index but vastly different waist-hip ratios.

=== Stress ===
The anti-stress hormone [[cortisol]] is regulated by the [[HPA axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]] and has been associated with higher levels of abdominal fat and therefore a higher WHR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wardle|first1=J|last2=Chida|first2=Y|last3=Gibson|first3=EL|last4=Whitaker|first4=KL|last5=Steptoe|first5=A|title=Stress and adiposity: a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies|journal=Obesity|date=2011|volume=19|issue=4|pages=771–778|doi=10.1038/oby.2010.241|pmid=20948519}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Abdominal fat is a marker of visceral fat (stored around important internal organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines) and has greater blood flow and more receptors for cortisol than peripheral fat. The greater the number of cortisol receptors, the more sensitive the visceral fat tissue is to cortisol. This heightened sensitivity to cortisol stimulates fat cells to further increase in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedersen|first1=SB|last2=Jonler|first2=M|last3=Richelsen|first3=B|title=Characterization of regional and gender differences in glucocorticoid receptors and lipoprotein lipase activity in human adipose tissue. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|date=1994|volume=78|issue=1|pages=1354–1359}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Women who have a combination of normal [[Body mass index|BMI]] and high WHR experience elevated cortisol reactivity to acute stressors and failure to habituate to repeated stressors, compared to women with normal WHR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epel|first1=ES|last2=McEwen|first2=B|last3=Seeman|first3=T|last4=Matthews|first4=K|last5=Castellazzo|first5=G|last6=Brownell|first6=KD|title=Stress and body shape: stress-induced cortisol secretion is consistently greater among women with central fat|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|date=2007|volume=62|issue=5|pages=623–632|pmid=11020091}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that high WHR might also indicate HPA-axis dysregulation and over-exposure to cortisol.

Evidence for the relationship between cortisol and central fat distribution has primarily been studied in individuals with [[Cushing’s syndrome]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samaras|first1=K|last2=Campbell|first2=LV|title=The non-genetic determinants of central adiposity|journal=International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders : Journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity|date=1997|volume=21|issue=10|pages=839–845|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0800502}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is characterized by over-exposure to cortisol due to elevated activity of the [[HPA axis]]. A primary component of Cushing’s syndrome is the accumulation of fat in the abdominal region, and it is hypothesized that elevated cortisol levels contribute to this accumulation. However, this hypothesis remains contested as cortisol levels only modestly explain variation in central fat distribution. It is more likely that a complex set of biological and neuroendocrine pathways related to cortisol secretion contribute to central adiposity, such as [[leptin]], [[neuropeptide y]], [[corticotropin releasing factor]] and the sympathetic nervous system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Growth and development ==
In general, adults with [[growth hormone]] deficiencies also have increased WHRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=R|title=Partial growth hormone deficiency is associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and increased carotid intima-medial thickness|journal=Clinical Endocrinology (Oxford)|date=2010|volume=73|issue=4|pages=508–515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomes-Santos|first1=E|title=Increased visceral adiposity and cortisol to cortisone ratio in adults with congenital isolated GH deficiency.|journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology|date=2014|volume=99|issue=9|pages=3285–3289|doi=10.1210/jc.2014-2132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults with untreated congenital isolated growth hormone deficiency have increased WHRs, possibly from increased cortisone:cortisol ratios and [[insulin]] sensitivities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Since these individuals have increased visceral obesity, it has been suggested that a minimal growth hormone secretion would theoretically increase insulin resistance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; However, because of the growth hormone deficiency, this insulin resistance point cannot be reached and these individuals are more sensitive to insulin.  Increased adipose deposits are therefore more likely to form in these individuals, causing the high WHR. Growth hormone deficiencies have also been correlated with WHRs in prepubertal children; the specific baseline body statistics, such as WHRs, of pre-pubertal children with growth hormone deficiencies can predict growth response effectiveness to artificial growth hormone therapies, such as rhGH treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Esen|first1=I|title=The association between growth response to growth hormone and baseline body composition of children with growth hormone deficiency|journal=Growth Hormone and IGF Research|date=2013|volume=23|issue=5|pages=196–199|pmid=23890535|doi=10.1016/j.ghir.2013.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex characteristics ===
Males with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], determined by [[CYP21A2]] mutations, have increased WHRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falhammer|first1=H|title=Cardiovascular risk, metabolic profile, and body composition in adult males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|date=2011|volume=164|issue=2|pages=285–293|pmid=21098686|doi=10.1530/EJE-10-0877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fertility ===
A WHR of 0.9 for men and 0.7 for women has been shown to correlate strongly with general [[health]] and [[fertility]]. Women within the 0.7 range have optimal levels of [[estrogen]] and are less susceptible to major diseases such as [[diabetes]], cardiovascular disorders and ovarian cancers.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Rules of Attraction in the Game of Love| veditors=| publisher=| place=| pages=| url=http://www.livescience.com/health/060213_attraction_rules.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with high WHR (0.80 or higher) have significantly lower pregnancy rates than women with lower WHRs (0.70–0.79), independent of their BMIs.&lt;ref name="Ratio"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singh D | title = Female mate value at a glance: relationship of waist-to-hip ratio to health, fecundity and attractiveness | journal = Neuro Endocrinol.

Evidence suggests that WHR is an accurate somatic indicator of reproductive endocrinological status and long-term health risk. Among girls with identical body weights, those with lower WHRs show earlier pubertal endocrine activity, as measured by high levels of lutenizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, as well as sex steroid (estradiol) activity. A Dutch prospective study on outcome in an artificial insemination program provides evidence for the role of WHR and fecundity.&lt;ref name="zaadstra1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zaadstra BM, Seidell JC, Van Noord PA, te Velde ER, Habbema JD, Vrieswijk B, Karbaat J | title = Fat and female fecundity: prospective study of effect of body fat distribution on conception rates | journal = BMJ | volume = 306 | issue = 6876 | pages = 484–487 | year=1993 | pmid = 8448457 | pmc = 1676805 | doi=10.1136/bmj.306.6876.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; These investigators report that a 0.1 unit increase in WHR decreases the probability of conception per cycle by 30% after adjustment for age, obesity, reasons for artificial insemination, cycle length and regularity, smoking, and parity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singh  | year = 1993a | title = Adaptive significance of female physical attractiveness: Role of the waist-to-hip ratio | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 293–307 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.293 | pmid=8366421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singh  | year = 1993b | title = Body shape and women's attractiveness.

[[Menopause]], the natural or surgical cessation of the menstrual cycle, is due to an overall decrease in ovarian production of the hormones estradiol and progesterone. These hormonal changes are also associated with an increase in WHR independent of increases in body mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cagnacci|first1=A|last2=Zanin|first2=R|last3=Cannoletta|first3=M|last4=Generali|first4=M|last5=Caretto|first5=S|last6=Volpe|first6=A|title=Menopause, estrogens, progestins, or their combination on body weight and anthropometric measure|journal=Fertility and Sterility|date=2007|volume=88|issue=6|pages=1603–1608|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.01.039|pmid=17481628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, studies find that large premenopausal WHRs are associated with lower [[estradiol]] levels and variation in age of menopause onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=EW|last2=Sammel|first2=MD|last3=Lin|first3=H|last4=Gracia|first4=CR|title=Obesity and reproductive hormone levels in the transition to menopause|journal=Menopause|date=2007|volume=17|issue=4|pages=718–726|pmid=20216473|doi=10.1097/gme.0b013e3181cec85d|pmc=2888623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulating estrogen preferentially stores lipid deposits in the gluteofemoral region, including the buttocks and thighs, and evidence suggests that menopause-associated estrogen deficiency results in an accumulation of adipose deposits around the abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;Cagnacci et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These menopause-induced changes in body fat distribution can be counteracted with [[hormone replacement therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Genazzani|first1=AR|last2=Gambacciani|first2=M|title=Effect of climacteric transition and hormone replacement therapy on body weight and body fat distribution|journal=Gynecological Endocrinology|date=2006|volume=22|issue=3|pages=145–150|doi=10.1080/09513590600629092|pmid=16835076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, aging males gradually accumulate abdominal fat, and hence increased WHR, in parallel with declining [[androgen]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samaras|first1=K|last2=Campbell|first2=LV|title=The non-genetic determinants of central adiposity|journal=International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders: Journal of the International Association for the study of Obesity|date=1997|volume=21|issue=10|pages=839–845|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0800502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive ability ===
Using data from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, William Lassek at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and Steven Gaulin of the University of California, Santa Barbara, found a child's performance in cognitive tests correlated to their mother's waist–hip ratio, a proxy for how much fat she stores on her hips.&lt;ref name=Lassek&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=January 2008|title=Waist-hip ratio and cognitive ability: is gluteofemoral fat a privileged store of neurodevelopmental resources?|last=Lassek|first=W.|author2=Gaulin S. |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.07.005 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=26–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children whose mothers had wide hips and a low waist–hip ratio scored highest, leading Lassek and Gaulin to suggest that fetuses benefit from hip fat, which contains long chain [[polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]], critical for the development of the fetus's brain.&lt;ref name=Lassek /&gt; In addition, evidence suggests that children of low-WHR teens were protected from the cognitive deficits often associated with teen birth.

== Human genetics ==

Studies in twins have suggested that between 22% and 61% of variability in waist-to-hip ratio may be accounted for by genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2010/10October/Pages/pear-shaped-genes-found.aspx|title='Pear shaped' genes found – NHS Choices – Health News|work=www.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measure of female attractiveness ==
The concept and significance of WHR as an indicator of attractiveness was first theorized by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologist]] [[Devendra Singh]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singh D | title = Adaptive significance of female physical attractiveness: role of waist-to-hip ratio | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–307 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 8366421 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buss |first=David |title=The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating |url=http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/04/buss.html |format=hardcover |edition=second|publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |chapter= |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh argued that the WHR was a more consistent estrogen marker than the [[BWH|bust–waist ratio]] (BWR) studied at [[King's College, London]] by Dr. [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=30–4 |doi=10.2224/sbp.1974.2.1.30 |title=Psychological correlates of sexual attractiveness: An empirical demonstration of denial and fantasy gratification phenomena? |year=1974 |last1=Wilson |first1=Glenn D. |last2=Brazendale |first2=Anthony H. |journal=Social Behavior and Personality: an international journal |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=201–5 |doi=10.1080/00224545.1975.9918705 |title=Vital Statistics, Perceived Sexual Attractiveness, and Response to Risque Humor |year=1975 |last1=Wilson |first1=Glenn |last2=Nias |first2=David |last3=Brazendale |first3=Anthony |journal=The Journal of Social Psychology |volume=95 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that men in westernized societies are more influenced by female [[waist]] size than [[hip]] size:

{{quote|"Hip size indicates pelvic size and the amount of additional fat storage that can be used as a source of energy. Waist size conveys information such as current reproductive status or health status ... in westernized societies with no risk of seasonal lack of food, the waist, conveying information about [[fecundity]] and health status, will be more important than hip size for assessing a female's attractiveness."|''Journal of Biological Psychology''|&lt;ref name="Rozmus-Wrzesinska "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rozmus-Wrzesinska M, Pawlowski B |title=Men's ratings of female attractiveness are influenced more by changes in female waist size compared with changes in hip size |journal=Biol Psychol |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=299–308 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15620796 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By western standards, women in foraging populations have high numbers of pregnancies, high parasite loads, and high caloric dependence on fibrous foods. These variables change across cultures, suggesting that
# the normal range of female WHR was often higher than in western cultures,
# what constituted locally “WHR” varied, and
# average WHR of [[nubile]] females and of females of peak fertility varied.
Thus, a WHR that indicates pubertal onset, sex, fertility, hormonal irregularities, and/or differentiates male from female in one population may not do so in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esDW3xTKoLIC|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|last=Buss|first=David M.|date=2005-07-15|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471727224|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of 1993 studies done by Singh, men used WHR and overall body fat to determine a woman’s attractiveness. In his first study, men were shown a series of 12 drawings of women with various WHRs and body fat. Drawings with normal weight and a low WHR were associated with the most positive traits (i.e. attractive, sexy, intelligent and healthy). The drawings of thin female figures were not associated with any positive traits except youthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Devendra|date=1994-01-01|title=Is thin really beautiful and good? Relationship between waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and female attractiveness|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994901163|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=16|issue=1|pages=123–132|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90116-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this study, Singh suggests that males and females may have developed innate mechanisms which detect and make use of the WHR to assess how healthy an individual is and (particularly for men), infer possible mate value. Having a healthy mate improves the chances of producing offspring with inherited genetic protection from various diseases and a healthy mate is more likely to be a good parent (Hamilton &amp; Zuk, 1982; Thornhill, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Devendra|last2=Young|first2=Robert K.|date=1995-11-01|title=Body weight, waist-to-hip ratio, breasts, and hips: Role in judgments of female attractiveness and desirability for relationships|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309595000747|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=16|issue=6|pages=483–507|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(95)00074-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies discovered WHR as a signal of attractiveness as well, beyond just examining body fat and fertility. Barnaby Dixson, Gina Grimshaw, Wayne Linklater, and Alan Dixson conducted a study using eye-tracking techniques to evaluate men's fixation on digitally altered photographs of the same woman, as well as asking the men to evaluate the images based on attractiveness. What they found was while men fixated on the woman's breasts in each photo, they selected the images where the woman had a 0.7 WHR as most attractive, regardless of breast size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixson|first=Barnaby J.|last2=Grimshaw|first2=Gina M.|last3=Linklater|first3=Wayne L.|last4=Dixson|first4=Alan F.|date=2011-02-01|title=Eye-tracking of men's preferences for waist-to-hip ratio and breast size of women|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=40|issue=1|pages=43–50|doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9523-5|issn=1573-2800|pmid=19688590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, referencing a 2005 study conducted by Johnson and Tassinary looking at animated human walking stimuli, Farid Pazhoohi and James R. Liddle proposed that men do not solely use WHR to evaluate attractiveness, but also a means of sex-differentiation, with higher WHR perceived as more masculine and lower WHR as an indicator of femininity. Pazhoohi and Liddle used this idea as a possible additional explanation as to why men perceive a lower WHR as more attractive – because it relates to an expression of femininity, as opposed to masculinity and a higher WHR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pazhoohi F., Liddle J. R. | year = 2012 | title = IDENTIFYING FEMININE AND MASCULINE RANGES FOR WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO | url = | journal = Journal of Social, Evolutionary &amp; Cultural Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 227–232 | doi=10.1037/h0099212}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, it was shown that men with lower, more feminine, WHRs feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem and self-efficacy than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pazhoohi F., Hosseinchari M., Doyle J.

To enhance their perceived attractiveness, some women may artificially alter their apparent WHR. The methods include the use of a [[corset]] to reduce the waist size and [[hip and buttock padding]] to increase the apparent size of the hips and buttocks.  In an earlier attempt to quantify attractiveness, [[corset]] and [[girdle]] manufacturers of the 20th century used a calculation called ''hip spring''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corsetiere.net/Spirella/Corsetiere/Older.htm#hipspring|title=Bald|work=corsetiere.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or ''hip-spring'' or ''hipspring''), calculated by subtracting the waist measurement from the hip measurement. However this calculation fell into disuse because it is a poor indicator of attractiveness; for example, a hip spring of {{convert|10|in}} would likely be considered quite attractive for an average-sized adult woman, but a child or petite woman with the same number would more likely be seen as malnourished.

WHR versus BMI attractiveness is related to fertility, not fat content. A study performed by Holliday used computer generated female body shapes to construct images which covary with real female body mass (indexed with BMI) and not with body shape (indexed with WHR), and vice versa. Twelve observers (6 male and 6 female) rated these images for attractiveness during an fMRI study. The attractiveness ratings were correlated with changes in BMI and not WHR. The results demonstrated that in addition to activation in higher visual areas, changes to BMI had a direct impact on activity within the brain’s reward system. This shows that BMI, not WHR, modulates reward mechanisms in the brain and that this may have important implications for judgements of ideal body size in eating disordered individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holliday I. E. |author2=Longe O. A. |author3=Thai N. |author4=Hancock P. B. |author5=Tovée M. J. | year = 2011 | title = BMI not WHR modulates BOLD fMRI responses in a sub-cortical reward network when participants judge the attractiveness of human female bodies | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 11| page = 11 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0027255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study, conducted by Furnham, was used as an extension of Singh &amp; Young's 1995 investigation. A total of 137 participants were in the study. There were 98 female participants. The age range was between 16 and 67. The majority of participants were undergraduates, and 90% were white British, the remainder being Asian (East Indian) and African. Their educational and socio-economic backgrounds (nearly all middle class) were fairly homogenous, and none had previously participated in any studies involving female body shape or attractiveness. It was predicted that the effect of breast size on judgment of attractiveness and age estimation would be dependent on overall body fat and the size of the waist-to-hip ratio.&lt;ref name="Furnham"&gt;Furnham, Adrian, Melanie Dias, and Alastair McClelland. "The Role of Body Weight, Waist-to-Hip Ratio, and Breast Size in Judgments of Female Attractiveness – Springer." Sex Roles 39.3-4 (n.d.): 311-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the participants were given a booklet with eight pictures in total. Each figure was identified as heavy or slender, feminine WHR or masculine WHR, and large-breasted or small-breasted. The participants rated the figures for four personal attributes (attractiveness, healthiness, femininity, and kindness/understanding).&lt;ref name="Furnham" /&gt;

When ratings of the figures' attractiveness were made, generally it appeared that bust size, WHR, and their weight were all important contributory elements. The female participants rated the figures with a low WHR as more attractive, healthy, feminine looking, and in the case of the heavy figure, more kind/understanding than did male participants. This is a particularly interesting finding, as most previous studies report that young women idealize female bodies solely on the basis of thinness. As far as the breast sizes of the slender figures is concerned, whether they had large or small breasts did not appear to have any effect on the ratings of attractiveness or kindness/understanding, and having larger breasts only increased the mean ratings of health and femininity very slightly. However, a heavy figure with a high WHR and a large bust was rated as the least attractive and healthy by all participants.&lt;ref name="Furnham" /&gt;

Waist-hip ratio is also a reliable cue to one’s sex and it is hypothesised that the "individuals who represent a mismatch based on the cue provided by WHR (e.g., women with high WHRs or men with low WHRs) would likely be viewed as unattractive by the opposite sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pazhoohi F, Liddle JR|title=Identifying feminine and masculine ranges for Waist-to-Hip ratio |journal=Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=227–232 |date=June 2012 |doi=10.1037/h0099212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food ==
A number of studies have been carried out with focus on food composition of diets in relation to changes in waist circumference adjusted for body mass index.

Whole-grain, ready-to-eat, oat cereal diets reduce [[low-density lipoprotein cholesterol]] and waist circumference in overweight or obese adults more than low-fibre control food diets. Weight loss did not vary between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maki KC, Beiseigel JM, Jonnalagadda SS, Gugger CK, Reeves MS, Farmer MV, Kaden VN, Rains TM | title = Whole-grain ready-to-eat oat cereal, as part of a dietary program for weight loss, reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in adults with overweight and obesity more than a dietary program including low-fiber control foods | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 110 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–14 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20102847 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2009.10.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mean annual change in waist circumference was more than 3 times as great for subjects in the white-bread cluster as subjects using a diet high in fruit, vegetables, reduced-fat dairy, and whole grains and low in red and processed meat, fast food, and soda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newby PK, Muller D, Hallfrisch J, Qiao N, Andres R, Tucker KL | title = Dietary patterns and changes in body mass index and waist circumference in adults | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 1417–25 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12791618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study suggests that dietary pattern high in fruit and dairy and low in white bread, processed meat, margarine, and soft drinks may help to prevent abdominal fat accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Romaguera D, Ängquist L, Du H, Jakobsen MU, Forouhi NG, Halkjær J, Feskens EJ, van der A DL, Masala G, Steffen A, Palli D, Wareham NJ, Overvad K, Tjønneland A, Boeing H, Riboli E, Sørensen TI | title = Food composition of the diet in relation to changes in waist circumference adjusted for body mass index | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = e23384 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21858094 | pmc = 3157378 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0023384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zirconium silicate''', also '''zirconium orthosilicate''', ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is a [[chemical compound]], a [[silicate]] of [[zirconium]]. It occurs in nature as [[zircon]], a [[silicate mineral]]. Powdered zirconium silicate is also known as zircon flour.

Zirconium silicate is usually colorless, but impurities induce various colorations. It is insoluble in water, acids, alkali and [[aqua regia]]. Hardness is 7.5 on the [[Mohs scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page= 1002| title =Handbook of inorganic chemicals| author= P. Patnaik| publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional| year = 2002| isbn = 0-07-049439-8| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
{{unref|section|date=January 2017}}
{{seealso|Chernobylite}}
Zirconium silicate occurs in nature as mineral [[zircon]]. Ore is mined from natural deposits and concentrated by various techniques. It is separated from sand by [[electrostatic]] and [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]] methods.

Also, the compound can be made by fusion of [[silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[zirconium oxide|ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in an arc furnace, or by reacting a zirconium salt with [[sodium silicate]] in an aqueous solution.

==Uses==
Zirconium silicate is used for manufacturing [[refractory material]]s for applications where resistance to [[corrosion]] by [[alkali]] materials is required. It is also used in production of some [[ceramic]]s, [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]], and [[ceramic glaze]]s. In enamels and glazes it serves as an [[opacifier]]. It can be also present in some [[cement]]s. Another use of zirconium silicate is as beads for [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] and [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]]. [[Thin film]]s of zirconium silicate and [[hafnium silicate]] produced by [[chemical vapor deposition]], most often [[MOCVD]], can be used as a [[high-k dielectric]] as a replacement for [[silicon dioxide]] in semiconductors.&lt;ref name="hand"&gt;

Zirconium silicates have also been studied for potential use in medical applications. For example, [[ZS-9]] is a zirconium silicate that was designed specifically to trap potassium [[ions]] over other ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140314040817/http://www.zspharma.com/ZS-9.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of [[hyperkalemia]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Zirconium disilicate is used in some [[Crown (dentistry)|dental crowns]] because of its hardness and because it is chemically nonreactive.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Toxicity==
Zirconium silicate is an abrasive irritant for skin and eyes. Chronic exposure to dust can cause pulmonary [[granuloma]]s, skin inflammation, and skin granuloma.&lt;ref name=MSDS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espimetals.com/msds%27s/zirconiumsilicate.pdf |title=Zirconium silicate MSDS |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111081325/http://www.espimetals.com/msds's/zirconiumsilicate.pdf |archivedate=November 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no known adverse effects for normal, incidental ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agsco.com/MSDS/Zirconium%20Silicate.pdf |format=PDF |title=Material Safety Data Sheet |website=Agsco.com |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
