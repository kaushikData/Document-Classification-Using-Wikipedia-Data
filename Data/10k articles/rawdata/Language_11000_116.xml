'''Analog recording''' (Greek, ''ana'' is "according to" and ''logos'' "relationship") is a technique used for the recording of [[analog signal]]s which, among many possibilities, allows '''analog audio''' and [[analog video]] for later playback.

Analog audio recording began with mechanical systems such as the [[phonautograph]] and [[phonograph]]. Later, electronic techniques such as [[wire recording]] and [[tape recorder]] were developed.

Analog recording methods store signals as a [[continuous signal]] ''in'' or ''on'' the media. The signal may be stored as a physical texture on a [[phonograph record]], or a fluctuation in the [[field strength]] of a [[magnetic recording]]. This is different from [[digital recording]] where [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s are [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]] and represented as [[discrete number]]s.

==Phonautograph==
The [[phonautograph]] is the earliest known device for recording [[sound]].

==The phonograph==
[[File:Edison and phonograph edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|Edison and his Phonograph Machine]]
The [[phonograph]] was the first machine used to capture and reproduce analog sound, and was invented by the well-known inventor [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877.  Edison incorporated various elements into his Phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain |first=Marshall |url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/analog-digital1.htm |title=How Analog and Digital Recording Works |publisher=howstuffworks.com |date=2000-04-01 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recording===
For a sound to be recorded by the [[Phonograph]], it has to go through three distinct steps.  First, the sound enters a cone-shaped component of the device, called the microphone diaphragm.  That sound causes the microphone diaphragm, which is connected to a small metal needle, to vibrate.  The needle then vibrates in the same way, causing its sharp tip to etch a distinctive groove into a [[Phonograph cylinder|cylinder]], which was made out of tinfoil.

===Playback===
In order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders, the recording process is essentially reversed.  As the cylinder spins, the needle follows the groove created by the previous recording session.  This causes the needle to vibrate, and then the diaphragm.  This vibration comes out of the diaphragm, which is now functioning as a sort of sound [[Audio power amplifier|amplification device]], much like the [[Wind instrument|bell]] on any wind instrument.  The result is an audible reproduction of the originally recorded sound.

===Phonograph problems===
[[Thomas Edison|Edison's]] [[phonograph]] was the first of its kind, but drawbacks were nevertheless obvious.  The biggest of these, and the one that ended up being fixed first, came from the physical contact between the phonograph needle and the [[Phonograph cylinder|tinfoil diaphragm]].  Because the needle had to continually make contact with the groove in the diaphragm every time the recording was played, the groove would wear down.  This meant that every single time a recording was played, it was one step closer to being gone forever.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}} Another problem with the phonograph was the permanence of its recordings. Unlike music today, which can be edited endlessly, the music captured by phonograph machines were single-take, live recordings.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

The last problem with the phonograph was related to [[fidelity]].  Fidelity is the similarity/difference between the original recorded sound, and that same sound after it has been reproduced by a playback device, in this case the phonograph.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}  As can be expected from such an early audio recording machine, the fidelity of Edison's phonograph was extremely low.  This lack of sound quality is why the phonograph was originally used to record speeches, meetings, and telephone calls, rather than music.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

==Gramophone==
[[File:BerlinerDisc1897.jpg|thumb|right|An early Berliner record]]
Fans of modern record players are already familiar with one very early improvement on the phonograph, known as the [[Berliner Gramophone|gramophone]].  Inventor [[Emile Berliner]] created the device in 1887, only ten years after Edison's original device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recording-history.org/HTML/phono_technology4.php |title=First Phonographs and Graphophones, and then Gramophones |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419043421/http://www.recording-history.org/HTML/phono_technology4.php |archivedate=2013-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
[[Emile Berliner|Berliner's]] main improvement to the phonograph was related to the component of the device that actually held the recorded information.  The previously used tinfoil cylinders were awkwardly shaped, making them hard to store.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}  They could also not be reproduced economically, which was another reason why they were not seen as a viable option for recorded music.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}
Berliner realized these disadvantages, and set out to create a better version of the tinfoil cylinder.  What he came up with was not a cylinder at all, but was rather a flat circular disc much like modern [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]].  These discs could not only be easily stacked and stored for safe-keeping, but were also comparatively easy to reproduce.  This quality allowed for the [[mass production]] of recorded discs, which was the first step towards commercially recorded music.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

===Problems===
Unfortunately, though the Gramophone was a large step up from the [[Phonograph]] commercially, it still had many of the same problems.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}} The mass production possibilities created by [[Emile Berliner|Berliner]]’s flat discs got companies thinking about recording music, but since nothing had been done to address the low fidelity issue, the industry had yet to really take off.  The problems with finality and breakdown of recordings started by the Phonograph were equally as prominent with the Gramophone.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

==Telegraphone==
[[File:US Patent 661,619 - Magnetic recorder.jpg|thumbnail|right|Early mechanical drawings of the telegraphone]]
The next great advancement in analog sound recording came in the form of the [[telegraphone]], which was created by [[Denmark|Danish]] inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]] between 1898 and 1900.  This machine was vastly different from the gramophone or the phonograph, in that instead of recording sound mechanically, it recorded using a process called [[Magnetic storage|electromagnetism]].{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recording-history.org/index.php |title=Recording History |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715015823/http://www.recording-history.org/index.php |archivedate=2013-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recording-history.org/HTML/wire2.php |title=Inventing the Wire Recorder |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514170031/http://www.recording-history.org/HTML/wire2.php |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Valdemar-poulsen-c1898.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Valdemar Poulsen]] --&gt;
[[Valdemar Poulsen|Poulsen]] was able to transmit an electrical signal, much like the one that would [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] over the radio or a telephone, and then capture it on a magnetizable element, in this case a length of steel wire, which was wrapped around a [[bass drum]].{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

===Problems===
Poulsen's [[Valdemar Poulsen|telegraphone]] was not without its share of problems.  First, the reels of steel wire were extremely heavy, weighing approximately {{convert|40|lb}} each.  Secondly, steel's scarcity at the time raised the price of recording; a single minute of recording would cost a full dollar, and the price was further increased because multiple recordings were necessary in order to capture the best rendition.  Moreover, steel wire could be dangerous, with a risk comparable to that of a [[bandsaw]].{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

Like the recording devices that came before it, the telegraphone recordings were nearly impossible to edit.  Rather than cutting and splicing together multiple takes, as could easily be done with scissors or a computer in future recording devices, this machine required both a [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|welding torch]] and a [[soldering]] tool to modify.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

==Magnetophon==
[[File:Ton S.b, tape unit.jpg|thumb|right|The Magnetophon]]
In 1935, inventor [[Fritz Pfleumer]] took the [[Magnetic storage|electromagnetic recording]] idea and took it to the next level.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}  Rather than using heavy, expensive, and dangerous steel wire like Poulsen, Pfleumer realized that he could coat normal strips of paper with tiny particles of [[iron]].  The iron would allow the paper to be magnetized in the same way as the steel wire, but would eliminate most of its shortcomings.  The [[magnetophon]] operated with a process nearly identical to that of the telegraphone.  An inscriber, called the [[recording head]], passes over the electromagnetic paper strip, creating patterns of varying magnetic [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] within it, which can later be played back.  The playback is achieved using a reversal of the recording process.  The pre-magnetized paper, which had come to be known as [[Magnetic tape|tape]], passed over a coil, creating changes in [[magnetic flux]].  These changes were translated into an electric current, which when [[Instrument amplifier|amplified]] produced a replica of the previously recorded sounds.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

===Advantages===
There were many advantages of tape recording, but the most important was that it led to the development of [[Multitrack recording|multitracking]].  [[Multitrack recording|Multitracking]] occurs when multiple takes of a performance, which were recorded at separate times, are brought together to play simultaneously.  This is the method all [[recording studio]]s use to this day, in order to record all of the separate instruments of a song, and get the best possible takes from all of the musicians.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

A reel of tape could also hold far more recorded information than previous mediums.  For instance, Berliner's discs held only a few minutes of recording, meaning that each disc usually contained a single song, or multiple short clips. Pfleumer's tape reels, on the other hand, could hold up to thirty minutes of sound.  This ability is what eventually led to the concept of a music "album", or collection of multiple songs.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

===Problems===
The original magnetophon had its share of setbacks as well.  Namely, the problem of low [[fidelity]] found in previous devices had yet to be solved.  Though audiences and inventors had not yet experienced what high fidelity recording would even sound like, they knew that the sound they were hearing from recordings needed to be improved before any kind of recorded music industry could be expected.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

==Modern tape recorder==
The introduction of [[tape bias]] to recording systems improved fidelity to acceptable and eventually high-fidelity performance. Adding a DC bias to the signal sent to the recording head reduced distortion in the recording. The use of an AC bias further reduced distortion and greatly improved the frequency response of recording systems.{{sfn|Milner|2009|pp=1-416}}

'''Anga Lipi''' (অঙ্গ লিপি) is a historical [[writing system]] or script of the [[Anga area]] of India.It is believed to have been originated from Mithilakshara or the [[Tirhuta]] script used to write [[Maithili language|Maithili]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Etymology and history==
''[[Anga]]'' refers to a region in what is now [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] states of [[India]], and ''Lipi'' means ''script''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Olivelle | first1 = Patrick | title =Between the empires: society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE | date = 2006 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = [[Oxford University]]  | isbn = 0-19-530532-9 | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efaOR_-YsIcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Anga Script is mentioned in an ancient Sanskrit language Buddhist book the [[Lalitavistara Sūtra|"Lalitvistar"]] (ललितविस्तर), which names Anga Lipi relatively early in the list of 64 scripts known to the Buddha. The script was specific to the [[Anga]] region, or [[Anga Mahajanapada]], and was among those known to Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Wilson  | first1 =John |  title =Indian Caste | date = 2005 | publisher = Adamant Media Corporation | location =   | isbn = 1-4021-7996-0 | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2vPtVVNPcIC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=anga+lipi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=krkcTPfdOYqVrAertvzpCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEEQuwUwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anga%20lipi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was mentioned as the fourth most important script of Ancient India in one version. [[Arthur Coke Burnell]] thought that some of the sixty four scripts mentioned in "Lalitvistar" were mythical, but he considered some, including Dravid, Anga and Banga, to be real, though not appearing as distinct alphabets until the 9th or 10th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =Coke Burnell  | first1 =Arthur  |  title =Elements of South-Indian Palaeography | date = 1878| publisher = Trübner &amp; Co | location = London | isbn =  | page =  52 |url= https://archive.org/stream/elementssouthin05burngoog#page/n70/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Burnell regarded this passage as a late [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]].)

==Characteristics and comparison==
Anga Lipi and [[Eastern Nagari script]] might have been derived from Brahmic, with some regional characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sircar  | first1 =D.C. |  title =Journal of ancient Indian history | date = 1986 | publisher = [[University of Calcutta]],Dept. of Ancient Indian History and Culture | location =  | isbn = | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfxtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=anga+lipi&amp;dq=anga+lipi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I7McTMn7KsmGrQfuvaDfCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the belief that the development of local characteristics in alphabets was continuing from earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =  K.L.M.  | first1 = Firma |  title =The people and culture of Bengal, a study in origins | date = 2002 |location =  | isbn =  | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=viRuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=anga+lipi&amp;dq=anga+lipi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I7McTMn7KsmGrQfuvaDfCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apostrophe Protection Society''' is a UK society that has "the specific aim of preserving the correct use of this currently much abused punctuation mark".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apostrophe.org.uk/ The Apostrophe Protection Society]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2001 by John Richards, a retired [[sub-editor]], in response to his observations of widespread incorrect use of the [[apostrophe]].

The website includes many claimed examples of apostrophe "abuse"; it says it is intended to help correct, rather than chide, offenders. Richards says he has a standard, polite letter that explains the basic rules for apostrophe use, which he sends to supporters to forward on to offending businesses and other organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

When an architecture firm is working on a project that is outside of their geographic location or range of expertise, it will often choose to work with an architect that is either local to the project site or skilled in that particular area of expertise. In this case, the primary architect works with the local architect in order to complete the project, and the local architect becomes the "architect of record." This type of working relationship is common when high-profile architects (or "[[Starchitect|starchitects]]") win design bids but find themselves in need of architects with more practical skills or knowledge of local conditions. Or more pragmatically, the high-profile architect simply needs an architect who is local to the project site, facilitating quicker site visits and project oversight.

The local architecture firms that are responsible for corresponding with city agencies about code compliance, tender documents, client communication and creating up to 90 percent of the construction documents and carry out construction inspections are similar, but should be referred as the "executive architect." {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The '''Assistive Technology Industry Association''' ('''ATIA''') is a not-for-profit membership organization of manufacturers, sellers and providers of technology-based assistive devices and/or services, for people with disabilities. ATIA represents the interests of its members to business, government, education, and the many agencies that serve people with disabilities. One goal of the ATIA is to "speak with the common voice" for Its mission is to serve as the collective voice of the [[Assistive Technology]] (AT) industry so that the best products and services are delivered to people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atia.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid%3D3681 |title=About ATIA - Information |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108094958/http://www.atia.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3681 |archivedate=2010-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1998, ATIA is governed by a 10-member Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atia.org/about-atia/board-of-directors/ |title=ATIA Board of Directors |website=www.atia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATIA has over 120 individual and corporate members. Its offices are located in Chicago, Illinois.

Since 1999, ATIA has held annual conferences that provide forums for education and communication to professional practitioners serving those with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptional Parent, February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The annual conferences are also open to people with disabilities, their caregivers, their family members, and members of the general public. In 2009, ATIA began providing educational online [[webinar]]s to serve these groups.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptional Parent, February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ATIA has also held conferences in collaboration with the [[Job Accommodation Network]] and United States Business Leadership Network (USBLN). The published result of one such conference is ''Roadmaps for Enhancing Employment of Persons with Disabilities through Accessible Technology''.

== Publications ==
ATIA produces the Assistive Technology Outcomes and Benefits Journal (ATOB) in a collaborative scholarly partnership with the Special Education Assistive Technology Center (SEAT Center) at [[Illinois State University]]. ATOB publishes articles related to the outcomes and benefits of assistive technology for persons with disabilities across the lifespan. ATOB is a peer-reviewed annual publication, first published in 2004.

== Industry standard setting ==
ATIA is involved in industry standard setting through its Accessibility Interoperability Alliance (AIA) division. AIA was initiated in 2007 as an independent organization by a group of leading [[Information Technology]] (IT) and Assistive Technology (AT) companies, content providers, and other key engineering organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since then they have been working to develop standards and collaborate on the creation of solutions to long-standing compatibility problems that hinder the development of [[accessibility]] solutions for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hodne, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Business Wire, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 AIA become a technical and engineering division within ATIA.

'''Avrom Reyzen''' (Abraham Reisen) (1876 &amp;ndash; 1953) was a Yiddish writer, poet and editor, and the elder brother of the [[Yiddishist]] [[Zalman Reisen]]. 

Reyzen was born in [[Koidanov]] (Minsk, eastern Belorussia). Supported by Yaknehoz (pseudonym of Yeshaye Nisn Hakoyen Goldberg), while in his early teens Reyzen sent articles to ''Dos Yudishes folks-blat'' in [[St Petersburg, Russia]]. 

He corresponded with Jacob Dinezon and [[I. L. Peretz]]. In 1891, they published Reyzen’s poem ''Ven dos lebn is farbitert'' (''When Life Is Embittered'') in their ''Di yudishe bibliotek'' (''The Yiddish Library''). His first story, ''A kapore der noz abi a goldener zeyger mit 300 rubl nadn'' (''Damn the Nose, As Long As There Is a Dowry of a Watch and 300 Rubles'') was published in [[Vilna]] in 1892.&lt;ref name=yivo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Reyzen_Avrom |title=YIVO Encyclopedia article on Reyzen by Nathan Cohen |publisher=Yivoencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1895, he joined the Russian army, serving in a musicians’ unit until 1899. 

In addition to writing for the Zionist ''Der yud'', in 1900 Reyzen created the literary anthology ''Dos tsvantsikste yorhundert'' (''The Twentieth Century'') which included work by I. L. Peretz, [[Hersh Dovid Nomberg]], [[David Pinski]], and others. A believer in the socialist ideology, Reyzen wrote for the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]], sometimes under the pseudonym M. Vilner, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=yivo /&gt;

In 1902, Reyzen published a poetry collection, ''Tsayt lider'' (''Poems of the Time''), and in 1903 issued a book of stories, ''Ertseylungen un bilder'' (''Stories and Scenes''). He wrote for ''Der fraynd'' and ''Der tog'' in [[St Petersburg]].

A founder (with his brother Zalman, [[Chaim Zhitlovsky]], I.L. Peretz, and his close friends [[Scholem Asch]] and Hersch Dovid Nomberg) of [[Yiddishism]], he took part in the [[Czernowitz Conference|Czernowitz Yiddish Language Conference]] of 1908 at which Yiddish was proclaimed a national language of the Jews.&lt;ref name=save&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savethemusic.com/bin/archives.cgi?q=bio&amp;id=Avrom+Reisen |title=Save the Music bio on Avrom Reisen |publisher=Savethemusic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721165052/http://savethemusic.com/bin/archives.cgi?q=bio&amp;id=Avrom+Reisen |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1910, he began the [[Warsaw]] literary weekly ''Eyropeyishe literatur'' (''European Literature'') and another called ''Fraye erd'' (''Free Land'').

In early 1911, Reyzen moved to [[New York City]] and contributed to ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward|Forverts]]'' and ''Tsukunft''. His ''Troyerike motivn gevidmet oreme layt'' (''Sad Motifs Dedicated to the Poor'') was published (at Sholem Aleichem's recommendation) in Philadelphia’s ''Shtot tsaytung''. From 1929 he worked exclusively for ''Forverts'', where he wrote a story each week, without a break. In 1935 he completed the three-volume autobiographical ''Epizodn fun mayn lebn'' (''Episodes From My Life'').&lt;ref name=save /&gt;

[[Irving Howe]] wrote about Reyzen:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The miracle of a Reisen is not that he derives from the people but that he remains at harmony with them... Precisely because he regards being a Jew as a "natural" condition of life, beyond query or challenge, his poems and stories take his culture utterly for granted: they neither explain nor justify"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At his death in 1953, Reyzen was eulogized:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are many Yiddish writers who owe their success to Reisen's encouragement. For years he published and edited, under great sacrifices, Yiddish journals with the primary aim of providing a platform for young, struggling writers... He had no arrogance, no pretensions and no personal vanity."&lt;ref name=save /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Spectator, May 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Bathari''' is an [[Afro-Asiatic language]] of [[Oman]], located on the southeast coast facing the [[Khuriya Muriya Islands]] (17°40′46″N 55°22′19″E).  The language is very similar to [[Mehri language|Mehri]] and some members of the Bathari tribe speak Mehri instead of Bathari.&lt;ref name="Steska"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steska|first1=Mike|title=DICE Questionnaire - BHM|url=http://dice.missouri.edu/docs/afro-asiatic/Bathari.pdf|publisher=[[University of Missouri]]|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first westerner to discover the existence of Bathari was Bertram Thomas in 1929.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stroomer|first1=Harry|last2=Johnstone|first2=Thomas M.|title=Harsusi Texts from Oman: Based on the Field Materials of T.M.

==Name==
The name ''Bathari'' has been variously rendered: ''Batahari, Bautahari, Botahari, Bathara.  ''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.verbix.com|title=Where on earth do they speak Bathari?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stress always falls on the last long syllable in Bathari, unless the stress unit is only composed of short syllables. In this case, the first syllable is stressed. As with other Modern South Arabian languages, Bathari nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine) and three numbers (singular, dual and plural), but the dual is reportedly obsolete. The ending ''-(v)t'' marks feminine nouns, apart from loanwords from Arabic that end in ''-h'.''' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also, it is not Shahri but Bathari which retains (or perhaps has retaken, from Arabic) the Arabic-like 'ain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Charles D.|date=1969-01-01|title=Modern South Arabian Determination-A Clue Thereto from Shaḥri|jstor=598276|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=89|issue=1|pages=22–27|doi=10.2307/598276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Bathari words were mentioned in Johnstone's Mehri Lexicon and Jibbali Lexicon (1981).  Stroomer affirms that it is a dialect of Mehri (p. xii), whereas Simeone-Senelle considers it a separate language. She does admit, however, that Bathari, along with Harsfsi, is closely related to Mehri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaye|first=Alan S.|date=2001-01-01|title=Review of Mehri Texts from Oman (Based on Field Materials of T.

In terms of speaker numbers they range from 12 to 20 for Bathari to over 180,000 for Mehri.

== Threat of Extinction ==
In addition to the threat of [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Mehri also threatens to replace the language due to its less prestigious position.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The tribe seems to be dying out with the language also under threat from modem education solely in Arabic.

The '''Brothers Halbertsma''' were three brothers born in the [[Friesland|Frisian]] village of [[Grou]] towards the end of the 18th century, who played a role of crucial importance for the development of a [[written language|written]] literature in the [[West Frisian language|Western Frisian language]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Breuker, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hemminga, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Jensma, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; These three brothers were:
*[[Justus Hiddes Halbertsma|Justus (or Joast) Hiddes Halbertsma]] (1789–1869).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied theology in Amsterdam, and afterwards was a [[Mennonites|Mennonite]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] in [[Bolsward]] and since 1822 in [[Deventer]]. He was a somewhat distant and cerebral author of short stories and poems. In his works ideas were more important than emotions. Besides his literary achievements he was also a scholar of [[linguistics]], and with his (unfinished) ''Lexicon Frisicum'' he took the first step towards the composition of a [[dictionary]] of the Western Frisian language.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, pp. 588–591.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma]] (1792–1852).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, p. 591.&lt;/ref&gt; He kept their father's bakery running after the untimely death of both their parents in 1809, later becoming an international [[merchant]] in dairy products (mainly butter and cheese). He lived in Grou his entire life, and wrote for the most part humorous [[rhyme]]s and poems. Those were generally not of the same literary quality as his brothers' works, but became quite popular with the common man.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, pp. 591–592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Wiersma, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma]] (1797–1858).&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied medicine in [[Leiden]] and [[Heidelberg]], and became a physician in Grou. His poems and short stories were much more emotional than those of his brother Justus, and his poetry in particular is still very much admired.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, pp. 592–594.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Work of art|oeuvre]] included the poem ''[[De Alde Friezen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal en Boorsma, pp. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt; which in 1875 became the [[national anthem]] of the [[West Frisians|Western Frisian people]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroor, p. 2831.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these three writers, who are usually meant when speaking of the 'Brothers Halbertsma', there was a fourth brother, who did not produce any literary work:
*Binnert Hiddes Halbertsma (1795–1847).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He took over the family bakery which had been kept going by his brother Tsjalling until he was old enough, and became a baker in Grou. Later he sold the bakery and started a new business trading in [[stave (wood)|staves]] for wooden [[barrel]]s. Under the leadership of his son Hidde Binnerts Halbertsma and his grandson Pieter Goslik Halbertsma&lt;ref&gt;Schroor, p. 1125.&lt;/ref&gt; this company evolved into Halbertsma Houtbewerking N.V.,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; which was taken over in 1990, and since is part of the Faber Halbertsma Group.&lt;ref&gt;Schroor, p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers Halbertsma were all born in the house of their parents on Kowemerk ("Cow Market") street in [[Grou]], a village in the central part of the Dutch province of [[Friesland]].&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Wiersma, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; They were sons of the baker and small-time merchant&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Oppewal en Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Hidde Joasts Halbertsma (1756–1809)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Terpstra, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Ruerdtsje (or Riurtk)&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Tsjallings Binnerts (1767–1809).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Two children who were born later died in early childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Terpstra, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; the little boy in 1803,&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; and the little girl in 1805.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Ruerdtsje Binnerts was a scion of a prominent family in Grou.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Her people were [[Mennonites]],&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; and although her husband had been raised a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], he converted after marrying her.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; From Justus' letters Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; a loving mother, and a deeply religious person.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Wiersma, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a [[mariner]] before his marriage.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; In 1784, he published a long [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] poem under the title ''Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland'' ("Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in [[Gelderland]]").&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents were a family trait.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

The Brothers Halbertsma were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Justus was just twenty years of age, Tsjalling seventeen, Binnert thirteen, and Eeltsje only eleven.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Justus and Eeltsje started to write short fiction and poetry which can be considered [[folk literature]].&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Wiersma, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; As Justus acted as editor for Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and [[prose]] were strongly connected from the very beginning and for the most part published together.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason the linguist Foeke Buitenrust Hettema would later describe Halbertsma as the '[[literary agent]]' of his brothers Eeltsje and Tsjalling.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

In 1822, Justus and Eeltsje's early works were collected under the title ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'' ("Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket"), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Breuker, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Twerda, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; A second, expanded edition of ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'', consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;Terpstra, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twerda, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersma, pp. 5, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (''De Noarger Rún oan Gabe Skroar''), 1840 (''Twigen út in Alde Stamme''), 1854 (''Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen''), and 1858 (''De Jonkerboer'' and ''Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonstêd'').&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brothers Halbertsma 1958, pp. 589–594.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, contributions by the third brother, Tsjalling, were also inserted.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; After the death of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff.&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;Wiersma, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of ''[[Rimen en Teltsjes]]'' ("Rhymes and Tales").&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, pp. 603–606.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt;

This work is now thought of as the national book of Western Frisian literature,&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; and although the [[literature|literary]] value of this collection was later disputed by some [[literary critic|critics]],&lt;ref&gt;Breuker, pp. 594–596.&lt;/ref&gt; it is undeniable that ''Rimen en Teltsjes'' and its predecessor ''De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar'' played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/frisian.htm|title=Frisian languages, alphabets and pronunciation|website=www.omniglot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave "the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected."&lt;ref&gt;Wadman, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; As of today ''Rimen en Teltsjes'' still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

A '''chalkboard eraser''' (or '''blackboard duster''') is a special type of [[eraser]] specifically used to erase [[chalk]] markings on slating paint (used on [[chalkboard]]s and [[Slate_(writing)|slates]]). It is most commonly made of [[felt]] strips attached to an ergonomically designed handle.

==History==

Chalkboard erasers were first invented around 1863 by John L. Hammett,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history/He-Ja/J-L-Hammett-Company.html#b J.L. Hammett Company Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on J.L. Hammett Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who owned some stores that sold and created school products in [[Rhode Island]] and then later in [[Boston]]. Mostly slates were sold there as well as chalk and so on. At the time, rags or old cloths were used to erase and get rid of the chalk markings on slates in schools, offices, and for the most part, everywhere. Hammett created the chalkboard before the invention of the chalkboard eraser by creating ''slating paint''. Hammett then, during a presentation on his chalkboard "discovered" that [[wool]] felt strips wiped off the chalk writing better than rags. Following this discovery he gathered a team to create the custom eraser for sale. The erasers proved to be a success for Hammett and, later in the 19th century, he created a company that also sold inexpensive supplies for teachers and [[school]]s, such as [[paper]], [[ink]], etc. Hammett ultimately sold the company.

'''Chashan 茶山''' (autonym: ''{{IPA|ŋɔ˧˩ tʃʰaŋ˥}}'') is a [[Burmish languages|Burmish]] language spoken in Pianma Township 片马镇, [[Lushui County]], Yunnan, China, in Xiapianma 下片马,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=57081&lt;/ref&gt; Gangfang 岗房,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=57071&lt;/ref&gt; and Gulang 古浪&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=57070&lt;/ref&gt; villages (Dai, et al. 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.china-europa-forum.net/a___________1.pdf 片马茶山人和谐的多语生活]&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to [[Lashi language|Lashi]], and has 56.3% lexical similarity with Lashi of [[Lushui County]] out of a sample of 1,000 vocabulary words (Dai 2010:118).

In Pianma Township, there are 587 Chashan people officially classified as ethnic [[Lisu people|Lisu]]. The local people consider the Chashan to be a distinct ethnic group, separate from the [[Jingpo people]] ({{zh|景颇族}}). The Chashan autonym is ''{{IPA|ŋɔ˧˩ tʃʰaŋ˥}}'' (Echang 峨昌), similar to that of the [[Achang language|Achang]]. More Chashan speakers may be found across the border in [[Kachin State]], [[Burma]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6295">'''Conceptual blending''', also called '''conceptual integration''' or '''view application''', is a theory of [[cognition]] developed by [[Gilles Fauconnier]] and [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]]. According to this theory, elements and vital relations from diverse scenarios are "blended" in a [[subconscious]] process, which is assumed to be ubiquitous to everyday thought and language. Conceptual blending is an emerging field of studies for computer scientists wishing to pursue researches in artificial intelligence.{{CitationNeeded|date=June 2017}}

==History==
The development of this theory began in 1993 and a representative early formulation is found in the online article Conceptual Integration and Formal Expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zakros.ucsd.edu/~trohrer/metaphor/turner.htm Conceptual Integration and Formal Expression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516203828/http://zakros.ucsd.edu/~trohrer/metaphor/turner.htm |date=2006-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner and Fauconnier cite [[Arthur Koestler]]'s 1964 book ''[[The Act of Creation]]'' as an early forerunner of conceptual blending: Koestler had identified a common pattern in creative achievements in the arts, sciences and humor that he had termed "[[bisociation]] of matrices."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Turner, Gilles Fauconnier: The Way We Think. Conceptual Blending and the Mind's Hidden Complexities. New York: Basic Books 2002, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  A newer version of blending theory, with somewhat different terminology, was presented in Turner and Fauconnier's 2002 book, ''The Way We Think''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|title=The Way We Think: Conceptual Blending and the Mind's Hidden Complexities
|last=Fauconnier
|first=Gilles
|author2=Turner, Mark
|year=2008
|publisher=Basic Books
}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conceptual blending, in the Fauconnier and Turner formulation, is one of the theoretical tools used in [[George Lakoff]] and [[Rafael_E._Núñez|Rafael Núñez]]'s ''[[Where Mathematics Comes From]]'', in which the authors assert that "understanding mathematics requires the mastering of extensive networks of metaphorical blends."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational models==

Conceptual blending is closely related to [[frame (artificial intelligence)|frame]]-based theories, but goes beyond these primarily in that it is a theory of how to ''combine'' frames (or frame-like objects). An early computational model of a process called "[[view application]]", which is closely related to conceptual blending (which did not exist at the time), was implemented in the 1980s by Shrager at CMU and PARC, and applied in the domains of causal reasoning about complex devices&lt;ref&gt;Shrager, J. (1987) Theory Change via View Application in Instructionless Learning. Machine Learning 2 (3), 247–276.&lt;/ref&gt; and scientific reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Shrager, J. (1990) Commonsense perception and the psychology of theory formation. In Shrager &amp; Langley (Eds.) Computational models of scientific discovery and theory formation. San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent computational accounts of blending have been developed in areas such as mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Guhe, Markus, Alison Pease, Alan Smaill, Maricarmen Martinez, Martin Schmidtb, Helmar Gust, Kai-Uwe Kühnberger and Ulf Krumnack (2011). A computational account of conceptual blending in basic mathematics. Cognitive Systems Research Volume 12, Issues 3–4, September–December 2011, pp. 249–265 Special Issue on Complex Cognition&lt;/ref&gt;   Some later models are based upon [[Structure mapping engine|Structure Mapping]], which did not exist at the time of the earlier implementations.

==The philosophical status of the theory==

In his book ''The Literary Mind''&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation
|title=The literary mind
|last=Turner

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;93), conceptual blending theorist Mark Turner states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Conceptual blending is a fundamental instrument of the every day mind, used in our basic construal of all our realities, from the social to the scientific.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Insights obtained from conceptual blends constitute the products of creative thinking, however conceptual blending theory is not itself a complete theory of creativity, inasmuch as it does not illuminate the issue of where the inputs to a blend originate.  In other words, conceptual blending provides a terminology for describing creative products, but has little to say on the matter of inspiration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7960">'''Coup de glotte''' or 'shock of the [[glottis]]' is a term used in the theory of singing technique to describe a particular method of emitting or opening a note by an abrupt physical mechanism of the glottis (the space between the vocal folds). During the 19th century there was disagreement among teachers and performers as to whether the technique should be taught as a normal part of vocal method or not. The technique is still sometimes used to achieve particular effects, dramatic or ornamental, but is usually avoided in the teaching of fundamental vocal method.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In English, it is often called a glottal attack.

== Tone production and vocal 'attack' ==
Vocal sound is produced by a column of air passing from the [[lung]]s through the larynx while the [[vocal cords]] or ligaments are drawn together, leaving narrow spaces through which the air passes in short, rapid pulsations or vibrations. The discipline of training aims to remove all rigidity and strain in the throat while governing the maximum economy of the ratio of breath to tone produced, so that a relaxed and pure tone may float freely on the breath, supported by the trained and elastic pressure of the diaphragm upon the lungs.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

When singing a note, it is desirable that the release of breath and the attack of the tone should occur simultaneously and without artifice. When beginning on a vowel, with no added consonant to mask the start of the note, one can hear if there is any undesirable emission of breath or aspirate ('''Ha''') ''before'' the production of tone. If the voice is correctly produced the union of tone and breath should be spontaneous, but if it is not, this fault will apply to every note produced even when the effect is masked by a consonant, and will form a basic (and vocally destructive) flaw in the vocal method.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Advocacy of 'coup de glotte' ==
The 'coup de glotte' was taught by the very famous teacher [[Manuel García (baritone)|Manuel Garcia]] as the means of achieving this in normal singing method. Garcia had invented or implemented the [[laryngoscope]], and sought to present scientific explanations for certain functions. He expressed it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The pupil... should draw in breath slowly, and then produce the sounds by a neat, resolute articulation of the glottis, upon the broad Italian vowel A. If this movement be properly executed, the sound will come out bright and round. Care however must be taken to [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] the sound at once on the note itself, and not to slur up to it, or feel for it. The pupil must also be warned against confounding the articulation or stroke of the glottis with the stroke of the chest, which latter resembles the act of coughing, or the effort made in expelling some obstruction from the throat...&lt;br /&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
The glottis is prepared for articulation by closing it, which causes a momentary accumulation of air below; and it is then opened by a sudden and vigorous stroke, similar to the action of the lips when strongly emphasising the letter P. Some masters recommend the use of [consonants, e.g. Pa, La] in order to acquire precision in striking notes; but in our opinion this plan... has the disadvantage of merely disguising the faulty articulation of the glottis, without possessing any power whatever of correcting it.' Garcia, ''A Compendious Treatise'', Part 1 Chap. 6, section on ''Articulation of the Glottis''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
Much of Garcia's 'method' remains extremely important as a plan for the correct development and production of the voice. But in this respect his 'scientific' approach misfired, and resulted in many students and singers attempting to reproduce the effect described by conscious muscular movement in the throat. This often had injurious results. An essential basis of expressive singing is that the breath and tone should be united without any conscious adjustment of the vocal mechanism, through teaching-methods which direct the singer's attention away from the muscular apparatus by which the sound is produced.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The technique (of 'some masters') referred to by Garcia of vocal exercising rapidly repeating plosive syllables such as 'Pa', transfers the momentary restraint of breath from the larynx or glottis to the lips, so that the natural diaphragmatic attack, without glottal manipulation, is learned. The use of soft vocalised syllables such as 'Ma' or 'Na', in rapid succession on single notes or in ''[[vocalise]]s'', assist in directing the tone to its 'forward' focus of resonance as the tone remains continuously engaged while the lips of the mouth are intermittently closed and opened and the nasal passages remain unobstructed.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The criticism of the method is expressed, for instance, by Mme [[Luisa Tetrazzini|Tetrazzini]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;
In the result the "attack" is certainly very sharp and clean, but personally I cannot recommend this particular method of achieving that result, since the effect is anything but agreeable to the ear, and there is good reason for thinking that the practice, besides being unnecessary, is also injurious to a vocal organ... There should never be any strain or forcing of any kind, and on the same principle is the rule as to the amount of breath emitted, which should always be the smallest quantity possible which suffices to produce the tone required. (''How to Sing'', 1923, Chap. 14, ''Vocal Cords''.){{citation needed|date=January 2013}} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== A historical debate ==
A very resounding condemnation of the ''coup de glotte'' as a singing technique was given by [[Victor Maurel]], in a public lecture at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in July 1892. The debate at that time was strong, and is reported lucidly in several phrases by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. The technique was then being advocated by the teacher Charles Lunn (who trained the baritone [[Frederic Austin]]) and to an even greater extent by Dr J.W. Bernhardt, in lectures and pamphlets or books on singing method. Shaw noticed the tendency of the technique to produce coarseness in the middle register, and attributed the fault to the Garcia method, and to the teaching of the Royal Academy of Music.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 1892-93 Shaw and Lunn clashed publicly over the impact of the technique on such singers as [[Thérèse Tietjens]], [[Mathilde Marchesi]], [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Charles Santley]]. Lunn claimed that the attack on a vowel was impossible without the coup de glotte: Shaw used the example of the organ pipe, or of whistling, to assert the opposite. In the cases of Melba and Santley, at least, the living example left no doubt that this was not an integral part of their vocal method.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[Image:HarlanEstate.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cult Wine, Harlan Estate]]

'''Cult wines''' are those for which dedicated groups of committed enthusiasts will pay large sums of money. Such [[wine]]s include, for example, [[Screaming Eagle Winery and Vineyards|Screaming Eagle]] from America and [[Penfolds Grange]] from [[Australian wine|Australia]], among many others.

Cult wines are often seen as trophy wines to be collected or as [[investment wine]] to be held rather than consumed. Because price is often seen as an indicator of quality, sellers may adopt a [[premium pricing]] strategy where high prices are used to increase the desirability of such wines. This is true even for less expensive wines. For example, one vintner explained that "on several occasions we have had difficulty selling wines at $75, but as soon as we raise the price to $125 they sell out and get put on allocation".&lt;ref name=decacrus&gt;''Decanter'' (June, 2006). "Cape crusaders". pp. 90 &amp; 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wines that fall under the title occasionally are from Burgundy, Bordeaux, Rhône and Italy.

These wines when scored highly by [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.|Robert Parker]] have had a tendency to increase in price resembling the Bordeaux investment market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Sommeliers look at their best options  |url=http://www.wineinvestment.org/29-11-08_Sommeliers_look_at_their_best_options.html |quote=Emrich-Schönleber Riesling Mineral, 2007. A sommelier describes the wine as “Riesling is an undervalued variety and with this wine the quality is way higher than the price “. |work=[[WINEINVESTMENT]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==California cult wines==
California cult wines refers to any of the [[California wine]]s "typically but not exclusively [[Napa Valley (wine)|Napa Valley]] Cabernets" for which collectors, investors and enthusiastic consumers will pay high prices. The emergence of the cult movement coincided with trends in the 1990s towards riper fruit and wines with bigger and more concentrated flavors. The producers of such wines include [[Araujo Estates]], [[Bryant Family Vineyard]], [[Colgin Cellars]], [[Dalla Valle Vineyards]], [[Grace Family Vineyards]], [[Harlan Estate]], [[Schrader Cellars]], [[Screaming Eagle Winery and Vineyards|Screaming Eagle]] and [[Sine Qua Non (wine)|Sine Qua Non]]. All have scored 100 point scores from wine critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/cult-worship-the-new-cult-cabernets Cult Worship: The New Cult Cabernets], Food &amp; Wine, January, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323968704578652194244614414?mod=djemonwine_t An Eminent New Leader for a Cult Cabernet], Wall St. Journal, August 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winespectator.com/wssaccess/show/id/40916], Wine Spectator, November 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

These wines are generally very expensive and are limited production (often fewer than 600 cases per year) and can command several times their "release price" in the secondary market.

==Bordeaux cult wines==
The cult wines of Bordeaux tend to be left-bank [[Cabernet Sauvignon|cabernet]]-based wines that ranked highly in the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855|Classification of 1855]]. [[Château Lafite Rothschild]], [[Château Latour]], [[Château Margaux]], [[Château Haut-Brion]], and [[Château Mouton Rothschild]] all qualify. Right-bank wines from [[Pétrus (wine)|Pétrus]], [[Château Le Pin]], [[Château Angélus]], and [[Château Cheval Blanc]] are also highly sought-after. With the exception of Le Pin (which was first produced in 1979&lt;ref name="Cellarnotes Le Pin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chateau Le Pin|url=http://www.cellarnotes.net/chateau_le_pin.htm|publisher=Cellarnotes.net|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), all of these estates have a long history of fine wine production, going back in some cases before the 1700s. The production levels of these wines is generally higher than California cult wines: Haut-Brion, for example, produces 10-12,000 cases annually, Lafite produces just under 30,000, and Petrus produces 6,000. Le Pin would be one of the smallest-producing of the Bordeaux cult wines, at 600-700 cases a year.

'''Deterrence theory''' gained increased prominence as a military strategy during the [[Cold War]] with regard to the use of [[nuclear weapons]]. It took on a unique connotation during this time as an inferior nuclear force, by virtue of its extreme destructive power, could deter a more powerful adversary, provided that this force could be protected against destruction by a surprise attack. ''Deterrence'' is a strategy intended to [[Coercive diplomacy|dissuade]] an adversary from taking an action not yet started, or to prevent them from doing something that another state desires. A credible nuclear deterrent, [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]] wrote in 1959, must be always at the ready, yet never used.&lt;ref name="Brodie_1959"&gt;

Deterrence is a state of mind brought about by the existence of a credible threat of unacceptable counteraction. It assumes and requires rational decision makers."}}
  
In [[Thomas Schelling]]'s (1966) classic work on deterrence, the concept that military strategy can no longer be defined as the science of military victory is presented. Instead, it is argued that military strategy was now equally, if not more, the art of coercion, of intimidation and deterrence.&lt;ref name="Schelling_1966"&gt;Since the consequence of a breakdown of the nuclear deterrence strategy is so catastrophic for human civilisation, it is reasonableness to employ the strategy only if the chance of breakdown is zero.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schelling says the capacity to harm another state is now used as a motivating factor for other states to avoid it and influence another state's behavior. To be coercive or deter another state, violence must be anticipated and avoidable by accommodation. It can therefore be summarized that the use of the power to hurt as bargaining power is the foundation of deterrence theory, and is most successful when it is held in reserve.&lt;ref name="Schelling_1966" /&gt;

In 2004 [[Frank C. Zagare]] made the case that deterrence theory is logically inconsistent, not empirically accurate, and that it is deficient as a theory. In place of classical deterrence, rational choice scholars have argued for ''perfect deterrence'', which assumes that states may vary in their internal characteristics and especially in the credibility of their threats of retaliation.&lt;ref name="Zagare_2004"&gt;

In a January 2007 article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', veteran [[cold-war]] policy makers [[Henry Kissinger]], [[William Perry|Bill Perry]], [[George Shultz]], and [[Sam Nunn]] reversed their previous position and asserted that far from making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk.&lt;ref name=globalzero&gt;{{cite web

==Concept==

The use of military threats as a means to deter international crises and war has been a central topic of [[international security]] research for at least 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Carl von Clausewitz, On War, trans. and ed. Michael Howard and Peter Paret (Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Research has predominantly focused on the theory of rational deterrence to analyze the conditions under which conventional deterrence is likely to succeed or fail. Alternative theories however have challenged the rational deterrence theory and have focused on organizational theory and [[cognitive psychology]].

The concept of deterrence can be defined as the use of threats by one party to convince another party to refrain from initiating some course of action.&lt;ref name="Huth_1999"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A threat serves as a deterrent to the extent that it convinces its target not to carry out the intended action because of the costs and losses that target would incur. In international security, a policy of deterrence generally refers to threats of military retaliation directed by the leaders of one state to the leaders of another in an attempt to prevent the other state from resorting to the threat of use of military force in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.

As outlined by Huth,&lt;ref name="Huth_1999" /&gt; a policy of deterrence can fit into two broad categories being (i) preventing an armed attack against a state's own territory (known as direct deterrence); or (ii) preventing an armed attack against another state (known as extended deterrence). Situations of direct deterrence often occur when there is a [[territorial dispute]] between neighboring states in which major powers like the United States do not directly intervene. On the other hand, situations of extended deterrence often occur when a [[great power]] becomes involved. It is the latter that has generated the majority of interest in academic literature. Building on these two broad categories, Huth goes on to outline that deterrence policies may be implemented in response to a pressing short-term threat (known as immediate deterrence) or as strategy to prevent a military conflict or short term threat from arising (known as general deterrence).

A successful deterrence policy must be considered in not only military terms, but also in political terms. In military terms, deterrence success refers to preventing state leaders from issuing military threats and actions that escalate peacetime diplomatic and military cooperation into a crisis or militarized confrontation which threatens armed conflict and possibly war. The prevention of crises of wars however is not the only aim of deterrence. In addition, defending states must be able to resist the political and military demands of a potential attacking nation. If armed conflict is avoided at the price of diplomatic concessions to the maximum demands of the potential attacking nation under the threat of war, then it cannot be claimed that deterrence has succeeded.

Furthermore, as Jentleson ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Jentleson"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue, two key sets of factors for successful deterrence are important being (i) a defending state strategy that firstly balances credible coercion and deft diplomacy consistent with the three criteria of proportionality, reciprocity, and coercive credibility, and secondly minimizes international and domestic constraints; and (ii) the extent of an attacking state's vulnerability as shaped by its domestic political and economic conditions. In broad terms, a state wishing to implement a strategy of deterrence is most likely to succeed if the costs of non-compliance it can impose on, and the benefits of compliance it can offer to, another state are greater than the benefits of noncompliance and the costs of compliance.

Deterrence theory holds that nuclear weapons are intended to deter other states from attacking with their nuclear weapons, through the promise of retaliation and possibly [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD). Nuclear deterrence can also be applied to an attack by conventional forces; for example, the doctrine of [[massive retaliation]] threatened to launch US nuclear weapons in response to Soviet attacks.

A successful nuclear deterrent requires that a country preserve its ability to retaliate, either by responding before its own weapons are destroyed or by ensuring a [[second strike]] capability. A nuclear deterrent is sometimes composed of a [[nuclear triad]], as in the case of the nuclear weapons owned by the [[United States]], [[Russia]], the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[India]]. Other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]], have only sea- and air-based nuclear weapons.

===Proportionality===
Jentleson ''et al. ''provide further detail in relation to these factors.&lt;ref name="Jentleson" /&gt; Firstly, proportionality refers to the relationship between the defending state's scope and nature of the objectives being pursued, and the instruments available for use to pursue this. The more the defending state demands of another state, the higher that state's costs of compliance and the greater need for the defending state's strategy to increase the costs of noncompliance and the benefits of compliance. This is a challenge, as deterrence is, by definition, a strategy of limited means. George (1991) goes on to explain that deterrence may, but is not required to, go beyond threats to the actual use of military force; but if force is actually used, it must be limited and fall short of full-scale use or war otherwise it fails.&lt;ref name="George_1991"&gt;{{Citation

|work=Forceful Persuasion: Coercive Diplomacy as an Alternative to War
|publisher=United States Institute of Peace Press
|place=Washington, D.C
|pages=3–14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main source of disproportionality is an objective that goes beyond policy change to [[regime change]]. This has been seen in the cases of Libya, Iraq, and North Korea where defending states have sought to change the leadership of a state in addition to policy changes relating primarily to their nuclear weapons programs.

===Reciprocity===
Secondly, Jentleson ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Jentleson" /&gt; outline that reciprocity involves an explicit understanding of linkage between the defending state's carrots and the attacking state's concessions. The balance lies neither in offering too little too late or for too much in return, not offering too much too soon or for too little return.

===Coercive credibility===
Finally, coercive credibility requires that, in addition to calculations about costs and benefits of cooperation, the defending state convincingly conveys to the attacking state that non-cooperation has consequences. Threats, uses of force, and other coercive instruments such as [[economic sanctions]] must be sufficiently credible to raise the attacking state's perceived costs of noncompliance. A defending state having a superior military capability or economic strength in itself is not enough to ensure credibility. Indeed, all three elements of a balanced deterrence strategy are more likely to be achieved if other major international actors like the [[United Nations]] or [[NATO]] are supportive and if opposition within the defending state's domestic politics is limited.

The other important consideration outlined by Jentleson ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Jentleson" /&gt; that must be taken into consideration is the domestic political and economic conditions within the attacking state affecting its vulnerability to deterrence policies, and the attacking state's ability to compensate unfavourable power balances. The first factor is whether internal political support and regime security are better served by defiance, or if there are domestic political gains to be made from improving relations with the defending state. The second factor is an economic calculation of the costs that military force, sanctions, and other coercive instruments can impose, and the benefits that trade and other economic incentives may carry. This in part is a function of the strength and flexibility of the attacking state's domestic economy and its capacity to absorb or counter the costs being imposed. The third factor is the role of elites and other key domestic political figures within the attacking state. To the extent these actors' interests are threatened with the defending state's demands, they act to prevent or block the defending state's demands.

==Rational deterrence theory==
The predominant approach to theorizing about deterrence has entailed the use of rational choice and game-theoretic models of decision making (see [[game theory]]). Deterrence theorists have consistently argued that deterrence success is more likely if a defending state's deterrent threat is credible to an attacking state. Huth&lt;ref name="Huth_1999" /&gt; outlines that a threat is considered credible if the defending state possesses both the military capabilities to inflict substantial costs on an attacking state in an armed conflict, and if the attacking state believes that the defending state is resolved to use its available military forces. Huth&lt;ref name="Huth_1999" /&gt; goes on to explain the four key factors for consideration under rational deterrence theory being (i) the military balance; (ii) signaling and bargaining power; (iii) reputations for resolve; and (iv) interests at stake.

===The military balance===
Deterrence is often directed against state leaders who have specific territorial goals that they seek to attain either by seizing disputed territory in a limited military attack or by occupying disputed territory after the decisive defeat of the adversary's armed forces. In either case, the strategic orientation of potential attacking states is generally short term and driven by concerns about military cost and effectiveness. For successful deterrence, defending states need the military capacity to respond quickly and in strength to a range of contingencies. Where deterrence often fails is when either a defending state or an attacking state under or overestimate the others' ability to undertake a particular course of action.

===Signaling and bargaining power===
The central problem for a state that seeks to communicate a credible deterrent threat through diplomatic or military actions is that all defending states have an incentive to act as if they are determined to resist an attack, in the hope that the attacking state will back away from military conflict with a seemingly resolved adversary. If all defending states have such incentives, then potential attacking states may discount statements made by defending states along with any movement of military forces as merely bluffs. In this regards, rational deterrence theorists have argued that costly signals are required to communicate the credibility of a defending state's resolve. Costly signals are those actions and statements that clearly increase the risk of a military conflict and also increase the costs of backing down from a deterrent threat. States that are bluffing are unwilling to cross a certain threshold of threat and military action for fear of committing themselves to an armed conflict.

===Reputations for resolve===
There are three different arguments that have been developed in relation to the role of reputations in influencing deterrence outcomes. The first argument focuses on a defending state's past behaviour in international disputes and crises, which creates strong beliefs in a potential attacking state about the defending state's expected behaviour in future conflicts. The credibilities of a defending state's policies are arguably linked over time, and reputations for resolve have a powerful causal impact on an attacking state's decision whether to challenge either general or immediate deterrence. The second approach argues that reputations have a limited impact on deterrence outcomes because the credibility of deterrence is heavily determined by the specific configuration of military capabilities, interests at stake, and political constraints faced by a defending state in a given situation of attempted deterrence. The argument of this school of thought is that potential attacking states are not likely to draw strong inferences about a defending states resolve from prior conflicts because potential attacking states do not believe that a defending state's past behaviour is a reliable predictor of future behaviour. The third approach is a middle ground between the first two approaches. It argues that potential attacking states are likely to draw reputational inferences about resolve from the past behaviour of defending states only under certain conditions. The insight is the expectation that decision makers will use only certain types of information when drawing inferences about reputations, and an attacking state updates and revises its beliefs when the unanticipated behaviour of a defending state cannot be explained by case-specific variables.
An example both shows that the problem extends to the perception of the third parties as well as main adversaries and underlies the way in which attempts at deterrence can not only fail but backfire if the assumptions about the others' perceptions are incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2538549 | volume=7 | title=Deterrence and Perception | journal=International Security | pages=3 | year=1982 | last1 = Jervis | first1 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interests at stake===
Although costly signaling and bargaining power are more well established arguments in rational deterrence theory, the interests of defending states are not as well known, and attacking states may look beyond the short term bargaining tactics of a defending state and seek to determine what interests are at stake for the defending state that would justify the risks of a military conflict. The argument here is that defending states that have greater interests at stake in a dispute are more resolved to use force and be more willing to endure military losses to secure those interests. Even less well established arguments are the specific interests that are more salient to state leaders such as military interests versus economic interests.

Furthermore, Huth&lt;ref name="Huth_1999" /&gt; argues that both supporters and critics of rational deterrence theory agree that an unfavourable assessment of the domestic and international status quo by state leaders can undermine or severely test the success of deterrence. In a rational choice approach, if the expected utility of not using force is reduced by a declining status quo position, then deterrence failure is more likely, since the alternative option of using force becomes relatively more attractive.

==Nuclear weapons and deterrence==
{{main article|Nuclear strategy|Massive retaliation|Mutual assured destruction|Flexible response}}
In 1966 Schelling&lt;ref name="Schelling_1966" /&gt; is prescriptive in outlining the impact of the development of nuclear weapons in the analysis of military power and deterrence. In his 1966 analysis, before the widespread use of assured second strike capability, or immediate reprisal, in the form of [[SSBN]] submarines, Schelling argues that [[nuclear weapons]] give nations the potential to not only destroy their enemies but humanity itself without drawing immediate reprisal because of the lack of a conceivable defense system and the speed with which nuclear weapons can be deployed. A nation's credible threat of such severe damage empowers their deterrence policies and fuels political coercion and military deadlock, which in turn can produce proxy warfare.

Historical analysis of nuclear weapons deterrent capabilities has led modern researchers to the concept of the [[stability-instability paradox]], whereby nuclear weapons confer large scale stability between nuclear weapon states, as in over 60 years none have engaged in large direct warfare due primarily to nuclear weapons deterrence capabilities, but instead are forced into pursuing political aims by military means in the form of comparatively smaller scale acts of instability, such as [[proxy war]]s and minor conflicts.

==US policy of deterrence==
The US policy of deterrence during the [[Cold War]] underwent significant variations. The early stages of the Cold War were generally characterized by [[containment]], an aggressive stance on behalf of the US especially on [[developing nations]] under its [[sphere of influence]]. This period was characterized by numerous [[proxy war]]s throughout most of the globe, particularly Africa, Asia, Central America, and South America. A notable such conflict was the [[Korean War]]. In contrast to general opinion, [[George F. Kennan]], who is taken to be the founder of this ideology in his [[Long Telegram]], asserted that his ideas had been misinterpreted and that he had never advocated military intervention, merely economic support.

With the [[Vietnam War#Exit of the Americans: 1973–75|U.S. drawdown]] from Vietnam, the normalization of U.S. relations with China, and the [[Sino-Soviet Split]], the policy of Containment was abandoned and a new policy of [[détente]] was established, whereby peaceful coexistence was sought between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although all factors listed above contributed to this shift, the most important factor was probably the rough parity achieved in stockpiling nuclear weapons with the clear capability of [[Mutual Assured Destruction]] (MAD). Therefore, the period of détente was characterized by a general reduction in the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and a thawing of the Cold War, lasting from the late 1960s until the start of the 1980s. The doctrine of mutual nuclear deterrence characterized relations between the United States and the Soviet Union during this period, and present relations with Russia.

A third shift occurred with President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s arms build-up during the 1980s. Reagan attempted to justify this policy in part due to concerns of growing Soviet influence in Latin America and the new republic of [[Iran]], established after the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979. Similar to the old policy of containment, the United States funded several [[proxy war]]s, including support for [[Saddam Hussein]] of [[Iraq]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], support for the [[mujahideen]] in [[Afghanistan]], who were fighting for independence from the Soviet Union, and several anti-communist movements in Latin America such as the overthrow of the [[Sandinista]] government in [[Nicaragua]]. The funding of the [[Contras]] in Nicaragua led to the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], while overt support led to a ruling from the [[International Court of Justice]] against the United States in [[Nicaragua v. United States]].

While the army was dealing with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the spread of nuclear technology to other nations beyond the United States and Russia, the concept of deterrence took on a broader multinational dimension. The U.S. policy on post–Cold War deterrence was outlined in 1995 in a document called "[[Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence]]".&lt;ref name="Nautilus"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document explains that while relations with Russia continue to follow the traditional characteristics of Mutual Nuclear Deterrence, due to both nations continuing MAD, U.S. policy of deterrence towards nations with minor nuclear capabilities should ensure through threats of immense retaliation (or even [[preemptive war|preemptive action]]) that they do not threaten the United States, its interests, or allies. The document explains that such threats must also be used to ensure that nations without nuclear technology refrain from developing nuclear weapons and that a universal ban precludes any nation from maintaining [[chemical]] or [[biological weapons]]. The current tensions with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs are due in part to the continuation of this policy of deterrence.

==Criticism==
Deterrence theory is criticized for its assumptions about opponent rationales.

First, it is argued that suicidal or psychotic opponents may not be deterred by either forms of deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, if two enemy states both possess nuclear weapons, Country ''X'' may try to gain a first-strike advantage by suddenly launching weapons at Country ''Y'', with a view to destroying its enemy's nuclear launch silos thereby rendering Country ''Y'' incapable of a response. Third, diplomatic misunderstandings and/or opposing political ideologies may lead to escalating mutual perceptions of threat, and a subsequent [[arms race]] that elevates the risk of actual war, a scenario illustrated in the movies ''[[WarGames]]'' (1983) and ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964). An [[arms race]] is inefficient in its [[optimal output]], as all countries involved expend resources on armaments that would not have been created if the others had not expended resources, a form of [[positive feedback]]. Fourth, escalation of perceived threat can make it easier for [[The Garrison State|certain measures]] to be inflicted on a population by its government, such as restrictions on [[civil liberties]], the creation of a [[military–industrial complex]], and military expenditures resulting in higher taxes and increasing [[budget deficits]].

In recent years, many mainstream politicians, academic analysts, and retired military leaders have also criticised deterrence and advocated [[nuclear disarmament]]. [[Sam Nunn]], [[William Perry]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and [[George Shultz]] have all called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' opeds proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Organisations such as [[Global Zero (campaign)|Global Zero]], an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament, have also been established.&lt;ref&gt;Maclin, Beth (2008-10-20) [http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18606/ "A Nuclear weapon-free world is possible, Nunn says"], Belfer Center, Harvard University. Retrieved on 2008-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled ''[[Nuclear Tipping Point]]''. The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in the Wall Street Journal op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18836134 |title=The Growing Appeal of Zero |date=June 18, 2011 |work=The Economist |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2010-06-10 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123012569&amp;sc=emaf |title=Documentary Advances Nuclear Free Movement |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Secretary Kissinger puts the new danger, which cannot be addressed by deterrence, this way: "The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil. In a world of suicide bombers, that calculation doesn't operate in any comparable way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/ben-goddard/78391-cold-warriors-say-no-nukes |title=Cold Warriors say no nukes |author=Ben Goddard |date=2010-01-27 |work=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shultz has said, "If you think of the people who are doing suicide attacks, and people like that get a nuclear weapon, they are almost by definition not deterrable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebulletin.org/new-abolitionists |title=The new abolitionists |author=[[Hugh Gusterson]] |date=30 March 2012 |work=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to the extreme [[mutually assured destruction]] form of deterrence, the concept of [[minimum deterrence]] in which a state possesses no more nuclear weapons than is necessary to deter an adversary from attacking is presently the most common form of deterrence practiced by [[nuclear weapon state]]s, such as China, India, Pakistan, Britain, and France.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen, Hans M, Robert S Norris, and Ivan Oelrich. "[https://fas.org/pubs/_pages/occ_pap7.html From Counterforce to Minimal Deterrence: A New Nuclear Policy on the Path Toward Eliminating Nuclear Weapons]." [https://fas.org/ ''Federation of American Scientists'']. April 2009. Accessed July 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuing [[minimal deterrence]] during arms negotiations between United States and Russia allows each state to make [[nuclear stockpile]] reductions without the state becoming vulnerable, however it has been noted that there comes a point where further reductions may be undesirable, once minimal deterrence is reached, as further reductions beyond this point increase a state's vulnerability and provide an incentive for an adversary to secretly expand its nuclear arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Nalebuff|Nalebuff, Barry]]. "Minimal Nuclear Deterrence." ''[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]]'' 32, no. 3 (September 1988): pg 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Senior European statesmen and women" called for further action in addressing problems of [[nuclear weapons proliferation]] in 2010. They said: "Nuclear deterrence is a far less persuasive strategic response to a world of potential regional nuclear arms races and nuclear terrorism than it was to the cold war".&lt;ref name="Willoch_et_al" /&gt;

[[Paul Virilio]] has criticized nuclear deterrence as anachronistic in the age of [[information warfare]] since [[disinformation]] and [[kompromat]] are the current threats to suggestible populations. The wound inflicted on unsuspecting populations he calls an "integral accident":
: The first deterrence, nuclear deterrence, is presently being superseded by the second deterrence: a type of deterrence based on what I call 'the information bomb' associated with the new weaponry of information and communications technologies. Thus, in the very near future, and I stress this important point, it will no longer be war that is the continuation of politics by other means, it will be what I have dubbed 'the integral accident' that is the continuation of politics by other means.&lt;ref&gt;John Armitage (October 18, 2000) [http://www.ctheory.net/text_file.asp?pick=132 The Kosovo War Took Place In Orbital Space: Paul Virilio in Conversation.] , ''Ctheory''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elamite''' is an [[extinct language]] that was spoken by the ancient [[Elamites]]. It was used in present-day southwestern [[Iran]] from 2600 BC to 330 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Stolper, Matthew W. 2008. ''Elamite''. In ''The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Aksum''. p. 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The last written records in Elamite appear around the conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] by [[Alexander the Great]]. Elamite is generally thought to have no demonstrable relatives and is usually considered a [[language isolate]]. The lack of established relatives makes its interpretation difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{ELL2|Elamite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
[[Elamite cuneiform]], adapted from [[Akkadian cuneiform]], was used from c. 2500 to 331 BC. Elamite cuneiform was largely a [[syllabary]] of some 130 glyphs at any one time and retained only a few [[logogram]]s from Akkadian but, over time, the number of logograms increased.

The complete [[corpus language|corpus]] of Elamite cuneiform consists of c. 20 thousand tablets and fragments. The majority belong to the [[Achaemenid]] era, and contain primarily economic records.

Two earlier scripts of the area remain undeciphered but plausibly have encoded Elamite:
*[[Proto-Elamite]] is the oldest known writing system from Iran. It was used during a brief period of time (c. 3100 – 2900 BC); clay tablets with Proto-Elamite writing have been found at different sites across Iran. It is thought to have developed from early [[cuneiform]] (proto-cuneiform) and consists of more than 1,000 signs. It is thought to be largely logographic. 
*[[Linear Elamite]] is attested in a few monumental inscriptions. It is often claimed that Linear Elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from Proto-Elamite, but it cannot be proven. Linear Elamite was used for a very brief period of time during the last quarter of the third millennium BC.

==Linguistic typology==
Elamite is an [[agglutinative language]],&lt;ref&gt;Stolper, Matthew W. 2008. ''Elamite''. In ''The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Aksum''. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[grammar]] was characterized by a well-developed and pervasive nominal class system. Animate nouns have separate markers for first, second
and third person, a rather unusual feature. It can be said to display a kind of [[Suffixaufnahme]] in that the nominal class markers of the head are also attached to any modifiers, including adjectives, [[noun adjunct]]s, possessor nouns and even entire clauses.

==History==
The history of Elamite is periodised as follows:

* Old Elamite (c. 2600–1500 BC)
* Middle Elamite (c. 1500–1000 BC)
* Neo-Elamite (1000–550 BC)
* Achaemenid Elamite (550–330 BC)

Middle Elamite is considered the “classical” period of Elamite, but the best attested variety is Achaemenid Elamite,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Keith and Sarah Ogilvie. Concise encyclopedia of languages of the world. P.316&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely used by the [[Achaemenid Persia]]n state for official inscriptions as well as administrative records and displays  significant [[Old Persian]] influence. Documents from the Old Elamite and early Neo-Elamite stages are rather scarce.

Neo-Elamite can be regarded as a transition between Middle and Achaemenid Elamite, with respect to language structure.

==Phonology==
Because of the limitations of the language's scripts, its phonology is not well understood.

Its consonants included at least stops /p/, /t/ and /k/, sibilants /s/, /ʃ/ and /z/ (with an uncertain pronunciation), nasals /m/ and /n/, liquids /l/ and /r/ and fricative /h/, which was lost in late Neo-Elamite. Some peculiarities of the spelling have been interpreted as suggesting that there was a contrast between two series of stops (/p/, /t/, /k/ as opposed to /b/, /d/, /g/), but in general, such a distinction was not consistently indicated by written Elamite. 

Elamite had at least the vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ and may also have had /e/, which was not generally expressed unambiguously.

Roots were generally CV, (C)VC, (C)VCV or, more rarely, CVCCV (the first C was usually a nasal).

==Morphology==
Elamite is [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] but with fewer morphemes per word than, for example, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] or [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Urartian language|Urartian]] and it uses mostly suffixing.

===Nouns===
The Elamite nominal system is thoroughly pervaded by a [[noun class]] distinction, which combines a gender distinction between animate and inanimate with a personal class distinction, corresponding to the three persons of verbal inflection (first, second, third, plural). &lt;br&gt;
The suffixes are as follows: &lt;br&gt;
Animate: &lt;br&gt;
:1st person singular: ''-k''
:2nd person singular: ''-t''
:3rd person singular: ''-r'' or ''Ø''
:3rd person plural: ''-p''
:
Inanimate: &lt;br&gt;
:''-Ø'', ''-me'', ''-n'', ''-t''{{clarify|date=March 2013}}

The animate third-person suffix ''-r'' can serve as a nominalizing suffix and indicate [[nomen agentis]] or just members of a class. The inanimate third-person singular suffix ''-me'' forms abstracts: ''sunki-k'' “a king (first person)” i.e. “I, a king”, ''sunki-r'' “a king (third person)”, ''nap-Ø'' or ''nap-ir'' “a god (third person)”, ''sunki-p'' “kings”, ''nap-ip'' “gods”, ''sunki-me'' “kingdom, kingship”, ''hal-Ø'' “town, land”, ''siya-n'' “temple”, ''hala-t'' “mud brick”.

Modifiers follow their (nominal) heads. In noun phrases and pronoun phrases, the suffixes referring to the head are appended to the modifier, regardless of whether the modifier is another noun (such as a possessor) or an adjective. Sometimes the suffix is preserved on the head as well:

:''u šak X-k(i)'' = “I, the son of X”

:''X šak Y-r(i)'' = “X, the son of Y”

:''u sunki-k Hatamti-k'' = “I, the king of Elam”

:''sunki Hatamti-p'' (or, sometimes, ''sunki-p Hatamti-p'') = “the kings of Elam”

:''temti riša-r'' = “great lord” (lit. “lord great”)

:''riša-r nap-ip-ir'' = “greatest of the gods” (lit. “great of the gods)

:''nap-ir u-ri'' = ''my god'' (lit. “god of me”)

:''hiya-n nap-ir u-ri-me'' = ''the throne hall of my god ''

:''takki-me puhu nika-me-me'' = “the life of our children”

:''sunki-p uri-p u-p(e)'' = ”kings, my predecessors” (lit. “kings, predecessors of me”)

This system, in which the noun class suffixes function as derivational morphemes as well as agreement markers and indirectly as subordinating morphemes, is best seen in Middle Elamite. It was, to a great extent, broken down in Achaemenid Elamite, where possession and, sometimes, attributive relationships are uniformly expressed with the “[[genitive case]]” suffix ''-na'' appended to the modifier: e.g. ''šak X-na'' “son of X”. The suffix ''-na'', which probably originated from the inanimate agreement suffix ''-n'' followed by the nominalizing particle ''-a'' (see below), appeared already in Neo-Elamite.

The personal pronouns distinguish nominative and accusative case forms. They are as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! scope="col" | Case
! scope="col" | 1st sg.
! scope="col" | 2nd sg.
! scope="col" | 3rd sg.
! scope="col" | 1st pl.
! scope="col" | 2nd pl.
! scope="col" | 3rd pl.
! scope="col" | Inanimate
|-
! scope="row" | Nominative
| u || ni/nu || i/hi || nika/nuku || num/numi || ap/appi || i/in
|-
! scope="row" | Accusative
| un || nun || ir/in || nukun || numun || appin || i/in
|}

In general, no special possessive pronouns are needed in view of the construction with the noun class suffixes. Nevertheless, a set of separate third-person animate possessives ''-e'' (sing.) / ''appi-e'' (plur.) is occasionally used already in Middle Elamite: ''puhu-e'' “her children”, ''hiš-api-e'' “their name”. The relative pronouns are ''akka'' “who” and ''appa'' “what, which”.

===Verbs===
The verb base can be simple (''ta-'' “put”) or “[[reduplication|reduplicated]]” (''beti'' &gt; ''bepti'' “rebel”). The pure verb base can function as a verbal noun, or “infinitive”.

The verb distinguishes three forms functioning as [[finite verb]]s, known as “conjugations”. Conjugation I is the only one with special endings characteristic of finite verbs as such, as shown below. Its use is mostly associated with active voice, transitivity (or verbs of motion), neutral aspect and past tense meaning. Conjugations II and III can be regarded as periphrastic constructions with participles; they are formed by the addition of the nominal personal class suffixes to a passive perfective participle in ''-k'' and to an active imperfective participle in ''-n'', respectively. Accordingly, conjugation II expresses a [[perfective aspect]], hence usually past tense, and an intransitive or passive voice, whereas conjugation III expresses an [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] non-past action.

The Middle Elamite conjugation I is formed with the following suffixes:

:1st singular: ''-h''

:2nd singular: ''-t''

:3rd singular: ''-š''

:1st plural: ''-hu''

:2nd plural: ''-h-t''

:3rd plural: ''-h-š''

Examples: ''kulla-h'' ”I prayed”, ''hap-t'' ”you heard”, ''hutta-š'' “he did”, ''kulla-hu'' “we prayed”, ''hutta-h-t'' “you (plur.) did”, ''hutta-h-š'' “they did”.

In Achaemenid Elamite, the loss of the /h/ reduces the transparency of the Conjugation I endings and leads to the merger of the singular and plural except in the first person; in addition, the first-person plural changes from ''-hu'' to ''-ut''.

The participles can be exemplified as follows: perfective participle ''hutta-k'' “done”, ''kulla-k'' “something prayed”, i.e. “a prayer”; imperfective participle ''hutta-n'' “doing” or “who will do”, also serving as a non-past infinitive. The corresponding conjugation is, for the perfective, first person singular ''hutta-k-k'', second person singular ''hutta-k-t'', third person singular ''hutta-k-r'', third person plural ''hutta-k-p''; and for the imperfective, 1st person singular ''hutta-n-k'', 2nd person singular ''hutta-n-t'', 3rd person singular ''hutta-n-r'', 3rd person plural ''hutta-n-p''.

In Achaemenid Elamite, the Conjugation 2 endings are somewhat changed: 1st person singular ''hutta-k-ut'', 2nd person singular ''hutta-k-t'', 3rd person singular ''hutta-k'' (hardly ever attested in predicative use), 3rd person plural ''hutta-p''.

There is also a periphrastic construction with an [[auxiliary verb]] ''ma-'' following either Conjugation II and III stems (i.e. the perfective and imperfective participles), or ''nomina agentis'' in ''-r'', or a verb base directly. In Achaemenid Elamite, only the third option exists. There is no consensus on the exact meaning of the periphrastic forms with ''ma-'', but durative, intensive or volitional interpretations have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Stolper, Matthew W. 2008. ''Elamite''. In ''The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Aksum''. P. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The optative is expressed by the addition of the suffix ''-ni'' to Conjugations I and II. The imperative is identical to the second person of Conjugation I in Middle Elamite. In Achaemenid Elamite, it is the third person that coincides with the imperative. The prohibitative is formed by the particle ''ani/ani'' preceding Conjugation III.

Verbal forms can be converted into the heads of subordinate clauses through the addition of the suffix ''-a'', much as in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: ''siyan in-me kuši-hš(i)-me-a'' “the temple which they did not build”. ''-ti''/''-ta'' can be suffixed to verbs, chiefly of conjugation I, expressing possibly a meaning of anteriority (perfect and pluperfect tense).

The negative particle is ''in-''; it takes nominal class suffixes that agree with the subject of attention (which may or may not coincide with the grammatical subject): first-person singular ''in-ki'', third-person singular animate ''in-ri'', third-person singular inanimate ''in-ni''/''in-me''. In Achaemenid Elamite, the inanimate form ''in-ni'' has been generalized to all persons, and concord has been lost.

==Syntax==
Nominal heads are normally followed by their modifiers, but there are occasional inversions. Word order is [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV), with indirect objects preceding direct objects, but it becomes more flexible in Achaemenid Elamite. There are often resumptive pronouns before the verb – often long sequences, especially in Middle Elamite (''ap u in duni-h'' "to-them I it gave").

The language uses [[postpositions]] such as ''-ma'' "in" and ''-na'' "of", but spatial and temporal relationships are generally expressed in Middle Elamite by means of "directional words" originating as nouns or verbs. They can precede or follow the governed nouns and tend to exhibit noun class agreement with whatever noun is described by the prepositional phrase: ''i-r pat-r u-r ta-t-ni'' "may you place him under me", lit. "him inferior of-me place-you-may". In Achaemenid Elamite, postpositions become more common and partly displace that type of construction.

A common conjunction is ''ak'' "and, or". Achaemenid Elamite also uses a number of subordinating conjunctions such as ''anka'' "if, when" and ''sap'' "as, when". Subordinate clauses usually precede the verb of the main clause. In Middle Elamite, the most common way to construct a relative clause is to attach a nominal class suffix to the clause-final verb, optionally followed by the relativizing suffix ''-a'': thus, ''lika-me i-r hani-š-r(i)'' "whose reign he loves", or optionally ''lika-me i-r hani-š-r-a''. The alternative construction by means of the relative pronouns ''akka'' "who" and ''appa'' "which" is uncommon in Middle Elamite, but gradually becomes dominant at the expense of the nominal class suffix construction in Achaemenid Elamite.

==Relations to other language families==
Elamite is regarded by the vast majority of [[linguists]] as a [[language isolate]],&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, Matthew Spriggs (eds.)(2003), "Archaeology and Language I: Theoretical and Methodological Orientations", Routledge, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Woodard (ed.)(2008), "The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Aksum", Cambridge University Press, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amalia E. Gnanadesikan (2011), "The Writing Revolution: Cuneiform to the Internet", John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; as it has no demonstrable relationship to the neighbouring [[Semitic languages]], [[Indo-European languages]], or to [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], despite having adopted the Sumerian-[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform]] script. An [[Elamo-Dravidian]] family connecting Elamite with the [[Dravidian languages]] of India was suggested by [[Igor M. Diakonoff]]{{when|date=June 2018}} and later defended by David McAlpin.&lt;ref&gt;David McAlpin, "Toward Proto-Elamo-Dravidian", ''Language'' vol. 50 no. 1 (1974); David McAlpin:  "Elamite and Dravidian, Further Evidence of Relationships", ''Current Anthropology'' vol. 16 no. 1 (1975); David McAlpin: "Linguistic prehistory: the Dravidian situation", in Madhav M. Deshpande and Peter Edwin Hook: ''Aryan and Non-Aryan in India'', Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (1979); David McAlpin, "Proto-Elamo-Dravidian: The Evidence and its Implications", ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' vol. 71 pt. 3, (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Václav Blažek]] proposed a relation with the [[Semitic languages]],&lt;ref name=Blench96&gt;{{Harvnb|Blench|2006|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Starostin]] published a [[lexicostatistic]] analysis finding Elamite to be approximately equidistant from [[Nostratic]] and Semitic,&lt;ref&gt;Starostin 2002&lt;/ref&gt; but these ideas have not been accepted by mainstream historical linguists.

'''Hae Jong Kim''' ({{ko-hhrm|김해종}}; born 1935) was a [[Korean-American]] [[bishop]] of the [[United Methodist Church]], elected in 1992, who resigned as a bishop in 2005.

== Early life ==
Kim was born in [[Seoul, Korea]] in 1935. During the [[Korean War]] he became a [[Christian]]. Then, while working for a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Chaplain]] as an [[Interpreting|interpreter]], [[translating]] sermons before [[Koreans|Korean]] audiences, he decided to enter into ministry. He was 17 years old.

Kim is married to Wha-Sei P. Kim (박화세). They have three children: Eugene (김유진), Eusun (김유선), and Eumi (김유미).

== Education ==
Kim went to the Methodist Theological Seminary in Seoul, and upon completing study there came to the [[United States]] to pursue further education. He graduated in 1964 with an [[M.Div.]] degree from the [[Methodist Theological School in Ohio]]. He continued [[graduate study]] at [[Drew Theological Seminary]].

== Ordained ministry ==
He also began [[pastoral care|pastoral ministry]] in 1964, serving various types of churches in the Northern [[New Jersey]] [[Annual Conference]] of the [[Methodist Church]], including a Korean church he founded. Kim was instrumental in developing Korean ministry strategies in the conference and helped develop some 15 [[Korean American]] [[United Methodist Church|U.M. church]]es in New Jersey.

During the next several years, as Korean [[immigration]] to the U.S. began to swell, Kim worked for the Annual Conference and for [[United Methodist Church|U.M.]] agencies as a ''bridge person,'' helping to bring understanding about the Korean community. He has been an advocate for [[ethnic minority]] causes, having strong links to the Korean community and to the [[Methodist Church of Korea]].

Kim went on to serve as the Chairperson of the Conference Council on Ministries and has provided leadership at the annual and general church levels. Prior to his election to the [[Episcopacy]], he was a delegate to General Conferences (1980–92), as well as a Director of the U.M. General Board of Global Ministries (1980–99). During these years he had an important role in developing national and jurisdictional mission structures to facilitate Korean American ministries and congregations. In the Korean community he was recognized as a leader by his election as President of the National Association of Korean American U.M. Churches, and President of the Council of Korean Churches of Greater New York.  e worked with the Northeastern Jurisdiction Multi-Ethnic Center: on the Charter Committee and then as a member of the Board of Directors, serving as President 1988–92.

Kim earned the [[D.Min.]] degree from [[Drew Theological Seminary]] in 1984. That same year he was appointed a District Superintendent in the Northern New Jersey Conference, the first Korean American to hold this position in the entire [[United Methodist Church]]. Following this, he was appointed Pastor of a church in [[Basking Ridge, New Jersey]], from which he was elected a Bishop in July 1992. He served the New York West Episcopal Area from 1992 to 2000, and in 2000 became bishop of the Pittsburgh Area. He retired in 2004.

In January 2005, a disciplinary complaint was brought against Bishop Kim. The details of the charges were handled in accordance with confidentiality requirements of the ''United Methodist Book of Discipline'' and were not disclosed. However, on August 30, 2005, Bishop [[Peter D. Weaver]], then president of the United Methodist Council of Bishops, announced the resignation of Bishop Kim as a part of the resolution process. The resignation was to be effective September 1, 2005. Though he resigned from the United Methodist episcopacy, he retained his clergy credentials.

In July 2008 he became the pastor of a very small United Methodist church.
 
Bishop Kim likes to write poems. He has translated many Korean hymns into English, two of which are in the United Methdodist Hymnal: ''Lonely the Boat'' and ''"Mountains are All Aglow''. He has written other hymns in English.

== Selected writings ==
*''Ten Ideas for Evangelism and Church Growth''
*''Korean-American Ministries''
*''Class Meeting for Church Growth''
*''Becoming Disciples'' (in Korean)

'''''Hard Spell Abbey''''' was a five-part [[spelling bee]] [[game show]] produced for [[CBBC]]. It was shot entirely on location in [[Suffolk]] during 2004. The series was designed to accompany ''[[Hard Spell]]'', a family spelling competition for [[BBC One]]. Each episode featured games as well as some reality-based filming. Short comedy cameos from spelling celebrities were included in a highly popular strand named "Spellebrity Squares". In this rehash of a popular classic, an impressive roll call of celebrities was asked to spell live on camera, including Dermot O'Leary, Dick 'n' Dom, Tracy Beaker, Jonathan Ross, and Dermot Murnaghan.

In the show Trevor Hickson played Brother Brendan, a slightly mad but likeable monk who lived at the abbey and wanted to be involved with every game. Jaz Ampaw-Farr was the spelling expert who coached the contestants, aided by Brother Brendan to spelling success.

When the lady came down from the 10th storey flat to get baby food from the 4th story flat of her sister, Hashir Mohamed came down from the flat above in the nude and assaulted her outside the flat. When she cried out for help, neighbours came out and apprehended him.&lt;ref name=4malayalees&gt;{{cite news|title=വീട്ടമ്മയെ മാനഭംഗപ്പെടുത്താൻ ശ്രമം: തിരക്കഥാകൃത്ത് മുഹമ്മദ് ഹാഷിർ അറസ്റ്റിൽ|url=http://4malayalees.com/index.php?page=newsDetail&amp;id=45852|accessdate=2 March 2014|date=1 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302065259/http://4malayalees.com/index.php?page=newsDetail&amp;id=45852|archivedate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deshabhimani&gt;{{cite news|title=യുവതിയെ കടന്നുപിടിക്കാൻ ശ്രമിച്ച തിരക്കഥാകൃത്ത് അറസ്റ്റിൽ|url=http://www.deshabhimani.com/newscontent.php?id=424763|accessdate=2 March 2014|newspaper=[[Deshabhimani]]|date=1 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302065956/http://www.deshabhimani.com/newscontent.php?id=424763|archivedate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later handed over to the police.

A '''hotel amenity''' is something of a premium nature provided in addition to the room and its basics when renting a room at a [[hotel]], [[motel]], or other place of [[lodging]]. The amenities provided in each hotel vary. In some places of lodging, certain amenities may be standard with all rooms. In others, they may be optional for an additional cost.

==In the room==

===Kitchen facilities===
Some places of lodging offer kitchen facilities to enable guests to cook and/or store food. In some [[hotel]]s, this may be in the form of a [[kitchenette]], which may include a full-size or half-size [[refrigerator]], an [[oven]], a [[stove]], a [[sink]], and possibly some cabinets, although these are more common in [[extended stay hotel]]s.

Other places may include just a half-sized [[refrigerator]], a [[microwave oven]], and/or a [[Coffeemaker]].

Hotels that offer no kitchen facilities in guest rooms sometimes provide them in the lobby for all guests to use.

===Television===
Though not all have them, a [[television set]] is a standard item in most hotel rooms. In the past, coin-operated pay TVs existed. Currently, standard TV channels are free to watch, but some lodging facilities charge extra for [[cable TV|cable]] or [[satellite TV|satellite]] TV services that are offered.

With the advent of portable video through mobile and tablet devices, hotels have had a harder time generating revenue with their in room televisions.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tnooz.com/2012/06/26/mobile/move-over-in-room-hotel-tvs-guests-now-want-to-watch-entertainment-on-their-devices/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer and Internet access===
Most places of lodging currently offer internet access in some form. Most common is [[wi-fi]], which can be used by guests who bring their own computers in their rooms. In most hotels, this is free, though some charge a fee.

Some hotels offer hard-wired internet service requiring the use of a cable for the hook-up.  

They may also provide computers in the lobby for all guests to use, often along with printer services. More rarely, computers are provided in each guest room. Recently, more hotels are offering in-room tablet computers for guests to use.

===Personal items===
Many personal items are provided complimentary for use by guests. These may include [[iron (appliance)|irons]] and [[ironing board]]s, [[hair dryer]]s, [[soap]], [[shampoo]], [[mouthwash]], or [[shower cap]]s.  A current trend in personal items in the United States is to focus on American-made toiletries, such as those made by [[William Roam]], given a perception by guests that foreign-made amenities are not as desirable.  For example, in 2007 hotel amenity provider [[Gilchrist &amp; Soames]], conducted a voluntary worldwide recall, in cooperation with the FDA of its 18-milliliter or 0.65-ounce tubes of complementary toothpaste with the company name on it. Gilchrist &amp; Soames immediately quarantined its toothpaste, made in China, after the FDA issued its warning that the toothpaste possibly contained [[diethylene glycol]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese made hotel toothpaste recalled|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/20247641/ns/health-health_care/t/chinese-made-hotel-toothpaste-recalled/#.VR6cafnF8Sw|website=NBC news|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA stated at the time that it was not aware of any U.S. reports of any harmful effects from the toothpaste containing diethylene glycol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilchrist &amp; Soames Initiates Urgent Worldwide Toothpaste Voluntary Recall|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ArchiveRecalls/2005/ucm112256.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all items are provided by all hotels; for example, some hotels do not provide [[toothpaste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engber|first=Daniel|title=The Mystery of the Missing Hotel Toothpaste|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2013/07/toothpaste_in_hotels_why_do_they_provide_shampoo_soap_and_high_end_toiletries.html|work=[[Slate Magazine]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hair dryer===

In some hotels, a hair dryer is offered for guests use.

[[File:HotelTowelRack.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Towels on a rack in a hotel room]]
Hotels generally provide towels to guests for their use. 

One concern with the provision of towels is theft. Towel theft has proven costly to hotels, though hotels have been reported to do little to combat the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-04-11/business/9404110013_1_spokeswoman-for-marriott-hotels-towels-accounting-and-hotel-consulting-firm|title=Hotels Throw In Towel On Towel Theft|last=Rowe|first=Jeff|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=April 11, 1994|date=April 11, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Holiday Inn]] offered [[amnesty]] to those who returned stolen towels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/02/AR2007120202056.html|title=Time to Return the Towels|last=Schrank|first=Delphine|work=Washington Post|accessdate=December 3, 2007|date=December 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotels have begun to outfit their towels with RFID technology to reduce the frequency of theft.

Some resorts are [[all-inclusive resort|all inclusive]], allowing guests access to food at little or no charge at all times of day throughout their visits.

===Vending===
[[Vending machine]]s are provided at many hotels and motels. These machines usually sell [[soft drink]]s, snacks, and other items commonly sold in vending machines.

Ice dispensers are also standard. While in some hotels, the ice may be complimentary, there may be a fee to obtain ice in others.

===Exercise===
Some hotels have [[fitness center]]s allowing guests to work out during their visits. A recent trend at some upscale properties has seen some of the exercise and fitness programs held outdoors.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/02/25/hotels-take-fitness-amenities-to-the-great-outdoors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

'''Kapampangan''', '''Pampango,''' or the '''Pampangan language''' is a major [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]]. It is spoken in the province of [[Pampanga]], most of [[Tarlac]] and [[Bataan]]. Kapampangan is also understood in some municipalities of [[Bulacan]] and [[Nueva Ecija]] and by the [[Aeta people]] of [[Zambales]]. The language is known honorifically as ''Amánung Sísuan'' ("breastfed, or nurtured, language").&lt;ref name="gruyter"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ulrich Ammon |author2=Norbert Dittmar |author3=Klaus J. Mattheier |title =Sociolinguistics: an international handbook of the science of language and society|publisher =Walter de Gruyter|volume=Volume 3|year =2006|page=2018|isbn =978-3-11-018418-1|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=LMZm0w0k1c4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Kapampangan is one of the [[Central Luzon languages]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. Its closest relatives are the [[Sambalic languages]] of [[Zambales]] province and the [[Bolinao language]] spoken in the towns of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]] in [[Pangasinan]]. These languages share the same reflex {{IPA|/j/}} of the proto-Austronesian consonant *R.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==History==
''Kapampangan'' is derived from the root word ''pampáng'' ("riverbank"). The language was historically spoken in the [[Kingdom of Tondo]], ruled by the [[Lakan]]s.

A number of Kapampangan dictionaries and grammar books were written during the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonial period]]. Diego Bergaño wrote two 18th-century books about the language: ''Arte de la lengua Pampanga''&lt;ref name="Bergaño"&gt;Bergaño&lt;/ref&gt; (first published in 1729) and ''Vocabulario de la lengua Pampanga''  (first published in 1732). Kapampangan produced two 19th-century literary giants; [[Anselmo Fajardo]] was noted for ''Gonzalo de Córdova'' and ''Comedia Heróica de la Conquista de Granada'', and playwright [[Juan Crisóstomo Soto]] wrote ''Alang Dios'' in 1901. "Crissotan" was written by [[Amado Yuzon]], Soto's 1950s contemporary and [[Nobel Prize]] nominee for peace and literature,{{cn|date=July 2018}} to immortalize his contribution to Kapampangan literature.
&lt;!-- does not fit flow of the section, copy-pasted from the source {{quote|In many gatherings, Kapampangans seem more confident and articulate in exchanging views and ideas among their own [Kabalen] "countrymen" in Tagalog (which is the vernacular in the Philippines) than they would in their own [native language]. For instance, many Catholic priests are now delivering their homilies in the Tagalog language during a Kapampangan liturgy while high school student meetings are conducted in the Tagalog language even if all the participants are Kapampangans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silinternational.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/pangilinan-Dispute%20on%20Orthography.pdf] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}--&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Kapampangan is primarily spoken in the province of [[Pampanga]] and southern [[Tarlac]] ([[Bamban, Tarlac|Bamban]], [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]], [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], [[San Jose, Tarlac|San Jose]], [[Gerona, Tarlac|Gerona]], [[La Paz, Tarlac|La Paz]], [[Victoria, Tarlac|Victoria]] and [[Tarlac City]]). It is also spoken in border communities of the provinces of [[Bataan]] ([[Dinalupihan, Bataan|Dinalupihan]], [[Hermosa, Bataan|Hermosa]] and [[Orani, Bataan|Orani]]), [[Bulacan]] ([[Baliuag, Bulacan|Baliuag]], [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel]], [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan|San Ildefonso]], [[Hagonoy, Bulacan|Hagonoy]], [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]], [[Pulilan, Bulacan|Pulilan]] and [[Calumpit, Bulacan|Calumpit]]), [[Nueva Ecija]] ([[Cabiao, Nueva Ecija|Cabiao]], [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija|San Isidro]], [[Gapan City]] and [[Cabanatuan City]]) and [[Zambales]] ([[Olongapo City]] and [[Subic, Zambales|Subic]]). According to the 2000 Philippine census, 2,312,870 people (out of the total population of 76,332,470) spoke Kapampangan as their native language.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
Standard Kapampangan has 21 [[phoneme]]s: 15 [[consonant]]s and five [[vowel]]s; some western dialects have six vowels. Syllabic structure is relatively simple; each syllable contains at least one consonant and a vowel.

===Vowels===
Kapampangan has five vowel phonemes:
*{{IPA|/ɯ/}}, a [[close back unrounded vowel]] when unstressed; allophonic with {{IPA|/a/}}, an [[open front unrounded vowel]] similar to English "f''a''ther" when stressed
*{{IPA|/ɛ/}}, an [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] similar to English "b''e''d"
*{{IPA|/i/}}, a [[close front unrounded vowel]] similar to English "mach''i''ne"
*{{IPA|/o/}}, a [[close-mid back rounded vowel]] similar to English "f''o''rty"
*{{IPA|/u/}}, a [[close back rounded vowel]] similar to English "fl''u''te"

Some dialects also include {{IPA|/ə/}}.

There are four main [[diphthong]]s: {{IPA|/aɪ/}}, {{IPA|/oɪ/}}, {{IPA|/aʊ/}}, and {{IPA|/iʊ/}}. In most dialects (including standard Kapampangan), {{IPA|/aɪ/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}} are reduced to {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} respectively. &lt;!--Old version said [ɛ ~ e], [ɔ ~o] but I'm assuming that's just in reference to allophony, not a /ɛ/ {{angbr|e}} vs. /e/ {{angbr|ai}} distinction? --Tropylium
--&gt;

Monophthongs have [[allophone]]s in unstressed and syllable-final positions:
*{{IPA|/a/}} is raised slightly in unstressed positions, except final syllables. &lt;!--is that to [æ] as in "cat" or [ɐ] as in American English "cut"? --&gt;
*Unstressed {{IPA|/i u/}} is usually pronounced {{IPA|[ɪ ʊ]}}, as in English "b''i''t" and "b''oo''k" respectively (except final syllables).
*In final syllables {{IPA|/i/}} can be pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ, i]}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} can be pronounced {{IPA|[o, u]}}.
** ''deni/reni'' ("these") can be pronounced [ˈdɛnɛ]/[ˈɾɛnɛ] or [ˈdɛni]/[ˈɾɛni]; ''seli'' ("bought") can be pronounced [ˈsɛlɛ] or [ˈsɛli]; ''kekami'' ("to us" [except you]) can be pronounced [kɛkɐˈmɛ] or [kɛkɐˈmi]; ''suerti'' can be pronounced [ˈswɛɾtɛ] or [ˈswɛɾti], ''sisilim'' ("dusk") can be pronounced [sɪˈsilɛm] or [sɪˈsilim].
** ''kanu'' ("he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly") can be pronounced [kaˈno] or [kaˈnu]; ''libru'' ("book") can be pronounced [libˈɾo] or [libˈɾu]; ''ninu'' ("who") can be pronounced [ˈnino] or [ˈninu]; ''kaku'' ("to me") can be pronounced [ˈkako] or [ˈkaku], and ''kamaru'' ("cricket") can be pronounced [kamɐˈɾo] or [kamɐˈɾu].
*Unstressed {{IPA|/e, o/}} are usually pronounced {{IPA|[ɪ, ʊ]}}, respectively (except final syllables).

===Consonants===
In the chart of Kapampangan consonants, all stops are unaspirated. The [[velar nasal]] occurs in all positions, including the beginning of a word. Unlike other Philippine languages, Kapampangan lacks the phoneme /h/.

*{{IPA|/k/}} tends to [[lenition|lenite]] to {{IPA|[x]}} between vowels.
*{{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[ɾ]}} are allophones in Kapampangan, and sometimes interchangeable; ''Nukarin la ring libru?'' can be ''Nukarin la ding libru?'' ("Where are the books?").
*A glottal stop at the end of a word is often omitted in the middle of a sentence.

===Stress===
Stress is phonemic in Kapampangan. Primary stress occurs on the last or the next-to-last syllable of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress, except when stress occurs at the end of a word. Stress shift can occur, shifting to the right or left to differentiate between nominal or verbal use (as in the following examples):&lt;ref name="Forman, Michael, 1971, pp.28-29"&gt;Forman, Michael, 1971, pp.28-29&lt;/ref&gt;
*''dápat'' ("should, ought to") → ''dapát'' ("deed, concern, business")
*''dapúg'' ("gather, burn trash") → ''dápug'' ("trash pile")

Stress shift can also occur when one word is derived from another through affixation; again, stress can shift to the right or the left:&lt;ref name="Forman, Michael, 1971, pp.28-29"/&gt;
*''ábe'' → ''abáyan'' ("company")
*''láso'' → ''lasáwan'' ("melt, digest")

==={{anchor|Historical sound changes}}Sound changes===
In Kapampangan, the [[Proto-Philippine language|proto-Philippine]] [[schwa]] vowel {{IPA|*ə}} merged to /a/ in most dialects of Kapampangan; it is preserved in some western dialects. Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*tanəm}} is ''tanam'' (to plant) in Kapampangan, compared with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ''tanim'', [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] ''tanom'' and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] tanem (grave).

Proto-Philippine {{IPA|*R}} merged with {{IPA|/j/}}. The Kapampangan word for "new" is ''bayu''; it is ''bago'' in Tagalog, ''baro'' in Ilocano, and ''baru'' in Indonesian.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===
Kapampangan nouns are not [[inflection|inflected]], but are usually preceded by case [[Marker (linguistics)|markers]]. There are three types of case markers: [[absolutive case|absolutive]] ([[nominative case|nominative]]), [[ergative case|ergative]] ([[genitive case|genitive]]), and [[oblique case|oblique]].

Unlike [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (which are [[nominative–accusative language]]s) and [[Inuit Language|Inuit]] and [[Basque Language|Basque]] (which are [[ergative–absolutive language]]s), Kapampangan has [[Austronesian alignment]] (in common with most Philippine languages). Austronesian alignment may work with nominative (and absolutive) or ergative (and absolutive) markers and pronouns.

Absolutive or nominative markers mark the actor of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb. Ergative or genitive markers mark the object (usually indefinite) of an intransitive verb and the actor of a transitive one. It also marks possession. Oblique markers, similar to prepositions in English, mark (for example) location and direction. Noun markers are divided into two classes: names of people (personal) and everything else (common).

====Examples====
*''Sinulat ku'' (I wrote).
*''Silatanan na ku'' (He [or she] wrote me).
*''Dintang ya'' (He [or she] has arrived). Note: ''Dintang ya'' = He arrived (or arrives); ''Dintang ne'' = He has arrived.
*''Sabian me kaku'' (Tell it to me).
*''Ninu ing minaus keka?'' (Who called you?)
*''Mamasa la'' (They are reading).
*''Mamangan la ring babi?'' (Are the pigs eating?)

Genitive pronouns follow the word they modify. Oblique pronouns can replace the genitive pronoun, but  precede the word they modify.

*''Ing bale ku;'' ''Ing kakung bale;'' ''Ing kanakung bale'' (my house)

The dual pronoun ''ikata'' and the inclusive pronoun ''ikatamu'' refer to the first and second person. The exclusive pronoun ''ikamí'' refers to the first and third persons.

*''Ala katang nasi.'' (We [dual] do not have rice).
*''Ala tamung nasi.'' (We [inclusive] do not have rice).
*''Ala keng nasi'', ''Ala kaming nasi'' (We [exclusive] do not have rice).

Kapampangan differs from many [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] in requiring the pronoun even if the noun it represents, or the [[antecedent (grammar)|grammatical antecedent]], is present.

*''Dintang ya i Erning'' (not ''dintang i Erning''; Ernie arrived).
*''Mamasa la ri Maria at Juan'' (not ''mamasa ri Maria at Juan''; Maria and Juan are reading).
*''Silatanan na kang José'' (not ''silatanan kang José''; José wrote you).

====Special forms====
The pronouns ''ya'' and ''la'' have special forms when they are used in conjunction with the words ''ati'' (there is/are) and ''ala'' (there is/are not).

*''Ati yu king Pampanga'' (He is in Pampanga).
*''Ala lu ring doktor keni'', ''Ala lu ding doktor keni'' (the doctors are no longer here).

Both ''ati yu'' and ''ati ya'' are correct. The plural form ("they are") is ''atilu'' and ''atila''. Both ''ala la'' and ''ala lu'' are correct in the plural form. The singular forms are ''ala ya'' and ''ala yu''.

====Pronoun combinations====
Kapampangan pronouns follow a certain order after verbs (or particles, such as negation words). The [[Clitic#Enclitic|enclitic]] pronoun is always followed by another pronoun (or [[discourse marker]]:
*''Ikit da ka'' (I saw you).
*''Silatanan na ku'' (He wrote to me).

Pronouns also combine to form a [[portmanteau]] pronoun:
*''Ikit ke'' (I saw her).
*''Dinan kong pera (I will give them money).

Portmanteau pronouns are not usually used in questions and with the word ''naman'':
*''Akakit me?'' (Do you see him?)
*''Buri nya naman yan'', ''buri ne murin yan'' (He likes that, too).

In the following chart, blank entries denote combinations which are deemed impossible. Column headings denote pronouns in the absolutive case, and the row headings denote the [[ergative case]].

The demonstrative pronouns ''ini'' and ''iti'' (and their respective forms) both mean "this", but each has distinct uses. ''Iti'' usually refers to something abstract, but may also refer to concrete nouns: ''iting musika'' (this music), ''iti ing gagawan mi'' (this is what we do). ''Ini'' is always concrete: ''ining libru'' (this book), ''ini ing asu nang Juan'' (this is Juan's dog).

In their locative forms, ''keni'' is used when the person spoken to is not near the subject spoken of; ''keti'' is used when the person spoken to is near the subject spoken of. Two people in the same country will refer to their country as ''keti'', but will refer to their respective towns as ''keni''; both mean "here".

The plural forms of a demonstrative pronoun and its existential form (for the nearest addressee) are exceptions. The plural of ''iyan'' is ''den/ren''; the plural of ''niyan'' is ''daren''; the plural of ''kanyan'' is ''karen'', and the plural of ''oyan'' is ''oren''. The existential form of ''iyan'' is ''ken''.

*''Nanu ini?'' (What's this?)
*''Mangabanglu la rening sampaga'', ''Mangabanglu la dening sampaga'' (These flowers smell nice).
*''Ninu ing lalaking ita?'' (Who is that man?)
*''Me keni'', ''munta ka keni'' (Come here).
*''Ati ku keti'', ''atsu ku keni'', ''atyu ku keni'' (I am here).
*''Mangan la keta'' (They will eat there).
*''Ninu ing anak a yan?'' (Who is that child?)
*''Uyta/Oyta ya pala ing salamin mu!'' (So that's where your glasses are!)
*''E ku pa menakit makanyan/makanini'' (I haven't seen one of these before).
*''Manyaman la ren/Manyaman la den'' (Those are delicious).
*''Ayni/Areni/Oreni la reng adwang regalo para keka'' (Here are the two gifts for you).
*''Buri daka!'' (I like you!)

*''Mangan Tana!'' (Let's eat!)
*''Edaka buring mawala!'' (I don't want to lose you!)

==={{anchor|Conjugation chart}}Verbs===
Kapampangan verbs are morphologically complex, and take a variety of affixes reflecting focus, aspect and mode. The language has [[Austronesian alignment]], and the verbs change according to triggers in the sentence (better known as voices). Kapampangan has five voices: agent, patient, goal, locative, and cirumstantial. The circumstantial voice prefix is used for instrument and benefactee subjects.

The [[direct case]] morphemes in Kapampangan are ''ing'' (which marks singular subjects) and ''reng'', for plural subjects. Non-subject agents are marked with the ergative-case ''ning''; non-subject patients are marked with the accusative-case ''-ng'', which is [[clitic]]ized onto the preceding word.&lt;ref&gt;In the examples, the word to which the accusative case marker attaches is a pronoun or [[portmanteau]] pronoun that is obligatorily present in the same clause as the noun with which it is [[Coreference|co-referential]].  In sentences with an agent trigger, the pronoun co-refers with the agent subject.  In sentences with a non-agent trigger, the portmanteau pronoun co-refers with both the ergative agent and the non-agent subject, which is marked with direct case.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ambiguities and irregularities ====
Speakers of other Philippine languages find Kapampangan verbs difficult because some verbs belong to unpredictable verb classes and some verb forms are ambiguous. The root word ''sulat'' (write) exists in Tagalog and Kapampangan:
*''Susulat'' means "is writing" in Kapampangan and "will write" in Tagalog.
*''Sumulat'' means "will write" in Kapampangan and "wrote" in Tagalog. It is the infinitive in both languages.
*''Sinulat'' means "wrote" in both languages. In Kapampangan it is in the actor focus (with long i: {{IPA|[ˌsi:ˈnu:lat]}}) or object focus (with short i: {{IPA|[siˈnu:lat]}}), and object focus only in Tagalog.

The object-focus suffix ''-an'' represents two focuses; the only difference is that one conjugation preserves ''-an'' in the completed aspect, and it is dropped in the other conjugation:
*''Bayaran'' (to pay someone): ''bayaran'' (will pay someone), ''babayaran'' (is paying someone), ''beyaran'' (paid someone)
*''Bayaran'' (to pay for something): ''bayaran'' (will pay for something), ''babayaran'' (is paying for something), ''binayad'' (paid for something)

Other Philippine languages have separate forms; Tagalog has ''-in'' and ''-an'' in, [[Bikol language|Bikol]] and most of the [[Visayan languages]] have ''-on'' and ''-an'', and [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]] has ''-en'' and ''-an'' due to historical sound changes in the proto-Philippine /*e/.

A number of actor-focus verbs do not use the infix ''-um-'', but are usually conjugated like other verbs which do (for example, ''gawa'' (to do), ''bulus'' (to immerse), ''terak'' (to dance), ''lukas'' (to take off), ''sindi'' (to smoke), ''saklu'' (to fetch), ''takbang'' (to step) and ''tuki'' (to accompany). Many of these verbs undergo a change of vowel instead of taking the infix ''-in-'' (completed aspect). In the actor focus (''-um-'' verbs), this happens only to verbs with the vowel /u/ in the first syllable; ''lukas'' (to take off) is conjugated ''lukas'' (will take off), ''lulukas'' (is taking off), and ''likas'' (took off).

This change of vowel also applies to certain object-focus verbs in the completed aspect. In addition to /u/ becoming /i/, /a/ becomes /e/ in certain cases (for example, ''dela'' [brought something], ''semal'' [worked on something] and ''seli'' [bought]).

There is no written distinction between the two ''mag-'' affixes; ''magsalita'' may mean "is speaking" or "will speak", but there is an audible difference. {{IPA|[mɐɡsaliˈtaʔ]}} means "will speak" while {{IPA|[ˌmaːɡsaliˈtaʔ]}} means "is speaking".

== Writing systems and orthography ==
[[Image:Amanung Sisuan in Kulitan.svg|thumb|alt=Kulitan writing|''Amánung Sísuan'' (honorific name for "mother language" (literally "nurtured or suckled language") in Kulitan, Kapampangan's indigenous writing system]]
Kapampangan, like most Philippine languages, uses the Latin alphabet. Before the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, it was written with the [[Kulitan alphabet]]. Kapampangan is usually written in one of three different writing systems: ''sulat Baculud'', ''sulat Wawa'' and a hybrid of the two, ''Amung Samson''.&lt;ref name="K or C"&gt;Pangilinan, M. R. M. (2006, January). Kapampángan or Capampáñgan: settling the dispute on the Kapampángan Romanized orthography. In Paper at Tenth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan (pp. 17-20).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first system (''sulat Baculud'', also known as ''tutung Capampangan'' or ''tutung Kapampangan'' in the ''sulat Wawa'' system) is based on [[Spanish orthography]], a feature of which involved the use of the letters ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ to represent the phoneme /k/ (depending on the vowel sound following the phoneme). ⟨C⟩ was used before /a/, /o/ and /u/ (''ca'', ''co'' and ''cu''), and ⟨q⟩ was used with ⟨u⟩ before the vowels /e/ and /i/ (''que'', ''qui''). The Spanish-based orthography is primarily associated with literature by authors from Bacolor and the text used on the Kapampangan ''Pasion''.&lt;ref name="K or C"/&gt;

The second system, the ''Sulat Wawa'', is an "indigenized" form which preferred ⟨k⟩ over ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ in representing the phoneme /k/. This orthography, based on the [[Abakada alphabet]] was used by writers from Guagua and rivaled writers from the nearby town of Bacolor.&lt;ref name="K or C"/&gt;

The third system, ''Amung Samson'' hybrid orthography, intends to resolve the conflict in spelling between proponents of the ''sulat Baculud'' and ''sulat Wawa''. This system was created by former Catholic priest Venancio Samson during the 1970s to translate the Bible into Kapampangan. It resolved conflicts between the use of ⟨q⟩ and ⟨c⟩ (in ''sulat Baculud'') and ⟨k⟩ (in ''sulat Wawa'') by using ⟨k⟩ before ⟨e⟩ and ⟨i⟩ (instead of [qu]⟩ and using ⟨c⟩ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨o⟩, and ⟨u⟩ (instead of ⟨k⟩). The system also removed ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨ñ⟩ (from Spanish), replacing them with ⟨ly⟩ and ⟨ny⟩.&lt;ref name="K or C"/&gt;

Orthography has been debated by Kapampangan writers, and orthographic styles may vary by writer. The ''sulat Wawa'' system has become the popular method of writing due to the influence of the Tagalog-based [[Filipino language]] (the national language) and its orthography. The ''sulat Wawa'' system is used by the Akademyang Kapampangan and the poet Jose Gallardo.&lt;ref name="K or C"/&gt;

===Orthographic history and disputes===
From the 10th century AD to 1571, before the Spanish conquest of Lúsung Guo which resulted in the creation of the Province of Pampanga, Kapampangans used a writing system known as ''Kulitan'' or ''Sulat Kapampangan''. [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] missionaries studied the Kapampangan language and its writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=An introduction to Kulitan, the indigenous Kapampangan script | publisher=Center for Kapampangan Studies, Philippines. | author=Pangilinan, Michael | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as 1699, more than a century after the Spanish conquest, Spaniards continued studying the Kapampangan language and writing system. The Spanish introduced a Romanized orthography, known as the Bacolor Orthography, ''Súlat Bacúlud'' or ''Tutûng Kapampángan'' ([[English language|English]]: "genuine Kapampangan") because of the number of works written in this orthography. The orthography contains the letters ''q'', ''c'', ''f'', ''ñ'' and ''ll''.&lt;ref name="K or C"/&gt;

By the end of the Spanish colonization, the [[Abakada alphabet]] (also known as ''Súlat Wáwâ'' or [[Guagua, Pampanga|Guagua]] script) replaced ''c'' and ''q'' with ''k''. Kapampangan nationalist writers from Wáwâ (Guagua) wanted to create an identity distinct from the Bacúlud literary tradition. They were inspired by [[José Rizal]], who proposed simplifying the Romanized Tagalog by replacing ''c'' and ''q'' with ''k''. Two Kapampangan writers from Wáwâ, [[Aurelio Tolentino]] and [[Monico Mercado]] (with his translation of Rizal's ''"[[Mi último adiós]]"'') have adapted Rizal's proposal into Kapampangan writing.&lt;ref name="K or C"/&gt;

[[File:PampangoScript.png|thumb|alt=Man writing on a large sheet of paper on a floor|275px|A Kapampangan calligraphist writes in Kulitan script during the inauguration of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]]'s Extension Program on Pampanga's new campus.]]
On December 31, 1937, Philippine president [[Manuel L. Quezon]] proclaimed the language based on Tagalog as the commonwealth's national language. Zoilo Hilario proposed standardizing Kapampangan orthography. A member of the Institute of National Language (INL), Hilario sought to adopt the Abakada alphabet used in Tagalog as Kapampangan's orthographic system. The legal imposition of Tagalog as the Philippine national language placed all other Philippine languages (including Kapampangan) in a subordinate position. The conflict between the "purists" and "anti-purists" which plagued the Tagalog literary scene was echoed by Kapampangan writers.&lt;ref name="K or C"/&gt;

In 1970 (before his translation of the [[Bible]] into Kapampangan), Venancio Samson called the dispute over Kapampangan orthography to the attention of the Philippine Bible Society and submitted a proposal aimed at reconciling the old and the new spelling in Kapampangan writing with what is known as Ámugng Samson's hybrid orthography. Samson's synthesis was readily accepted by the Catholic Archdiocese of Pampanga, which used it in most of its Kapampangan publications during the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="K or C"/&gt;

In 1997, the Batiáuan Foundation said that the major obstacle to popularizing Kapampangan was the intense conflict over orthography. The prediction that the Kapampangans would be absorbed by the Tagalogs was seen by Kapampangan groups as a real threat, since Tagalog words were replacing indigenous words in spoken Kapampangan. They revised the Abakada alphabet in Kapampangan writing, removing the letter ''w'' and mandating simplified diacritical marks. According to Akademyang Kapampangan, the Batiáuan revision complicates Kapampangan writing and confuses adherents of their proposed orthography. Batiáuan insists that the diacritical marks are essential in written Kapampangan, because many words are spelled the same but are pronounced differently. From this perspective, diacritical marks facilitate understanding instead of complicating the language.&lt;ref name="K or C"/&gt;

'''Konda''', also known as '''Konda-Dora''', is one of the [[Dravidian languages]] spoken in India. It is spoken by the [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|scheduled tribe]] of the Konda-Dora who mostly live in the districts of Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, and East Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, Koraput district in Odisha and Assam. It is sometimes written in Telugu script and Odia Script. Some text books have been developed for schools up to 5th standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/the-dying-tongues-of-telangana-and-andhra/articleshow/57253816.cms  The dying tongues of Telangana and Andhra - Times of India]&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique writing system was developed by [[Sathupati Prasanna Sree]] for use with the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.omniglot.com/writing/konda.htm | title = Konda-Dora | access-date = 11 November 2017 | website= Omniglot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Law of Moses''' ({{lang-he-n|תֹּורַת מֹשֶׁה}} {{transl|he|Torat Moshe}}), also called the '''Mosaic Law''', refers primarily to the [[Torah]] or first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Traditionally believed to have been [[Mosaic authorship|written by Moses]], some academics now believe they had many authors.

==Terminology==
The Law of Moses or [[Torah#Meaning and names|Torah of Moses]] (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|תֹּורַת מֹשֶׁה}}, ''Torat Moshe'', [[Septuagint]] {{lang-grc|νόμος Μωυσῆ}}, ''nómos Mōusē'', or in some [[English translations of the bible|translations]] the "Teachings of Moses" &lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[New Century Version]], {{bibleverse||Joshua|8:32|NCV}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a biblical term first found in the [[Book of Joshua]] {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|8:31-32|NKJV}}, where Joshua writes the Hebrew words of "Torat Moshe {{Hebrew|תֹּורַת מֹשֶׁה}}" on an altar of stones at [[Mount Ebal]]. The text continues:
{{quote|And afterward he read all the words of the teachings, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the Torah'' (Joshua 8:34).&lt;ref&gt;Kristin De Troyer, Armin Lange ''Reading the present in the Qumran library'' 2005 p158: "Both at the beginning and at the ending of the Gibeonites' story there is now a reference to the law of Moses and to the fact that ... The building of the altar happens on Mount Ebal, not in Gilgal — Joshua gets to Gilgal only in 9:6."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term occurs 15 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], a further 7 times in the [[New Testament]], and repeatedly in [[Second Temple period]], [[intertestamental]], [[rabbinical]] and [[Church Fathers|patristic]] literature.

The Hebrew word for the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, ''[[Torah]]'' (which means "law" and was translated into Greek as [[Nomos (mythology)|"nomos"]] or "Law") refers to the same five books termed in English "Pentateuch" (from Latinised Greek  "five books," implying the five books of Moses). According to some scholars, use of the name "Torah" to designate the "Five Books of Moses" of the [[Hebrew Bible]] is clearly documented only from the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Crüsemann, Allan W. Mahnke ''The Torah: theology and social history of Old Testament law p331  1996 " there is only clear evidence for the use of the term Torah to describe the Pentateuch as a ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage, ''Torah'' can refer to the first five books of the Tanakh, as the Hebrew Bible is commonly called, to the instructions and [[mitzvot|commandments]] found in the 2nd to 5th books of the Hebrew Bible, and also to the entire Tanakh and even all of the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]] as well. Among English-speaking Christians the term "The Law" can refer to the whole Pentateuch including [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], but this is generally in relation to the New Testament where ''nomos'' "the Law" sometimes refers to all five books, including Genesis. This use of the Hebrew term "Torah" (law), for the first five books is considered misleading by 21st-century Christian [[bible scholar]] [[John Van Seters]], because the Pentateuch "consists of about one half law and the other half narrative."&lt;ref&gt;John Van Seters ''The Pentateuch: a social-science commentary'' 2004 p16 "Furthermore, the Hebrew term Torah, 'Law', is a little misleading as a description of the content of the Pentateuch, since it consists of about one half law and the other half narrative."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law in the Ancient Near East==
The "Law of Moses" in ancient Israel was different from other legal codes in the [[ancient Near East]] because transgressions were seen as offenses against God rather than solely as offenses against society (civil law).&lt;ref&gt;John H. Walton ''Ancient Israelite Literature in Its Cultural Context'' 1994  p233 "The ancient Near Eastern collections do not include cultic law; rather, their focus is on civil law. As a generalization, in the ancient Near East violation of law is an offense against society. In Israel a violation of law is an ..."&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the [[Sumer]]ian [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] (c. 2100-2050 BCE), and the [[Babylonia]]n [[Code of Hammurabi]] (c. 1760 BCE, of which almost half concerns [[contract law]]). However the influence of the ancient Near Eastern legal tradition on the Law of ancient Israel is recognised and well documented.&lt;ref&gt;''A survey of the Old Testament'' p52  Andrew E. Hill, John H. Walton - 2000 "The influence of the ancient Near Eastern legal tradition on the form and function of Hebrew law is undeniable and widely documented.2 Along with this contemporary cultural influence, the Old Testament affirms the divine origin of  "&lt;/ref&gt; For example the Israelite [[Sabbatical Year]] has antecedents in the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''mesharum'' edicts granting periodic relief to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible and the ancient Near East: collected essays'' Jimmy Jack McBee Roberts 2002 p46 "The Israelite Sabbatical Year, which seems to have the same purpose and recurs at about the same interval, appears to be an Israelite adaptation of this mesharum-edict tradition."&lt;/ref&gt; Another important distinction is that in ancient Near East legal codes, as in more recently unearthed [[Ugaritic]] texts, an important, and ultimate, role in the legal process was assigned to the king.  Ancient Israel, before the monarchical period beginning with David, was set up as a [[theocracy]], rather than a [[monarchy]], although God is most commonly portrayed like a king.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Curtis in ''Law and religion: essays on the place of the law in Israel '' ed. [[Barnabas Lindars]] - 1988 p3 Chapter 1 GOD AS 'JUDGE' IN UGARITIC AND HEBREW THOUGHT "The many legal texts discovered at Ugarit make it clear that the king played an important legal role; although legal transactions could be carried out before witnesses, "&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew Bible==
===Moses and authorship of the Law===
{{main|Moses|Deuteronomist|Mosaic authorship}}
According to the Hebrew Bible, Moses was the [[The Exodus|leader of early Israel out of Egypt]]; and traditionally the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] are attributed to him, though most modern scholars believe there were multiple authors. The law attributed to Moses, specifically the laws set out in the books of [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]], as a consequence came to be considered supreme over all other sources of authority (any king and/or his officials), and the [[Levites]] were the guardians and interpreters of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fUEuF-W9Ul&amp;sig=YcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., "The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues" (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)] p.19ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Deuteronomy ({{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|31:24–26|KJV}}) records Moses saying, "Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] of the {{LORD}}." Similar passages referring to the Law include, for example, Exodus 17:14, "And the {{LORD}} said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of [[Joshua]], that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of [[Amalek]] from under [[heaven]];" Exodus 24:4, "And Moses wrote all the words of the {{LORD}}, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the [[twelve tribes of Israel]];" Exodus 34:27, "And the {{LORD}} said unto Moses, Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with thee and with Israel;" and {{Bibleref|Leviticus|26:46|KJV}}  "These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the {{LORD}} established on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] between himself and the [[Israelites]] through Moses."

===Later references to the Law in the Hebrew Bible===
The [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] relates how a "law of Moses" was discovered in the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] during the reign of king [[Josiah]] (r. 641–609 BCE). This book is mostly identified as an early version of the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], perhaps chapters 5-26 and chapter 28 of the extant text. This text contains a number of laws, dated to the 8th century BCE [[kingdom of Judah]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Another mention of the "Book of the Law of Moses" is found in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+8%3A30-31&amp;version=ESV Joshua 8:30-31] .

===Content===
{{main|613 commandments}}
The content of the Law is spread among the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and then reiterated and added to in [[Deuteronomy]] (''deutero-nomy'' is Latinised Greek for "Second reading of the Law"). This includes:
* the [[Ten Commandments]]
* Moral laws - on murder, theft, honesty, adultery, etc.
* Social laws - on property, inheritance, marriage and divorce,
* Food laws - on what is [[kosher|clean and unclean]], on cooking and storing food.
* Purity laws - on [[Niddah|menstruation]], [[zav|seminal emissions]], [[Tzaraath|skin disease and mildew]], etc.
* Feasts - the [[Day of Atonement]], [[Passover]], [[Feast of Tabernacles]], [[Feast of Unleavened Bread]], [[Feast of Weeks]] etc.
* Sacrifices and offerings - the [[sin offering]], [[burnt offering]], [[whole offering]], [[heave offering]], [[Passover sacrifice]], [[meal offering]], [[wave offering]], [[peace offering]], [[drink offering]], [[thank offering]], [[dough offering]], [[incense offering]], [[red heifer]], [[scapegoat]], [[first fruits]], etc.
* Instructions for the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|priesthood]] and the [[High Priest (Judaism)|high priest]] including [[tithe]]s.
* Instructions regarding the [[Tabernacle]], and which were later applied to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], including those concerning the [[Holy of Holies]] containing the [[Ark of the Covenant]] (in which were the tablets of the law, [[Aaron's rod]], the [[manna]]). Instructions  and for the construction of [[altar (Judaism)|various altars]].
* Forward looking instructions for time when Israel would demand a [[kings of Israel|king]].

==Rabbinical interpretation==
The content of the instructions and its interpretations, the Oral Torah, was passed down orally, excerpted and codified in [[Rabbinical Judaism]], and in the [[Talmud]] were numbered as the [[613 commandments]]. The [[Law given to Moses at Sinai]] (Hebrew Halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai הלכה למשה מסיני) is a [[Halakha|halakhic]] distinction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5554">The '''Linguists' Club''' was a language club located in [[London]], which operated between 1932 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Widlund-Fantini |first=Anne-Marie |date=2007 |title=''Danica Seleskovitch: Interprète et témoin du XXe siècle'' |trans-title=Danica Seleskovitch: Interpreter and witness to the 20th century |language=French |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuZ3bllaUc8C&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=isbn+978-2-8251-3697-3&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=osJNTe-yC4iqsAO3s8GmCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pilley&amp;f=false |location=Lausanne |publisher=L'Age d'Homme |isbn=978-2-8251-3697-3 |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luxurylondon.co.uk/article/historic-london-the-linguists-club |date=22 October 2016 |title=Historic London: The Linguists' Club |last=Finney |first=Elizabeth |access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Club acted as a meeting place and school for [[Linguistics|linguists]], including [[Language interpretation|interpreters]], [[Translation|translators]], language students, and other members who merely wanted to practise their language skills. The Club's motto was '''Se comprendre, c'est la paix''' ''(Mutual understanding is peace).''

The Club's owner and principal was [[Teddy Pilley (Interpreter)|Teddy Pilley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/bletchleyjews.html# |title=Jewish Personnel at Bletchley Park in World War Two |series=Jewish Virtual Library |last=Sugarman |first=Martin |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Club was initially located on [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]] near to [[Holborn tube station]], and then later in premises at 20 [[Grosvenor Place (London)|Grosvenor Place]] (this was the postal address, but the Club's entrance was actually in the [[mews]] at the rear at 8/9 Chester Close).&lt;ref name=Bootheando&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bootheando.com/2013/03/08/la-historia-de-la-interpretacion-simultanea-de-la-mano-de-ted-pilley |date=2013 |title=La historia de la interpretación simultánea de la mano de Ted Pilley |trans-title=Simultaneous interpreting, as practiced by Ted Pilley |language=Spanish |website=Bootheando |series=Historia, Interpretación, Interpretación simultánea, Intérprete |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Club provided language classes and less-formal discussion groups in a number of languages, including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, and [[Esperanto]]. The discussion groups could cover any number of topics, except politics and sex. The Linguists' Club was open 6 days a week, from 11 am to 11 pm. There was a snack bar, no alcohol was served. There was a TV room, a ping-pong room, a small cinema for showing foreign-language films, and Friday evening dances to records. Just after [[World War II]], some Club dances were held on the roof-garden of the Chester Close location, illuminated by coloured light bulbs. For a time, in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, the Club organised trips abroad for members, and there were also visits to a social venue near [[Leatherhead]], [[Surrey]], known as ''Surrey Crest''.

In the early days of the Club's life, Teddy Pilley facilitated so called ''Working Parties'', to help train aspiring [[Language interpretation|interpreters]].&lt;ref name=Bootheando/&gt; An active ''Translation Bureau'' was also established, to provide commercial services to the general public.

Membership in the Linguists' Club could be purchased for periods from one month to a year. Members could opt to suspend membership for periods of absence from the country. There was a Life Membership fee of 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]], and many took this option. There was also a guest membership of one day. The last register of members listed membership numbers in the 70,000s.

Under the co-editorship of Teddy Pilley and Hilda Westron, the Linguists' Club published a monthly magazine, '''The Linguist''', which had world-wide circulation.

The Club expanded in the 1950s to include a second location at Niddry Lodge, near to [[Kensington High Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rbkclocalstudies.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/niddry-lodge-not-the-tower-of-babel/ |last=Walker |first=Dave |date=4 June 2015 |title=Niddry Lodge: not the Tower of Babel |publisher=[[Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea]] |series=The Library Time Machine (Blog) |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Finney |first=Elizabeth |date=November 2016 |title=Welcome to The Club |url=https://issuu.com/runwildmedia/docs/k_c_nov_16 |journal=Kensington &amp; Chelsea Magazine |issue=057 |pages=48–49 |access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming included a ''School of English'' to help international members learn English. Niddry Lodge had been built in the early 1800s. There was far more room for activities that could not be held at Chester Close. The Lodge had a 1 [[acre]] garden (the largest private garden in Kensington at the time), where classes/discussion groups were held in warm weather. There was also a ballroom where Scottish dancing and fencing lessons were held. Niddry Lodge was on a lease from [[Metropolitan Borough of Kensington|Kensington Council]], and when that expired the Lodge was sadly demolished to make way for the new [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington &amp; Chelsea]] [[town hall]]. Some of the trees in the town hall courtyard are from the Lodge's garden.

The following is a list of countries where [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is an official language, plus a number of countries where Spanish, or any language closely related to it, is an important or significant language.

==Official or national language==
Spanish is the majority language in 20 sovereign states and several dependent territories, totaling around 442 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eldiae.es/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/El-espa%C3%B1ol-lengua-viva-2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903092938/http://eldiae.es/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/El-espa%C3%B1ol-lengua-viva-2014.pdf |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is additionally the main official language in Equatorial Guinea.

In these countries and territories, Spanish is the main or mostly used language of communication of the vast majority of the population; official documents are written chiefly or solely in that language; and it is taught in schools and utilized as the primary medium of instruction as part of the official curriculum.

=== Andorra ===
{{Also|Languages of Andorra}}

The Spanish language is not official but also holds a special status (in the education system, the media, and some official documents) in the [[Principality of Andorra]] which shares land borders with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.ad/cres/observatori/temes/llengua3trimestre2005.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070717032526/http://www.iea.ad/cres/observatori/temes/llengua3trimestre2005.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 July 2007 |title=Observatori de l'Institut d'Estudis Andorrans|language=Catalan |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belize ===
{{Also|Languages of Belize}}

Spanish has no official recognition in the [[Central America]]n nation of [[Belize]], a [[Commonwealth realm]] where English is the official national language. However, the country shares land borders with Spanish-speaking Mexico and Guatemala and, per the 2010 Belizean census, Spanish is spoken by a sizable portion of the population; 30% claim Spanish as a mother tongue and about 50% of the population has working knowledge of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Institute of Belize: Belize Population and Housing Census 2010. Country Report. Belmopan 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gibraltar ===
{{Also|Languages of Gibraltar}}

The Spanish language is not official but also holds a special status (in the education system, the media, and some official documents) in the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], which share land borders with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/constitution/new_constitution/NewGibraltarConstitution.pdf Constitution of Gibraltar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121050613/http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/constitution/new_constitution/NewGibraltarConstitution.pdf |date=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Spanish language in the United States}}

Spanish has been spoken in the United States for several centuries in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and [[Florida]], which were all once part of [[New Spain]].

=== Philippines ===

{{Main|Spanish language in the Philippines}}
{{Also|Philippine Spanish}}

Spanish was an official language of the [[Philippines]] from the beginning of the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Hispanic period]] in 1565 and through independence until a constitutional change in 1973. 
However, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] had Spanish redesigned as an official language under Presidential Decree No. 156, dated 15 March 1973 and Spanish remained official until 1987, when it was re-designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language.&lt;ref&gt;'''Article XIV, Sec 7''': For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English. The regional languages are the auxiliary official languages in the regions and shall serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein. '''Spanish''' and Arabic shall be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2007, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] announced that the Philippine government asked help from the Spanish Government in her plan to reintroduce Spanish as a required subject in the Philippine school system.&lt;ref name=SpanishGMA&gt;{{cite web

While Spanish is designated as an optional government language in the [[Philippines]], its usage is very limited and not present in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-xiv/ Constitution of the Philippines], Art. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the country, Spanish is regulated by the [[Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language]].

Spanish is a secondary official language, alongside [[Arabic language|Arabic]], in the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], a former Spanish colony and now a partially recognized state, most of whose territory is occupied by [[Morocco]]. Spanish is not a native language in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/santiago/2008/03/04/0003_6622703.htm |title=Como saharauis queremos conservar el español |publisher=Lavozdegalicia.es |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/anuario/anuario_06-07/pdf/paises_3.pdf |format=PDF |title=EL ESPAñOL EN LOS CAMPAMENTOS DE REFUGIADOS SAHARAUIS (TINDUF, ARGELIA) |publisher=Cvc.cervantes.es |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works===
His noted works are "Venu Lo Gunje dhara",''Him Kirtini'', ''Him Tarangini'' ({{lang-hi|हिम तरंगिणी}}), ''Yug Charan'' ({{lang-hi|युग चरण}}), and ''Sahitya Devata'' ({{lang-hi|साहित्य देवता}}), and his most noted poems are ''Deep Se Deep Jale'' ({{lang-hi|दीप से दीप जले}}), ''Kaisa Chhand Banaa Deti hai'' ({{lang-hi|कैसा छन्द बना देती है}}) and ''Pushp ki Abhilaashaa'' ({{lang-hi|पुष्प की अभिलाषा}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shayeri.net/gpoet/makhanlal.html Poems by Makhanlal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===

'''Narmin Kamal''' ({{lang-az|Nərmin Kamal}}) is a novelist and essayist, author of several books published in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani literature, although not as well known as its Turkish and Russian cousins, is one of the gems of European culture.

'''Profanity in science fiction''' (SF) shares all of the issues of [[profanity]] in fiction in general, but has several unique aspects of its own, including the use of alien profanities (such as the alien expletive "shazbot!" from ''[[Mork &amp;amp; Mindy]]'', a word that briefly enjoyed popular usage outside of that television show&lt;ref name=EFFL /&gt;).

==Extent of usage==
In his advice to other SF writers, [[Orson Scott Card]] states that there are no hard-and-fast rules for the use of profanity in SF stories, despite what may have been expected of writers in the past.  The onus is squarely on the writer to determine how much profanity to use, to enquire as to each publisher's limits, and to think about the effect that the use of profanity will have on the reader, both in perceiving the characters and in possibly being offended by the story as a whole.&lt;ref name=OSC1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogow1991 /&gt;

Card urges those writers who do decide to omit profanity from their stories to omit it completely.  He regards the coinage of ''tanj'' ("There Ain't No Justice") by [[Larry Niven]] as a "noble experiment" that "proved that euphemisms are often worse than the crudities that they replace", because they make the story look silly.  In Card's opinion, such [[nonce word]]s simply don't work.&lt;ref name=OSC1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogow1991 /&gt;

Ruth Wajnryb shares this opinion, stating that ''tanj'' or ''flarn'' don't work as profanities because they are not real, and are "just a futile attempt to give clean-cut stories some foul-mouthed action".&lt;ref name=Wajnryb2005 /&gt;

Jes Battis observes, in contrast, that the use of ''frell'' and ''dren'' in ''[[Farscape]]'' allowed the television series to get away with dialogue that would normally never have made it past broadcasting and network censorship.  The words are respectively equivalent to ''[[wikt:fuck|fuck]]'' and ''[[wikt:shit|shit]]'' and are used as both [[interjection]]s and [[noun]]s in the series.  In the episode "[[Suns and Lovers]]", for example, [[Aeryn Sun]] says "frell me dead!" as an exclamation of surprise, much as a real-world person would utter "well, fuck me!"{{ref|1|[frell]}} or, indeed, "fuck me dead!" Battis also notes that ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used a similar strategy, by using [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Cantonese]] for all profanities, also using the word ''gorram'' as a replacement for ''god damn'', a phrase usually considered [[blasphemy|blasphemous]].&lt;ref name=Battis1&gt;{{cite book|title=Investigating Farscape|author=Jes Battis|pages=145|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2007|isbn= 978-1-84511-342-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, dialogue in ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' is liberally peppered with the word ''frak'' ('fuck').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The F-word in Sci-Fi TV shows|work=forums.whirlpool.net.au|date=|url=http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies-archive.cfm/318201.html|accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, invented expletives are used throughout the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]].  For example, the Alderaanian expletive ''stang'' was introduced in the 1978 novel ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' and subsequently used in ''Star Wars'' novels, comic books, and games.  Also, ''Star Wars'' authors commonly use the Huttese curse ''fierfek'', first introduced in a short story published in the 1996 anthology ''[[Tales from Jabba's Palace]]'', and the Corelian curse ''[[sith]]spawn'', first introduced in the 1994/1995 comic book series ''[[Dark Empire II]]''.

[[Parke Godwin]] opines that excessive profanity, as a part of naturalistic dialogue, "dulls much modern fiction and too many films" and states it to be a pitfall for novice writers, or for writers who never grow up, to fall into.  He states that it is a "lazy copout that no longer frightens horses in the street, merely annoys and ultimately bores an intelligent reader".  He advises writers that "less is more", and that if it really is the right thing for a character to be salty, it should be made clear to the reader why, observing as an example that in his science fiction novel ''Limbo Search'' the profanity used by character Janice Tyne is a symptom of her fear and tension, caused by being burned out at age 27 and afraid of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Portable Writer's Conference|editor=Stephen Blake Mettee|chapter=Listen!|author=[[Parke Godwin]]|publisher=Quill Driver Books|year=2006|isbn= 978-1-884956-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanda Raiford observes that the use of the nonce word ''[[Frak (expletive)|frak]]'' in both ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series is "an indispensable part of the naturalistic tone that show strives to achieve", noting that it, and ''toaster'' (a [[racial epithet]] for [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]]s), allow the show to use obscene and racialist dialogue that no real-life educated American adult would consider using the real-life equivalents of in polite company.  She compares the racial hatred associated with the use of ''[[wikt:nigger|nigger]]'' (an utterance of which she states to have preceded and accompanied "every lynching of a black person in America") to the racial hatred of the Cylons, by the humans, that the use of such phrases as ''frakking toasters'' indicates in the series.  She also observes that several of the characters, including [[Gaius Baltar]], are ''frakking toaster lovers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Boundaries in Political Science Fiction|editor1=Donald M. Hassler |editor2=Clyde Wilcox |chapter=Race, Robots, and the Law|author=Wanda Raiford|pages=106|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-57003-736-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series of [[Star Trek: New Frontier]] novels by [[Peter David]], the principal protagonist, Captain Mackenzie Calhoun, frequently utters the word ''grozit'', a curse from his home world of Xenex. It is understood to be the equivalent to ''shit''.

The 2005 video game ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'' also used ''fierfek'', the expletive popular in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.  This word is described [[in-universe]] as being an alien loan-word originally meaning 'poison', but has been adopted by the game's [[special forces]] [[protagonists]] as a curse word to make the illusion of playing as [[commandos]] more believable.

==Fictional profanities==
Profanity in SF also encompasses the idea of things that ''alien cultures'' might find profane, and the notion that what non-humans and humans find to be profane may differ markedly. Card observes that human profanity encompasses words dealing with sexual intercourse and states that that tells one something about human beings. He proceeds to suggest that what aliens might find to be profane can be a useful tool for suggesting the alienness of a culture. The first example of this that he gives are alien cultures that have no trouble with words about sexual intercourse, but that find words to do with ''eating'' to be profane.&lt;ref name=OSC1 /&gt; ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' made use of this concept in the episode "[[Vox Sola]]".&lt;ref name="Vox_Sola"&gt;[http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/episodes/ent1a.htm Ex Astris Scientia], Enterprise Episodes, Season 2&lt;/ref&gt; The second example Card provides is that of alien cultures where the idea of [[ownership|property ownership]] is considered to be as obscene as [[pederasty]].&lt;ref name=OSC1 /&gt; [[Douglas Adams]]'s ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' at one point mentions that the word [[Belgium]] is the worst profanity in the galaxy.

==In other contexts==
As mentioned above, ''shazbot'' briefly enjoyed popular usage outside of its television show.&lt;ref name=EFFL/&gt; ''Battlestar Galactica''{{'}}s ''frak'', a word that [[Lee Goldberg]] characterizes as "something truly amazing and subversive" and that [[Scott Adams]] calls "pure genius", has also escaped its original context. Originally spelled ''frack'', it along with ''felgercarb'' were coined by writer [[Glen A. Larson]] for the 1978 ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', for much the same reasons that ''frell'' and ''dren'' were coined for ''Farscape'': the ability to use profane dialogue, with words that would be immediately understood as synonymous with the real profanities that they stood in for, without falling foul of network censorship and broadcasting restrictions accompanying its original Sunday evening broadcast timeslot.&lt;ref name=Talbott2008/&gt;

The producers re-spelled the word ''frak'' for the 2004 ''Battlestar Galactica'' series, in order to make it, literally, a [[four-letter word]];&lt;ref name=Talbott2008/&gt; the word appears in several [[Black Library]] novels before then, most notably the [[Ciaphas Cain]] series.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} It has escaped, in both forms, from the series to a whole variety of other contexts, from a ''[[Dilbert]]'' cartoon strip where [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] mutters it, through other television shows including ''[[The Office]]'', ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'', and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', and [[Robert Crais]]' [[Elvis Cole]] novel ''Chasing Darkness'', to everyday spoken use.&lt;ref name=Talbott2008/&gt;

The [[BBC Two]] [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' replaces most of its characters' profanities with invented terms, mainly ''[[smeg (vulgarism)|smeg]]'' (possibly a truncation of ''[[smegma]]'') and its compound ''smeg-head''.  Other common insults are ''goit'' and ''gimboid''.

== Footnotes ==
*{{note|1|frell}} Battis has lot to say on Aeryn Sun's use of "frell" here, in terms of its status as a non-performative utterance, and the locutionary and perlocutionary power of the statement.  For more detail, see pages 146 et seq. of Battis 2007.&lt;ref name=Battis1 /&gt;

'''Project Eden''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] research and development [[private corporation]], which designs products for seniors with [[arthritis]]. Its primary product is the ‘’’Edex’'', a [[writing implement]] which reduces movements traditionally associated with writing. Project Eden was founded in [[Waterloo, Ontario]] and is currently headquartered in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. Its products are currently manufactured by

== History ==

Project Eden was founded by a group of entrepreneurs in the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Kitchener-Waterloo]] region of [[Ontario]]. Though founded in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], it later relocated to [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. Although it manufactured the first series of Edex writers in house, it later outsourced this work to a company in the [[Greater Toronto Area]].

== Products ==

Project Eden’s main product, the Edex, is a finger mounted writing aid designed to meet the needs of the arthritic population, most of whom are [[Baby boomer|Baby Boomers]]. This target population often find their writing abilities restricted due to pain and frustration, which can be attenuated by the Edex.

The Edex is made of a pair of padded aluminum loops which fit around the index and middle fingers. Any [[writing instrument]] that is attached to the device can be operated with minimal finger movement, allowing the hand to remain close to its rest position. This reduces the problems faced by arthritic seniors when trying to write.

While other products by Project Eden are available in the market, or in the process of being launched, Project Eden has also invested in the research and development of other products for arthritic seniors.

'''Rama''' is one of the [[indigenous language]]s of the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan family]] spoken by the [[Rama (people)|Rama people]] on the island of [[Rama Cay]] and south of lake [[Bluefields]] on the Caribbean coast of [[Nicaragua]].  Other indigenous languages of this region include [[Miskito language|Miskito]] and [[Sumo language|Sumu]] {{Harvcol|Craig|1992}}.  Rama is one of the northernmost languages of the Chibchan family {{Harvcol|Craig|1990|p=293}}.

The Rama language is severely [[endangered language|endangered]]. Their language was described as "dying quickly for lack of use" as early as the 1860s {{Harvcol|Pim|Seemann|1869|p=280}}. By 1980, the Rama were noted as having "all but lost their original ethnic language", and had become speakers of a form of [[English-based creole languages|English creole]] instead {{Harvcol|Craig|1990|p=293}}. In 1992, only approximately 36 fluent speakers could be found among an ethnic population of 649 individuals in 1992 {{Harvcol|Craig|1992}}. The number of speakers on [[Rama Cay]] island was only 4 in 1992. There have been several language revitalization efforts. The fieldwork for the first dictionary of Rama was done during this time by Robin Schneider, a graduate student from the [[University of Berlin]] {{Harvcol|Rigby|Schneider|1989}}.It is spoken in Honduras and Nicaragua

== Phonology ==
There are three basic vowel sounds: ''a, i'' and ''u''. In addition to these, ''e'' and ''o'' have been introduced as distinct vowels in some foreign loanwords. Each vowel may be either short or long. Here the vowels are shown in standard Rama orthography
(see for example {{Harvcolnb|Craig|Rigby|Assadi|Tibbitts|1988}}):

Rama words have non-predictable stress.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann's vocabulary {{Harvcol|Lehmann|1914}} indicates stress; modern standard spelling does not.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonotactics and sandhi ===
Rama [[phonotactics]] includes notable consonant clusters at the beginning of words (e.g. {{lang|rma|psaarik|italic=yes}} "toucan", {{lang|rma|tkua|italic=yes}} "hot", {{lang|rma|nkiikna|italic=yes}} "man", {{lang|rma|mlingu|italic=yes}} "killed") and word-internally (e.g. {{lang|rma|alkwsi|italic=yes}} "speaks", {{lang|rma|salpka|italic=yes}} "fish"). Variations among speakers witness a tendency to simplify such clusters (e.g. {{lang|rma|nkiikna|italic=yes}} or {{lang|rma|kiikna|italic=yes}} "man", {{lang|rma|nsu-|italic=yes}} or {{lang|rma|su-|italic=yes}} "we, us, our").

Such clusters often arise due to a tendency to omit unstressed short vowels. For example, when the third person singular subject prefix ''i-'' and the past tense suffix ''-u'' are added to the verb stem {{lang|rma|kwis|italic=yes}} "eat", thus: ''i-'' + {{lang|rma|kwis|italic=yes}} + ''-u'', the verb stem loses its only vowel, resulting in the form {{lang|rma|ikwsu|italic=yes}} "he/she/it ate". Sometimes omitting different vowels may lead to alternative results. Adding the past tense suffix ''-u'' to the verb stem {{lang|rma|maling|italic=yes}} "kill", i.e. {{lang|rma|maling|italic=yes}} + ''-u'', may give either {{lang|rma|mlingu|italic=yes}} or {{lang|rma|malngu|italic=yes}} "killed".

There are also cases of vowel alternation in morphemes (e.g. the first-person subject prefix may appear as ''n-, ni-'' or ''na-'') and lexical stems (thus the stem {{lang|rma|aakar|italic=yes}} "stay" may appear in the forms ''aak'''i'''r-i'' "stays" and ''aaik'''u'''r-u'' "stayed", where the short stem vowel copies the vowel of the suffix).

Consonants display a degree of [[sandhi]]-type alternation, as seen for example in the final consonant of the same stem {{lang|rma|aakar|italic=yes}} "stay, be", cf. the imperative {{lang|rma|aaki'''t'''|italic=yes}} "stay!". This latter variant is found both word-final and before a suffix beginning with a consonant (e.g. {{lang|rma|aaki'''t'''-ka|italic=true}} "if there is").

== Grammar ==
In terms of grammatical typology Rama may be considered a fairly "normal" language for the linguistic area within which it is located, despite the lack of close genetic ties with its immediate neighbours. For example, Rama shares some general typological features with [[Miskito language|Miskito]], a dominant contact language, displaying many characteristics typical of SOV languages (even though not all sentences are actually verb-final). A single set of prefixes serves to express both pronominal possessors (e.g. ''n-''{{lang|rma|up|italic=yes}} "my eye") and subjects (e.g. ''n-''{{lang|rma|taaku|italic=yes}} "I went"). Noun phrase relations are indicated by postpositions, tense and [[subordination (linguistics)|subordination]] by verbal suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;Sources for the information in this section include {{Harvcolnb|Craig|1991}}, {{Harvcolnb|Craig|Rigby|Assadi|Tibbitts|1988}}, {{Harvcolnb|Lehmann|1914}} and {{Harvcolnb|Rigby|Craig|Tibbitts|1989}}, and also the Rama texts in {{Harvcolnb|Craig|Tibbits|Rigby|1986}} and {{Harvcolnb|Craig|Tibbits|Rigby|Benjamins|1992}}. There are some notable differences between the earlier and more recent descriptions; cf. {{Harvcolnb|Craig|1991}}: "The discrepancy between the earlier data and that which are presented here begs the question of whether it is due to the way the data were gathered, or whether it is an indication of linguistic change, or both." For practical reasons and coherence, the present sketch focuses on the recent data found in the materials produced by the present language recovery movement.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noun phrase ===

==== Elements of the noun phrase ====
There are no articles. Nouns are frequently undetermined, e.g. {{lang|rma|Pkaak tkii su itraali|italic=yes}} "(The) lizard walks on (the) ground" (literally: lizard ground on (s)he-walks), {{lang|rma|Salpka sauk u ikuu|italic=true}} "He/she caught (a) fish with (a) hook" (fish hook with (s)he-caught).

Demonstrative determiners precede the noun: {{lang|rma|'''ning''' nguu|italic=yes}} "'''this''' house", {{lang|rma|'''naming''' tausung|italic=yes}} "'''that''' dog". Quantifiers follow the noun: {{lang|rma|tausung '''saiming'''|italic=yes}} "'''one''' dog", {{lang|rma|puus '''puksak'''|italic=yes}} "'''two''' cats",&lt;ref&gt;The earliest studies of the Rama language, for example {{Harvcolnb|Lehmann|1911}}, mistakenly identified it as having [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]]; this was later demonstrated to be untrue {{Harvcol|Craig|2000|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|rma|nguu '''ngarak'''|italic=true}} "'''many''' houses", {{lang|rma|tamaaski '''ui'''|italic=true}} "'''every''' morning", {{lang|rma|kaulingdut '''umling'''|italic=true}} "'''all''' the people", {{lang|rma|tausung '''saina'''|italic=true}} "the '''other''' dog, '''another''' dog".

Most nouns do not change for [[grammatical number|number]], but those denoting humans can take the plural suffix {{lang|rma|-dut|italic=true}} or {{lang|rma|-lut|italic=true}}, as in {{lang|rma|kiikna'''dut'''|italic=true}} "men", {{lang|rma|kumaa'''lut'''|italic=true}} "women", {{lang|rma|tiiskama'''lut'''|italic=true}} "children", etc.

Attributive adjectives follow the noun they qualify: {{lang|rma|salpka '''taara'''|italic=true}} "(a/the) '''big''' fish".

==== Possession ====
Inalienable pronominal possession, found with body parts and characteristics, is expressed by prefixes attached to the possessed noun: {{lang|rma|'''n'''up|italic=true}} "'''my''' eye", {{lang|rma|'''y'''ausa|italic=true}} "'''his/her''' strength", {{lang|rma|'''nsu'''suluk|italic=true}} "'''our''' fingers".&lt;ref&gt;There may have been variation over time as to which nouns are treated as inalienable. For example, in modern sources {{lang|rma|maing aak|italic=true}} "your name" is found, with {{lang|rma|aak|italic=true}} treated as alienable, but {{Harvcolnb|Lehmann|1914}} has {{lang|rma|maak|italic=true}} "your name".&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases (including kinship relations), a genitive pronoun (formed from the pronominal prefix + {{lang|rma|-aing|italic=true}}) precedes the possessed noun, e.g. {{lang|rma|'''naing''' puus / nguu / aak / tiiskama / taata / tairung|italic=true}} "'''my''' cat / house / name / child / father / sister", {{lang|rma|'''maing''' kaulingdut|italic=true}} "your family (lit. your people)", {{lang|rma|'''yaing''' aak|italic=true}} "'''his/her''' name", {{lang|rma|'''nsulaing''' rama kuup|italic=true}} "'''our''' Rama language".

The forms {{lang|rma|naing, maing, yaing|italic=true}} etc. also function predicatively (as equivalents of English possessive pronouns), as in {{lang|rma|Naming puus '''naing'''|italic=true}} "That cat is '''mine'''".

Nominal possession is expressed by two constructions: possessor + possessed (i.e. simple juxtaposition), e.g. {{lang|rma|naing taata aak|italic=true}} "my father's name" (my father name), and possessor + {{lang|rma|aing|italic=true}} + possessed ({{lang|rma|aing|italic=true}} being a genitive postposition), e.g. {{lang|rma|Nora '''aing''' nguu|italic=true}} "Nora's house".

==== Pronouns ====
Personal pronouns have free (independent) and bound (prefix) forms as in the following table. The third person singular bound form is ''i-'' before a consonant or ''y-'' before a vowel.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" width="40%"
|+ Personal pronouns
!
! Independent
! Prefix
|-
! I, me
| {{lang|rma|naas, na|italic=true}}
| ''n-''
|-

| {{lang|rma|maa|italic=true}}
| ''m-''
|-
! he/him, she/her, it
| {{lang|rma|yaing|italic=true}}

|-

| {{lang|rma|mlut|italic=true}}
| ''m- -lut''
|-
! they, them
| {{lang|rma|anut|italic=true}}
| ''an-''
|}

The independent pronouns are often used as subjects: {{lang|rma|'''Nah''' tawan ki aakar|italic=true}} "'''I''' live in Bluefields" (I town in stay), {{lang|rma|'''Maa''' kalma apaakut?|italic=true}} "Can '''you''' sew a dress?" (you dress sew-IRREALIS), {{lang|rma|'''Yaing''' taaki|italic=true}} "'''He/She''' is going". They may also be complements of postpositions: {{lang|rma|Naing airung ning nguu ki aakar '''nah''' u|italic=true}} "My mother lives in this house with '''me'''" (my mother this house in stay I with), {{lang|rma|'''maa''' kang|italic=true}} "from '''you'''", {{lang|rma|Walsa '''anut''' su tabiu|italic=true}} "The tiger came out at '''them'''" (tiger they at came-out). Note that ''-ut'' changes to ''-ul'' before a vowel, for example in {{lang|rma|nsul u|italic=true}} "with us".

The prefix forms of the pronouns are used as subject prefixes with verbs: {{lang|rma|Neli aa '''ni'''tangu|italic=true}} "I gave it to Nelly" (Nelly OBJECT I-gave), {{lang|rma|Tamaik suulikaas '''ni'''aukut|italic=true}} "Tomorrow I will cook some meat" (tomorrow meat I-will-cook), {{lang|rma|Taa u '''m'''taaku?|italic=true}} "With whom did you go?" (who with you-went), {{lang|rma|'''I'''taaku|italic=true}} "he/she went", {{lang|rma|Ipang su '''an'''siiku|italic=true}} "'''They''' came to the island" (island in they-came). In the second person plural, ''m-'' is prefixed and ''-lut'' suffixed to the verb.

Subject prefixes are omitted when the subject is represented by an independent pronoun: "I am going" is either {{lang|rma|Nah taaki|italic=true}} or {{lang|rma|Ntaaki|italic=true}}, "He is going" is either {{lang|rma|Yaing taaki|italic=true}} or {{lang|rma|Itaaki|italic=true}}, etc. They are also commonly absent in the presence of a full subject noun phrase: {{lang|rma|Naing taata taaki|italic=true}} "My father is going", but "repetition" of the subject is also possible: {{lang|rma|Pkaak tkii su itraali|italic=true}} "The lizard (he) walks on the ground" (lizard ground on it-walks).

A pronominal object is expressed by adding the postposition ''aa'' to the pronouns, which adopt the prefix form in the singular but the full form in the plural: {{lang|rma|naa, maa, yaa|italic=true}} but {{lang|rma|nsula|italic=true}} (for {{lang|rma|nsut + -a|italic=true}}) etc. But third person objects are commonly zero-marked, that is, the absence of an overt object of a transitive verb implies an understood "him", "her" or "it", e.g. ''Anangsku'' "They cleaned it" (lit. they-cleaned).

The demonstrative pronouns are the same as the corresponding determiners: {{lang|rma|ning|italic=true}} "this", {{lang|rma|naming|italic=true}} "that", as in {{lang|rma|Ning naing nguu|italic=true}} "This is my house".

The interrogative pronouns are {{lang|rma|niku|italic=true}} "what", {{lang|rma|taa|italic=true}} "who", as in {{lang|rma|Niku maing aak?|italic=true}} "What is your name?", {{lang|rma|Taa rama kuup alkwsi?|italic=true}} "Who speaks Rama?" (who Rama language speaks), {{lang|rma|Taa u mtaaku?|italic=true}} "With whom did you go?" (who with you-went).

==== Postpositions ====
Rama [[postpositions]] perform roughly the same functions as English prepositions, as in {{lang|rma|tkii '''su'''|italic=true}} "'''on''' the ground", {{lang|rma|tawan '''ki'''|italic=true}} "'''in''' (the) town", {{lang|rma|nah '''u'''|italic=true}} "'''with''' me", {{lang|rma|nguu '''aing'''|italic=true}} "'''of''' the house", etc.

Postpositional phrases may occur either before or after the verb. Some postpositions have a shorter and a longer form; following the verb the long forms are used, e.g. {{lang|rma|Nangalbiu naing taata '''kang'''|italic=true}} "I ran away from my father" (I-ran my father from) but before the verb the short forms are more usual: {{lang|rma|Naing taata '''ka''' nangalbiu|italic=true}} (my father from I-ran).

|-
| colspan=2|{{lang|rma|u|italic=true}}
| "with"
|}

Although {{lang|rma|aak|italic=true}} or {{lang|rma|aa|italic=true}} is given as an object marker, most objects (other than personal pronouns) take no postposition, e.g. {{lang|rma|Kruubu '''kiikna''' kwisu|italic=true}} "The tiger ate the man" (tiger man ate).

In addition to the simple postpositions there are more complex forms of the [[relational noun|relational]] type that express more specific relationships. These are composed of a noun-like lexical form followed by a postposition, such as {{lang|rma|psutki|italic=true}} "inside", {{lang|rma|karka|italic=true}} "out of". They are placed after a noun phrase, e.g. {{lang|rma|ngurii psutki|italic=true}} "inside the hole", or a postpositional phrase, e.g. {{lang|rma|ung su karka|italic=true}} "out of the pot" (literally: pot in out-from). Such expressions may also be used adverbially.

=== The verb ===

==== Overview ====
The simplest structure for verb forms consists of these elements:

# an optional '''subject prefix''' (already discussed above under Pronouns)
# the verb '''stem'''
# either a '''tense/mood''' suffix (or zero) or a '''subordination''' marker

e.g. {{lang|rma|Nah tawan ki '''aakar'''|italic=true}} "I live in Bluefields" (no subject prefix and no tense suffix), {{lang|rma|Yaing '''taak-i'''|italic=true}} "He/She is going" (no subject prefix, present tense suffix), {{lang|rma|Taa u '''m-taak-u'''?|italic=true}} "With whom did you go?" (second person subject prefix, past tense suffix), {{lang|rma|Suulikaas '''ni-auk-ut'''|italic=true}} "I will cook some meat" (first person subject prefix, future/irrealis suffix), {{lang|rma|kruubu '''an-sung-ka'''|italic=true}} "when they see the tiger" (third person plural subject prefix, "when" subordinator), {{lang|rma|Nah suulikaas baalpi '''ni-paya-kama'''|italic=true}} "I am looking for meat to buy" (first person singular subject prefix, purpose subordinator).

This basic structure may be expanded by adding other elements, including aspect markers (which come between the stem and the tense/mood suffix) and preverbs (which precede the subject prefix, if present). More complex meanings can be expressed through the use of serial verb constructions.

==== Tense/mood and subordinator suffixes ====
Most verb forms end in a suffix such as one of the following which either specifies a tense (or a mood) or else signals a subordinate clause:&lt;ref&gt;The table does not aim to be exhaustive but covers the most basic options.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" width="60%"

|}

Use of one of the subordinator suffixes constitutes the main subordination strategy. Since these suffixes occupy the same place as the tense suffixes, the resulting subordinate clauses are tenseless, in this respect resembling non-finite clauses in European languages. Nonetheless, Rama verb forms with subordinators take subject prefixes under the same basic conditions as tensed ones, and in this way resemble finite forms.

Examples with {{lang|rma|siik|italic=true}} "come": {{lang|rma|nsiiki|italic=true}} "I am coming", {{lang|rma|nsiiku|italic=true}} "I came", {{lang|rma|nsiikut|italic=true}} "I will come", {{lang|rma|nsiikbang|italic=true}} "for me to come", {{lang|rma|nsiikka|italic=true}} "when I come", {{lang|rma|nsiikkata|italic=true}} "if I come" etc.

In some cases the lack of any suffix signals a lack of marked tense or a habitual sense: compare {{lang|rma|Ntaakkama '''aakari'''|italic=true}} "I am ready to go" (now) with {{lang|rma|Nah tawan ki '''aakar'''}} "I live in the town". Imperatives in the second person singular are also suffixless, e.g. {{lang|rma|Siik!}} "Come!" One verb, {{lang|rma|taak}} "go", has a suppletive imperative {{lang|rma|mang!}} or {{lang|rma|bang!}} "go!".

Sometimes forms with the ''-bang'' suffix are used in independent clauses: see the section on Aspect below.

==== Aspect ====
Using the simple past tense of {{lang|rma|kwis|italic=true}} "eat", the sentence {{lang|rma|Kruubu kiikna kwisu|italic=true}} means "The tiger ate the man", but the "manner of eating" may be specified further to express completion of the action by adding to the stem {{lang|rma|kwis|italic=true}} the aspect marker {{lang|rma|-atkul|italic=true}}, giving {{lang|rma|Kruubu kiikna kwisatkulu|italic=true}} "The tiger ate the man all up". Further examples with {{lang|rma|-atkul-|italic=true}} are: {{lang|rma|Dor yakaangatkulu|italic=true}} "He/she shut the door tight" ({{lang|rma|akaang|italic=true}} "close") and {{lang|rma|Paalpa ansungatkulu|italic=true}} "They saw the whole manatee" ({{lang|rma|sung|italic=true}} "see"). Another aspect-marking suffix similarly used is {{lang|rma|-atkar|italic=true}} ({{lang|rma|-itkr-|italic=true}}) expressing repetition.

A range of further aspectual nuances may be conveyed by a variety of periphrastic constructions. Several of these involve the verb {{lang|rma|aakar|italic=true}} "stay" or its derivative {{lang|rma|baakar|italic=true}} (which contains the preverb {{lang|rma|ba-|italic=true}}), either of which, following a verb stem, may convey progressive aspect: {{lang|rma|Nah paun baakiri|italic=true}} "I am crying" ({{lang|rma|paun|italic=true}} "cry"; the second vowel in {{lang|rma|aakar|italic=true}} can copy the vowel of the suffix). {{lang|rma|Baakar|italic=true}} can also express "be about to (do something)".

The suffix {{lang|rma|-bang|italic=true}} (see also above) may express intention, as in {{lang|rma|Tiiskama nitanangbang|italic=true}} "I am going to look at the baby" ({{lang|rma|tanang|italic=true}} "look at"), and in first person plural imperatives (i.e. "let's..."), as in {{lang|rma|Nsukamibang!|italic=true}} "Let's sleep!" ({{lang|rma|kami|italic=true}} "sleep"). In the latter use the subject prefix may be omitted, e.g. {{lang|rma|Rama kuup alkwisbang!|italic=true}} "Let's speak Rama!" ({{lang|rma|alkwis|italic=true}} "speak").

A form related to {{lang|rma|bang|italic=true}}, {{lang|rma|bating|italic=true}}, means "want" with a nominal object, as in {{lang|rma|Sumuu ibatingi|italic=true}} "He/she wants a banana", but with verbal complements means "be going to (do something)" in the simple form, as in {{lang|rma|Itraat batingi|italic=true}} "He/she is going to walk" ({{lang|rma|traat|italic=true}} "walk"), or "get ready to (do something)" in the progressive {{lang|rma|baakar|italic=true}} construction, as in {{lang|rma|Nalngu bating baakiri|italic=true}} "I get ready to drink" ({{lang|rma|alngu|italic=true}} "drink").

Another periphrasis, constructed with {{lang|rma|aakar|italic=true}} following the subordinate form in {{lang|rma|-kama|italic=true}} of the main verb, expresses "be ready to (do something)", e.g. {{lang|rma|Ntaakkama aakari|italic=true}} "I am ready to go" ({{lang|rma|taak|italic=true}} "go").

One other means of expressing aspectual (or mood) nuances is provided by the use of a second set of emphatic tense suffixes which replace the simple suffixes, namely {{lang|rma|-aing|italic=true}} emphatic affirmative, {{lang|rma|-uing|italic=true}} habitual past and {{lang|rma|-uting|italic=true}} emphatic future.

==== Modality ====
Modal notions are expressed by further periphrastic constructions. A verb with the {{lang|rma|-kama|italic=true}} suffix may be used in an independent clause to convey obligation: {{lang|rma|Tiiskiba umling '''taakkama''' skuul ki|italic=true}} "All the children must go to school". {{lang|rma|Ikar|italic=true}} is used as a modal auxiliary of volition, as in {{lang|rma|Nah rama kuup larn tang ikri|italic=true}} "I want to learn Rama" ({{lang|rma|larn tang|italic=true}} "learn"). Ability may be expressed by the future/irrealis tense form in {{lang|rma|-ut|italic=true}}, e.g. {{lang|rma|Maa kalma apaakut?|italic=true}} "Will/can you sew a dress?" Inability is expressed by the negator {{lang|rma|angka|italic=true}} preceding the complete verb, e.g. {{lang|rma|Nah rama kuup angka alkwsi|italic=true}} "I cannot speak Rama".

==== Preverbs ====
Rama has [[preverb]]s which form constructions comparable to English [[phrasal verb]]s such as "run ''away''", "come ''over''", "carry ''on''" etc. The Rama preverbs resemble some of the postpositions in form: they are {{lang|rma|ba-, yu-, ka-, su-|italic=true}} and {{lang|rma|yaa-|italic=true}}. Like English phrasal verbs, the meanings and uses of Rama preverb constructions can be quite idiomatic and unpredictable. Preverbs precede the subject prefix if present: {{lang|rma|'''Ka'''nangalbiu|italic=true}} "I ran away from (him/her)" ({{lang|rma|ngalbi|italic=true}} "run" with the preverb {{lang|rma|ka-|italic=true}} "from": {{lang|rma|-na-|italic=true}} is the subject prefix). {{lang|rma|Ngulkang tawan ki '''yu'''ansiiku|italic=true}} "They brought the wild pig to the town" ({{lang|rma|yu-siik|italic=true}} "come with, i.e. bring"). {{lang|rma|Tiiskama taa '''yu'''taaku?|italic=true}} "Who took the child?" ({{lang|rma|yu-taak|italic=true}} "go with, i.e. take").

While many preverb-verb combinations are lexically specified, {{lang|rma|yu-|italic=true}} may also be used productively to express an instrumental argument, e.g. {{lang|rma|Nainguku kiskis nsukuaakari, suulikaas '''yu'''nsuaukkama|italic=true}} "That's why we have tongs, in order to roast meat with (them)" (therefore tongs we-have, meat for-we-roast-with).

==== Serial verbs ====
A limited range of serial-type constructions are found. A notable case of this is the use of the verb {{lang|rma|traal|italic=true}} "walk" following another verb, as in: {{lang|rma|Ipang ika kiikna paalpa baanalpi '''traali''' lakun aik|italic=true}} "Men of Rama Cay go to look for manatee in the lagoon" (island from man manatee they-seek walk lagoon side). The morphological analysis of {{lang|rma|baanalpi traali|italic=true}} "they go to look for" is: {{lang|rma|ba-an-alpi traal-i|italic=true}} (PREVERB-they-seek walk-PRESENT).

=== The sentence ===

==== 'Be' and 'have' ====
Noun and adjective predicates are constructed without a copula, in the order Subject + Predicate, e.g. {{lang|rma|Ning naing nguu|italic=true}} "This is my house" (this my house), {{lang|rma|Yaing aak Basilio|italic=true}} "His name is Basilio" (his name Basilio), {{lang|rma|Paalpa suuli taara|italic=true}} "The manatee is a big animal" (manatee animal big), {{lang|rma|Naing nguu aakwaala|italic=true}} "My house is pretty" (my house pretty); so also {{lang|rma|Naming puus naing|italic=true}} "That cat is mine" and {{lang|rma|Naing puus suuk mlingkama|italic=true}} "My cat is for killing rats". The Subject + Predicate order is inverted in a question such as {{lang|rma|Niku yaing aak?|italic=true}} "What is his name?"

The verb {{lang|rma|aakar|italic=true}} "stay" is used to express "be (in a place)" and "be (in a state)", as in {{lang|rma|Skuul saud aap su aakar|italic=true}} "The school is on the south side" (school south side in stay), {{lang|rma|Nah mliika aakar|italic=true}} "I am fine" (I well stay). {{lang|rma|Aakar|italic=true}} can also mean "live (in a place)" as in {{lang|rma|Nah ipang su aakar|italic=true}} "I live on Rama Cay" (I island in stay), and "there is" as in {{lang|rma|Nguu ngarak ipang su aakar|italic=true}} "There are many houses on Rama Cay" (house many island in stay).

The verb {{lang|rma|kuaakar|italic=true}} (or {{lang|rma|kwaakar|italic=true}}) means "have", e.g. {{lang|rma|Nah nising puksak kuaakar|italic=true}} "I have two sisters" (I sister two have), {{lang|rma|Nainguku kiskis nsukuaakari|italic=true}} "That's why we have tongs", {{lang|rma|Puupu kwiik ngarak ikuaakari|italic=true}} "The octopus has many arms".

==== Word order with verbal predicates ====
In sentences with a verb as predicate, the basic order is:
* SV if intransitive, e.g. {{lang|rma|Sukmurk tkari|italic=true}} "The frog jumps", {{lang|rma|Nah paun baakiri|italic=true}} "I am crying" (I cry AUXILIARY), {{lang|rma|Naing tiiskama almlingi|italic=true}} "My child is sick" (my child is-sick)
* SOV if transitive (assuming that both arguments are present as noun phrases in the utterance), e.g. {{lang|rma|Kruubu kiikna kwisu|italic=true}} "The tiger ate the man" (tiger man ate), {{lang|rma|Nora rama kuup alkwsi|italic=true}} "Nora speaks Rama" (Nora Rama language speaks), ''Nah tausung saiming kuaakar'' "I have one dog" (I dog one have).
Other sentence elements (in bold here) may be placed:
* in front of the verb: {{lang|rma|Pkaak '''tkii su''' itraali|italic=true}} "The lizard walks '''on the ground'''", {{lang|rma|Tulkumas '''ituk u''' naayarnguli|italic=true}} "The scorpion bites '''with its tail'''", {{lang|rma|'''Ipang su''' ansiiku|italic=true}} "They came '''to the island'''", {{lang|rma|Nguu ngarak '''ipang su''' aakar|italic=true}} "There are many houses '''on the island'''", {{lang|rma|'''Nah u''' alkwis!|italic=true}} "Speak '''with me'''!", {{lang|rma|Nah '''yaabra aap su''' aapunu|italic=true}} "I grew up '''on the south side'''", {{lang|rma|Naas '''sii ba''' taak ikar|italic=true}} "I don't want to go '''for water'''", {{lang|rma|Salpka taara '''sauk u''' ikuu|italic=true}} "He caught a big fish '''with a hook'''", {{lang|rma|Kruubu '''tamaaski ui''' tabii|italic=true}} "The tiger came out '''every morning'''".
* at the end of the sentence (i.e. after the verb): {{lang|rma|Nsut rama larn tangi '''Nora u'''|italic=true}} "We are learning Rama '''with Nora'''", {{lang|rma|Naing airung ning nguu ki aakar '''nah u'''|italic=true}} "My mother lives in this house '''with me'''", {{lang|rma|Nkiikna ngulkang malngi '''twiis u'''|italic=true}} "The man kills the wari '''with a lance'''", {{lang|rma|Maa kalma apaakut '''naing isii'''?|italic=true}} "Can you sew a dress '''like mine'''?", {{lang|rma|Naing taata ngabang yuisiiku '''nguu ki'''|italic=true}} "My father brings the silkgrass '''into the house'''", {{lang|rma|kiskis yuisiikka '''nguu ki'''|italic=true}} "when he brings the tongs '''into the house'''", {{lang|rma|yupsi tabii '''ung su karka'''|italic=true}} "when the oil comes '''out of the pot'''".
* or at the beginning of the sentence: {{lang|rma|'''Ipang su''' nah maktungu|italic=true}} "I was born '''on Rama Cay'''", {{lang|rma|'''Ngurii psutki''' yaing tiiskama yuitaaki|italic=true}} "She took the child '''inside the hole'''", {{lang|rma|'''Ung ariis ba''' upsi ankai|italic=true}} "They put the oil '''in the empty pot'''", {{lang|rma|'''Tamaik''' suulikaas niaukut|italic=true}} "'''Tomorrow''' I will cook meat".
Clausal elements (i.e. those containing a verb) usually follow the main verb, e.g. {{lang|rma|Nah taaki '''ai nipiabang'''|italic=true}} "I am going '''to plant corn'''", {{lang|rma|Nah suulikaas baalpi '''nipayakama'''|italic=true}} "I am looking for meat '''to buy'''", {{lang|rma|Mliika anaakar '''paalpa analkuka'''|italic=true}} "They are happy '''when they hear about the manatee'''".

==== Questions ====
Yes/no questions take the same form as the corresponding statement, e.g. {{lang|rma|Maing nguu taara?|italic=true}} "Is your house big?", {{lang|rma|Maa ipang su aakar?|italic=true}} "Do you live on Rama Cay?", {{lang|rma|Maa rama kuup alkwsi?|italic=true}} "Do you speak Rama?", {{lang|rma|Maa nising kuaakar?|italic=true}} "Have you a sister?", {{lang|rma|Maa kalma apaakut naing isii?|italic=true}} "Can you sew a dress like mine?" Such questions may be answered using {{lang|rma|Aha|italic=true}} "Yes" or {{lang|rma|Mahaling|italic=true}} "No".

Some question words (sometimes called wh-words):

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" width="40%"
|+ Some question words
! rowspan=2|Pronouns
| {{lang|rma|niku|italic=true}}
| "what"
|-
| {{lang|rma|taa|italic=true}}
| "who"
|-
! rowspan=2|Adverbs
| {{lang|rma|ngarangki, ngarangsu|italic=true}}
| "where"
|-
| {{lang|rma|niika bii|italic=true}}
| "how"
|}

Question words may be preceded by another sentence constituent as topic, e.g. {{lang|rma|Tiiskama '''taa''' yutaaku?|italic=true}} "Who took the child?" (child who took), {{lang|rma|Maa, '''ngarangki''' aakar?|italic=true}} "And you, where do you live?" (you, where live).

However, question words generally stand at the beginning of the sentence: {{lang|rma|'''Ngarangki''' maa aakar?|italic=true}} "Where do you live?" (where you live), {{lang|rma|'''Ngarangki''' ngulkang aakar?|italic=true}} "Where does the wari live?" (where wari lives), {{lang|rma|'''Ngarangki''' Nora aing nguu aakar?|italic=true}} "Where is Nora's house?" (where Nora GENITIVE house stay), {{lang|rma|'''Ngarangsu''' yaing taaki?|italic=true}} "Where is he/she going?" (where he/she goes), {{lang|rma|'''Ngarangsu''' yaing taata taaki?|italic=true}} "Where is his/her father going?" (where his/her father goes), {{lang|rma|'''Taa''' nsulaing rama kuup alkwsi?|italic=true}} "Who speaks our Rama language?" (who our Rama language speaks), {{lang|rma|'''Taa u''' mtaaku?|italic=true}} "With whom did you go?" (who with you-went).

Questions words with a non-verbal predicate: {{lang|rma|'''Niku''' maing aak?|italic=true}} "What is your name?", {{lang|rma|'''Niika bii''' maing kaulingdut?|italic=true}} "How is your family?"

==== Negation ====
Sentences may be negated by placing {{lang|rma|taama|italic=true}} after the verb or predicate, e.g. {{lang|rma|Nah ipang su aakar taama|italic=true}} "I do not live on Rama Cay", {{lang|rma|Maa rama kuup alkwsi taama|italic=true}} "You do not speak Rama", {{lang|rma|Naing nguu taara taama|italic=true}} "My house is not big", {{lang|rma|Naming tausung naing taama|italic=true}} "That dog is not mine", or by placing ''aa'' before the verb, e.g. {{lang|rma|Paalpa aa baanalpiu|italic=true}} "They didn't look for the manatee", {{lang|rma|Naas aa taak ikar|italic=true}} "I don't want to go".

There is a special negative word, {{lang|rma|angka|italic=true}}, to express impossibility, e.g. {{lang|rma|Nah angka aakar tawan ki|italic=true}} "I cannot live in Bluefields".

==== Coordination and subordination ====
Coordinating conjunctions: {{lang|rma|an|italic=true}} "and", {{lang|rma|barka|italic=true}} "but": {{lang|rma|Naing nising '''an''' naing tairung ning nguu ki aakar nah u|italic=true}} "My sister '''and''' my brother live in this house with me", {{lang|rma|Nah tausung saiming kuaakar '''an''' maa puus puksak kuaakar|italic=true}} "I have one dog '''and''' you have two cats", {{lang|rma|Naing nguu taara taama, '''barka''' aakwaala|italic=true}} "My house is not big, but it is pretty".

Subordinate clauses may be formed by means of subordinator suffixes as described above. Reported speech is formed by juxtaposition as in {{lang|rma|Anaapiu anaungi|italic=true}} "They found it, they say" ({{lang|rma|aapi|italic=true}} "find", {{lang|rma|aung|italic=true}} "say"). Relative clauses also have no specific subordinator but the clause marker {{lang|rma|kaing|italic=true}} may be employed, e.g. {{lang|rma|Suulikaas nipaayau kaing Neli aa nitangu|italic=true}} "The meat I bought, I gave it to Nelly" (meat I-bought {{lang|rma|kaing|italic=true}} Nelly OBJECT I-gave).

== Lexicon ==
Rama has borrowed words from Miskito (e.g. {{lang|rma|taara|italic=true}} "big"), English, Rama Cay Creole and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Words possibly borrowed from Miskito include some that Miskito ultimately borrowed from English, e.g. {{lang|rma|tawan|italic=true}} "town". There are probably also numerous Miskito calques in Rama, such as {{lang|rma|preya aing nguu|italic=true}} "church", cf. Miskito {{lang|rma|prias watla|italic=true}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides such loans, Rama has a primary lexicon of Chibchan origin, expanded through various word-formation processes.

Many verb stems are made up of extensions from primary roots by the addition of one of the prefixes {{lang|rma|al-|italic=true}} and {{lang|rma|aa-|italic=true}}, which often correlate with intransitive and transitive meanings respectively. Evident intransitive derivation with {{lang|rma|al-|italic=true}} is illustrated by the pairs {{lang|rma|maling|italic=true}} "kill" : {{lang|rma|almaling|italic=true}} "die", {{lang|rma|aark : alaark|italic=true}} "break (tr./intr.)" and {{lang|rma|auk : alauk|italic=true}} "roast (tr./intr.)", while other cases of outward resemblance are semantically opaque, e.g. {{lang|rma|kwis|italic=true}} "eat" and {{lang|rma|alkwis|italic=true}} "speak", or involve more complex relationships, e.g. {{lang|rma|aap|italic=true}} (i.e. {{lang|rma|aa- + p|italic=true}}) "find" and {{lang|rma|baalp|italic=true}} ({{lang|rma|ba-|italic=true}} [preverb] + {{lang|rma|al + p|italic=true}} "seek".

Verbs may be derived from other parts of speech by suffixing one of several verbal roots glossed as "do, make", such as {{lang|rma|-king, -ting|italic=true}} and {{lang|rma|-uung|italic=true}}.

A common adjective-forming suffix is {{lang|rma|-ba|italic=true}}, while the participial suffix {{lang|rma|-ima|italic=true}} gives rise to both adjectives and nouns.

Certain recurrent endings found in numerous noun stems appear to correspond to vague semantic classes. A notable example is {{lang|rma|-up|italic=true}}, which occurs as the last component in nouns many of which denote round objects, fruits or body parts. As an [[inalienable noun]] in its own right, {{lang|rma|-up|italic=true}} means "eye" or "seed".

Composition is another common way of forming nouns, as in {{lang|rma|suulikaas|italic=true}} "meat" (from {{lang|rma|suuli|italic=true}} "animal" + {{lang|rma|kaas|italic=true}} "flesh") or the inalienable noun {{lang|rma|-upulis|italic=true}} "eyelash" (from {{lang|rma|-up|italic=true}} "eye" + {{lang|rma|ulis|italic=true}} "hair").

New concepts can also be expressed syntactically, e.g. through genitive constructions such as {{lang|rma|preya aing nguu|italic=true}} "church" (lit. house of prayer), or through verbal paraphrase.

Partial or complete reduplication is seen in the forms of some words, including onomatopoeics such as {{lang|rma|tahtah|italic=true}} "dripping", animal names like {{lang|rma|ngaukngauk|italic=true}} "spider" or {{lang|rma|tkwustkwus|italic=true}} "rabbit", colour names and other descriptive adjectives such as {{lang|rma|nuknuknga|italic=true}} "yellow", {{lang|rma|ngarngaringba|italic=true}} "green", {{lang|rma|siksiknga|italic=true}} "speckled", {{lang|rma|kingkingma|italic=true}} "calm", and others, e.g. {{lang|rma|tiskitiski|italic=true}} "a little".

Some recorded words that were claimed to be from the [[Corobicí language]] are actually from a dialect of Rama spoken in the region of [[Upala]].&lt;ref&gt;Adolfo Constenla, ''Comparative Chibchan Phonology'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5229">'''Rumpology''', '''Asstrology''' or '''bottom reading''' is a [[pseudoscience]] akin to [[physiognomy]], performed by examining crevices, dimples, warts, moles and folds of a person's [[buttocks]] in much the same way a [[chirology|chirologist]] would read the palm of the [[hand]].&lt;ref name="skepdic2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/essays/rumpology4dummies.html|title=Rumplogy for Dummies|first=Robert Todd|last=Carrol|publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''rumpology'' is a [[neologism]]. The American astrologer [[Jackie Stallone]] claims that rumpology is known to have been practiced in ancient times by the [[Babylonia]]ns, the [[History of India|Indians]], and the [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],&lt;ref name="stallone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jacquelinestallone.com/rumps.html |title=Jacqueline Stallone's Rumpology Reports! |accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she provides no evidence for this claim. Stallone has been largely responsible for the supposed "revival" of rumpology in modern times.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Theory and practice==
Rumpologists have a variety of theories as to the meaning of different posterior characteristics. According to Stallone, the left and right buttocks reveal a person's past and future, respectively, although she has also commented that "The crack of your behind corresponds to the division of the two hemispheres of the brain".&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/1999/09/13/monnp/ |title=This is Sly's mom on crack |publisher=Salon.com |first=Amy |last=Reiter |date=September 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to blind German [[clairvoyant]] and rumpologist Ulf Beck, an "apple-shaped, muscular bottom indicates someone who is charismatic, dynamic, very confident and often creative. A person who enjoys life. A pear-shaped bottom suggests someone very steadfast, patient and down-to-earth."&lt;ref name="tatters"&gt;{{cite news |first= Nick |last= Tattersall |authorlink=  |title= Blind Psychic Gropes Buttocks to See Future |url= http://soundingcircle.com/newslog2.php/__show_article/_a000195-000303.htm |work= Sounding Circle |publisher= Reuters |id=  |pages=  |page=  |date= July 9, 2003 |accessdate= 2007-04-25 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070708231912/http://soundingcircle.com/newslog2.php/__show_article/_a000195-000303.htm |archivedate= July 8, 2007 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British people|British]] rumpologist Sam Amos also uses shape to diagnose personality,&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ass-tronomy|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/2507600/What-does-your-bum-shape-say-about-you-We-find-out.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=June 30, 2009|location=London|first=Kate|last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that "A round bottom indicates the person is open, happy and optimistic in life. However, a flat bottom suggests the person is rather vain and is negative and sad."&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Have a rumpologist read your bottom|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/lifestyle/article.html?Have_a_rumpologist_read_your_bottom&amp;in_article_id=459128&amp;in_page_id=194|date=January 5, 2009|publisher=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumpology can be performed either by sight, touch or by using buttock prints.&lt;ref name="stallone"/&gt; In addition to live readings, Jackie Stallone will perform buttock readings using e-mailed digital photographs,&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt; and has claimed to predict the outcome of Presidential elections and Oscar awards by reading the bottoms of her two pet [[Doberman Pinscher]]s.&lt;ref name="Salon2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2001/03/21/npwed_37/ |title=Streisand: Stallone's mom's butt prints are hot! |first=Amy |last=Reiter |publisher=Salon.com |date=March 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulf Buck claims he can read people's futures by feeling their naked buttocks.&lt;ref name="tatters"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Upon learning about a TV show 'rumpologist' known as Professor Jose Miranda (a pupil of Stallone's&lt;ref name="skepdic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/rumpology.html |title=rumpology |publisher=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the Florida psychic [[Sheree Silver]] disassociated herself from the practice, telling the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'', "I can't imagine anyone wasting their time and money on someone like this when there are so many legitimate psychics out there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.book-of-thoth.com/article1014.html |title=Psychic TV `rumpologist' becomes huge hit on Spanish-language TV |publisher=The Book Of THoTH |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911010556/http://www.book-of-thoth.com/article1014.html |archivedate=2011-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sami languages''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑː|m|i}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;) are a group of [[Uralic languages]] spoken by the [[Sami people]] in [[Northern Europe]] (in parts of northern [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and extreme northwestern [[Russia]]). There are, depending on the nature and terms of division, ten or more Sami languages. Several names are used for the Sami languages: ''Saami'', ''Sámi'', ''Saame'', ''Samic'', ''Saamic'', as well as the [[exonyms]] ''Lappish'' and ''Lappic''. The last two, along with the term ''Lapp'', are now often considered [[pejorative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karlsson |first=Fred |title=An Essential Finnish Grammar |url= |year=2008 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]], [[Oxfordshire]] |isbn=978-0-415-43914-5 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
The Sami languages form a branch of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]]. According to the traditional view, Sami is within the Uralic family most closely related to the [[Finnic languages]] (Sammallahti 1998). However, this view has recently been doubted by some scholars, who argue that the traditional view of a common [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-Sami]] protolanguage is not as strongly supported as had been earlier assumed,&lt;ref&gt;T. Salminen: Problems in the taxonomy of the Uralic languages in the light of modern comparative studies. — Лингвистический беспредел: сборник статей к 70-летию А. И. Кузнецовой. Москва: Издательство Московского университета, 2002. 44–55. AND [http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/kuzn.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the similarities may stem from an areal influence on Sami from Finnic.

In terms of internal relationships, the Sami languages are divided into two groups: western and eastern. The groups may be further divided into various subgroups and ultimately individual languages. (Sammallahti 1998: 6-38.) Parts of the Sami language area form a [[dialect continuum]] in which the neighbouring languages may be [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] to a fair degree, but two more widely separated groups will not understand each other's speech. There are, however, some sharp language boundaries, in particular between [[Northern Sami]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] and [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], the speakers of which are not able to understand each other without learning or long practice. The evolution of sharp language boundaries seems to suggest a relative isolation of the language speakers from each other and not very intensive contacts between the respective speakers in the past. There is some significance in this, as the geographical barriers between the respective speakers are no different from those in other parts of the Sami area.

== Geographic distribution ==
The Sami languages are spoken in [[Sápmi]] in [[Northern Europe]], in a region stretching over the four countries [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Russia]], reaching from the southern part of central [[Scandinavia]] in the southwest to the tip of the [[Kola Peninsula]] in the east. The borders between the languages do not align with the ones separating the region's modern nation states.

During the [[Middle Ages]] and [[early modern period]], now-extinct Sami languages were also spoken in the central and southern parts of [[Finland]] and [[Karelia]] and in a wider area on the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]]. Historical documents as well as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Karelian language|Karelian]] [[oral tradition]] contain many mentions of the earlier Sami inhabitation in these areas (Itkonen, 1947). Also, [[loanword]]s as well as place-names of Sami origin in the southern dialects of Finnish and Karelian dialects testify of earlier Sami presence in the area (Koponen, 1996; Saarikivi, 2004; Aikio, 2007). These Sami languages, however, became extinct later, under the wave of the Finno-Karelian agricultural expansion.

== History ==
The [[Proto-Samic language]] is believed to have formed in the vicinity of the [[Gulf of Finland]] between 1000 BC to 700 AD, deriving from a common Proto-Sami-Finnic language (M. Korhonen 1981).&lt;ref name="M. Korhonen"&gt;Korhonen, Mikko 1981: Johdatus lapin kielen historiaan. Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seuran toimituksia ; 370. Helsinki, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; However, reconstruction of any basic proto-languages in the Uralic family have reached a level close to or identical to [[Proto-Uralic]] (Salminen 1999).&lt;ref name="T. Salminen"&gt;: Problems in the taxonomy of the Uralic languages in the light of modern comparative studies. — Лингвистический беспредел: сборник статей к 70-летию А. И. Кузнецовой. Москва: Издательство Московского университета, 2002. 44–55.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the comparative linguist Ante Aikio, the Proto-Samic language developed in South Finland or in Karelia around 2000–2500 years ago, spreading then to northern Fennoscandia.&lt;ref name="Aikio 2004"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Aikio |first=Ante |contribution=An essay on substrate studies and the origin of Saami |editor1-last=Hyvärinen |editor1-first=Irma |editor2-last=Kallio |editor2-first=Petri |editor3-last=Korhonen |editor3-first=Jarmo |title=Etymologie, Entlehnungen und Entwicklungen: Festschrift für Jorma Koivulehto zum 70. Geburtstag |series=Mémoires de la Société Néophilologique de Helsinki |volume=63 |publisher=Société Néophilologique |publication-date=2004 |publication-place=Helsinki |pages=5–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is believed to have expanded west and north into [[Fennoscandia]] during the [[Nordic Iron Age]], reaching central [[Scandinavia]] during the [[Proto-Scandinavian]] period ca. 500 AD (Bergsland 1996).&lt;ref name="Bergsland, Knut"&gt;[[Knut Bergsland]]: Bidrag til sydsamenes historie, Senter for Samiske Studier Universitet i Tromsø 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The language assimilated several layers of unknown [[Paleo-European languages]] from the early hunter-gatherers, first during the Proto-Sami phase and second in the subsequent expansion of the language in the west and the north of Fennoscandia that is part of modern Sami today. (Aikio 2004, Aikio 2006).&lt;ref name="Aikio 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aikio 2006"&gt;Aikio, A. (2006). ''On Germanic-Saami contacts and Saami prehistory.'' Journal de la Société Finno-Ougrienne 91: 9–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written languages and sociolinguistic situation ==
[[File:Lenguas sami.png|thumb|right|The Sami languages in the Nordics]]
At present there are nine living Sami languages. The largest six of the languages have independent literary languages; the three others have no written standard, and of them, there are only a few, mainly elderly, speakers left. The [[ISO 639-2]] code for all Sami languages without its proper code is "smi". The seven written languages are:

* [[Northern Sami language|Northern Sami]] (Norway, Sweden, Finland): With an estimated 15,000 speakers, this accounts for probably more than 75% of all Sami speakers in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[ISO 639-1]]/[[ISO 639-2]]:  se/sme
* [[Lule Sami language|Lule Sami]] (Norway, Sweden): The second largest group with an estimated 1,500 speakers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[ISO 639-2]]:  smj
* [[Ume Sami language|Ume Sami]] (Norway, Sweden): [[ISO 639-2]]: smu
* [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] (Norway, Sweden): 500 speakers (estimated).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[ISO 639-2]]:  sma
* [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] (''Enare Sami'') ([[Inari, Finland|Inari]], Finland): 500 speakers (estimated).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[SIL code]]:  LPI, [[ISO 639-2]]:  smn
* [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]] (Näätämö and the Nellim-Keväjärvi districts, [[Inari, Finland|Inari]] municipality, Finland, also spoken in [[Russia]], previously in Norway): 400 speakers (estimated).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[SIL code]]:  LPK, [[ISO 639-2]]: sms
* [[Kildin Sami language|Kildin Sami]] ([[Kola Peninsula]], Russia): 608 speakers in [[Murmansk Oblast]], 179 in other Russian regions, although 1991 persons stated their Saami ethnicity (1769 of them live in [[Murmansk Oblast]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Russian Census (2002)]]. Data from http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php?reg=0&lt;/ref&gt; [[SIL code]]:  LPD, [[ISO 639-3]]: sjd

The other Sami languages are critically endangered or [[Moribund language|moribund]] and have very few speakers left. [[Pite Sami language|Pite Sami]] has about 30&amp;ndash;50 speakers,&lt;ref&gt;According to researcher Joshua Wilbur and Pite Sami dictionary committee leader Nils Henrik Bengtsson, March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and a dictionary and an official orthography is under way. A descriptive grammar (Wilbur 2014) has been published. [[Ume Sami language|Ume Sami]] likely has under 20 speakers left,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and ten speakers of [[Ter Sami language|Ter Sami]] were known to be alive in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Tiuraniemi Olli: "Anatoli Zaharov on maapallon ainoa turjansaamea puhuva mies", ''Kide'' 6 / 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The last speaker of [[Akkala Sami language|Akkala Sami]] is known to have died in December 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/nordisk_samekonvensjon.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720012642/http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/nordisk_samekonvensjon.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 July 2011|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the eleventh attested variety, [[Kemi Sami language|Kemi Sami]], became extinct in the 19th century. An additional Sami language, [[Kainuu Sami language|Kainuu Sami]], became extinct in the 18th century, and probably belonged to the Eastern group like Kemi Sami, although the evidence for the language is limited.

== Orthographies ==
{{Main|Sami orthography}}

[[Image:Sami alphabet 1933.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Sami Primer, USSR 1933]]

The Sami languages use [[Latin script|Latin alphabets]], with these respective additional letters.

:{|
|Northern Sami: || Áá Čč Đđ Ŋŋ Šš Ŧŧ Žž
|-
|Inari Sami: || Áá Ââ Ää Čč Đđ Šš Žž
|-
|Skolt Sami: || Ââ Čč Ʒʒ Ǯǯ [[D with stroke (disambiguation)|Đđ]] Ǧǧ Ǥǥ Ǩǩ Ŋŋ      Õõ  Šš Žž  Åå Ää ([[soft sign]] ʹ and a separator ʼ)
|-
|Lule Sami in Sweden: || Áá Åå Ŋŋ Ää
|-
|Lule Sami in Norway: || Áá Åå Ŋŋ Ææ
|-
|Southern Sami in Sweden: ||  Ïï Ää Öö Åå
|-
|Southern Sami in Norway: ||  Ïï Ææ Øø Åå
|-
|Ume Sami: || Áá Đđ Ïï Ŋŋ Ŧŧ Üü Åå Ää Öö
|}

Note that the letter Đ is a capital [[D with stroke|D with a bar]] across it ([[Unicode]] U+0110) also used in [[Serbo-Croatian]] etc., and is not the capital [[eth]] (Ð; U+00D0) found in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] or [[Old English language|Old English]], to which it is almost identical.

Note also that the different characters used on the different sides of the Swedish/Norwegian border merely are orthographic standards based on the [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian alphabet]], respectively, and don't denote different pronunciations.

Kildin Sami now uses an extended version of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] (in three slightly different variants): Аа А̄а̄ Ӓӓ Бб Вв Гг Дд Ее Е̄е̄ Ёё Ё̄ё̄ Жж Зз Һһ/ʼ Ии Ӣӣ Йй Јј/Ҋҋ Кк Лл Ӆӆ Мм Ӎӎ Нн Ӊӊ Ӈӈ Оо О̄о̄ Пп Рр Ҏҏ Сс Тт Уу Ӯӯ Фф Хх Цц Чч Шш (Щщ) Ьъ Ыы Ьь Ҍҍ Ээ Э̄э̄ Ӭӭ Юю Ю̄ю̄ Яя Я̄я̄

The Skolt Sami standard uses ʹ (U+02B9) as a soft sign,&lt;ref&gt;[http://divvun.no/doc/keyboards/kbdlangdocs/sms/doc/index.html Divvun]&lt;/ref&gt; but other apostrophes (like ' (U+0027), ˊ (U+02CA) or ´ (U+00B4)) are also sometimes used in published texts.

== Official status ==

=== Finland ===
[[Image:Porosaivontie.jpg|thumb|A bilingual street sign in [[Enontekiö]] in both Finnish (top) and Northern Sami]][[File:Samisktalande i Finland.jpg|thumb|Sami speakers in Finland 1980-2011.]]

In [[Finland]], the Sami language act of 1991 granted Sami people the right to use the Sami languages for all government services. Three Sami languages are recognized: Northern, Skolt and Inari Sami. The Sami language act of 2003 made Sami an official language in [[Enontekiö]], [[Inari, Finland|Inari]], [[Sodankylä]] and [[Utsjoki]] [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]].

=== Norway ===
Adopted in April 1988, Article 110a of the [[Norwegian Constitution]] states: "It is the responsibility of the authorities of the State to create conditions enabling the Sami people to preserve and develop its language, culture and way of life". The Sami Language Act went into effect in the 1990s. Sami is an official language of the municipalities of [[Kautokeino]], [[Karasjok]], [[Gáivuotna]] ([[Kåfjord, Troms|Kåfjord]]), [[Nesseby]], [[Porsanger]], [[Deatnu - Tana|Tana]], [[Tysfjord]], [[Lavangen]] and [[Snåsa]].

=== Russia ===
In [[Russia]], Sami has no official status. Sami has been taught at the Murmansk University since 2012; before then, Sami was taught at the Institute of Peoples of the North (Институт народов севера) in [[Saint Petersburg]] (Leningrad).

=== Sweden ===
On 1 April 2000, Sami became one of five recognized [[Minority languages of Sweden|minority languages]] in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy'', 3(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010). Swedish Television as a mechanism for language planning and policy. Language Problems and Language Planning, 34(2), 158-181.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in dealing with public authorities in the [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] of [[Arjeplog Municipality|Arjeplog]], [[Gällivare Municipality|Gällivare]], [[Jokkmokk Municipality|Jokkmokk]], and [[Kiruna Municipality|Kiruna]]. In 2011, this list was enlarged considerably. In Sweden the Umeå and Uppsala Universities have courses in North Sami, and Umeå University also teaches Ume Sami and South Sami.

'''Sebastià Juan Arbó''' ({{IPA-ca|səβəstiˈa ʒuˈan əɾˈβo}}; 1902 – 1984) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] novelist and playwright. He wrote in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. He was born in San Carlos de la Rapita on October 28, 1902 and died in [[Barcelona]] on January 2, 1984. His work includes novels, drama, biographies and translations. He was an honorary member of the Association of Writers in the Catalan Language. In 1948 he won the [[Premio Nadal]] (the Nadal Prize).

==Early life==
Born into a peasant family, at age eight Juan moved with his parents to [[Amposta]], and at twelve and worked in an office. In 1927 he went to [[Barcelona]], where he began his writing career as a journalist for ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' and ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'', as well as on various editorials.

==Career==
In 1931 Juan published his first novel, L'inútil combat (Useless battle).

In 1932 he published ''Terres de l'Ebre'', his best known work, a novel that describes the situation of the peasants of the [[Ebro delta]], forgotten and humble, working in a hard and thankless land, subject to the fatalities. The novel transforms their personal and community experiences into fiction. In 1933 he published ''Notes d'un estudiant que va morir boig'' and in 1935 ''Boig Camins de nit''.

After the [[Spanish Civil War, 1938–1939|Civil War]] he stopped publishing until, in 1947, he released ''Tino Costa'', with versions in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. In 1946 he had, however, published, a biography: ''Cervantes''.

From 1948 he wrote works in Spanish such as ''Sobre las piedras grises'' (1948) which won the Nadal Prize for novel, and especially ''Martin Masks'' (1959). In his later years he returned to publishing in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Narracions d'Delta'' (1965), ''L'espera'' (1948) and ''La Masia'' (1975).

Juan died on January 2, 1984 of a heart attack.

'''Sokna''' (also ''Sawknah'', ''Sukna''; native name: '''Tasuknit'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://salvadorjafer.net/linguasfera/1Afroasiatic/10Tamazic/lingtamazic.htm Linguasfera: Tamazic (Berber)](catalan) Llengües, Literatures i Cultures del Món, [LLCM], Retrieved the 27 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;) is a presumably extinct [[Eastern Berber language]] which was spoken in the town of [[Sokna, Libya|Sokna]] (''Isuknan'') and the village of [[Fuqaha, Libya|Fuqaha]] in northeastern [[Fezzan]] in [[Libya]]. According to Václav Blažek (1999), Sokna was also spoken in the oasis of [[Tmessa (Libya)|Tmessa]].&lt;ref&gt;Václav Blažek, "Numerals: Comparative-etymological Analyses of Numeral Systems and Their Implications : Saharan, Nubian, Egyptian, Berber, Kartvelian, Uralic, Altaic and Indo-European Languages", in: Filozofická Fakulta: Opera Universitatis Masarykianae vol. 332, p. 57, Facultas Philosophica - Masarykova Univerzita Brno, 1999 ({{ISBN|9788021020702}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extensive and recent materials on it are Sarnelli (1924)&lt;ref&gt;Sarnelli, Tommaso. 1924. "Il dialetto berbero di Sokna: Materiali lessicali, testi manoscritti in caratteri arabi, con trascrizione e traduzione", in ''Supplemento all'Africa Italiana''.&lt;/ref&gt; for Sokna and Paradisi (1963)&lt;ref&gt;Paradisi, Umberto. 1963. "Il linguaggio berbero di El-Fogaha (Fezzan)". ''Istituto Orientale di Napoli XIII''. 93-126.&lt;/ref&gt; for El-Fogaha. Both articles report that the language was spoken only by a handful of old people at the time, so it is generally presumed to be extinct.

Aikhenvald &amp; Militarev (1984) and Blench (2006) consider Sokna and Fezzan to be separate languages. Blench lists Tmessa and Al-Foqaha as dialects of Fezzan.

In [[Argument|logical argument]] and [[mathematical proof]], the '''therefore sign''' (∴) is generally used before a [[logical consequence]], such as the conclusion of a [[syllogism]]. The symbol consists of three dots placed in an upright triangle and is read ''therefore''. It is encoded at {{unichar|2234|therefore|html=}}. For common use in Microsoft Office hold the ALT key and type "8756".  While it is not generally used in formal writing, it is used in [[mathematics]] and [[shorthand]]. It is complementary to {{unichar|2235|because|html=}}.

==History==
According to [[Florian Cajori|Cajori]], ''A History of Mathematical Notations,'' [[Johann Rahn]] used both the ''therefore'' and ''because'' signs to mean "therefore"; in the German edition of ''Teutsche Algebra'' (1659) the ''therefore'' sign was prevalent with the modern meaning, but in the 1668 English edition Rahn used the ''because'' sign more often to mean "therefore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema031756mbp |title=Cajori, vol. 1, p. 211 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors in the eighteenth century also used three dots in a triangle shape to signify "therefore," but as with Rahn, there wasn't much in the way of consistency as to how the triangle was oriented; ''because'' with its current meaning appears to have originated in the nineteenth century. In this century, the three-dot notation for therefore became very rare in continental Europe, but it remains popular in the British Isles.&lt;ref name="Cajori2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Florian|last=Cajori|title=A History of Mathematical Notations: Two Volumes in One|url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=gxrO8ZnMK_YC|page=282}}|year=2011|origyear=1929|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61640-571-7|pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example of use==
Used in a [[syllogism]]:

:All gods are immortal.
:[[Zeus]] is a god.
:∴&amp;nbsp;Zeus is immortal.

:x + 1 = 6
:∴&amp;nbsp;x = 5

==Related signs==
The inverted form ∵, known as the '''because sign''', is sometimes used as a [[shorthand]] form of "because". This is [[Unicode]] character U+2235 {{sc2|BECAUSE}}.

The ''therefore'' sign is sometimes used as a substitute for an [[asterism (typography)|asterism]] ⁂.

In meteorology, the therefore sign is used to indicate moderate rain on a [[station model]]; the asterism indicates moderate snow.

To denote [[logical implication]] or [[entailment]], various signs are used in [[mathematical logic]]: →, ⇒, ⊃, ⊢, ⊨. These symbols are then part of a mathematical formula, and are not considered to be punctuation. In contrast, the therefore sign is traditionally used as a punctuation mark, and does not form part of a logical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://inis.jinr.ru/sl/tcaep/science/symbols/maths.htm |title=Symbols - Mathematical Symbols |last=Stott |first=Jonathan |website=The Constants and Equations Pages |via=[[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphically identical sign ∴ serves as a [[Japanese map symbol]] on the maps of the [[Geographical Survey Institute of Japan]], indicating a tea plantation. On other maps the sign, often with thicker dots,  is sometimes used to signal the presence of a national monument or [[ruins]].

The character ஃ in the [[Tamil script]] represents the [[āytam]], a special sound of the [[Tamil language]].

In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], a similar symbol is used as an explanatory symbol (''forklaringstegnet''). It can be typeset using the [[open o]] followed by a colon, thus: '''ɔ:'''. It is used for the meaning "namely", "id est", "scilicet" or similar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.typografi.org/forklaringstegn/forklaringstegn.html |title=Forklaringstegnet: en savnet del av det typografiske repertoar? |website=www.typografi.org |language=Norwegian |access-date=2018-08-15 |trans-title=Explanation: A missing part of the typographical repertoire?&lt;!--translated via Google Translate, improvement welcome!--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Use in Freemasonry==
[[File:DiplomeMaçonnique1945.png|thumb|left|A diploma from the Masonic ''[[Grande Loge de France]]'' showing the symbol as a substitute for the dot of abbreviation.|alt=A diploma from the Masonic Grande Loge de France]]

In [[Masonic]] traditions the symbol is used for [[abbreviation]], instead of the usual period, essentially an initial or monogram continuing the meaning of "therefore", 'standing for' i.e. "thus" (latin ''sic'').  For example "R∴W∴ John Smith" is an abbreviation for "Right Worshipful John Smith" (the term Right Worshipful is an archaic title just as "Land Lord" is and indicates that Brother Smith is a Grand Lodge officer).&lt;ref name="Mackey"&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Freemasonry]] Part 1 and Its Kindred Sciences Comprising the ...'', [[Albert Gallatin Mackey]], page 2, reprint in 2002, [[Kessinger Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7661-2650-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the hard accessibility of the symbol in not specialized keyboards and fonts, and to prevent compatibility issues, it's often substituted by a colon followed by a period ("''':.'''") even if it's considered more elegant to use the original therefore character in printing.

'''Treta Yuga''' ([[Sanskrit]]: त्रेता युग) is the second out of the four  [[yuga]]s, or ages of mankind, in the religion of [[Hinduism]]. It follows the [[Satya Yuga]] and is followed by the [[Dvapara Yuga]] and [[Kali Yuga]]. Treta means 'a collection of three arousing things' in Sanskrit, and is so called because during the Treta Yuga, there were three [[Dashavatara|Avatars of Vishnu]] that were seen, the sixth and seventh incarnations as [[Parashurama]] and [[Rama]] respectively. The name could also be derived from the fact that the Treta Yug lasted 3,600 divine years, or 1,296,000 human years.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.stephen-knapp.com/timings_of_the_four_yugas.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The bull of [[Dharma]] symbolises that mortality stood on three legs during this period. It had all four legs in the Satya Yuga and two in the succeeding Dvapara Yuga. Currently, in the immoral age of [[Kaliyuga|Kali]], it stands on one leg.&lt;ref&gt; [https://tamilandvedas.com/tag/four-yugas/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
During the Treta Yuga, the power of humans diminishes slightly. Kings and Brahmins need to actively fulfill their desires instead of using mere fiat of will. People grow more materialistic and less inclined towards spirituality. Wars broke out frequently and climate changes became common place, giving rise to deserts and oceans.

Despite these seemingly negative effects, the Treta Yuga also brought knowledge of universal magnetism. This knowledge allowed humans to understand the forces of nature and the true nature of the universe. Agriculture and mining came into existence along with norms and rules to keep society under control.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/6639/treta-yuga]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatars of Lord Vishnu during Treta Yuga==

===Parashurama===
{{Main|Parashurama}}

Vishnu incarnated as the [[Brahman]] [[Parashurama]] in this era because there were too many warlike [[Kshatriyas]] plaguing the Earth, and he therefore had to wipe out most of the world's warriors. However, some of the Kshatriyas survived or more were created, and their population grew again. Eventually, the avatara of Vishnu in Parashurama ended, though it is said that he continued to live on as a mighty warrior-hermit. He confronted [[Rama]], angrily, years later, before acknowledging the latter's supremacy and retiring. He lived on in the Dvapara Yuga, having a great duel with [[Bhishma]] for the sake of [[Amba (Mahabharata)|Amba]]. However he failed to defeat him and stopped fighting after he was forbidden by the divine sage [[Narada]] and his ancestors and learning that Bhishma had surpassed him in art of warfare. He mentored [[Drona|Dronacharya]], teacher of both the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandava]]s. Parashurama also taught [[Karna]] how to use the ''[[Brahmastra]]'' but when he found out that Karna had lied about being a brahmana, he cursed Karna that his knowledge of the Brahmastra would fail him when he needed it the most. He is said to be still alive today, doing penance on the [[Mahendragiri_(Odisha)|Mahendragiri]] mountain.

===Rama===
{{Main|Rama}}

The hallmark of this era was the rise of evil in the form of the demon king of Sri Lanka, [[Ravana]]. He conquered the three worlds namely, Earth, Heaven and the Netherworld ([[Patala]]) and terrorized everyone. Even the Devas were subordinate to him - his son [[Indrajit|Meghanada]] had earned the title ''Indrajit'' by defeating Indra, the King of heaven in battle; and even the [[Surya|Sun]] had to obey the king. In this scenario, Lord Vishnu incarnated himself as the son of King [[Dasharatha]] of the [[Suryavamsha|Suryavamshis]] or [[Ikshvaku_dynasty|Ikshvaku]] dynasty and was named [[Rama]]. Due to a stepmother's jealousy, Rama was sent away to a forest in exile for 14 years, during which time he confronted and killed Ravana for kidnapping his wife, and thus stored peace on earth. He is said to have afterwards established Rama-rajya or Rama's Kingdom over the entire earth from his throne at [[Ayodhya]] for 11,000 years, before eventually returning to his [[Mahavishnu]] form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lordrama.co.in/rama-rajya.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trygve Knudsen''' (23 June 1897 &amp;ndash; 18 January 1968) was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[philologist]], [[linguist]] and [[lexicographer]].

==Personal life==
Knudsen was born in [[Tønsberg]] as the son of lawyer Knud Peder Knudsen (1863&amp;ndash;1937) and Henriette von Lachmann Mørck (1867&amp;ndash;1923). He married Grethe Tønnessen in 1925.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Trygve Knudsen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]] |first=Tove |last=Bull |authorlink=Tove Bull |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Trygve_Knudsen/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Knudsen [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in Tønsberg 1916, and enrolled in [[philology]] at the [[University of Oslo|University of Kristiania]]. He took the [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1923, and his thesis was issued as a book, titled ''P. A. Munch og samtidens norske målstræv''. Between 1925 and 1930 he worked as a University [[research fellow]], and later as a teacher in [[Aker, Norway|Aker]] and [[Oslo]]. From 1935 he worked as a teacher at [[Oslo katedralskole|Oslo Cathedral School]], until 1946, when he started lecturing at the University. He was appointed professor at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1954, and kept this position until he retired in 1967.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Knudsen was co-editor of the magazine ''Maal og Minne'' from 1951. He wrote the book ''Gammelnorsk Homiliebok'' in 1952. He was chairman for the [[Norwegian Language Council|Norwegian Language Committee]] (''Norsk Språknemnd'') from 1956 to 1957. He wrote articles on city dialects in general, and more specifically on dialects in Oslo and Tønsberg. He was a radio speaker, especially on the subject "Norwegian language", and he held guest lectures at the universities of [[University of Bergen|Bergen]], [[Lund University|Lund]], [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] and [[Göteborg University|Göteborg]]. He was also a literary critic.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Knudsen received an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Stockholm]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

In November 2006, the Turkish Wikipedia was nominated under the [[Science]] category for {{Interlanguage link multi|Altın Örümcek Web Ödülleri|tr}} ([[Golden Spider Web Awards]]), which are commonly known as the "Web Oscars" for Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halklailiskiler.com/5-altin-orumcek-web-odulleri.html|title=5. Altın Örümcek Web Ödülleri|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, the Turkish Wikipedia was given the award for "Best Content" in this competition. The award was given in a ceremony on 25 January 2007 at [[Istanbul Technical University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altinorumcek.com/sonuclar/5-altin-orumcek/|title=Altın Örümcek - Geçmiş Yıllar - Değerlendirme Süreci|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/teknoloji/8667704.asp|title=Altın Örümcek ödülleri açıklandı|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ugly Duckling theorem''' is an [[argument]] asserting that classification is impossible without some sort of [[bias (statistics)|bias]]. More particularly, it assumes finitely many properties combinable by [[logical connective]]s, and finitely many objects; it asserts that any two [[Identity of indiscernibles|different]] objects share the same number of ([[Extension (predicate logic)|extensional]]) properties. The theorem is named after [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s story "[[The Ugly Duckling]]", because it shows that a [[duckling]] is just as similar to a [[swan]] as two duckling are to each other. It was proposed by [[Satosi Watanabe]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="Watanabe.1969"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Watanabe UglyDucklingTheorem svg.svg|thumb|400px|Watanabe's example, using objects ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and properties F ("first"), W ("white"). "0", "1", "[[negation|¬]]" , "[[conjunction (logic)|∧]]", "[[disjunction (logic)|∨]]", and "[[exclusive or|⊕]]" denote "''false''", "''true''", "''[[negation|not]]''", "''[[conjunction (logic)|and]]''", "''[[disjunction (logic)|or]]''", and "''[[exclusive or]]''", respectively. Since F happens to imply W, each predicate that can be formed from F and W coincides with another one, hence there are only 8 [[extension (semantics)|extensionally]] distinct possible predicates. The white ducklings ''A'' and ''B'' agree on 4 of them (line 2, 3, 4, 8), but so do ''A'' and ''C'', too (line 3, 5, 7, 8), and so do ''B'' and ''C'' (line 1, 3, 6, 8).&lt;ref name="Watanabe.1969"/&gt;{{rp|368}}&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe's ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, correspond to ''C'', ''B'', ''A'', F, and W, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Suppose there are &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; things in the universe, and one wants to put them into classes or categories. One has no preconceived ideas or [[bias]]es about what sorts of categories are "natural" or "normal" and what are not. So one has to consider all the possible classes that could be, all the possible ways of making sets out of the &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; objects. There are &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; such ways, the size of the [[power set]] of &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; objects. One can use that to measure the similarity between two objects: and one would see how many sets they have in common. However one can not. Any two objects have exactly the same number of classes in common if we can form any possible class, namely &lt;math&gt;2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; (half the total number of classes there are). To see this is so, one may imagine each class is a represented by an &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-bit [[bit array|string]] (or [[binary numeral system|binary encoded]] integer), with a zero for each element not in the class and a one for each element in the class. As one finds, there are &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; such strings.

As all possible choices of zeros and ones are there, any two bit-positions will agree exactly half the time. One may pick two elements and reorder the bits so they are the first two, and imagine the numbers sorted lexicographically. The first &lt;math&gt;2^n/2&lt;/math&gt; numbers will have bit #1 set to zero, and the second &lt;math&gt;2^n/2&lt;/math&gt; will have it set to one. Within each of those blocks, the top &lt;math&gt;2^n/4&lt;/math&gt; will have bit #2 set to zero and the other &lt;math&gt;2^n/4&lt;/math&gt; will have it as one, so they agree on two blocks of &lt;math&gt;2^n/4&lt;/math&gt; or on half of all the cases. No matter which two elements one picks. So if we have no preconceived bias about which categories are better, everything is then equally similar (or equally dissimilar). The number of [[propositional function|predicates]] simultaneously satisfied by two non-identical elements is constant over all such pairs and is the same{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} as the number of those satisfied by one.&lt;!-- I calculated these as 2^{n-2} and 2^{n-1} respectively. --&gt; Thus, some kind of inductive{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} bias is needed to make judgements; i.e. to prefer certain categories over others.

===Boolean functions===
Let &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; be a set of vectors of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; booleans each.  The ugly duckling is the vector which is least like the others.  Given the booleans, this can be computed using [[Hamming distance]].

However, the choice of boolean features to consider could have been somewhat arbitrary.  Perhaps there were features derivable from the original features that were important for identifying the ugly duckling.  The set of booleans in the vector can be extended with new features computed as boolean functions of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; original features.  The only canonical way to do this is to extend it with ''all'' possible Boolean functions.  The resulting completed vectors have &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; features.  The Ugly Duckling Theorem states that there is no ugly duckling because any two completed vectors will either be equal or differ in exactly half of the features.

Proof.  Let x and y be two vectors.  If they are the same, then their completed vectors must also be the same because any Boolean function of x will agree with the same Boolean function of y.  If x and y are different, then there exists a coordinate &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th coordinate of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; differs from the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th coordinate of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  Now the completed features contain every Boolean function on &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; Boolean variables, with each one exactly once.  Viewing these Boolean functions as polynomials in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; variables over GF(2), segregate the functions into pairs &lt;math&gt;(f,g)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; contains the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th coordinate as a linear term and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; without that linear term.  Now, for every such pair &lt;math&gt;(f,g)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will agree on exactly one of the two functions.  
If they agree on one, they must disagree on the other and vice versa.  (This proof is believed to be due to Watanabe.)

==Discussion==

{{clarify span|A solution to the Ugly Ducking Theorem|A problem may have a 'solution', but a theorem may not.|date=December 2017}} would be to introduce a constraint on how similarity is measured by limiting the properties involved in classification, say between A and B. However Medin et al. (1993) point out that this does not actually resolve the arbitrariness or bias problem since in what respects A is similar to B: “varies with the stimulus context and task, so that there is no unique answer, to the question of how similar is one object to another”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= | author=Douglas L. Medin and R.L. Goldstone and Dedre Gentner | title=Respects for similarity | journal=Psychological Review | volume=100 | number=2 | pages=254&amp;mdash;278 | month= | year=1993 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.2.254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] (1972){{cn|date=December 2017}} came to the same conclusion: "But importance is a highly volatile matter, varying with every shift of context and interest, and quite incapable of supporting the fixed distinctions that philosophers so often seek to rest upon it".&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "a barberpole and a zebra would be more similar than a horse and a zebra if the feature ''striped'' had sufficient weight. Of course, if these feature weights were fixed, then these similarity relations would be constrained". Yet the property "striped" as a weight 'fix' or constraint is arbitrary itself, meaning: "unless one can specify such criteria, then the claim that categorization is based on attribute matching is almost entirely vacuous".

Stamos (2003) has attempted to solve the Ugly Ducking Theorem by showing some judgments of overall similarity are non-arbitrary in the sense they are useful:

{{Quote|"Presumably, people's perceptual and conceptual processes have evolved that information that matters to human needs and goals can be roughly approximated by a similarity heuristic... If you are in the jungle and you see a tiger but you decide not to stereotype (perhaps because you believe that similarity is a false friend), then you will probably be eaten. In other words, in the biological world stereotyping based on veridical judgments of overall similarity statistically results in greater survival and reproductive success."&lt;ref&gt;Stamos, D. N. (2003). ''The Species Problem''. Lexington Books. p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unless some properties are considered more salient, or ‘weighted’ more important than others, everything will appear equally similar, hence Watanabe (1986) wrote: “any objects, in so far as they are distinguishable, are equally similar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= | author=Satosi Watanabe | title=Epistemological Relativity | journal=Annals of the Japan Association for Philosophy of Science | volume=7 | number=1 | pages=1&amp;mdash;14 | month= | year=1986 | doi=10.4288/jafpos1956.7.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;!---commented out (wrong):---Watanabe came to realize there is an unquantifiable number of shared properties between all objects, making any classification biased.---&gt;
In a weaker setting that assumes infinitely many properties, Murphy and Medin (1985) give an example of two putative classified things, plums and lawnmowers:

{{Quote|"Suppose that one is to list the attributes that plums and lawnmowers have in common in order to judge their similarity. It is easy to see that the list could be infinite: Both weigh less than 10,000 kg (and less than 10,001 kg), both did not exist 10,000,000 years ago (and 10,000,001 years ago), both cannot hear well, both can be dropped, both take up space, and so on. Likewise, the list of differences could be infinite… any two entities can be arbitrarily similar or dissimilar by changing the criterion of what counts as a relevant attribute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://matt.colorado.edu/teaching/highcog/spr10/readings/mm85.pdf | author=Gregory L. Murphy and Douglas L. Medin | title=The Role of Theories in Conceptual Coherence | journal=Psychological Review | volume=92 | number=3 | pages=289&amp;mdash;316 | date=Jul 1985 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.92.3.289}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!---commented out (doesn't refer to Watanabe's setting, no indication that is refers to Murphy and Medin's setting, either):---However, since there is an unlimited number of properties to choose from, it remains an arbitrary choice what properties to select/deselect. This makes classification biased.---&gt;
&lt;!---commented out (has been said in the lead):---Watanabe named this the "Ugly Duckling theorem" because a swan is as similar to a duckling as to another swan (there are no constraints or fixes on what constitutes similarity).---&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">'''Yitzkhok Yoel Linetzky''' (1839&amp;ndash;1915) was a [[Yiddish language]] author and early [[Zionism|Zionist]]. [[Sol Liptzin]] characterized him as "a master of the picturesque vitriolic phrase." [Liptzin, 1972, 46]

==Life==

He was raised a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jew]] in [[Vinnytsia]], [[Podolia]] (now in [[Ukraine]]), but revolted against his violent schoolteachers and [[Kabbalah|cabalist]] father by aligning himself with the [[Haskalah]], the Jewish Enlightenment. His father tried to offset this development by marrying him at the age of fourteen to a twelve-year-old girl; he drew her away from Hasidism and Kaballah, and his father forced him to divorce and remarry, this time to what Liptzin describes as "a deaf, moronic woman".

Linetzky ran away to [[Odessa]], Ukraine, where he acquired a secular education. Attempting to leave for [[Germany]] to continue his education, he was stopped at the border and brought back, a virtual prisoner, to Vinitza. At 23, he managed again to escape, this time to the government-sponsored [[rabbi]]nical academy at [[Zhytomyr]], where he developed a close friendship with [[Abraham Goldfaden]].

Like Goldfaden and several other Yiddish-language writers of his generation, he came to prominence in the 1860s as a writer for ''[[Kol Mevasser]]''; like several others, he had first published in its [[Hebrew language]] sister publication ''[[Hamelitz]]''. With Goldfaden, he was later involved in several Yiddish language newspapers, including as joint editors of the short-lived weekly ''Yisrolik'' (July 1875&amp;ndash;February 1876) almost immediately before Goldfaden founded the first professional [[Yiddish theater]] troupe.

The [[pogrom]]s following the 1881 assassination of Czar [[Alexander II of Russia]] made Linetzky into an early [[Zionism|Zionist]]. His 1882 booklet ''America or Israel'' aligned him with the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement, active in the Jewish colonization of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

==Works==

His semi-autobiographical [[picaresque novel]], ''Dos Polishe Yingel'' (''The Polish Lad''), an outright attack on the Hasidim, first appeared in installments in ''Kol Mevasser'' in 1867, and remained popular at least until the eve of [[World War II]].

Other works included a book of poems ''Der Beyzer Marshalik'' (''The Angry Master of Ceremonies'', 1879).
