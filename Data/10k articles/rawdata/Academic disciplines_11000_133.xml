      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2063">Each species of [[slime mold]] has its own specific chemical messenger, which are collectively referred to as acrasins.{{ref|bonner}} These chemicals signal that lots of individual cells should move towards each other to form a single large cell or [[Plasmodium (life cycle)|plasmodium]]. One of the earliest acrasins to be identified was [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], found in the species ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' by Brian Shaffer{{ref|shaffer}}, which exhibits a complex swirling-pulsating spiral pattern when forming a pseudoplasmodium.{{ref|naos}}

The term acrasin was descriptively named after Acrasia from [[Edmund Spenser|Edmund Spenser's]] [[Faerie Queene]]{{ref|smithson}}, who seduced men against their will and then transformed them into beasts. Acrasia is itself a play on the Greek [[akrasia]] that describes loss of free will.

[[File:Launch of advertising campaign for visitors to 2014 World Cup in Johannesburg 2010-07-09 1.jpg|thumb|Launch of the advertising campaign for visitors to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]]]

An '''advertising campaign''' is a series of [[advertisement]] messages that share a single idea and theme which make up an [[marketing strategy|integrated marketing]] [[marketing communications|communication]] (IMC). An IMC is a platform in which a group of people can group their ideas, beliefs, and concepts into one large media base. Advertising campaigns utilize diverse media channels over a particular time frame and target identified audiences.  

The campaign theme is the central message that will be received in the promotional activities and is the prime focus of advertising campaign, as it sets the motif for the series of individual advertisements and other marketing communications that will be used. The campaign themes are usually produced with the objective of being used for a significant period but many of them are temporal due to factors like being not effective or market conditions, competition and [[marketing mix]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising and Promotion: an integrated marketing communications perspective|last1=Belch|first1=George|last2=Belch|first2=Michael,|first=|publisher=MacGraw-Hill/Irwin|year=2004|isbn=0078028973|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising campaigns are built to accomplish a particular objective or a set of objectives. Such objectives usually include establishing a brand, raising brand awareness, aggrandizing the rate of conversions/sales. The rate of success or failure in accomplishing these goals is reckoned via effectiveness measures.  There are 5 key points at which an advertising campaign must consider to ensure an effective campaign. These points are, integrated marketing communications, media channels, positioning, the communications process diagram and [[touch point]]s.

== Integrated marketing Communication: (IMC) ==

Integrated marketing communication (IMC) is a conceptual approach used by the majority of organizations to develop a strategic plan on how they are going to broadcast their marketing and advertising campaigns. Recently there has been a shift in the way marketers and advertisers interact with their consumers and now see it as a conversation between Advertising/ Marketing teams and consumers. IMC has emerged as a key strategy for organizations to manage customer experiences in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;"Integrated Marketing Communications - Medill - Northwestern University". ''www.medill.northwestern.edu''. Retrieved 24/ 3/16&lt;/ref&gt; The more traditional advertising practices such as newspapers, billboards, and magazines are still used but fail to have the same effect now as they did in previous years.

The importance of the IMC is to make the marketing process seamless for both the brand and the consumer. IMC attempts to meld all aspects of marketing into one cohesive piece. This includes sales promotion, advertising, public relations, direct marketing, and social media. The entire point of IMC is to have all of these aspects of marketing work together as a unified force. This can be done through methods, channels, and activities all while using a media platform. The end goal of IMC is to get the brands message across to consumers in the most convenient way possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thedma.org/membership/member-groups-communities/integrated-marketing-community/integrated-marketing-definitions/|title=Integrated Marketing Definitions - Definition of Integrated Marketing {{!}} thedma.org|work=thedma.org|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of using IMC are that it has the ability to communicate the same message through several channels to create brand awareness. IMC is the most cost-effective solution when compared to mass media advertising to interact with target consumers on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://igotit.com/en/page/about.html|title=Buying, selling, trading and connecting with local businesses|last=Shultz|first=Orion|date=1 July 2008|website=igotit.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMC also benefits small businesses, as they are able to submerge their consumers with communication of various kinds in a way that pushes them through the research and buying stages creating a relationship and dialogue with their new customer. Popular and obvious examples of IMC put into action are the likes of direct marketing to the consumer that the organisation already has a knowledge that the person is interested in the brand by gathering personal information about them from when they previously shopped there and then sending mail, emails, texts and other direct communication with the person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In-store sales promotions are tactics such as ‘30% off’ sales or offering loyalty cards to consumers to build a relationship. Television and radio advertisement are also a form of advertising strategy derived from IMC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of the components of IMC play an important role and a company may or may not choose to  implement any of the integration strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Don E.|last2=Schultz|first2=Heidi F.|date=1998-01-01|title=Transitioning marketing communication into the twenty-first century|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/135272698345852|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|volume=4|issue=1|pages=9–26|doi=10.1080/135272698345852|issn=1352-7266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media Channels ==

Media channels, also known as, marketing communications channels, are used to create a connection with the target consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pcl.stanford.edu/campaigns/|title=PCL: Political Campaigns|website=pcl.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional methods of communication with the consumer include newspapers, magazines, Radio, television, billboards, telephone, post and door to door sales. These are just a few of the historically traditional methods.

Along with traditional media channels, comes new and upcoming media channels. Social media has begun to play a very large role in the way media and marketing intermingle to reach a consumer base. Social media has the power to reach a wider audience. Depending on the age group and demographic, social media can influence a company's overall image. Using social media as a marketing tool has become a widely popular method for branding. A brand has the chance to create an entire social media presence based around their own specific targeted community. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.contentfac.com/9-reasons-social-media-marketing-should-top-your-to-do-list/|title=Why Social Media Marketing Is Important For Any Business|website=www.contentfac.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With advancements in digital communications channels, marketing communications allow for the possibility of two-way communications where an immediate consumer response can be elicited. Digital communications tools include: websites, blogs, social media, email, mobile, and search engines as a few examples. It is important for an advertising campaign to carefully select channels based on where their target consumer spends time to ensure market and advertising efforts are maximized.

== Modern day implications to the advantages &amp; disadvantages of traditional media channels ==
In the rapidly changing marketing and advertising environment, exposure to certain consumer groups and target audiences through traditional media channels has blurred. These traditional media channels are defined as print, broadcast, out-of-home and direct mail.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising: Strategy, Creativity and Media|last=Fill|first=Chris|last2=Hughes|first2=Graham|last3=De Francesco|first3=Scott|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=0273760890|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of various new modern-day media channels has altered their traditional advantages and disadvantages. It is imperative to the effectiveness of the Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) strategy that exposure to certain demographics, consumer groups and target audiences is anticipated to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communications impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Marketing Communication: Maybe Definition Is in the Point of View|last=Schultz|first=D. E|publisher=Marketing News|year=1993|isbn=0324593600|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Print media is mainly defined as newspapers and magazines. With the transition in last decade [2006 – 2016] to digital information on phones, computers and tablets, the demographic that still are exposed to traditional print media is going to be older. It is also estimated that there will be a reduction of print material in coming years. This has to be taken into account by the advertisers and in some cases, they could use this to their advantage. Newspapers advantages would be that it is low cost, timely, reader controls exposure and has moderate coverage to the older generations in western society. Disadvantages would obviously be the aging demographic, short life, clutter and low attention-getting capabilities. Magazines are similar in some cases but have defined differences as they are a niche product increasing segmentation potential; they also have high informational content and longevity. Disadvantages are they are visual only, lack of flexibility and a long lead time for advertisement placement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Traditional broadcast media’s primary platforms are television and radio. These are still relatively prominent in modern-day society, but with the emergence of online content such as YouTube, Instagram and Vine it would difficult to anticipate where the market is headed in the next decade. Televisions advantages are that it has mass coverage, high reach, quality reputation, low post per exposure and impacts human senses. Disadvantages would be that it has low selectivity, short message life and high production costs. Alternatively, radio offers flexibility, high frequency and low advertising &amp; production costs. Disadvantages to radio are that its audio only, low attention-getting and short message.

Out-of-home (OOH) media a broad marketing concept that is no longer relegated to large, static billboards on the side of motorways. More current and innovative approaches to OOH media range from street furniture to aerial blimps. Due to the constant and contemporary nature of the outdoors there will always be new ways in which a campaign can revitalize this media channel. Advantages would be the accessibility and reach, geographic flexibility and relatively low cost. Disadvantages to OOH media are that it has a short life, difficult to measure / control and it can convey poor brand image.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Direct mail is classified as messages sent directly to consumers through the mail delivery service. One of the more ‘dated’ media channels and in the modern day has very little advantages, other than it is highly selective and has high information content. Disadvantages are that it promotes a poor brand image – junk mail and that it has a high cost to contact ratio.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Target Market ==
{{Manual|date=March 2017}}
When an organisation begins to construct their advertising campaign they need to research each and every aspect of their target market and target consumer. The target consumer is the person or group of people who is most likely to buy from an organisation, he is also called 'potential customer'. A target consumer can be categorized by several key characteristics; Gender, age, occupation, marital status, geographical location, behavioral,&lt;ref&gt;CBS(2014). ''Blue Jeans: The fabric of freedom.'' Retrieved December 8, 2016 from &lt;nowiki&gt;Https://www.youtube.com/watch?V=UzOGdtV-_4w&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; level of income and education to name the main factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/target-market|title=Target Market|last=Staff|first=Entrepreneur|website=Entrepreneur|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is called segmenting customers on the basis of demographics.

Gender is simply whether a person is male or female. Age is usually broken up into bracketed intervals of ten or so years, for example, a person's age between 15–25 years old. By understanding which age bracket the target market falls into the advertisers can position their efforts accordingly. Occupation is also known as a profession and refers to what a person does for a living; this could be a particular job, student, unemployed etc. A person’s marital status defines whether they are married or unmarried. Geographical location is a broad term specifying a particular area or place within a given country, state/ city, suburb or street as some examples. Income refers to how much money a person is earning annually which can help identify how much money they have left over after expenses to potential spend on a brand. The final factor to explain is education, whether a person went to school or not, what school they attended, what standard of education they have, diplomas, certificates, graduate, degrees, masters, Ph.D. or other forms of defining educational factors. Knowing this information can help an advertiser understand their target markets level of thinking to help adapt the advertising campaign to be understood by the given target consumer/s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

For a business to successfully find the appropriate Target Market for their products or services, it is important that they segment the market to better decide which customers to target. This is best done when the market is segmented into the four following areas: geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioural.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Geographic segmentation involves the market being divided into different nations, regions, states, counties, cities, or neighbourhoods. Segmenting the Target market geographically is effective as different areas have different needs, which can be affected by weather, fashion, etc.

Demographic segmentation separates the market into groups according to age, gender, family size, income, occupation, education, religion, nationality, and race. It is important to note that this is the easiest and least expensive way to segment the market, as the research has already been done.

Psychographic segmentation is the process of markets being divided into groups based on social class, personality characteristics, and values.

Behavioural segmentation “divides a market into groups based on consumer knowledge, attitude, use, or response to a product” (Krause, T. 2007). This is believed to be the best starting point, when a business is building a market segment. The behavioural segment is important because it focuses on why consumers consume products. For example, during Father’s day and Mother’s day, flowers were promoted due to the heavy demand of flowers during these holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Target_Marketing.aspx|title=Target Marketing Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Target Marketing|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defining the target market helps businesses and individuals design a marketing campaign. This in turns helps businesses/ individuals avoid waste and get their advertisements to likely customers. While attempting to find the correct target market it is important to focus on specific groups of individuals that will benefit from your product. By marketing to specific groups of individuals that specifically relate to the product, businesses and individuals will more quickly and efficiently find those who will purchase the product. Businesses and individuals that monitor their existing data (customer and sales data) will find it easier to define their target market, and surveying existing customers will assist in finding more customers.  Avoiding inefficiencies when finding a target market is equally as important. Wasting time and money advertising to a large group of potential customers is inefficient if only a handful become customers. A focused plan that reaches a tiny audience can work out well if they’re already interested in what you’re selling. Over time target markets can change. People interested today might not be interested tomorrow, and those not interested in the present time, might become interested over time. Analysing sales data and customer information helps businesses and individuals understand when their target market is increasing or decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-defining-target-market-69728.html|title=The Importance of Defining a Target Market|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many advantages that are associated with finding your Target Market. One advantage is the “ability to offer the right product” (Suttle. R. 2016) through knowing the age and needs of the customer willing to purchase the item. Another advantage of Target Marketing assists businesses in understanding what price the customer will pay for the products or service. Businesses are also more efficient and effective at advertising their product, because they “reach the right consumers with messages that are more applicable” (Suttle. R. 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/broad-targeting-advantages-marketing-25610.html|title=The Broad Targeting Advantages in Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are several disadvantages that can be associated with Target Marketing. Firstly, finding your Target Market is expensive. Often businesses conduct primary research to find whom their Target Market is, which usually involves hiring a research agency, which can cost “tens of thousands of dollars” (Suttle, R. 2016). Finding ones Target Market is also time-consuming, as it often “requires a considerable amount of time to identify a target audience” (Suttle, R. 2016). Also focusing on finding your Target Market can make you overlook other customers that are interested in your product. Businesses/ Individuals may find that their ‘average customer’ might not include those that fall just outside of the average customers “demographics” (Suttle, R. 2016), which will limit the sale of their products. The last disadvantage to note is the ethical ramifications that are associated with Target Marketing. An example of this would be a “beer company that may target less educated, poorer people with larger-sized bottles” (Suttle, R. 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/disadvantages-target-marketing-36131.html|title=The Disadvantages of Target Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positioning ==
{{Confusing section|small=no|date=March 2017}}
In advertising various brands compete to overtake the perceptual mapping in a consumers mind. Everyday consumers view advertising and rank particular brands compared to their competitors. Individuals rank these specific brands in an order of what is most important to them. For example, a person may compare brands of cars based on how sporty they think they look, affordability, practicality and classiness. How one person perceives a brand is different to another but is largely left to the advertising campaign to manipulate and create the perception that they want you to envision as the consumer. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Positioning is an important marketing concept that businesses implement to market their products or services. The positioning concept focuses on creating an image that will best attract the intended audience.  Businesses that implement the positioning concept focus on promotion, price, placement and product. When the positioning concept is effective and productive it elevates the marketing efforts made by a business, and assists the buyer in purchasing the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/positioning-marketing-plan-22983.html|title=What Is Positioning in a Marketing Plan?|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positioning process is imperative in marketing because of the specific level of consumer-based recognition is involved. A company must create a trademark brand for themselves in order to be recognizable by a broad range of consumers. For example, a fast food restaurant positions itself as fast, cheap, and delicious. They are playing upon their strengths and most visible characteristics. On the other hand a luxury car brand will position its brand as a stylish and expensive platform because they want to target a specific brand very different than the fast food brand. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://strategiccfo.com/market-positioning/|title=Market Positioning • The Strategic CFO|date=2013-07-24|work=The Strategic CFO|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the positioning concept to be effective one must focus on the concepts of promotion, price, place and product.

There are three basic objectives of promotion, which include: presenting product information to targeted business customers and consumers, increase demand among the target market, and differentiating a product and creating a brand identity. Tools that can be used to achieve these objectives are advertising, public relations, personal selling, direct marketing, and sales promotion.

Price of an object is crucial in the concept of positioning. Adjusting or decreasing the product price has a profound impact on the sales of the product, and should complement the other parts of the positioning concept. The price needs to ensure survival, increase profit, generate survival, gain market shares, and establish an appropriate image.

Positioning a product is essential in the positioning concept. It is the process marketers use to communicate their products’ attributes to the intended target market. In order for products to be successful businesses must focus on the customer needs, competitive pressures, available communication channels and carefully crafted key messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-product-positioning-marketing-plan-24275.html|title=The Importance of Product Positioning to the Marketing Plan|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product Positioning presents several advantages in the advertising campaign, and to the businesses/ individuals that implement it. Positioning connects with superior aspects of a product and matches “them with consumers more effectively than competitors” (Jaideep, S. 2016). Positioning can also help businesses or individuals realise the consumer’s expectations of the product/s they are willing to purchase from them. Positioning a product reinforces the companies name, product and brand. It also makes the brand popular and strengthens customer loyalty. Product benefits to customers are better advertised through positioning the product, which results in more interest and attention of consumers. This also attracts different types of consumers as products posse’s different benefits that attract different groups of consumers, for example: a shoe that is advertised for playing sports, going for walks, hiking and casual wear will attract different groups of consumers. Another advantage of positioning is the competitive strength it gives to businesses/ individuals and their products, introducing new products successfully to the market and communicating new and varied features that are added to a product later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marketing/product/top-10-benefits-of-product-positioning/48605/|title=Top 10 Benefits of Product Positioning|website=YourArticleLibrary.com: The Next Generation Library|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication Process Diagram ==

The Communication of processes diagram refers to the order of operation an advertising campaign pieces together the flow of communication between a given organisation and the consumer. The diagram usually flows left to right (unless shown in a circular array) starting with the source. An advertising campaign uses the communication process diagram to ensure all the appropriate steps of communication are being taken in order.

The &lt;u&gt;source&lt;/u&gt; is the person or organisation that has a message they want to share with potential consumers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Belch,G., &amp; Belch, M. A. (2012) ''Advertisng and promotion: AN integrated marketing communication perspective'' (9th ed.) New York, NY: McGraw- Hill Irwin page 147- 158&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is Vodafone wanting to tell their consumers and new consumers of a new monthly plan.

The diagram then moves on to &lt;u&gt;encoding&lt;/u&gt; which consists of the organisation putting messages, thoughts and ideas into a symbolic form that be interpreted by the target consumer using symbols or words.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The third stage in the diagram is &lt;u&gt;channel message&lt;/u&gt;. This occurs when the information or meaning the source wants to convoy, is put into a form to easily be transmitted to the targeted audience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This also includes the method that communication gets from the source to the receiver. Examples of this is Vodafone advertising on TV, bus stops and university campuses as students may be the intended consumer for the new plan.

&lt;u&gt;Decoding&lt;/u&gt; is the processes that the viewer interprets the message that the source sent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Obviously it is up to the source to ensure that the message encoded well enough so that it is received as intended.

The &lt;u&gt;receiver&lt;/u&gt; is also known as the viewer or potential consumer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is the person who interprets the source message through channeling whether they are the intended target audience or not. Every day we interpret different advertisements even if we are not the target audience for that advertisement.

In between these steps there are external factors acting as distractions, these factors are called &lt;u&gt;noise&lt;/u&gt;. Noise distorts the way the message gets to the intended target audience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These distractions are from all other forms of advertising and communication from every other person or organisation. Examples of noise are State of mind, unfamiliar language, unclear message, Values, Attitudes, Perceptions, Culture and Knowledge of similar products or services to name a few forms of noise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Finally there is the &lt;u&gt;response or feedback&lt;/u&gt;. This is the &lt;u&gt;receiver’s&lt;/u&gt; reaction to the communication of message&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the way they understood it. &lt;u&gt;Feedback&lt;/u&gt; relates to the way sales react as well as the interest or questions that arise in relation to the message put out.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Touch Points ==

[[File:Customer journey with touchpoints English.png|thumb|Customer journey with touchpoints English]]
When considering touch points in an advertising campaign a brand looks Multisensory touch points. These touch points help the brand to develop a point of contact between themselves and the consumer. Modern day advancements in various forms of technology have made it easier for consumers to engage with brands in numerous ways. The most successful touch points are those that create value in the consumer and brands relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Persson, J. (n.d.). ''Brand TouchPoint'' ''Matrix''. Retrieved March 19, 2016 from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://brandtouchpointmatrix.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of touch points include social media links, QR codes, person handing out flyers about a particular brand, billboards, web sites and various other methods that connect the brand and consumer.

Multi sensory touch points are subconscious yet helps use to recognise brands through characteristic identified through human sensors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Heath, R., Brandt, D., &amp; Nairn, A. (2006). Brand relationships: Strengtheng. by emotion, weakened by attention. ''Journal of Advertising Research, 46''(4), 410-419.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics could be shape, colour, textures, sounds, smell or tastes associated with a given brand.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is important for an advertising campaign to consider sensory cues into their campaign as market places continue to become increasingly competitive and crowded. Anyone of the given sensory characteristics may remind a person of the brand they best associate with. A prime example of this is Red Bull who use the colour, shapes and size of their cans to best relate their product to success and winning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A taller can looks like the 1st place podium when placed next to competitors, the design looks like the finish flag in racing representing winning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The opportunity for an advertising campaign to succeed is significantly increased with the use of multi sensory touch points used as a point of difference between brands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Guerrilla marketing==

Guerrilla marketing is an advertising strategy which increases brand exposure through the use of unconventional campaigns which initiate social discussion and "buzz". This can often be achieved with lower budgets than conventional advertising methods, allowing small and medium-sized businesses the chance to compete against larger competitors. Through unconventional methods, inventiveness and creativity, guerrilla marketing leaves the receiver with a long lasting impression of the brand as most guerrilla marketing campaigns target the receivers at a personal level, taking them by surprise and may incorporate an element of shock. Guerrilla marketing is typically executed exclusively in public places, including streets, parks, shopping centres etc., to ensure maximum audience resulting in further discussion on social media.&lt;ref&gt;Hutter, K., &amp; Hoffmann, S. (2011). Guerrilla marketing: The nature of the concept and propositions for further research. Asian Journal of Marketing, 5(2), 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla marketing is the term used for several types of marketing categories including street marketing, ambient marketing, presence marketing, alternative marketing, experimental marketing, grassroots marketing, wild posting, guerrilla projection advertising, undercover marketing and [[astroturfing]].{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Jay Conrad Levinson coined the term ''Guerrilla Marketing'' with his 1984 book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Paksoy, T &amp; Chang, C. (2010). Applied Mathematical Modelling. Revised multi-choice goal programming for multi-period, multi-stage inventory controlled supply chain model with popup stores in Guerrilla marketing, 34(34), 3586-3587&lt;/ref&gt; Through the enhancement of technology and common use of internet and mobile phones, marketing communication has become more affordable and guerrilla marketing is on the rise, allowing the spread of newsworthy guerrilla campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kolegjifama.eu/materialet/Biblioteka%20Elektronike/Chaotics%20The%20Business%20of%20Managing%20and%20Marketing%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Turbulence.pdf|title=Chaotics - The Business of Managing and Marketing in the Age of Turbulance.|author1=Kotler, P  |author2=Caslione, J|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When establishing a guerrilla marketing strategy, there are seven elements to a clear and logical approach.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 1989"&gt;Levinson, J. (1989). Guerrilla Marketing Attack – New Stratigies, Tactics and Weapson for Winning Big Profits for your Small Business). Boston, United States of America: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, write a statement that identifies the purpose of the strategy. Secondly define how the purpose will be achieved concentrating on the key advantages. Next Levinson (1989) suggests writing a descriptive summary on the target market or consumers. The fourth element is to establish a statement that itemizes the marketing tools and methods planning to be used in the strategy (for example, radio advertising during 6.30am – 9am on weekday mornings or window displays that are regularly updated). The fifth step is to create a statement which positions the brand/product/company in the market. Define the brands characteristics and give it an identity is the sixth element. Lastly, clearly identify a budget which will be put solely towards marketing going forward.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 1989"/&gt;

For a successful overall guerrilla marketing campaign, combine the above steps with seven winning actions.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrilla Marketing Attack – New Stratigies, Tactics and Weapons for Winning Big Profits for your Small Business). Boston, United States of America: Houghton Mifflin Company.  p39&lt;/ref&gt; These seven principles are commitment – stick to the marketing plan without changing it; investment – appreciate that marketing is an investment, consistency – ensure the marketing message and strategy remains consistent across all forms of, confidence – show confidence in the commitment to the guerrilla marketing strategy, patience – time and dedication to the strategy, assortment – incorporate different methods of advertising and marketing for optimum results, and subsequent – build customer loyalty and retention though follow up marketing post-sale.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 1989"/&gt;

Levinson suggests guerrilla marketing tactics were initiated to enable small businesses with limited financial resources to gain an upper hand on the corporate giants who had unlimited budgets and resources at their disposal. Large companies cottoned on to the success of guerrilla marketing and have had hundreds of effective attention grabbing campaigns using the strategies originally designed for smaller businesses with minimal marketing budgets.&lt;ref&gt;McNaughton, M. (2008). Guerrilla communication, visual consumption, and consumer public relations. Public Relations Review, 34(1), 303-305.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-traditional, unconventional and shocking campaigns are highly successful in obtaining media coverage and therefore brand awareness, albeit good or bad media attention. However, like most marketing strategies a bad campaign can backfire and damage profits and sales.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 2010"&gt;Levinson, J. &amp; Gibson, S. (2010). Guerrilla Social Media Marketing: 100+ Weapons to Grow Your Online Influence, Attract Customers, and Drive Profits. California, United States of America: Entrepreneur Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Undercover marketing and astroturfing are two type of guerrilla marketing that are deemed as risky and can be detrimental to the company.&lt;ref name="Levinson, J. 2010"/&gt;

“Advertising can be dated back to 4000 BC where Egyptians used papyrus to make sales messages and wall posters. Traditional advertising and marketing slowly developed over the centuries but never bloomed until early 1900s” ("What Is Guerrilla Marketing?", 2010). Guerrilla marketing are relatively simple, use tactics to advertise on a very small budget. It is to make a campaign that is “shocking, funny, unique, outrageous, clever and creative that people can’t stop talking about it” (Uk essays, 2016). Guerrilla marketing is different when compared to traditional marketing tactics (Staff, 2016).  “Guerrilla marketing means going after conventional goals of profits, sales and growth but doing it by using unconventional means, such as expanding offerings during gloomy economic days to inspire customers to increase the size of each purchase” (Staff, 2016).  Guerrilla marketing also suggests that rather than investing money, it is better to “invest time, energy, imagination and knowledge” (Staff, 2016) instead. Guerrilla marketing puts profit as their main priority not sales as their main focal point, this is done to urge the growth of geometrically by enlarging the size of each transactions. This all done through one of the most powerful marketing weapons around, the telephone. Research shows that it will always increases profits and sales. The term “guerrilla first appeared during the war of independence in Spain and Portugal at the beginning of the 19th century it can be translated as battle” (Uk essays, 2016).  Even thou guerrilla marketing was aimed for small business; this did not stop bigger business from adopting the same ideology. “Larger business has been using unconventional marketing to complement their advertising campaigns, even then some marketers argue that when bigger business utilize guerrilla marketing tactics, it isn’t true guerrilla” ("What Is Guerrilla Marketing?", 2010).  The reason being that larger companies have bigger budgets and usually their brands well established.  In some cases, it is far riskier for a larger business to do guerrilla marketing tactics. Which can cause problem when their stunts become a flop when compared to smaller business, as they do not run as much risk, as most people will just write it off as another failed stunt.  Many methods in guerrilla marketing consist of “graffiti (or reverse graffiti, where a dirty wall is selectively cleaned), interactive displays, intercept encounters in public spaces, flash mobs, or various PR stunts are often used” ("Guerrilla Marketing | What is Guerrilla Marketing?” 2016).

Small business use social media as a form of marketing. This Is due to that social media in the 21st century is phenomenon. “Collecting billions of people around the world through a series of status updates, tweets, and other rich media” ("Guerrilla Marketing Strategies for Small Businesses", 2013). Social media is a powerful tool in the world of business. Guerrilla marketing strategies and tactics are a great and cost effective way to generate” awareness for your business, products and services. To maximize full potential in your marketing efforts, it’s to blend them with a powerful and robust online marking strategy with a marketing automation software” ("Guerrilla Marketing Strategies for Small Businesses", 2013). Which can boost small businesses. Guerrilla tactics consist of instruments that have effects on the efforts. Some instruments are usually there to maximize the surprise effect and some of these instruments mainly cutting advertising costs.” Guerrilla marketing is a way of increasing the number of individuals exposed to the advertising with the cost of campaign. The instrument of diffusion helps to each a wide audience, which causes none or little cost because consumers (viral marketing) or the media (guerrilla PR) pass on the advertising message” ("Guerrilla Marketing: The Nature of the Concept and Propositions for Further Research", 2016).  Guerrilla campaigns usually implement a free ride approach, this means that to cut their costs and increase the number of recipients simultaneously to maximize the low cost effect. For example, they will try to benefit from placing advertisements on big events e.g. sporting events. Guerrilla marketing was regarded to target existing customers rather than new ones, aiming to increase their engagement with a product and/ or brand. “When selecting audiences for a guerrilla message, a group that is already engaged with the product at some level is the best target; they will be quicker to recognize and respond to creative tactics, and more likely to share the experience with their friends, as social media has become a major feature of the market landscape, guerrilla marketing has shown to be particularly effective online. Consumers who regularly use social media are more likely to share their interactions with guerrilla marketing, and creative advertising can quickly go viral” ("Guerrilla Marketing | What is Guerrilla Marketing?", 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Guerrilla Marketing | What is Guerrilla Marketing?.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19109">The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] defines '''aging in place''' as "the ability to live in one's own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Places Terminology|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/terminology.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental gerontology ==
Research in environmental [[gerontology]] indicates the importance of the physical and social environment of [[housing]] and the [[neighborhood]] (public space), as well as its implications for aging in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sánchez-González, Diego |author2=Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Vicente|title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America.

== Preference ==

Most adults would prefer to age in place—that is, remain in their home of choice as long as possible. In fact, 90 percent of adults over the age of 65 report that they would prefer to stay in their current residence as they [[Ageing|age]].&lt;ref name="A Report to the National Livable Communities: Creating Environments for Successful Aging"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/il/beyond_50_communities.pdf |title=A Report to the National Livable Communities: Creating Environments for Successful Aging |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-third of American households are home to one or more residents 60 years of age or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cronin, Anne |author2=Marybeth Mandich|title=Human Development and Performance Throughout the Lifespan|year=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1133951193|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Home modifications ==

There exist many risks for injury to older adults in the common household, therefore impacting upon their capability to successfully age in place. Among the greatest threats to an ability to age in place is falling. According to the CDC, falls are the leading cause of injurious death among older adults. Therefore, engagement in fall prevention is crucial to one's ability to age in place. Common features in an everyday household, such as a lack of support in the shower or bathroom, inadequate railings on the stairs, loose throw rugs, and obstructed pathways are all possible dangers to an older person. However, simple and low-cost modifications to an older person's home can greatly decrease the risk of falling, as well as decreasing the risk of other forms of injury. Consequently, this increases the likelihood that one can age in place.&lt;ref name="Aging in Place at Home: The Definitive Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thehelpinghome.com/aging-in-place-at-home-definitive-guide-part1/ |title=Aging in Place at Home: The Definitive Guide |accessdate=2017-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of home modifications include: increased lighting, accessible switches at both ends of the stairs, additional railings, grab bars, nonskid flooring, a hand-held flexible shower head, walk-in bathtubs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therapytubs.com|title=Premier Walk In Tubs from TherapyTubs.com|website=www.therapytubs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the removal of throw rugs and clutter.&lt;ref name="Aging in Place at Home: The Definitive Guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.homemods.org/directory/nrcshhm/index.htm |title=The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, home modifications can be simple and cost-effective, while simultaneously offering substantial benefits to the individual. Other modifications to the home – especially those that require retrofitting – are a little more costly due to increased complexity of installation. These can include: ramps for accessible entry and exit, walk-in shower, sliding shelves, stairlifts, or even home elevators. Many homes are built or retrofitted with the [[Universal design]] model in mind, which makes everything in the home accessible to all people with or without functional limitations.&lt;ref name="The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification" /&gt;

==Resources in the community==
Naturally occurring retirement communities, also known as NORCS, are another source of support for older adults wishing to age in place.  A NORC, though not built specifically for a certain age demographic, occurs where a congregation of residents 60 and older live cooperatively.  Some offer recreational activities, preventative health and social services for the community.  This model can be supported by local, state, and federal dollars as well as community businesses, neighborhood associations and private foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NORC|url=http://www.philanthropicgroup.com/giaaip050409v2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological changes==
In some cases, the [[caregivers]] of people who are aging in place seek to persuade them to adopt new technology, which may include learning new skills and changing their daily routine to incorporate the technology.&lt;ref name="Peek 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peek|first1=Sebastiaan T.M.|last2=Wouters|first2=Eveline J.M.|last3=van Hoof|first3=Joost|last4=Luijkx|first4=Katrien G.|last5=Boeije|first5=Hennie R.|last6=Vrijhoef|first6=Hubertus J.M.|title=Factors influencing acceptance of technology for aging in place: A systematic review|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=April 2014|volume=83|issue=4|pages=235–248|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2014}}, there is research about how people aging in place try to use new technology when persuaded, but not much research about the extent to which they continue to use it after trying it for some time.&lt;ref name="Peek 2014"/&gt; Factors which contribute to the decision to try to technology are the anticipated benefits of the technology, the difficulty using it, the extent to which the user feels that harm will come from not using it, the availability of alternatives, support from others in their social circle, and their own personal attitudes and disposition.&lt;ref name="Peek 2014"/&gt;

==Biological reasons==
Many elders have difficulties with everyday functioning that require modifications to the houses or apartments they live in. There are several reasons why these changes happen:
*Motor functioning: In a 2002 study by Min Soo Kang, it was reported that of the elder population in America, 18% will have a disability. This calculates to 51 million Americans who have difficulties in functioning every day. 32% over age 65 will have difficulty walking, which may require use of walkers, wheelchairs and canes. To make life easier for the elder, some modifications that can aid them are wider entrances, grab rails, elevator chairs on stairs, etc.
*Fine motor functioning: Elders may have difficulty using their fingers, which can be problematic. As a result, modifications to handles, bathroom fixtures, etc. can aid with this problem.
*Cognitive functioning: It was reported in Kochera (2002) that 1 out of 5 people over the age of 55 will have a mental health disorder.  Due to the deterioration, the five senses and cognitive capability decrease and cause slower responses.  As a result, fire hazards may not be noticed, which can be very important when setting up fire alarms, exits, etc.

==Examples==
Aging in place can be further defined by:

# Aging in place without urgent needs: This group includes individuals who want to stay in their current home, are not experiencing immediate health/mobility issues, and prefer aging in place.
# Aging in place with progressive condition-based needs: This group is made up of those with chronic or progressive conditions that will require special modifications for aging in place. These individuals are usually aware of their needs but meeting them is not necessarily urgent. Many have chronic conditions such as diabetes and lung/heart disease that challenge them.
# Aging in place with traumatic change needs: This group includes those who experienced an abrupt or immediate change that demands adjustments in the living environment for aging in place such as home modifications or universal design.

==Careers in the field==
By working with a person's regular [[physician]] and other doctors, an [[Occupational therapist|Occupational Therapist]] (OT) can suggest changes to be made to a person's home in order to uniquely compensate for that particular patient's capabilities and disabilities.&lt;ref name="Occupational Therapy: Helping America Age in Place"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aota.org/News/Centennial/40313/Aging/Aging-in-Place.aspx |title=Occupational Therapy: Helping America Age in Place |format=website |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making an appointment and meeting with an Occupational Therapist, a patient is getting a one-on-one based session where the therapist is focused solely on that patient's limitations and is making strategies in order to modify the patient's home, making it safer and letting them keep their independence. OT's will work with contractors and occasionally local groups and volunteers to make home modifications ranging from small changes like better lighting to more extreme changes such as chair lifts instead of stairs. An OT will typically try to make low-cost adjustments in the initial stages, but once again this is based on each individual.&lt;ref name="REMAINING IN YOUR HOME AS YOU AGE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aota.org/-/media/corporate/files/aboutot/consumers/adults/aginginplace/remaining-in-place-aging.pdf |title=REMAINING IN YOUR HOME AS YOU AGE |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; OT's also provide services to older adults in community based scenarios focusing in health promotion.

== Initiatives worldwide ==

=== In Canada ===
In Ontario, Canada, aging in place is known as aging at home, and has received considerable financial support from the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care.

=== In United States ===
According to the [[United States Census]], 46 million people age 65+ lived in the United States in 2014 and this same segment of the population will grow to 74 million in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Older Americans 2016: Key Indicators of Well-Being|url=https://agingstats.gov/docs/LatestReport/Older-Americans-2016-Key-Indicators-of-WellBeing.pdf |date=2017-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Websites and organizations have sprung up all across the nation, in individual communities, states and nationwide to help people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. Aging in Place is an initiative of Partners for Livable Communities and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. It was developed to help America's communities prepare for the aging of their population and to become places that are good to grow up, live in and grow old. They have been working directly with nine laboratory communities to assist them in advancing policies, programs and services to promote Aging in Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=e Communities for All Ages Partners for Livable Communities|title=Aging in Place Initiative|url=http://livable.org/program-areas/livable-communities-for-all-ages-a-aging-in-place/the-aging-in-place-initiative|accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar network is the [[Elder Village]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/ppi/liv-com/fs177-village.pdf The Village: A Growing Option for Aging in Place], Fact Sheet 177, AARP Public Policy Institute, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart homes are also another development to help promote aging in place by integrating a range of monitoring and supportive devices. These homes have technology for physiological monitoring, functional monitoring for emergency detection and response, safety monitoring and assistance, security monitoring and assistance, social interaction monitoring and assistance and cognitive and sensory assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icaa.cc/wef/Global-Population-Ageing-Book.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122065922/http://www.icaa.cc/wef/Global-Population-Ageing-Book.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia Institute of Technology has developed a smart house. This house would help to address issues older adults face when living alone, such as physical and mental decline as well as awareness for family members. The house includes technology such as pendants which understand commands in the form of hand gestures. It could open and lock doors, close blinds, turn on lights, and more. There is also an in-home monitoring system that can inform family members about an older relative's daily activities, health status, and potential problems. This would allow older adults to remain in their own home while still maintaining their independence without their families having to worry about their well being. This is not the only smart house that has popped up.
The University of Florida has created one as well. It has smart refrigerators and pantries which can detect food consumption and expired products. Their smart laundry machines can coordinate with the smart closet to notify the resident when it is time to do laundry as well as aid in sorting the laundry. Every room is specially designed with these and many more smart features to aid their living situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Mynatt ED, Melenhorst AS, Fisk AD, Roger WA |title=Aware Technologies for Aging in Place:  Understanding User Needs and Attitudes|url=http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/~qmahmoud/teaching/fall2006/pervasive/aging.pdf|work=Georgia Institute of Technology|publisher=PERVASIVE computing|accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar technology has been done at the Washington State University, University of Texas, University of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Missouri, as well as in Osaka, Japan.

In December 2011,  AARP Policy Institute and the National Conference of State Legislatures released a report entitled, "Aging in Place:  A State Survey of Livability Policies and Practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Aging in place: Policies and Practices that work|url=http://www.aarp.org/home-garden/livable-communities/info-11-2011/solutions-forum-aging-in-place.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; to foster aging in place by giving state legislators examples of how laws, policies and programs can support this goal.  In addition to such governmental initiatives, livability can be optimized through the incorporation of universal design principles, telecare and other assistive technologies. Assistive technologies include communications, health and wellness monitoring, home safety and security.  Semico Research published a report in July 2013 claiming the health and wellness monitoring market for Aging in Place will reach $30 billion by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://semico.com/content/aging-place-internet-things-golden-years|title=Aging in Place:  The Internet of Things for the Golden Years - Semico Research|website=semico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly]] (PACE) model was created in the early 1970s in order to meet the chronic care needs of older people through their community. As an assistance program, one must be at least 55 years of age, certified by their state to need nursing home care, are able to live safely in the community at the time of enrollment, and live in a PACE service area. The goal of the PACE program is to care for the chronic care needs of older individuals while providing them with the ability to live independently, or age in place in their homes, for as long as possible. In order to make independent living possible for this population, the PACE program provides services, such as physical therapy, respite care, prescription drugs, social services, nutritional counseling, and much more. Since 2011, PACE has 82 operational programs in 29 states, and is continuing to expand today.&lt;ref name="National PACE Association"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npaonline.org/website/article.asp?id=12 |title=National PACE Association |publisher=Npaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Middle Eastern and Asian countries ===
For many countries in the Middle and Far East, it is part of the cultural beliefs for older adults to age in place. Many children believe it to be their duty to care for their parents as they age and therefore will move in with their parents when their assistance is needed. In many Middle Eastern countries, nursing homes are just recently coming into existence due to cultural and generational shifts towards Western values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegland|first=Mary Elaine|title=The Cultural Context of Aging: Worldwide Perspectives|year=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport CT|isbn=978-0-275-99288-0|pages=303–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Close Relationships|emotions}}
In [[psychology]], the [[theory of attachment]] can be applied to adult relationships including friendships, emotional affairs, adult romantic or platonic relationships and in some cases relationships with inanimate objects ("[[transitional objects]]").&lt;ref name= "Hooley JM, Wilson-Murphy M"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hooley JM.|author2=Wilson-Murphy M.|title=Adult attachment to transitional objects and borderline personality disorder|pmid=22486448|doi=10.1521/pedi.2012.26.2.179|volume=26|journal=J Pers Disord|pages=179-91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory, initially studied in the 1960s and 1970s primarily in the context of children and parents, was extended to adult relationships in the late 1980s.

Four main styles of attachment have been identified in adults:
*secure
*anxious-preoccupied
*dismissive-avoidant
*fearful-avoidant

Investigators have explored the organization and the stability of mental ''working models'' that underlie these attachment styles. They have also explored how attachment impacts relationship outcomes and how attachment functions in relationship dynamics.

==Extending attachment theory==
[[Mary Ainsworth]] and [[John Bowlby]] founded modern attachment theory on studies of children and their caregivers. Children and caregivers remained the primary focus of attachment theory for many years. Then, in the late 1980s, Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult relationships.&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 87"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hazan C. |author2=Shaver P.R. |title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=511–24 |date=March 1987 |pmid=3572722 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/52/3/511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1990 | title = Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 270–280 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazan and Shaver noticed that interactions between adults shared similarities to interactions between children and caregivers. For example, romantic or platonic partners desire to be close to one another. Adults feel comforted when their attachments are present and anxious or lonely when they are absent. Romantic relationships, for example, serve as a secure base that help people face the surprises, opportunities, and challenges life presents. Similarities such as these led Hazan and Shaver to extend attachment theory to adult relationships.

Relationships between adults differ in many ways from relationships between children and caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~rcfraley/attachment.htm|title=A Brief Overview of Adult Attachment Theory and Research {{!}} R. Chris Fraley|website=internal.psychology.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is not that these two kinds of relationships are identical. The claim is that the core principles of attachment theory apply to both kinds of relationships.

Investigators tend to describe the core principles of attachment theory in light of their own theoretical interests. Their descriptions seem quite different on a superficial level. For example, Fraley and Shaver&lt;ref name="Fraley Shaver 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraley | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 2000 | title = Adult attachment: Theoretical developments, emerging controversies, and unanswered questions | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 132–154 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.132}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe the "central propositions" of attachment in adults as follows:
* The emotional and behavioral dynamics of infant–caregiver relationships and adult relationships are governed by the same biological system.
* The kinds of individual differences observed in infant–caregiver relationships are similar to the ones observed in various close adult relationships.
* Individual differences in adult attachment behavior are reflections of the expectations and beliefs people have formed about themselves and their close relationships on the basis of their attachment histories; these "working models" are relatively stable and, as such, may be reflections of early caregiving experiences.
* Romantic love, as commonly conceived, involves the interplay of attachment, caregiving and intimacy.

Compare this with the five "core propositions" of attachment theory listed by Rholes and Simpson:&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson 04"&gt;Rholes, W.S. &amp; Simpson, J.A. (2004). Attachment theory: Basic concepts and contemporary questions. In W.S. Rholes and J.A. Simpson (Eds.), ''Adult Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Implications'', pp. 3–14. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although the basic impetus for the formation of attachment relationships is provided by biological factors, the bonds that children form with their caregivers are shaped by interpersonal experience.
* Experiences in earlier relationships create internal working models and attachment styles that systematically affect attachment relationships.
* The attachment orientations of adult caregivers influence the attachment bond their children have with them.
* Working models and attachment orientations are relatively stable over time, but they are not impervious to change.
* Some forms of psychological maladjustment and clinical disorders are attributable in part to the effects of insecure working models and attachment styles.

While these two lists clearly reflect the theoretical interests of the investigators who created them, a closer look reveals a number of shared themes. The shared themes claim that:
* People are biologically driven to form attachments with others, but the process of forming attachments is influenced by learning experiences.
* Individuals form different kinds of attachments depending on the expectations and beliefs they have about their relationships. These expectations and beliefs constitute internal "working models" used to guide relationship behaviors.
* Internal "working models" are relatively stable even though they can be influenced by experience.
* Individual differences in attachment can contribute positively or negatively to mental health and to the quality of relationships with others.

No doubt these themes could be described in a variety of ways (and other themes added to the list). Regardless of how one describes the core principles of attachment theory, the key insight is that the same principles of attachment apply to close relationships throughout the lifespan. The principles of attachment between children and caregivers are fundamentally the same as the principles of attachment between adults.

==Styles==
Adults are described as having 4 attachment styles: Secure, Anxious-preoccupied, Dismissive-avoidant, and Fearful-avoidant.

The secure attachment style in adults corresponds to the secure attachment style in children. The anxious–preoccupied attachment style in adults corresponds to the anxious-ambivalent attachment style in children. However, the dismissive-avoidant attachment style and the fearful-avoidant attachment style, which are distinct in adults, correspond to a single avoidant attachment style in children. The descriptions of adult attachment styles offered below are based on the relationship questionnaire devised by Bartholomew and Horowitz&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartholomew K, Horowitz LM |title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=226–44 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1920064 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/61/2/226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on a review of studies by Pietromonaco and Barrett.&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 97"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pietromonaco PR, Barrett LF |title=Working models of attachment and daily social interactions |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=1409–23 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9418285 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1409 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/73/6/1409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several attachment-based treatment approaches that can be used with adults.&lt;ref name="Sable 00"&gt;Sable, P., (2000). Attachment &amp; Adult Psychotherapy. Northvale NJ: Aaronson.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is an approach to treating couples based on [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 02"&gt;Johnson, S., (2002). Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy with Trauma Survivors. NY: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure===
Securely attached people tend to agree with the following statements: "It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me." This style of attachment usually results from a history of warm and responsive interactions with their attachments. Securely attached people tend to have positive views of themselves and their attachments. They also tend to have positive views of their relationships. Often they report greater satisfaction and adjustment in their relationships than people with other attachment styles. Securely attached people feel comfortable both with intimacy and with independence. 

Secure attachment and adaptive functioning are promoted by a caregiver who is emotionally available and appropriately responsive to his or her child's attachment behavior, as well as capable of regulating both his or her positive and negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sable|first=Pat|title=What is Adult Attachment?|journal=Clin Soc Work J|date=2008|volume=36 |pages=21–30 |doi=10.1007/s10615-007-0110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure===

==== Anxious-preoccupied ====
People with anxious-preoccupied attachment type tend to agree with the following statements: "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." People with this style of attachment seek high levels of [[intimacy]], approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy to such an extent that they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared with securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often [[doubt]] their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, [[emotional dysregulation]], worry, and [[impulsiveness]] in their relationships.

==== Dismissive-avoidant ====
People with a dismissive style of avoidant attachment tend to agree with these statements: "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", "It is  important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient", and "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." People with this attachment style desire a high level of independence. The desire for independence often appears as an attempt to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient and invulnerable to feelings associated with being closely attached to others. They often deny needing close relationships. Some may even view close relationships as relatively unimportant. Not surprisingly, they seek less intimacy with attachments, whom they often view less positively than they view themselves. Investigators commonly note the [[Defense mechanism|defensive]] character of this attachment style. People with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style tend to suppress and hide their feelings, and they tend to deal with [[Social rejection|rejection]] by distancing themselves from the sources of rejection (e.g. their attachments or relationships).

==== Fearful-avoidant ====
People with losses or other trauma, such as sexual abuse in childhood and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contextualizing the effects of childhood sexual abuse on adult self- and social functioning: an attachment theory perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213499000812 | doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(99)00081-2 | volume=23|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|pages=1141–1157}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to agree with the following statements: "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to other people."
They tend to feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness, and the mixed feelings are combined with sometimes unconscious, negative views about themselves and their attachments. They commonly view themselves as unworthy of responsiveness from their attachments, and they don't trust the intentions of their attachments. Similar to the dismissive-avoidant attachment style, people with a fearful-avoidant attachment style seek less intimacy from attachments and frequently suppress and deny their feelings. Because of this, they are much less comfortable expressing affection.

==Working models==
Bowlby observed that children learn from their interactions with caregivers. Over the course of many interactions, children form expectations about the accessibility and helpfulness of their caregivers. These expectations reflect children's thoughts about themselves and about their caregivers:
{{quote|Confidence that an attachment figure is, apart from being accessible, likely to be responsive can be seen to turn on at least two variables: (a) whether or not the attachment figure is judged to be the sort of person who in general responds to calls for support and protection; (b) whether or not the self is judged to be the sort of person towards whom anyone, and the attachment figure in particular, is likely to respond in a helpful way. Logically, these variables are independent. In practice they are apt to be confounded. As a result, the model of the attachment figure and the model of the self are likely to develop so as to be complementary and mutually confirming. (Bowlby, 1973, p. 238)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 73"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1973). Separation: Anxiety &amp; Anger, Volume 2 of Attachment and loss London. Hogarth Press; New York: Basic Books; Harmondsworth: Penguin (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Children's thoughts about their caregivers, together with thoughts about how deserving they are themselves of good care from their caregivers, form ''working models'' of attachment. Working models help guide behavior by allowing children to anticipate and plan for caregiver responses. Bowlby theorized that once formed,  working models remain relatively stable. Children usually interpret experiences in the light of their working models, rather than change their working models to fit new experiences. However, when experiences cannot be interpreted in the light of their working models children may then modify their working models.

When Hazen and Shaver extended attachment theory to romantic relationships in adults, they also included the idea of working models. Research into adult working models has focused on two issues. First, how are the thoughts that form working models organized in the mind? Second, how stable are working models across time? These questions are briefly discussed below.

===Organization of working models===
Bartholomew and Horowitz have proposed that working models consist of two parts.&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"/&gt; One part deals with thoughts about the self. The other part deals with thoughts about others. They further propose that a person's thoughts about self are generally positive or generally negative. The same applies to a person's thoughts about others. In order to test these proposals, Bartholomew and Horowitz have looked at the relationship between attachment styles, self-esteem, and sociability. The diagram below shows the relationships they observed:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ Security-based strategy of affect regulation
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="background: none;" |
! colspan=2 | Self-esteem&lt;br&gt;(thoughts about self)
|-
! Positive
! Negative

! rowspan=2 | Sociability&lt;br&gt;(thoughts about others)
! Positive
| Secure
| Anxious-preoccupied
|-
! Negative
| Dismissive-avoidant
| Fearful-avoidant
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The secure and dismissive attachment styles are associated with higher self-esteem compared with the anxious and fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure and anxious attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about others in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain can be characterized as generally positive or generally negative.

Baldwin and colleagues have applied the theory of relational schemas to working models of attachment. Relational schemas contain information about the way the attachment figure regularly interact with each other.&lt;ref name= "Baldwin 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1992 | title = Relational schemas and the processing of social information | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 461–484 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.112.3.461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1997 | title = Relational schemas as a source of if-then self-inference procedures | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 326–335 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.1.4.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each pattern of interaction that regularly occurs between partners, a relational schema is formed that contains:
* information about the self
* information about the attachment
* information about the way the interaction usually unfolds.

For example, if a person regularly asks his or her partner for a hug or kiss, and the partner regularly responds with a hug or kiss, the person forms a relational schema representing the predictable interaction. The schema contains information about the self (e.g., "I need lots of physical affection"). It also contains information about the partner (e.g., "My partner is an affectionate person"). And it contains information about the way the interaction usually unfolds, which can be summarized by an if–then statement (e.g., "''If'' I ask my partner for a hug or kiss, ''then'' my partner will respond with a hug or kiss and comfort me"). Relational schemas help guide behavior in relationships by allowing people to anticipate and plan for partner responses.

Baldwin and colleagues have proposed that working models of attachment are composed of relational schemas. The fact that relational schemas contain information about the self and information about others is consistent with previous conceptions of working models. The unique contribution of relational schemas to working models is the information about the way interactions with attachments usually unfold. Relational schemas add the if–then statements about interactions to working models. To demonstrate that working models are organized as relational schemas, Baldwin and colleagues created a set of written scenarios that described interactions dealing with trust, dependency and closeness.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr Keedian Seidel Thompson 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | last3 = Keedian | first3 = E. | last4 = Seidel | first4 = M. | last5 = Thompson | first5 = D.W. | year = 1993 | title = An exploration of the relational schemata underlying attachment styles: self-report and lexical decision approaches | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 746–754 | doi=10.1177/0146167293196010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the scenarios for closeness included:
* You want to spend more time with your attachment.
* You reach out to hug or kiss your partner.
* You tell your attachment how deeply you feel for him or her.

Following each scenario, people were presented with two options about how their attachments might respond. One option was "he/she accepts you." The other option was "he/she rejects you." People were asked to rate the likelihood of each response on a seven-point scale. Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles were more likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my partner will accept me." People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my attachment will reject me." Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas. Relational schemas may therefore be used to understand the organization of working models of attachment, as has been demonstrated in subsequent studies.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | year = 1995 | title = On the Instability of Attachment Style Ratings | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 247–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00090.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Keelan | first2 = J.P.R. | last3 = Fehr | first3 = B. | last4 = Enns | first4 = V. | last5 = Koh-Rangarajoo | first5 = E. | year = 1996 | title = Social-cognitive conceptualization of attachment working models: Availability and accessibility effects | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 94–109 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.1.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Meunier 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Meunier | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = The Cued Activation of Attachment Relational Schemas | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 209–227 | doi=10.1521/soco.1999.17.2.209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relational schemas involved in working models are likely organized into a hierarchy. According to Baldwin:
{{quote|A person may have a general working model of relationships, for instance, to the effect that others tend to be only partially and unpredictably responsive to one's needs. At a more specific level, this expectation will take different forms when considering different role relationships, such as customer or romantic partner. Within romantic relationships, expectations might then vary significantly depending on the specific attachment, or the specific situation, or the specific needs being expressed. (Baldwin, 1992, p. 429).&lt;ref name="Baldwin 92"/&gt;}}

The highest level of the hierarchy contains very general relational schemas that apply to all relationships. The next level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas that apply to particular kinds of relationships. The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relationship schemas that apply to specific relationships.

In fact, several theorists have proposed a hierarchical organization of working models.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 80"&gt;Bowlby, J.

{{quote|From this perspective, people do not hold a single set of working models of the self and others; rather, they hold a family of models that include, at higher levels, abstract rules or assumptions about attachment relationships and, at lower levels, information about specific relationships and events within relationships. These ideas also imply that working models are not a single entity but are multifaceted representations in which information at one level need not be consistent with information at another level. (Pietromonaco &amp; Barrett, 2000, page 159)&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pietromonaco | first1 = P.R. | last2 = Barrett | first2 = L.F. | year = 2000 | title = The internal working models concept: What do we really know about the self in relation to others? | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 155–175 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every hierarchy for working models includes both general working models (higher in the hierarchy) and relationship-specific working models (lower in the hierarchy). Studies have supported the existence of both general working models and relationship-specific working models. People can report a general attachment style when asked to do so, and the majority of their relationships are consistent with their general attachment style.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"/&gt; A general attachment style indicates a general working model that applies to many relationships. Yet, people also report different styles of attachments to their friends, parents and lovers.&lt;ref name="Trinke Bartholomew 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trinke | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1997 | title = Hierarchies of attachment relationships in young adulthood | url = | journal = [[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 603–625 | doi=10.1177/0265407597145002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Guardia Ryan Couchman Deci 00"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=La Guardia JG, Ryan RM, Couchman CE, Deci EL |title=Within-person variation in security of attachment: a self-determination theory perspective on attachment, need fulfillment, and well-being |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=367–84 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10981840 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.79.3.367 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/79/3/367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship-specific attachment styles indicate relationship-specific working models. Evidence that general working models and relationship-specific working models are organized into a hierarchy comes from a study by Overall, Fletcher and Friesen.&lt;ref name="Overall Fletcher Friesen 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Overall | first1 = N.C. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = G.J.O. | last3 = Friesen | first3 = M.D. | year = 2003 | title = Mapping the [[intimate relationship]] mind: Comparisons between three models of attachment representations | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 1479–1493 | doi=10.1177/0146167203251519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the mental working models that underlie attachment styles appear to contain information about self and information about others organized into relational schemas. The relational schemas are themselves organized into a three-tier hierarchy. The highest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for a general working model that applies to all relationships. The middle level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models that apply to different types of relationships (e.g., friends, parents, lovers). The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models of specific relationships.

===Stability of working models===
Investigators study the stability of working models by looking at the stability of attachment styles. Attachment styles reflect the thoughts and expectations that constitute working models. Changes in attachment styles therefore indicate changes in working models.

Around 70–80% of people experience no significant changes in attachment styles over time.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Merrick | first2 = S. | last3 = Treboux | first3 = D. | last4 = Crowell | first4 = J. | last5 = Albersheim | first5 = L. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: A twenty-year longitudinal study | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 684–689 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00176 | pmid=10953934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Hazen 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L. | last2 = Hazen | first2 = C. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment styles and close relationships: A four year prospective study | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 123–142 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00058.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J. | last2 = Noller | first2 = P. | year = 1992 | title = Attachment style and romantic love: Relationship dissolution | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 69–74 | doi=10.1080/00049539208260145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfe Bartholomew 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scharfe | first1 = E. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1994 | title = Reliability and stability of adult attachment patterns | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 23–43 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that attachment styles do not change for a majority of people indicates working models are relatively stable. Yet, around 20–30% of people do experience changes in attachment styles. These changes can occur over periods of weeks or months. The number of people who experience changes in attachment styles, and the short periods over which the changes occur, suggest working models are not rigid personality traits.

Why attachment styles change is not well understood. Waters, Weinfield and Hamilton propose that negative life experiences often cause changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Weinfield Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Weinfield | first2 = N.S. | last3 = Hamilton | first3 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = The stability of attachment styles from infancy to adolescence and early adulthood: General discussion | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 703–706 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their proposal is supported by evidence that people who experience negative life events also tend to experience changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = Continuity and discontinuity of attachment from infancy through adolescence | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 690–694 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinfield Sroufe Egelund 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinfield | first1 = N.

The study found that all four sets of factors cause changes in attachment styles. Changes in attachment styles are complex and depend on multiple factors.

==Relationship outcomes==
Adult relationships vary in their outcomes. The participants of some relationships express more [[Contentment|satisfaction]] than the participants of other relationships. The participants of some relationships stay together longer than the partners of other relationships. Does attachment influence the satisfaction and duration of relationships?

===Satisfaction===
Several studies have linked attachment styles to relationship satisfaction. People who have secure attachment styles usually express greater satisfaction with their relationships than people who have other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Brennan Shaver 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1995 | title = Dimensions of adult attachment, affect regulation, and romantic relationship functioning | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 267–283 | doi=10.1177/0146167295213008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, communication patterns and satisfaction across the life cycle of marriage | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 333–348 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00069.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1996 | title = Attachment, caregiving, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 401–416 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1996.tb00124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller Callan 94"&gt;Feeney, J.A., Noller, P., &amp; Callan, V.J.

Although the link between attachment styles and marital satisfaction has been firmly established, the mechanisms by which attachment styles influence marital satisfaction remain poorly understood. One mechanism may be communication. Secure attachment styles may lead to more constructive communication and more intimate self-disclosures, which in turn increase relationship satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Keelan Dion Dion 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keelan | first1 = J.P.R. | last2 = Dion | first2 = K.K. | last3 = Dion | first3 = K.L. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment style and relationship satisfaction: Test of a self-disclosure explanation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 24–35 | doi=10.1037/h0087055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms by which attachment styles may influence relationship satisfaction include emotional expressiveness,&lt;ref name="Feeney 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = Adult attachment, emotional control, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 169–185 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1999.tb00185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury Fincham 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | last3 = Fincham | first3 = F. | year = 1998 | title = Negative affectivity as a mediator of the association between adult attachment and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 467–484 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategies for coping with conflict,&lt;ref name="Lussier Sabourin Turgeon 97"/&gt; and perceived support from partners.&lt;ref name="Meyers Landsberger 02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cobb | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Davila | first2 = J. | last3 = Bradbury | first3 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment security and marital satisfaction: The role of positive perceptions and social support | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1131–1143 | doi=10.1177/0146167201279006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies are needed to better understand how attachment styles influence relationship satisfaction.

===Duration===
Some studies suggest people with secure attachment styles have longer-lasting relationships.&lt;ref name="Simpson 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | year = 1990 | title = Influence of attachment styles on romantic relationships | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 971–980 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duemmler Kobak 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duemmler | first1 = S.L. | last2 = Kobak | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = The development of commitment and attachment in dating relationships: attachment security as relationship construct | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 401–415 | doi=10.1006/jado.2001.0406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to commitment. People with secure attachment styles tend to express more commitment to their relationships. People with secure attachment styles also tend to be more satisfied with their relationships, which may encourage them to stay in their relationships longer. However, secure attachment styles are by no means a guarantee of long-lasting relationships.

Nor are secure attachment styles the only attachment styles associated with stable relationships. People with anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often find themselves in long-lasting, but unhappy, relationships.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Davis 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L.A. | last2 = Davis | first2 = K.E. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, gender, and relationship stability: A longitudinal analysis | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 502–512 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.3.502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment insecurity and the distinction between unhappy spouses who do and do not divorce | url = | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 371–393 | doi=10.1037/0893-3200.15.3.371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often involve anxiety about being abandoned and doubts about one's worth as a relationship. These kinds of feelings and thoughts may lead people to stay in unhappy relationships.

==Relationship dynamics==
Attachment plays a role in the way actors interact with one another. A few examples include the role of attachment in affect regulation, support, intimacy, and [[jealousy]]. These examples are briefly discussed below. Attachment also plays a role in many interactions not discussed in this article, such as conflict, communication and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson Stevens 98"&gt;Rholes, W.S., Simpson, J.A., &amp; Stevens, J.G.

===Affect regulation===
Bowlby, in studies with children, observed that certain kinds of events trigger anxiety, and that people try to relieve their anxiety by seeking closeness and comfort from caregivers.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982) Attachment, Vol. 1 of Attachment and loss. London: Hogarth Press. New York: Basic Books (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Three main sets of conditions trigger anxiety in children:
* Conditions of the child (fatigue, hunger, illness, pain, cold, etc.)
* Conditions involving the caregiver (caregiver absent, caregiver departing, caregiver discouraging of proximity, caregiver giving attention to another child, etc.)
* Conditions of the environment (alarming events, criticism or rejection by others)

The anxiety triggered by these conditions motivates the individuals to engage in behaviors that bring them physically closer to caregivers. A similar dynamic occurs in adults in relationships where others care about them. Conditions involving personal well-being, conditions involving a relationship partner, and conditions involving the environment can trigger anxiety in adults. Adults try to alleviate their anxiety by seeking physical and psychological closeness to their partners.

Mikulincer, Shaver and Pereg have developed a model for this dynamic.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | last3 = Pereg | first3 = D. | year = 2003 | title = Attachment theory and affect regulation: The dynamics, development, and cognitive consequences of attachment-related strategies | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 77–102 | doi=10.1023/a:1024515519160}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model, when people experience anxiety, they try to reduce their anxiety by seeking closeness with relationship partners. However, the partners may accept or reject requests for greater closeness. This leads people to adopt different strategies for reducing anxiety. People engage in three main strategies to reduce anxiety.

The first strategy is called the ''security-based'' strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the security-based strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Security Based.png|border|center|Security-based strategy of affect regulation.]]
A person perceives something that provokes anxiety. The person tries to reduce the anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. The attachment responds positively to the request for closeness, which reaffirms a sense of security and reduces anxiety. The person returns to her or his everyday activities.

The second strategy is called the ''hyperactivation'', or anxiety attachment, strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the hyperactivation strategy.

The events begin the same way. Something provokes anxiety in a person, who then tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to their attachment. The attachment rebuffs the request for greater closeness. The lack of responsiveness increases feelings of insecurity and anxiety. The person then gets locked into a cycle with the attachment: the person tries to get closer, the attachment rejects the request for greater closeness, which leads the person to try even harder to get closer, followed by another rejection from the attachment, and so on. The cycle ends only when the situation shifts to a security-based strategy (because the attachment finally responds positively) or when the person switches to an attachment avoidant strategy (because the person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment).

The third strategy is called the ''attachment avoidance'' strategy. The following diagram shows the sequence of events in the attachment avoidance strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Attachment Avoidance.png|border|center|Attachment avoidance strategy of affect regulation.]]
The events begin the same way as the security-based strategy. A person perceives something that triggers anxiety, and the person tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. But the attachment is either unavailable or rebuffs the request for closeness. The lack of responsiveness fuels insecurity and heightens anxiety. The person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment, suppresses her or his anxiety, and distances herself or himself from the attachment.

Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these strategies of regulating attachment anxiety have very different consequences.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"/&gt; The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave in a particular way and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts can encourage more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more negative thoughts and less creativity in handling problems and stressful situations. It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so that they can use security-based strategies for dealing with their anxiety.

===Support===
People feel less anxious when close to their attachments because their attachments can provide support during difficult situations. Support includes the comfort, assistance, and information people receive from their attachments.

Attachment influences both the perception of support from others and the tendency to seek support from others. People who have attachments who respond consistently and positively to requests for closeness allow individuals to have secure attachments, and in return they seek more support, in a generally relaxed way, while people whose attachments are inconsistent in reacting positively or regularly reject requests for support find they need to use other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Kobak Sceery 88"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobak | first1 = R.R. | last2 = Sceery | first2 = A. | year = 1988 | title = Attachment in late adolescence: Working models, affect regulation, and representations of self and others | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 135–146 | doi=10.2307/1130395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Florian Weller 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Florian | first2 = V. | last3 = Weller | first3 = A. | year = 1993 | title = Attachment styles, coping strategies, and post-traumatic psychological distress: The impact of the Gulf War in Israel | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 817–826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.5.817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson Rholes Nelligan 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Rholes | first2 = W.S. | last3 = Nelligan | first3 = J.S. | year = 1992 | title = Support seeking and support giving within couples in an anxiety provoking situation: The role of attachment styles | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 434–446 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.62.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Florian Mikulincer Bucholtz 95"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Florian V, Mikulincer M, Bucholtz I |title=Effects of adult attachment style on the perception and search for social support |journal=J Psychol |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=665–76 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7500299 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1995.9914937}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with secure attachment styles may trust their attachments to provide support because their attachments have reliably offered support in the past. They may be more likely to ask for support when it's needed. People with insecure attachment styles often do not have a history of supportive responses from their attachments. They may rely less on their attachments and be less likely to ask for support when it's needed, though there may be other factors involved, as well.

Changes in the way people perceive attachment tend to occur with changes in the way people perceive support. One study looked at college students' perceptions of attachment to their mothers, fathers, same-sex friends, and opposite-sex friends&lt;ref name="Asendorpf Wilpers 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asendorpf | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Wilpers | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security and available support: Closely linked relationship qualities | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 115–138 | doi=10.1177/0265407500171006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found that when students reported changes in attachment for a particular relationship, they usually reported changes in support for that relationship as well. Changes in attachment for one relationship did not affect the perception of support in other relationships. The link between changes in attachment and changes in support was relationship-specific.

===Intimacy===
Attachment theory has always recognized the importance of intimacy. Bowlby writes:
{{quote|Attachment theory regards the propensity to make intimate emotional bonds to particular individuals as a basic component of human nature, already present in germinal form in the neonate and continuing through adult life into old age. (Bowlby, 1988, pp. 120–121)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 88"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1988). A secure base. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The desire for intimacy has biological roots and, in the great majority of people, persists from birth until death. The desire for intimacy also has important implications for attachment. Relationships that frequently satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to more secure attachments. Relationships that rarely satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to less secure attachments.

Collins and Feeney have examined the relationship between attachment and intimacy in detail.&lt;ref name="Collins Feeney 04"&gt;Collins, N.L. &amp; Freeney, B.C. (2004). An Attachment Theory Perspective on Closeness and Intimacy. In D.J. Mashek &amp; A. Aron (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'', pp. 163–188. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They define intimacy as a special set of interactions in which a person discloses something important about himself or herself, and their attachment responds to the disclosure in a way that makes the person feel validated, understood, and cared for. These interactions usually involve verbal self-disclosure. However, intimate interactions can also involve non-verbal forms of self-expression such as touching, hugging, kissing, and sexual behavior. From this perspective, intimacy requires the following:
* willingness to disclose one's true thoughts, feelings, wishes, and fears
* willingness to rely on an attachment for care and emotional support
* willingness to engage in physical intimacy in the case of romantic or potential romantic partners

Collins and Feeney review a number of studies showing how each attachment style relates to the willingness to self-disclose, the willingness to rely on partners, and the willingness to engage in physical intimacy. The secure attachment style is generally related to more self-disclosure, more reliance on partners, and more physical intimacy than other attachment styles. However, the amount of intimacy in a relationship can vary due to personality variables and situational circumstances, and so each attachment style may function to adapt an individual to the particular context of intimacy in which they live.

Mashek and Sherman report some findings on the desire for less closeness with partners.&lt;ref name="Mashek Sherman 04"&gt;Mashek, D.J., &amp; Sherman, M.D. (2004). Desiring less closeness with initimate others. In A. Aron and Mashek, D.J. (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'' (pp. 343–356). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes too much intimacy can be suffocating. People in this situation desire less closeness with their partners. On one hand, the relationship between attachment styles and desire for less closeness is predictable. People who have fearful-avoidant and anxious-preoccupied attachment styles typically want greater closeness with their partners. People who have dismissive–avoidant attachment styles typically want less closeness with their partners. On the other hand, the relatively large numbers of people who admit to wanting less closeness with their partners (up to 57% in some studies) far outnumbers the people who have dismissive-avoidant attachment styles. This suggests people who have secure, anxious–preoccupied, or fearful-avoidant attachment styles sometimes seek less closeness with their partners. The desire for less closeness is not determined by attachment styles alone.

===Jealousy===
{{main|Jealousy}}
Jealousy refers to the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that occur when a person believes a valued relationship is threatened by a rival. A jealous person experiences anxiety about maintaining support, intimacy, and other valued qualities of her or his relationship. Given that attachment relates to anxiety regulation, support, and intimacy, as discussed above, it is not surprising that attachment also relates to jealousy.

Bowlby observed that attachment behaviors in children can be triggered by the presence of a rival:
{{quote|In most young children the mere sight of mother holding another baby in her arms is enough to elicit strong attachment behaviour. The older child insists on remaining close to his mother, or on climbing on to her lap. Often he behaves as though he were a baby. It is possible that this well-known behaviour is only a special case of a child reacting to mother's lack of attention and lack of responsiveness to him. The fact, however, that an older child often reacts in this way even when his mother makes a point of being attentive and responsive suggests that more is involved; and the pioneer experiments of Levy (1937) also indicate that the mere presence of a baby on mother's lap is sufficient to make an older child much more clinging. (Bowlby, 1969/1982, page 260)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"/&gt;}}

When children see a rival contending for a caregiver's attention, the children try to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention. Attempts to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention indicate the attachment system has been activated. But the presence of a rival also provokes jealousy in children. The jealousy provoked by a sibling rival has been described in detail.&lt;ref name="Volling McElwain Miller 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volling | first1 = B.L. | last2 = McElwain | first2 = N.L. | last3 = Miller | first3 = A.L. | year = 2002 | title = Emotion regulation in context: The jealousy complex between young siblings and its relations with child and family characteristics | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 581–600 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that a rival can provoke jealousy at very young ages. The presence of a rival can provoke jealousy in infants as young as six months old.&lt;ref name="Hart 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Jealousy in 6-month-old infants | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0303_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2004 | title = When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy? | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 57–78 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0601_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = C.R. | year = 2004 | title = The evolution of jealousy | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 62–71 | doi=10.1511/2004.45.919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment and jealousy can both be triggered in children by the presence of a rival.

Attachment and jealousy can be triggered by the same perceptual cues in adults, too.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpsteen | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = L.A. | year = 1997 | title = Romantic jealousy and adult romantic attachment | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 627–640 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of the attachment can trigger both a need for close proximity and jealousy when people believe the attachment is spending time with a rival. The presence of a rival can also trigger greater need for attachment and jealousy.

Differences in attachment styles influence both the frequency and the pattern of jealous expressions. People who have anxious–preoccupied or fearful-avoidant attachment styles experience jealousy more often and view rivals as more threatening than people who have secure attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buunk 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buunk | first1 = B.P. | year = 1997 | title = Personality, birth order and attachment styles as related to various types of jealousy | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 997–1006 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(97)00136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerrero | first1 = L.K. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment-style differences in the experience and expression of romantic jealousy | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 273–291 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00172.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radecki-Bush Farrell Bush 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radecki-Bush | first1 = C. | last2 = Farrell | first2 = A.D. | last3 = Bush | first3 = J.I. | year = 1993 | title = Predicting jealous responses: The influence of adult attachment and depression on threat appraisal | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 569–588 | doi=10.1177/0265407593104006}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with different attachment styles also express jealousy in different ways. One study found that:
{{quote|Securely attached participants felt anger more intensely than other emotions and were relatively more likely than other participants to express it, especially toward their attachment. And although anxious participants felt anger relatively intensely, and were as likely as others to express it through irritability, they were relatively unlikely to actually confront their attachment. This might be attributable to feelings of inferiority and fear, which were especially characteristic of the anxiously attached and which might be expected to inhibit direct expressions of anger. Avoidants felt sadness relatively more intensely than did secures in both studies. Further, avoidants were relatively more likely than others to work to maintain their self-esteem and, perhaps as a consequence, relatively unlikely to be brought closer to their attachment. (Sharpsteen &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997, page 637)&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;}}

A subsequent study has confirmed that people with different attachment styles experience and express jealousy in qualitatively different ways.&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"/&gt; Attachment thus plays an important role in jealous interactions by influencing the frequency and the manner in which attachments express jealousy.

===After love===
After dissolution of important romantic relationships people usually go through separation anxiety and grieving. Grief is a process which leads to the acceptance of loss and usually allows the person to move on. During this process people use different strategies to cope. Securely attached individuals tend to look for support, the most effective coping strategy. Avoidantly attached individuals tend to devalue the relationships and to withdraw. Anxiously attached individuals are more likely to use emotionally focused coping strategies and pay more attention to the experienced distress (Pistole, 1996). After the end of the relationships, securely attached individuals tend to have less negative overall emotional experience than insecurely attached individuals  (Pistole, 1995).

===Same-sex relationships===
Ridge &amp; Feeney (1998) have studied a group of gays and lesbians in Australian universities. Results showed that the frequency of attachment styles in the gay and lesbian population was the same as in the heterosexual; at the same time attachment styles have predicted relationship variables in a similar way as in the heterosexual population. However, gay and lesbian adult attachment styles were not related to childhood experiences with parents. Contradicting this last result, Robinson (1999) has found that in the lesbian population there was a link between attachment styles and early parenting. However, unlike in heterosexual females, attachment style was related to participants' relationship with their fathers.

A '''bioassay''' is an analytical method to determine concentration or potency of a substance by its effect on living cells or tissues.&lt;ref name="Hoskins 437–464"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoskins|first=W.

== Principle ==
Bioassay is a biochemical test to estimate the relative potency of a sample compound to a standard compound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoskins 437–464"/&gt; Typical bioassay involves a ''stimulus'' (ex. drugs) applied to a ''subject'' (ex. animals, tissues, plants) and a ''response'' (ex. death) of the subject is triggered and measured.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The intensity of stimulus is varied by doses and depending on this intensity of stimulus, a change/response will be followed by a subject.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
The first uses of bioassay dates back to as early as the late 19th century, when the foundation of bioassays was laid down by a German physician, Paul Ehrlich.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He introduced the concept of standardization by the reactions of living matter.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Noordwijk|first=Jacobus|title=Bioassays in whole animals|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0731708589800779|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis|volume=7|issue=2|pages=139–145|doi=10.1016/0731-7085(89)80077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design and Analysis for Bioassays|last=Saha|first=G.

Through 1940s and 1960s, animal bioassay was primarily used to test for toxicity and safety of drugs, food additives and pesticides.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In late 1960s and 1970s, reliance on bioassay increased as the public concern for occupational and environmental hazards increased.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While before this health risks of certain chemicals such as pesticide was tested in animal bioassay, it was still rare and testing was not seen often.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Classifications ==

=== Direct assay ===
- The stimulus/standard sufficiently produces measurable and specific response.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The response must be clear, easily recognized, and directly measured.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Indirect assay based on quantitative response ===
- The relationship between the dose and the response is first ascertained.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Then the dose corresponding to a given response is obtained from the relation for each preparation separately.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Indirect assay based on quantal response ===
- The assay involves 'all or none' response (ex. life or death).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The response is produced by threshold effect.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== [[ELISA]] (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) ===
- quantitative analytical method that measures absorbance of color change from antigen-antibody reaction (ex. Direct, indirect, sandwich, competitive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aydin|first=Suleyman|title=A short history, principles, and types of ELISA, and our laboratory experience with peptide/protein analyses using ELISA|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019697811500131X|journal=Peptides|volume=72|pages=4–15|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2015.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ELISA is used to measure variety of substances in human body from cortisol levels for stress to glucose level for diabetes.

'''Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate''' (or '''tiomolibdate'''  [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], trade name '''Decuprate'''), is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[tetrathiomolybdate (disambiguation)|tetrathiomolybdate]] (TTM, MoS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[choline]] currently under investigation as a therapy against [[Wilson's disease]], a rare and potentially fatal disease in which the body cannot regulate [[copper]]. Wilson's disease is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[Heredity|genetic]] disorder that is manifested by serious [[hepatic]], [[neurologic]] or [[psychiatric symptoms]]. The disease is fatal if left undiagnosed and untreated. It is estimated that approximately 1 individual in every 30,000 worldwide have Wilson's disease, corresponding to approximately 15,000{{Verify source|date=July 2016}} individuals in the European Union and approximately 11,000{{Verify source|date=July 2016}} in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17276780|year=2007|author1=Ala|first1=A|title=Wilson's disease|journal=The Lancet|volume=369|issue=9559|pages=397–408|last2=Walker|first2=A.

Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate is a de-coppering therapy in [[clinical development]] against Wilson's disease under the code name WTX101 by [[Wilson Therapeutics]] AB. Wilson Therapeutics was founded by [[HealthCap]] in 2012.

== Mechanism of action ==

Tetrathiomolybdate has a unique [[mechanism of action]] through which it selectively forms highly stable complexes with copper and proteins. These complexes are then believed to be primarily excreted via the [[bile]], restoring the normal excretion route of copper that is impaired in patients with Wilson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10728780|year=2000|author1=Komatsu|first1=Y|title=Excretion of copper complexed with thiomolybdate into the bile and blood in LEC rats|journal=Chemico-biological interactions|volume=124|issue=3|pages=217–31|last2=Sadakata|first2=I|last3=Ogra|first3=Y|last4=Suzuki|first4=K.

T.|doi=10.1016/S0946-672X(11)80042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The binding and [[excretion]] mechanism of WTX101 is stable; whereas many de-coppering agents form unstable complexes that are excreted via urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23563391|year=2013|author1=Říha|first1=M|title=Novel method for rapid copper chelation assessment confirmed low affinity of D-penicillamine for copper in comparison with trientine and 8-hydroxyquinolines|journal=Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry|volume=123|pages=80–7|last2=Karlíčková|first2=J|last3=Filipský|first3=T|last4=MacÁková|first4=K|last5=Hrdina|first5=R|last6=Mladěnka|first6=P|doi=10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2013.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data suggest that bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate can rapidly lower and control toxic free copper levels and improve clinical symptoms in Wilson's disease patients. The data also suggest that it is generally well-tolerated with the potential for a reduced risk of neurological worsening after initiation of therapy compared to existing therapies.&lt;ref name="Brewer09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewer06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewer03" /&gt;

As of November 2014, a Phase 2, multi-centre, open-label study is recruiting newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients 18 and older to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate administration over a 24-week period.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02273596|Efficacy and Safety Study of WTX101 in Adult Wilson Disease Patients}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsonsdisease.org/wilson-disease-research/wilsondisease-clinicaltrials.php |title=Wilson Disease Clinical Trials.

Previous clinical studies with bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate in oncology patients have shown that it can lower and maintain copper levels using a once or twice daily oral dosing.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowndes" /&gt; This is an important finding, since untreated Wilson's disease may lead to death within several years of the onset of symptoms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15742108|year=2005|author1=Członkowska|first1=A|title=Wilson's disease-cause of mortality in 164 patients during 1992-2003 observation period|journal=Journal of Neurology|volume=252|issue=6|pages=698–703|last2=Tarnacka|first2=B|last3=Litwin|first3=T|last4=Gajda|first4=J|last5=Rodo|first5=M|doi=10.1007/s00415-005-0720-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and medication use should continue throughout the patient's lifespan. Patient [[compliance (medicine)|compliance]] is crucial for clinical improvement, and it is a particular challenge for Wilson's disease patients taking de-coppering treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20625962|year=2010|author1=Masełbas|first1=W|title=Persistence with treatment in patients with Wilson disease|journal=Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska|volume=44|issue=3|pages=260–3|last2=Chabik|first2=G|last3=Członkowska|first3=A|doi=10.1016/s0028-3843(14)60040-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''broadcast range''' (also '''listening range''' or '''listening area''' for [[radio]], or '''viewing range''' or '''viewing area''' for [[television]]) is the service area that a [[broadcasting|broadcast station]] or other [[transmission (radio)|transmission]] covers via [[radio wave]]s (or possibly [[infrared]] [[light]], which is closely related).  It is generally the area in which a station's [[signal strength]] is sufficient for most [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]s to decode it. However, this also depends on [[electromagnetic interference|interference]] from other stations.

==Legal definitions==
The "primary service area" is the area served by a station's strongest signal.  The "city-grade contour" is 70 dBµ ([[decibel]]s relative to one microvolt per meter of signal strength) or 3.16mV/m (millivolts per meter) for FM stations in the [[United States]], according to [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations.  This is also significant in [[broadcast law]], in that a station must cover its [[city of license]] within this area, except for [[non-commercial educational]] and [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] stations.

The legally protected range of a station extends beyond this range, out to the point where signal strength is expected to be 1mV/m for most stations in [[North America]], though for [[List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes#AM|class B1]] stations it is 0.7mV/m, and as low as 0.5mV/m for full class B stations (the maximum allowed in densely [[population|populate]]d areas of both [[Canada]] and the U.S.).

==Practical application==
In reality, [[radio propagation]] changes along with the [[weather]] and [[tropospheric ducting]], and occasionally along with other upper-[[atmospheric]] phenomena like [[sunspot]]s and even [[meteor shower]]s.  Thus, while a [[broadcasting authority]] might fix the range to an area with exact [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]] (defined as a series of [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s), this is rarely if ever true.  When a broadcast reaches well outside of its intended range due to [[anomalous propagation|unusual conditions]], [[DXing]] is possible.

The local terrain can also play a major role in limiting broadcast range.  [[Mountain range]]s block [[FM broadcast]]s, [[AM broadcast]]s, and TV broadcasts, and other signals in the [[VHF]] and especially [[UHF]] ranges, respectively.  This [[terrain shielding]] occurs when the line of sight is blocked by something through which the [[radio wave]]s cannot pass, particularly stone.  At times this may be [[wikt:Moot|moot]] due to weather, such as when the tall [[cumulonimbus]] clouds of a [[squall line]] of [[thunderstorm]]s reflect the signal over the top, like an extremely tall [[radio tower]].  Conversely, heavy rain may [[attenuate]] the range of even local stations.  [[ATSC]] [[digital television]] is affected by wind and trees (even if not surrounding the transmitter or receiver locations), apparently related to its use of [[8VSB]] [[modulation]] instead of [[COFDM]].

[[AM broadcasting]] stations have different issues, due to using the [[mediumwave]] band.  Broadcast range in these stations is determined by [[ground conductivity]], and the proper use and [[Preventive maintenance|maintenance]] of [[grounding radial]]s which act as a [[ground plane]] for the [[mast radiator]]s used.  [[Skywaves]] reflect off the [[ionosphere]] at a much greater distance above [[Earth's surface]] at night.  This in turn causes mediumwave, most [[shortwave]], and even [[longwave]] stations to travel much further at night, which is the side of the Earth where the [[solar wind]] pulls the ionosphere (and [[magnetosphere]]) away from the [[planet]], instead of pushing toward it as on the day side.  Because of this, many AM stations must cut power or go off-air at night, except for the very earliest stations still [[grandfathered]] on [[clear-channel station|clear channel]]s.  [[Border blaster]] stations in northern [[Mexico]] also used this effect, along with very high-[[electrical power|power]] [[transmitter]]s, to extend their nighttime broadcast ranges well over the [[US/Mexico border]] and across most of the United States.

Various [[broadcast relay station]]s can help to extend a station's area by retransmitting them on the same or another [[channel (communications)|channel]].  What is usually called a [[repeater]] in [[amateur radio]] is called a [[broadcast translator]] (different channel) or booster (same channel) in [[American broadcasting]], or the much broader category or [[rebroadcaster]]s in [[Canadian broadcasting]] (which includes more than just the [[low-power broadcasting]] used in the U.S.)  Boosters are used only within the broadcast range of the parent station, and serve the same function locally as regional and national [[single-frequency network]]s do in [[Europe]]. [[Distributed transmission]] has also undergone tests in the U.S., but to preserve stations' [[market share]] in their home [[media market]]s, these will be limited to the broadcast area of a single large station.  [[Satellite radio]], which is designed for use without a dish, also uses ground repeaters in large cities due to the many obstructions their high-rise buildings cause to the many current and potential customers that are concentrated there.

==Edge-of-range issues==
Those at the edge of a station's broadcast range will typically notice [[White noise|static]] in an [[analog signal|analog]] broadcast, while [[error correction]] will keep a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] clear until it hits the [[cliff effect]] and suddenly disappears completely.  [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations may flip back and forth (sometimes [[picket-fencing|annoyingly rapidly]] when moving) due to the [[capture effect]], while [[amplitude modulation|AM]] stations (including TV video) may overlay or fade with each other.

[[FM stereo]] will tend to get static more quickly than the [[monaural|monophonic]] sound due to its use of [[subcarrier]]s, so stations may choose to extend the usable part of their range by disabling the [[stereo generator]].  Listeners can also choose to disable stereo decoding on the receiver, though loss of the stereo [[pilot tone]] causes this to happen automatically.  Because this tends to turn on and off when at the threshold of reception, and the threshold is often set too low by the [[manufacturer]]'s [[product design]], manually disabling this when at the edge of the broadcast range prevents the annoying noisy-stereo/quiet-mono switching.

The same is true of [[analog TV]] stereo and [[second audio program]]s, and even for color TV, all of which use subcarriers.  [[Radio reading service]]s and other subcarrier services will also tend to suffer from dropouts sooner than the main station.

Technologies are available that allow for switching to a different signal carrying the same radio program when leaving the broadcast range of a station.  [[Radio Data System]] allows for switching to a different FM or station with the same [[identifier]], or even to (but not necessarily from) an AM station.  Satellite radio also is designed to switch seamlessly between repeaters and/or satellite when moving outside the range of one or the other.  [[HD Radio]] switches back to the analog signal as a [[HD Radio|fallback]] when the edge of the digital range is encountered, but the success of this from the listener's perspective depends on how well the station's [[broadcast engineer]] has synchronized the two.

==Digital versus analog==
Digital transmissions require less power to be received clearly than analog ones.  The exact figure for various modes depends on how robust the signal is made to begin with, such as modulation, [[guard interval]], and [[forward error correction]].  In each of these three factors, the [[caveat emptor|caveat]] is that a higher [[data signaling rate]] means a [[tradeoff]] with reduced broadcast range.  The [[hierarchical modulation]] used on [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] is a unique case, which reduces the range of the full-[[screen resolution|definition]] signal, in exchange for an increase in the usable range of the lower-definition part of the video.

Digital stations in North America usually are operated by the same groups as the analog side, and thus operate their own independent facilities.  Because of this, the FCC requires U.S. TV stations to replicate their analog coverage with their digital signal as well.  However, ATSC digital TV only requires about one-fifth the amount of power to reach the same area on the same channel as analog does.  For HD Radio, the figure is only one percent of the station's analog [[watt]]age, in part because it is an [[in-band on-channel]] method, which uses [[sideband]]s that must prevent interference to [[adjacent channel]]s, especially for older or cheaper receivers which have insufficient [[sensitivity (radio receiver)|sensitivity]] and/or [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].

'''CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere''' (O&amp;A) is one of the current 8 Business Units (formerly: Flagships) of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO), [[Australia]]'s largest government-supported science research agency.

[[File:CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research Hobart.jpg|thumb|CSIRO Marine Laboratories in [[Hobart]], home of the largest component of CSIRO O&amp;A staff]]

==History==
The CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) Business Unit was formed in 2014 as one of the then 10 "Flagship" operational units of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) as part of a major organisational restructure; from 2015 onwards the term "Flagship" was officially dropped. This Business Unit was formed essentially as a synthesis of the pre-existing CSIRO Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR), representing the scientific capability, and the previously established Wealth from Oceans (WfO) Flagship, which was the route via which much of the relevant Australian government research funding was directed. As at 2016, its Director is Dr. Ken Lee, previously WfO Flagship Director. The O&amp;A Business Unit currently employs between 350 and 400 staff who are located at its various laboratories including [[Hobart]] ([[Tasmania]]), [[Aspendale,_Victoria|Aspendale]] ([[Victoria_(Australia)|Victoria]]), [[Dutton_Park,_Queensland|Dutton Park]] ([[Queensland]]), Black Mountain ([[Canberra]]) and [[Floreat,_Western_Australia|Floreat Park]] ([[Western Australia]]). For 2016 it was quoted as operating with an annual budget of $108M Australian Dollars with its research organised into the following the following programs: Climate Science Centre; Coastal Development and Management; Earth System Assessment; Engineering and Technology; Marine Resources and Industries; and Ocean and Climate Dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/Strategy-structure/Corporate-plan|title=CSIRO Corporate Plan 2016-17|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain previous CMAR activities, notably those involving the operation of the Marine National Facility (research vessel) [[RV Investigator]] and several scientific collections, are now managed within the separate CSIRO National Facilities and Collections Program.

The previous CSIRO Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research was itself formed as a result of a 2005 merger between the former CSIRO Division of Marine Research, with laboratories in Hobart, Brisbane, and Perth, and CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research, with laboratories in Aspendale and Canberra; the Division of Marine Research was formed in 1997 as a merger between two previous CSIRO Divisions, the Division of Fisheries Research and the Division of Oceanography, both with their headquarters in Hobart since 1984; prior to that time, the Division of Fisheries and Oceanography (subsequently separate Divisions) had occupied facilities in [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]], [[New South Wales]] since its inception in 1938&lt;ref&gt;Harley, David. 2012. [http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/449772/Cronulla-fisheries-site-Recommendations-for-future-use.pdf Cronulla Fisheries Site: Recommendations for Future Use. A report prepared for the NSW Department of Primary Industries, November 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; (following the CSIRO's departure this site became the New South Wales State [[Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre]]). Additional details of the somewhat convoluted organisational history of the relevant Divisions and their predecessors are available here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csiropedia.csiro.au/marine-and-atmospheric-research-2005/|title=Marine and Atmospheric Research Divisions|publisher=CSIROpedia|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seagoing capabilities==
Through the 1980s and 1990s the marine Divisions of CSIRO had the use of both the [[RV Southern Surveyor]], equipped for biological as well as oceanographic research, and the purpose built [[RV Franklin]] for physical and chemical oceanographic research, both of which served at various times as the Marine National Facility for the nation (meaning that other agencies could also carry out research using these vessels at what was effectively a subsidised rate by the Australian government). The last of the vessels to be retired, the Southern Surveyor, was replaced in 2014 by a new purpose built research vessel to serve as the Marine National Facility, the [[RV Investigator]]. Coupled with these major vessels, all capable of significant ocean-going research expeditions, staff were able to use a range of smaller boats and sometimes, charter vessels to carry out research in a range of coastal waters.

==2016 Climate Science cuts controversy and subsequent partial restoration==
In February 2016 the chief executive of CSIRO, [[Larry_R._Marshall|Dr Larry Marshall]], announced that research into the fundamentals of climate science was no longer a priority for CSIRO and up to 110 jobs were feared to be cut from the climate research section(s) of the Oceans and Atmosphere Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/climate-will-be-all-gone-as-csiro-swings-jobs-axe-scientists-say-20160203-gml7jy.html|title=Climate science to be gutted as CSIRO swings jobs axe|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After overwhelming negative reaction both within Australia and overseas, along with the forced redundancy of prominent climate scientists including the internationally renowned sea level expert [[John_A._Church|Dr John Church]], the Australian Government intervened with a directive and promise of new money to support the restoration of 15 jobs and the creation of a new Climate Science Centre to be based in Hobart with a staff of 40, with funding guaranteed for 10 years from 2016, although the expected number of job losses for O&amp;A was still estimated at 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/04/26/csiro-reduce-job-cuts-still-275-go|title=CSIRO reduce job cuts but still 275 to go|publisher=SBS|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the establishment of the new Centre was described as a "major U-turn in the direction of the CSIRO"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/turnbull-government-order-csiro-uturn-towards-climate-science-20160803-gqk2pr.html|title=Turnbull government orders CSIRO U-turn towards climate science|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a win for the Turnbull government over the previous CSIRO announcement, the generally positive reaction from other scientists was qualified by the fact that the new Centre would still represent a net loss to CSIRO's previous capability in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/expert-reaction-csiro-announces-climate-science-centre|title=EXPERT REACTION: CSIRO announces Climate Science Centre|publisher=scimex|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed account of this episode is available elsewhere on Wikipedia [[Larry_R._Marshall#Controversy_over_climate_research_cutbacks|here]].

The '''Circle of Friends''' approach is a method designed to increase the [[socialization]] and [[Inclusion (education)|inclusion]] of a [[disabled]] person with their peers.  A Circle of Friends consists of a "focus" child, for whom the group was established, six to eight classroom peers, and an adult facilitator who meet once weekly to socialize and work on specific goals.  Most available resources about the Circle of Friends approach are geared toward its use with school-aged children with various difficulties.

==Background==
Circle of Friends was originally developed in [[North America]] to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities and other difficulties in their local communities and in mainstream educational settings.&lt;ref&gt;Leicestershire County Council, England. [http://www.leics.gov.uk/search.htm?qt=circle+of+friends&amp;col=all&amp;ﬂag. Autism Outreach Team, Circle of Friends]. Retrieved April 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The National Autistic Society: Circle of Friends – [http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1757&amp;a=15944 Promoting inclusion and interaction]. Retrieved April 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;  In the past, it was more common for adults with disabilities to be [[institutionalization|confined to institutions]], and for students with [[special education|special educational needs]] to be educated in separate schools.&lt;ref&gt;Frederickson, N. &amp; Turner, J. (2003). Utilizing the classroom peer group to address children's social needs: An evaluation of the Circle of Friends intervention approach. The Journal of Special Education, 36, 234-245.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Circle of Friends approach coincides with a shift in societal attitudes toward inclusion of people with disabilities in mainstream settings.  It is intended to promote healthy friendships and to create and reinforce positive social experiences.

Although it was developed in North America, Circle of Friends has been implemented and researched extensively in the United Kingdom in a variety of settings, and with children of varying ages and difficulties.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Newton, C., Taylor, G., &amp; Wilson, D.

A Circles of Friends approach for socially neglected children. Educational Psychology in Practice, 14, 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor96/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor97/&gt; The approach is often used for children with [[Autism Spectrum Disorders]] (ASDs) because they have trouble developing social and communication skills.&lt;ref name=whitaker&gt;Whitaker, P., Barratt, P., Joy, H., Potter, M., &amp; Thomas, G. (1998). Children with autism and peer group support: Using "circles of friends". British Journal of Special Education, 25, 60–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, children with emotional, behavioral and social problems may benefit from the approach because they are often isolated and lack peer groups.&lt;ref name=newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor96&gt;Taylor, G. (1996). Creating a Circle of Friends: A case study. In H. Cowie &amp; S. Sharp (Eds.), Peer counselling in schools.

==Structure==
In the educational setting, general guidelines exist for establishing a Circle of Friends.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor96/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor97&gt;Taylor, G. (1997). Community building in schools: Developing a 'circle of friends.' Educational and Child Psychology, 14, 45-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederickson, N., Warren, L. &amp; Turner, J. (2005). "Circle of Friends" – An exploration of impact over time. Educational Psychology in Practice, 21, 197-217&lt;/ref&gt;

* Establishment of prerequisites: Before starting a Circle of Friends, it is necessary to ensure the cooperation and collaboration of school personnel (e.g. principals, teacher) and obtain consent from the focus child’s parents or caregivers.
* Class discussion to set up the Circle of Friends: The next step is to meet with the focus child’s class.  The focus child consents to this meeting but does not attend so that class members feel comfortable sharing information.  The class discussion is meant to introduce the idea of a Circle of Friends.  Students are encouraged to think about the benefits of friendship and consider the barriers to friendship the focus child encounters, and also empathize and share their own experiences with friendship.  The focus child’s strengths and difficulties are discussed, and links between the focus child’s behavior and problems with peer relationships are made.  Making these links is an important first step in problem solving solutions.  At the close of the meeting, six to eight volunteers are sought to take part in the Circle of Friends.
* Initial meeting of the Circle of Friends: At the initial Circle of Friends meeting, details of the class discussion are summarized for the focus child.  Ground rules for the group are then set (i.e. confidentiality, listening, seeking adult help when needed), as well as a schedule for meetings.
* Weekly meetings of the Circle of Friends: At weekly meetings, classmates play an important role in helping the focus child set and reach goals.  Some research suggests that all children involved in the Circle of Friends benefit from the experience and not just the focus child.&lt;ref name=newton/&gt;

Adapted versions of Circle of Friends exist.  One version differs from the original approach in that the focus child is not absent for the initial class meeting.&lt;ref name=shotton/&gt;  Others have described Circle of Friends meetings taking place on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txautism.net/docs/Guide/Interventions/CircleFriends.pdf Texas Autism Research Guide for Effective Teaching (TARGET)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724114405/http://www.txautism.net/docs/Guide/Interventions/CircleFriends.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}.

The '''circuit of culture''' is a theory or framework used in the area of [[cultural studies]]. It was devised in 1997 by a group of theorists when studying the [[Walkman]] cassette player. The theory suggests that in studying a cultural text or artifact you must look at five aspects: its representation, identity, production, consumption and regulation. Du Gay et al. suggest that "taken together (these 5 points) complete a sort of circuit...through which any analysis of a cultural text...must pass if it is to be adequately studied."&lt;ref&gt;du Gay et al. (1997) ''Doing Cultural Studies: The story of the Sony Walkman'' Milton Keynes: Open University; Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerard Goggin openly uses this framework in his book ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' in order to fully understand the cell phone as a cultural artifact. His book is split into four parts: production, consumption, regulation, and representation and identity (through looking at mobile convergences).&lt;ref&gt; Goggin, Gerard. (2006) ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="981">The '''database catalog''' of a [[database]] instance consists of [[metadata]] in which definitions of database objects such as base tables, views (virtual tables), [[synonym]]s, value ranges, [[index (database)|indexes]], [[User (computing)|users]], and user groups are stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systems Development Handbook|author= Paul C.

The [[SQL]] standard specifies a uniform means to access the catalog, called the [[Information schema|INFORMATION_SCHEMA]], but not all [[databases]] follow this, even if they implement other aspects of the SQL standard. For an example of database-specific [[metadata]] access methods, see [[Oracle metadata]].

'''Dynamic Earth''' (originally known as Our Dynamic Earth) is a visitor attraction in [[Edinburgh]], and also functions as a conference venue. It is in the [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] area, beside the [[Scottish Parliament building]] and at the foot of [[Holyrood Park#Salisbury Crags|Salisbury Crags]].

The principal focus of Dynamic Earth is to facilitate a better public understanding of the processes that have shaped the Earth (known as [[earth science]]). This includes the [[Big Bang]], [[abiogenesis]], [[plate tectonics]] and [[glaciers|glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dynamicearth.co.uk/visit/what-is-dynamic-earth |title=What is Dynamic Earth |publisher=Our Dynamic Earth |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The centre opened in 1999 as one of the first major projects supported by the [[Millennium Commission]]. The project was part of an [[urban regeneration]] plan for former industrial land at the lower end of Holyrood Road.

In the years 2006−2007 there were more than 200,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/our-dynamic-earth-celebrates-as-holyrood-doubles-its-funds-1-1240449 |title=Our Dynamic Earth celebrates as Holyrood doubles its funds |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=11 January 2008  |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The building's structure consists of a steel mast-supported membrane stretched over a steel skeleton. It was designed by architects [[Hopkins Architects|Michael Hopkins and Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hopkins.co.uk/projects/1/75 |title=Dynamic Earth |publisher=Hopkins Architects |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design incorporates the original wall that formed the outer perimeter of the Abbey Brewery ale stores that were formerly on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/blog/old-town-new-life-four-transformed-buildings-in-edinburgh |title=Old Town, new life: four transformed buildings in Edinburgh |first=Gareth |last=Davies |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date=26 May 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre's Scientific Director is the British television and radio presenter specialising in [[scientific]] and [[educational]] programmes [[Hermione Cockburn]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1286">In [[telecommunication]], the term '''electromagnetic environment''' (EME) has the following meanings:

#For a telecommunications [[system]], the spatial distribution of [[electromagnetic field]]s surrounding a given site.  The electromagnetic environment may be expressed in terms of the spatial and temporal distribution of electric [[field strength]] ([[volt]]s per metre), [[irradiance]] ([[watt]]s per square metre), or energy density ([[joule]]s per cubic metre).
#The resulting product of the [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[time]] distribution, in various [[frequency]] ranges, of the radiated or conducted electromagnetic [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] levels that may be encountered by a military force, system, or platform when performing its assigned mission in its intended operational environment. It is the sum of [[electromagnetic interference]]; [[electromagnetic pulse]]; hazards of [[electromagnetic radiation]] to personnel, ordnance, and volatile materials; and natural phenomena effects of [[lightning]] and p-static.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4343">'''End-user computing''' ('''EUC''') refers to systems in which non-programmers can create working [[Application software|application]]s.&lt;ref name="EUC"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1120304 | title=End-user computing | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] | accessdate=30 December 2015 | author=Goodall, Howie | booktitle=CHI EA '97 CHI '97 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems | date = March 1997 | conference=ACM CHI 97 Human Factors in Computing Systems Conference | location=Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California, United States of America | pages=132–132 | isbn=0-89791-926-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; EUC is a group of approaches to computing that aim to better integrate [[user (computing)|end users]] into the computing environment. These approaches attempt to realize the potential for high-end computing to perform [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] in a trustworthy manner.&lt;ref&gt;McBride, Neil, "[https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/handle/2086/213 Towards User-Oriented control of End-User Computing in Large Organizations]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood, Adam, [http://www.idea-group.com/bookseries/details.asp?id=3 Advances in End User Computing Series] University of Texas, USA, {{ISSN|1537-9310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

End-user computing can range in complexity from users simply clicking a series of buttons, to writing scripts in a controlled [[scripting language]], to being able to modify and execute code directly.

Examples of end-user computing are systems built using [[fourth-generation programming language]]s, such as [[MAPPER]] or [[SQL]], or one of the [[fifth-generation programming language]]s, such as [[ICAD (software)|ICAD]].

==Factors==
Factors contributing to the need for further EUC research include [[knowledge]] processing, [[pervasive computing]], issues of [[Upper ontology (computer science)|ontology]], [[interactive visualization]], and the like.

Some of the issues related to end-user computing concern [[software architecture]] ([[Graphical user interface|iconic]] versus language interfaces, open versus closed,{{clarify|date=July 2013}} and others). Other issues relate to [[intellectual property]], configuration and maintenance. End-user computing allows more user-input into system affairs that can range from [[personalization]] to full-fledged ownership of a system.

==EUC strategy==

EUC applications should not be evolved by accident,  but there should be a defined EUC strategy.{{cn|date=May 2016}} Any [[Application Architecture]] Strategy / IT Strategy should consider the white spaces in automation (enterprise functionality not automated by [[Enterprise resource planning | ERP]] / [[Enterprise Grade Applications]]). These are the potential areas where EUC can play a major role.{{cn|date=May 2016}} Then ASSIMPLER parameters{{which?|date=May 2016}} should be applied{{by whom?|date=May 2016}} to these white spaces to develop the EUC strategy. (ASSIMPLER stands for availability, scalability, security, interoperability, maintainability, performance, low [[cost of ownership]], extendibility and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''epipharyngeal groove''' is a ciliated groove along the dorsal side of the inside of the pharynx in some [[plankton]]-feeding early [[chordate]]s, such as ''[[Amphioxus]]''. It helps to carry a stream of mucus with plankton stuck in it, through the pharynx into the gut to be digested.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|author1=Hyman, L.H.|author2=Wake, M.H.|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226870137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC|page=71|accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''subnotochordal rod''' or '''hypochord'''  is a transient structure that appears ventral to the [[notochord]] in the heads of embryos of some vertebrates. Its appearance is stimulated by a chemical secreted by the notochord. The subnotochordal rod helps to stimulate development of the [[dorsal aorta]].&lt;ref name="biologists"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Development |volume=127|pages=869–879|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/127/4/869.full.pdf|date=25 January 2000|title=Endoderm patterning by the notochord: development of the hypochord in Xenopus|author=O.

[[File:Façade of St. Peter's Basilica 2.JPG|thumb|350px|[[Carlo Maderno]]'s monumental facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's basilica]] in [[Vatican City]].]]
A '''facade''' (also '''façade'''; {{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|s|ɑː|d}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/facade dictionary.cambridge.org]&lt;/ref&gt; is generally one exterior side of a [[building]], usually the front. It is a [[Loanword|foreign loan word]] from the [[French language|French]] ''façade'', which means "[[frontage]]" or "[[face]]".

In [[architecture]], the facade of a building is often the most important aspect from a design standpoint, as it sets the tone for the rest of the building. From the engineering perspective of a building, the facade is also of great importance due to its impact on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, Keith. "Exterior Building Enclosures". John Wiley &amp; sons, Inc, 2013, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; For historical facades, many local [[zoning]] regulations or other laws greatly restrict or even forbid their alteration.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the French  foreign loan word ''façade'', which in turn comes from the Italian ''facciata'', from ''faccia'' meaning face, ultimately from post-classical Latin ''facia''. The earliest usage recorded by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] is 1656.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=façade, n. |title=Oxford English dictionary |edition=Second, online  |origyear=1989 |date=December 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/67424}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facades added to earlier buildings==
It was quite common in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] period for existing houses in English towns to be given a fashionable new facade. For example, in the city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], The Bunch of Grapes in Westgate Street appears to be a Georgian building, but the appearance is only skin deep and some of the interior rooms still have [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] plasterwork ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Manco. [http://www.buildinghistory.org/bath/tudor/lostera.shtml Bath's lost era], "Bath and the Great Rebuilding", Bath History vol. 4, (Bath 1992). First published in Bath City Life Summer 1992. Retrieved 22 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This new construction has happened also in other places: in [[Santiago de Compostela]] the 3-metres-deep [[Casa do Cabido]] was built to match the [[architectural order]] of the square, and the main [[Churrigueresque]] facade of the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]], facing the [[Praza do Obradoiro]], is actually encasing and concealing the older [[Portico of Glory]].

==Highrise facades==
In modern [[highrise]] building, the exterior walls are often suspended from the concrete floor slabs. Examples include [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]] and precast concrete walls. The facade can at times be required to have a [[fire-resistance rating]], for instance, if two buildings are very close together, to lower the likelihood of fire spreading from one building to another.

In general, the facade systems that are suspended or attached to the precast concrete slabs will be made from [[aluminium]] (powdercoated or anodized) or [[stainless steel]]. In recent years more lavish materials such as [[titanium]] have sometimes been used, but due to their cost and susceptibility to [[panel edge staining]] these have not been popular.

Whether rated or not, [[fire protection]] is always a design consideration. The melting point of aluminium, {{convert|660|°C|0|abbr=on}}, is typically reached within minutes of the start of a fire. [[Firestop]]s for such [[Joint (building)|building joints]] can be qualified, too. Putting [[fire sprinkler system]]s on each floor has a profoundly positive effect on the fire safety of buildings with curtain walls.

Some [[building code]]s also limit the percentage of window area in exterior walls. When the exterior wall is ''not'' rated, the perimeter slab edge becomes a junction where rated slabs are abutting an unrated wall. For rated walls, one may also choose rated windows and [[fire door]]s, to maintain that wall's rating.

==Film sets and theme parks==
On a [[set construction|film set]] and within most themed attractions, many of the buildings are only facades, which are far cheaper than actual buildings, and not subject to [[building code]]s (within film sets).  In film sets, they are simply held up with supports from behind, and sometimes have boxes for actors to step in and out of from the front if necessary for a [[Scene (filming)|scene]]. Within theme parks, they are usually decoration for the interior ride or attraction, which is based on a simple building design.

==Examples==

The '''Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences''', commonly known simply as '''Fields Institute''', is an international centre for [[scientific research]] in [[mathematical science]]s at the [[University of Toronto]], in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The institute is named for University of Toronto mathematician [[John Charles Fields]], after whom the [[Fields Medal]] is also named. It was established in 1992, and was briefly based at the [[University of Waterloo]] before relocating to Toronto in 1995.

As a centre for mathematical activity, the institute brings together mathematicians from Canada and abroad. It also supports the collaboration between professional mathematicians and researchers in other domains, such as statistics, computer science, engineering, physical and biological sciences, medicine, economics and finance, telecommunications and information systems. It also holds monthly meetings on mathematics education, attended by participants from secondary school boards, university mathematics departments and the private sector.

The institute occupies a building at the university that was specially conceived and constructed for its activities, designed by [[Bruce Kuwabara|Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects]]. It accommodates up to 66 visitors and their support staff, providing office spaces and full access to the mathematics collection of the [[University of Toronto Libraries]].

The ''Fields Institute Monographs'' (FIM) features the research work of the institute, and is jointly published with the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fields Institute Monographs |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |url=http://www.ams.org/cgi-bin/bookstore/bookpromo/fimseries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fellows==
In 2002, the Fields Institute initiated the Fields Institute Fellows program to recognize outstanding contributions to activities at the Fields Institute and within the Canadian mathematical community.&lt;ref name="fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fields Institute Fellows|url=https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/honours/fieldsinstfellows.html|website=Fields Institute|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fellowship is a lifetime appointment.

'''foramina''', {{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|r|æ|m|ᵻ|n|ə}}) is any opening. Foramina inside the [[Anatomy|body]] of [[human body|humans]] and other [[Animal#Structure|animals]] typically allow [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s, [[artery|arteries]], [[vein]]s, or other structures to connect one part of the body with another.

==Skull==

{{main|Foramina of the skull}}

The [[skull]]s of [[vertebrate]]s (including [[human skull|humans]]) have foramina through which nerves, arteries, veins and other structures pass.

==Spine==

{{main|Intervertebral foramina}}

Within the [[vertebral column]] (spine) of vertebrates, including the [[Human vertebral column|human spine]], each bone has an opening at both its top and bottom to allow nerves, arteries, veins, etc. to pass through.

==Other==

* [[Apical foramen]], the hole at the tip of the root of a tooth
* [[Foramen ovale (heart)]], a hole between the venous and arterial sides of the fetal heart
* [[Vertebra#Cervical vertebrae|Transverse foramen]], one of a pair of openings in each cervical vertebra, in which the vertebral artery travels
* [[Greater sciatic foramen]], a major foramen of the pelvis
* [[Interventricular foramina (neuroanatomy)|Interventricular foramina]], channels connecting ventricles in the brain
* [[Lesser sciatic foramen]], an opening between the pelvis and the posterior thigh
* [[Obturator foramen]], the hole created by the ischium and pubis bones of the pelvis
* [[Sacrum|Sacral foramina]], which perforate the vertebral canal from the Sacrum (sacral bone), and through which the [[Sacral nerve|sacral nerves]] pass.
* [[Vertebral foramen]], the foramen formed by the anterior segment (the body), and the posterior part, the vertebral arch.
* [[Foramen of Panizza]], a hole connecting two aortas just after they leave the heart in crocodiles.

'''''Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth''''' (first published by Gambit, Boston, 1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] (a professor of the history of science at MIT) and [[Hertha von Dechend]]  (a scientist at 
Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität) is a nonfiction work of history and [[comparative mythology]], particularly the subfield of [[archaeoastronomy]].  
It is mostly about the claim of a [[Megalithic]] era discovery of [[axial precession]], and the encoding of this knowledge in mythology. The book was severely criticized by academics upon its publication.

==Argument==
{{rewrite section|date=September 2018}}
The main argument of the book may be summarized as the claim of an early ([[Neolithic]]) discovery of the [[precession of the equinoxes]] (usually attributed to [[Hipparchus]], 2nd century BCE), and an associated very long-lived [[Megalithic]] civilization of "unsuspected sophistication" that was particularly preoccupied with astronomical observation.
The knowledge of this civilization about precession, and the associated [[astrological age]]s,
would have been encoded in [[mythology]], typically in the form of a story relating to a [[millstone]] and a young protagonist—the "Hamlet's Mill" of the book's title, a reference to the kenning '' [[Amlodhi|Amlóða]] kvren'' recorded in the Old Icelandic ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
Chapter VI, Amlodhi's Quern: "Shakespeare's Gentle Prince [...] who was known once upon a time as a personage of no ordinary power, of universal position, and, in the North, as the owner of a formidable mill. [...] The Mill is thus not only very great and ancient, but it must also be central to the original Hamlet story. It reappears in the ' Skaldskaparmal'', where Snorri explains why a kenning for gold is 'Frodhi's meal'"
&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors indeed claim that mythology is primarily to be interpreted as in terms of [[archaeoastronomy]] ("mythological language has exclusive reference to celestial phenomena"), and they mock alternative interpretations in terms of fertility or agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;"Nevertheless, the expression of this proto-scientific vision of the cosmos was not mathematical but mythological. All the gods are stars, and mythological language has exclusive reference to celestial phenomena: for example, "earth" in myth means only "the ideal plane laid through the ecliptic" (p. 58); all stories of floods "refer to an old astronomical image" (p. 57). Without bothering to refute alternative positions which hold that some, at least, of the gods and myths stemmed from concern with fertility or meteorological phenomena, the authors merely mock "the fertility addicts" (p. 308) and "the Fecundity-'Trust" (p. 381)." White (1970:541).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's project is an examination of the "relics, fragments and allusions that have survived the steep attrition of the ages".&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet's Mill'', as quoted in Leach 1970&lt;/ref&gt; 
In particular, the book reconstructs a myth of a [[heavenly mill]] which rotates around the celestial pole and grinds out the world's [[salt]] and [[soil]], and is associated with the [[maelstrom]]. The millstone falling off its frame represents the passing of one age's pole star (symbolized by a ruler or king of some sort), and its restoration and the overthrow of the old king of authority and the empowering of the new one the establishment of a new order of the age (a new star moving into the position of pole star). 
The authors attempt to demonstrate the prevalence of influence of this hypothetical civilization's ideas by analysing the world's mythology (with an eye especially to all "mill myths") using 
{{quote|[...] cosmographic oddments from many eras and climes...a collection of yarns from Saxo Grammaticus, Snorri Sturluson ("Amlodhi's mill" as a [[kenning]] for the sea!), [[Firdausi]], [[Plato]], [[Plutarch]], the ''[[Kalevala]]'', ''[[Mahabharata]]'', and ''[[Gilgamesh]]'', not to forget Africa, the Americas, and Oceania....&lt;ref name="Puhvel1970"/&gt;}}

Santillana and Dechend state in their introduction to ''Hamlet's Mill'' that they are well aware of modern interpretations of myth and folklore but find them shallow and lacking insight: "...the experts now are benighted by the current folk fantasy, which is the belief that they are beyond all this - critics without nonsense and extremely wise". Consequently, Santillana and Dechend prefer to rely on the work of "meticulous scholars such as [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]], [[Karl Richard Lepsius|Lepsius]], [[Daniel Chwolson|Chwolson]], [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Boll]] and, to go farther back, of [[Athanasius Kircher]] and [[Petavius]]..."

They give reasons throughout the book for preferring the work of older scholars (and the early mythologists themselves) as the proper way to interpret myth; but this viewpoint did not sit well with their modern critics schooled in the "current anthropology, which has built up its own idea of the primitive and what came after".&lt;ref&gt;All quotations are from the Introduction to ''Hamlet's Mill'', first edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santillana had previously published, in 1961, ''The Origins of Scientific Thought'', on which  ''Hamlet's Mill'' is substantially based. Compare various statements in ''Hamlet's Mill'' to this quotation from ''The Origin of Scientific Thought'': "We can see then, how so many myths, fantastic and arbitrary in semblance, of which the Greek tale of the [[Argonauts|Argonaut]] is a late offspring, may provide a terminology of image motifs, a kind of code which is beginning to be broken. It was meant to allow those who knew (a) to determine unequivocally the position of given planets in respect to the earth, to the firmament, and to one another; (b) to present what knowledge there was of the fabric of the world in the form of tales about 'how the world began'."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in pages 35-36 of {{cite book| title=Against Method |edition=3rd |last=Feyerabend
|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Feyerabend
|isbn=0-86091-481-X| date=2000| publisher=Verso| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Hamlet's Mill'' was severely criticized by academic reviewers&lt;ref&gt;"The cowed reviewer is soon reduced to wondering whether mere critical prose should even be expended on something that obviously solicits the suspension of disbelief." Puhvel (1970). "As will presently be apparent, my reaction to this book is hostile - so before my prejudices get out of hand, let me try to explain what it is all about." (Leach 1970) "De Santillana has served us well once more by underscoring a pioneering idea, but von Dechend's implementation of that idea will prevent many scholars from recognizing its validity." White (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; on a number of grounds: tenuous arguments based on incorrect or outdated linguistic information;&lt;ref&gt;"The long-forgotten period-piece etymologies of [[Max Müller]] and [[Adalbert Kuhn]] ("surely a great scholar", p. 381) are blithely resurrected (for example, Sanskrit ''Pramantha'' matching Greek ''Prometheus'', p. 139), while more up-to-date authorities are caricatured as "severe philologists, slaves to exact 'truth'" (p. 294). Puhvel (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; lack of familiarity with modern sources;&lt;ref&gt;"..but in all other respects they choose to ignore almost completely nearly everything that has been written about their subject matter over the past forty years [...] Academic arrogance of this sort is impenetrable; in the certitude of their faith out authors are bound to dismiss all criticism as tendentious, and so, as critic, I have nothing left to say except that I do not believe a word of it." Leach 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; an over-reliance on coincidence or analogy;&lt;ref&gt;"Her only proofs are analogy, often strained. On a single page (425) she connects myths of Greece, Japan, Egypt, Iceland, the Marquesas, and the Cherokee Indians. On page 309, a rabbinical and a Pawnee tradition show "mistakable" identity. On page 320 we read "here ancient Greek myth suddenly emerges in full light among Indian tribes in America, miraculously preserved." One might quote such passages indefinitely." White (1970:541).&lt;/ref&gt; and the general implausibility of a far-flung and influential civilization existing and not leaving behind solid evidence. At most, it has been given a grudging sort of praise. Thus, [[Jaan Puhvel]] (1970) concluded that
{{quote|This is not a serious scholarly work on the problem of myth in the closing decades of the twentieth century. There are frequent flashes of insight, for example, on the cyclical world views of the ancients and on the nature of mythical language, as well as genuinely eloquent, quasi-poetic homilies.&lt;ref name="Puhvel1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Puhvel |first=Jaan |date=1 December 1970 |title=Hamlet's Mill. An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time |department=Reviews of Books |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=75 |issue=7 |pages=2009–2010 |doi=10.1086/ahr/75.7.2009 ||jstor=1848027}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Writing in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', [[Edmund Leach]] noted:
{{quote|[The] authors' insistence that between about 4000 B.C. and 100 A.D. a single archaic system prevailed throughout most of the civilized and proto-civilized world is pure fantasy. Their attempt to delineate the details of this system by a worldwide scatter of random oddments of mythology is no more than an intellectual game. [...] Something like 60 percent of the text is made up of complex arguments about Indo-European etymologies which would have seemed old-fashioned as early as 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leach |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Leach |date=12 February 1970 |title=Bedtime Story |journal=The New York Review of Books |volume=14 |page=36 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/11061 |publisher=American Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] referred to ''Hamlet’s Mill'' as:
{{quote|[...] amateurish in the worst sense, jumping to wild conclusions without any knowledge of the historical value of the sources or of previous work done. On the Scandinavian side there is heavy dependence on the fantasies of [[Viktor Rydberg|Rydberg]], writing in the last [19th] century, and apparent ignorance of progress made since his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = H. R. Ellis | date = 1974 | title = Review of ''Hamlet's Mill'' | url = | journal = Folklore | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 282–283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast the classical scholar [[Harald Reiche]] positively reviewed ''Hamlet's Mill''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Hamlet's Mill'', review by: Harald A. T. Reiche". (1973). ''The Classical Journal'', 69(1): 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Reiche was a colleague of [[Giorgio de Santillana|Santillana]] at [[MIT]], and himself developed the archaeoastronomical interpretation of ancient myth in a series of lectures and publications similar to ''Hamlet's Mill'' (dealing more specifically with [[Greek mythology]]), including an interpretation of "the layout of Atlantis as a sort of map of the sky".&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/JHAS./0011//0000100.000.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish astronomer [[Peter Nilson]], while recognizing that ''Hamlet's Mill'' does not qualify as a work of science, expressed admiration for it as well as it being a source of inspiration when he wrote his own book on classic mythologies based on the night sky: ''Himlavalvets sällsamheter'' (1977).

Barber &amp; Barber (2006), itself a study aiming to "uncover seismic, geological, astrological, or other natural events" from mythology, appreciates the book for its pioneer work in [[mythography]], judging that "Although controversial, &lt;nowiki&gt;[Santillana and von Dechend]&lt;/nowiki&gt; have usefully flagged and collected Herculean amounts of relevant data."&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Elizabeth Wayland and Barber, Paul T., ''When They Severed Earth from Sky: How the Human Mind Shapes Myth''. 2006. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-12774-3}}. p. 185, n.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the conclusions the authors draw from their data have been "virtually ignored by the scientific and scholarly establishment.”&lt;ref&gt;Roy G. Willis and Patrick Curry (2004), ''Astrology, Science and Culture: Pulling Down the Moon'', p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
The full hardcover title is ''Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth &amp; the Frame of Time''. Later softcover editions would use ''Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and its Transmission Through Myth''. 
The English edition was hastily assembled and published five years prior to Santillana's death. 
Hertha von Dechend (who is generally held to have written more of the book)&lt;ref&gt;"The mass of the book, including thirty-nine appendices, is clearly von Dechend's work." White (1970:541).&lt;/ref&gt; prepared an expanded second edition several years later. 
The essay was reissued by [[David R. Godine, Publisher]] in 1992. The German translation, which appeared in 1993, is slightly longer than the original. The 8th Italian edition of 2000 was substantially expanded.&lt;ref&gt;From 552 to 630 pages (see 'Editions').&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''high-integrity pressure protection system''' (HIPPS) is a type of [[safety instrumented system]] (SIS) designed to prevent over-pressurization of a plant, such as a [[chemical plant]] or [[oil refinery]]. The HIPPS will shut off the source of the high pressure before the design pressure of the system is exceeded, thus preventing loss of containment through rupture ([[explosion]]) of a line or vessel. Therefore, a HIPPS is considered as a barrier between a high-pressure and a low-pressure section of an installation.

==Traditional systems==
In traditional systems over-pressure is dealt with through [[Relief valve|relief systems]]. A relief system will open an alternative outlet for the fluids in the system once a set pressure is exceeded, to avoid further build-up of pressure in the protected system. This alternative outlet generally leads to a [[Gas flare|flare]] or venting system to safely dispose the excess fluids. A relief system aims at removing any excess inflow of fluids for safe disposal, where a HIPPS aims at stopping the inflow of excess fluids and containing them in the system.

Conventional relief systems have disadvantages such as release of (flammable and toxic) process fluids or their combustion products in the environment and often a large footprint of the installation. With increasing environmental awareness, relief systems are not always an acceptable solution. However, because of their simplicity, relatively low cost and wide availability, conventional relief systems are still often applied.

==Advantages of HIPPS==
HIPPS provides a solution to protect equipment in cases where:
*high-pressures and / or flow rates are processed
*the environment is to be protected
*the economic viability of a development needs improvement
*the risk profile of the plant must be reduced

HIPPS is an instrumented safety system that is designed and built in accordance with the [[IEC 61508]] and [[IEC 61511]] standards.

The international standards IEC 61508 and 61511 refer to safety functions and Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) when discussing a device to protect equipment, personnel and environment. Older standards use terms like safety shut-down systems, emergency shut-down systems or last layers of defence.

==Components of HIPPS==
A system that closes the source of over-pressure within a specified time with at least the same reliability as a safety relief valve is usually called a HIPPS.  Such a HIPPS is a complete functional loop consisting of:
*sensors, (or initiators) that detect the high pressure
*a logic solver, which processes the input from the sensors to an output to the final element
*final elements, that actually perform the corrective action in the field by bringing the process to a safe state. In case of a HIPPS this means shutting off the source of overpressure. The final element consists of a valve, actuator and solenoids.

==Diagram==
[[Image:HIPPS.png|frame|none|Example of a HIPPS system]]

The scheme above presents three pressure transmitters (PT) connected to a logic solver. The solver will decide based on 2-out-of-3 ([[2oo3]]) voting whether or not to activate the final element. the 1oo2 solenoid panel decides which valve to be closed. The final elements consist here of two block valves that stop flow to the downstream facilities (right) to prevent them from exceeding a maximum pressure. The operator of the plant is warned through a pressure alarm (PA) that the HIPPS was activated.
This system has a high degree of redundancy:
*failure of one of the three pressure transmitters will not compromise the HIPPS functionality, as two readings of high pressure are needed for activation.
*failure of one of the two block valves will not compromise the HIPPS functionality, as the other valve will close on activation of the HIPPS.

One must not confine self to the above design as the only means of materializing the HIPPS definition. One must always think of the HIPPS generically, as a means of isolating a source of a high pressure when down stream flow have been blocked, isolating the upstream equipment (source of the high pressure) in a highly reliable manner. Be this source of the high pressure a pump (in case of liquid) or a gas compressor (in case of gas), the aim of the HIPPS in these cases is to reliably shut down the pump or the gas compressor creating the high pressure condition in a reliable and safe manner.

==Standards and design practices==
The ever-increasing flow rates in combination with the environmental constraints initiated the widespread and rapid acceptance in the last decades of HIPPS as the ultimate protection system.

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has introduced the [[IEC 61508]] and the [[IEC 61511]] standards in 1998 and 2003. These are performance based, non-prescriptive, standards which provide a detailed framework and a life-cycle approach for the design, implementation and management of safety systems applicable to a variety of sectors with different levels of risk definition. These standards also apply to HIPPS.

The IEC 61508 mainly focuses on electrical/electronic/programmable safety-related systems. However it also provides a framework for safety-related systems based on other technologies including mechanical systems. The IEC 61511 is added by the IEC specifically for designers, integrators and users of safety instrumented systems and covers the other parts of the safety loop (sensors and final elements) in more detail.

The basis for the design of your safety instrumented system is the required [[Safety Integrity Level]] (SIL). The SIL is obtained during the risk analysis of a plant or process and represents the required risk reduction. The SIS shall meet the requirements of the applicable SIL which ranges from 1 to 4. The IEC standards define the requirements for each SIL for the lifecycle of the equipment, including design and maintenance. The SIL also defines a required [[probability of failure on demand]] (PFD) for the complete loop and architectural constraints for the loop and its different elements.

The requirements of the HIPPS should not be simplified to a PFD level only, the qualitative requirements and architectural constraints form an integral part of the requirements to an instrumented protection system such as HIPPS.

The European standard EN12186 (formerly the [[DIN]] G491) and more specific the EN14382 (formerly DIN 3381) has been used for the past decades in (mechanically) instrumented overpressure protection systems. These standards prescribe the requirements for the over-pressure protection systems, and their components, in gas plants. Not only the response time and accuracy of the loop but also safety factors for over-sizing of the actuator of the final element are dictated by these standards. Independent design verification and testing to prove compliance to the EN14382 standard is mandatory. Therefore the users often refer to this standard for HIPPS design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7898">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''history monoid''' is a way of representing the histories of concurrently running computer [[process (computer science)|processes]] as a collection of [[string (computer science)|strings]], each string representing the individual history of a process. The history [[monoid]] provides a set of [[synchronization primitive]]s (such as [[lock (computer science)|locks]], [[mutex]]es or [[thread join]]s) for providing rendezvous points between a set of independently executing processes or [[thread (computing)|threads]].

History monoids occur in the theory of [[concurrent computation]], and provide a low-level mathematical foundation for [[process calculi]], such as CSP the language of [[communicating sequential processes]], or CCS, the [[calculus of communicating systems]]. History monoids were first presented by M.W. Shields.&lt;ref&gt;M.W. Shields "Concurrent Machines", ''Computer Journal'', (1985) '''28''' pp.&amp;nbsp;449–465.&lt;/ref&gt;

History monoids are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[trace monoid]]s (free partially commutative monoids) and to the [[monoid]] of [[dependency graph]]s. As such, they are [[free object]]s and are [[universal property|universal]]. The history monoid is a type of semi-abelian [[categorical product]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of monoids.

==Product monoids and projection==
Let 
:&lt;math&gt;A=(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2,\ldots,\Sigma_n)&lt;/math&gt;

denote an ''n''-tuple of [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabets]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; denote all possible combinations of finite-length strings from the alphabets:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A)=\Sigma_1^* \times \Sigma_2^* \times \cdots \times \Sigma_n^*&lt;/math&gt;

(In more formal language, &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cartesian product]] of the [[free monoid]]s of the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;. The superscript star is the [[Kleene star]].) Composition in the product monoid is component-wise, so that, for

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{uv}=(u_1v_1,u_2v_2,\ldots,u_nv_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Define the union alphabet to be

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2 \cup \cdots \cup \Sigma_n. \,&lt;/math&gt;

(The union here is the [[set union]], not the [[disjoint union]].) Given any string &lt;math&gt;w\in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, we can pick out just the letters in some &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k^*&lt;/math&gt; using the corresponding [[string projection]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_k:\Sigma^*\to\Sigma_k^*&lt;/math&gt;. A '''distribution''' &lt;math&gt;\pi:\Sigma^*\to P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the mapping that operates on &lt;math&gt;w\in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; with all of the &lt;math&gt;\pi_k&lt;/math&gt;, separating it into components in each free monoid:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(w)\mapsto (\pi_1(w), \pi_2(w), \ldots , \pi_n(w)). \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Histories==
For every &lt;math&gt;a\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the tuple &lt;math&gt;\pi(a)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''elementary history''' of ''a''. It serves as an [[indicator function]] for the inclusion of a letter ''a'' in an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(a)=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a_k=\begin{cases} 
a \mbox{ if } a\in \Sigma_k \\
\varepsilon \mbox { otherwise }.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[empty string]].  The '''history monoid''' &lt;math&gt;H(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the submonoid of the product monoid &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; generated by the elementary histories: &lt;math&gt;H(A) = \{ \pi(a) | a\in\Sigma \}^*&lt;/math&gt; (where the superscript star is the Kleene star applied with a component-wise definition of composition as given above). The elements of  &lt;math&gt;H(A)&lt;/math&gt; are called '''global histories''', and the projections of a global history are called '''individual histories'''.

==Connection to computer science==
The use of the word ''history'' in this context, and the connection to concurrent computing, can be understood as follows. An individual history is a record of the sequence of [[state (computer science)|states]] of a process (or [[thread (computer science)|thread]] or [[Turing machine|machine]]); the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; is the set of states of the process.

A letter that occurs in two or more alphabets serves as a [[synchronization primitive]] between the various individual histories. That is, if such a letter occurs in one individual history, it must also occur in another history, and serves to "tie" or "rendezvous" them together.

Consider, for example, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1=\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2=\{a,d,e\}&lt;/math&gt;. The union alphabet is of course &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\{a,b,c,d,e\}&lt;/math&gt;. The elementary histories are &lt;math&gt;(a,a)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(b,\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(c,\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon,d)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon,e)&lt;/math&gt;.  In this example, an individual history of the first process might be &lt;math&gt;bcbcc&lt;/math&gt; while the individual history of the second machine might be &lt;math&gt;ddded&lt;/math&gt;. Both of these individual histories are represented by the global history &lt;math&gt;bcbdddcced&lt;/math&gt;, since the projection of this string onto the individual alphabets yields the individual histories. In the global history, the letter &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be considered to commute with the letters &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, in that these can be rearranged without changing the individual histories. Such commutation is simply a statement that the first and second processes are running concurrently, and are unordered with respect to each other; they have not (yet) exchanged any messages or performed any synchronization.

The letter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; serves as a synchronization primitive, as its occurrence marks a spot in both the global and individual histories, that cannot be commuted across. Thus, while the letters &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; can be re-ordered past &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, they cannot be reordered past &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the global history &lt;math&gt;bcdabe&lt;/math&gt; and the global history &lt;math&gt;bdcaeb&lt;/math&gt; both have as individual histories &lt;math&gt;bcab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dae&lt;/math&gt;, indicating that the execution of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; may happen before or after &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. However, the letter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is synchronizing, so that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is guaranteed to happen after &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, even though &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is in a different [[process (computer science)|process]] than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
The history monoid is isomorphic to the [[trace monoid]], and as such, is a type of semi-abelian [[categorical product]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of monoids.  In particular, the history monoid &lt;math&gt;H(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2,\ldots,\Sigma_n)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the trace monoid &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{M}(D)&lt;/math&gt; with the [[dependency relation]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;D=\left(\Sigma_1\times\Sigma_1\right)\cup
\left(\Sigma_2\times\Sigma_2\right)\cup \cdots \cup
\left(\Sigma_n\times\Sigma_n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In simple terms, this is just the formal statement of the informal discussion given above: the letters in an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; can be commutatively re-ordered past the letters in an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_j&lt;/math&gt;, unless they are letters that occur in both alphabets. Thus, traces are exactly global histories, and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2011">'''''The Indices of Deprivation 2010''''' (ID 2010) is a [[deprivation index]] at the small area level, created by the British [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] (DCLG) and released on 24 March 2011. It follows the [[Indices of deprivation 2007|ID2007]] and because much of the datasets are the same or similar between indices allows a comparison of "relative deprivation" of an area between the two indices.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/indices2010?view=Standard&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is known as the ID2010, most of the data actually dates from 2008.

==Key results==
*Over 5 million people lived in the most deprived areas in [[England]] in 2008 and 38 per cent of them were income deprived.
*[[Liverpool]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Manchester]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]], the City of [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] are the local authorities with the highest proportion of [[ONS coding system#Super Output Areas|lower layer Super Output Areas]] amongst the most deprived in England.
*Ninety-eight per cent of the most deprived lower layer Super Output Areas are in urban areas but there are also pockets of deprivation across rural areas
*Fifty-six per cent of local authorities contain at least one lower layer Super Output Areas amongst the 10 per cent most deprived in England
*Eighty-eight per cent of the lower layer Super Output Areas that are the most deprived in 2010 were also amongst the most deprived in 2007.

According to the research, the most deprived area in the country is in the village of [[Jaywick]] on the Essex coast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2390">'''Institute of Marine Sciences and Fisheries]''' ('''IMSF''') is an institute of [[Chittagong University]] in [[Bangladesh]]. It was originally established as the Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography in 1971 and under the [[Canadian Technical Assistance Program]], later included in the development scheme of the University under the [[Five-year plans of Pakistan|Fourth Five-year Plan]] of Bangladesh. In 1983, it was turned into the Institute of Marine Sciences. It trains people in [[marine science]] and its related disciplines, researches on marine, [[brackish]] and related environments and their resources, provides assistance to the government on [[sea|maritime]] issues, publishes books and journals on marine science, and  disseminates technology on marine science to the stakeholders.

In 1996, the M.Sc. in [[Marine Science]] degree program at the Institute has been diversified by introducing six specializations, namely, Fisheries, [[Aquaculture]], Oceanography, Fish Nutrition &amp; Feed Technology, [[Post-harvest Technology]], and [[Marine Pollution]]. In 2011, the Institute launched the country's first B.Sc. (Honours) in [[Oceanography]] degree program, and in 2012, B.Sc. in [[Fisheries]] (Honours) program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1787">'''Jarmil Michael Burghauser''' (born '''Jarmil Michael Mokrý''', October 21, 1921, [[Písek]]{{spaced ndash}}February 19, 1997, [[Prague]]) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[composer]], [[conducting|conductor]], and [[musicology|musicologist]].

After the short-lived [[Prague Spring]], he incurred the disfavor of his country's [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist regime]] and had to adopt the [[pseudonym]] '''Michal Hájků''' in order to write a series of compositions in a style which evoked earlier periods of music, called ''Storie apocrifa della musica Boema''.

The [[List of compositions by Antonín Dvořák|works of Antonín Dvořák]] are commonly referred to today (as an alternative to the often confusing or absent [[opus number]]s) by their '''Burghauser numbers''', based on an authoritative [[List of compositions by Antonín Dvořák|chronological catalog Burghauser prepared]] of [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]'s œuvre. Dvořák's pieces were not published in the order he wrote them, and his publisher gave his works opus numbers corresponding to  publishing date. Burghauser has helped greatly to clear up this confusion.

In [[anatomy]], a '''joint capsule''' or '''articular capsule''' is an envelope surrounding a [[synovial joint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/asp/dictionary.asp?keyword=Articular+capsule eMedicine/Stedman Medical Dictionary Lookup!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412020141/http://www.emedicine.com/asp/dictionary.asp?keyword=Articular+capsule |date=2008-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each joint capsule has two parts: an outer fibrous layer or membrane, and an inner synovial layer or membrane.

==Membranes==
Each capsule consists of two layers or membranes:
* an outer ('''fibrous membrane''', ''fibrous stratum'') composed of avascular white fibrous tissue
* an inner (''[[synovial membrane]]'', ''synovial stratum'') which is a secreting layer

On the inside of the capsule, articular cartilage covers the end surfaces of the bones that articulate within that joint.

The outer layer is highly innervated by the same nerves which perforate through the adjacent muscles associated with the joint.

==Fibrous membrane==
The fibrous membrane of the joint capsule is attached to the whole circumference of the articular end of each [[bone]] entering into the joint, and thus entirely surrounds the articulation.  It is made up of dense irregular connective tissue. It's a long spongy tissue.

==Clinical significance==
[[Frozen shoulder]] (adhesive capsulitis) is a disorder in which the [[shoulder]] capsule becomes inflamed.

[[Plica syndrome]] is a disorder in which the synovial plica becomes inflamed and causes abnormal biomechanics in the knee.

The technical meaning of '''maintenance''' involves  functional checks, servicing, repairing or replacing of necessary devices, equipment, machinery, building infrastructure, and supporting utilities in industrial, business, governmental, and residential installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defense Logistics Agency|url=http://www.dla.mil|website=DLA.mil|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Federation of National Maintenance Societies|url=http://www.efnms.org/|website=EFNMS.org|quote=All actions which have the objective of retaining or restoring an item in or to a state in which it can perform its required function. The actions include the combination of all technical and corresponding administrative, managerial, and supervision actions.|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this has come to often include both [[planned maintenance|scheduled]] and [[preventive maintenance|preventive]] maintenance as cost-effective practices to keep equipment ready for operation at the [[utilization]] stage of a [[system lifecycle]].

The marine transportation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marine Painting Manual|first1=A.

==Definitions==
[[File:Pothole repair.jpg|thumb|Road repair]]

Over time, the terminology of maintenance and MRO has begun to become standardized. The United States Department of Defense uses the following definitions:&lt;ref name="1037C"&gt;[[Federal Standard 1037C]] and from [[MIL-STD-188]] and from the [[Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any activity—such as tests, measurements, replacements, adjustments, and repairs—intended to retain or restore a [[functional unit]] in or to a specified state in which the unit can perform its required functions.&lt;ref name="1037C" /&gt;
* All action taken to retain material in a serviceable condition or to restore it to serviceability. It includes inspections, testing, servicing, classification as to serviceability, repair,  [[rebuilding]], and reclamation.&lt;ref name="1037C" /&gt;
* All supply and repair action taken to keep a force in condition to carry out its mission.&lt;ref name="1037C" /&gt;
* The routine recurring work required to keep a facility ([[plant]], building, structure, [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] facility, utility [[system]], or other real property) in such condition that it may be continuously used, at its original or designed capacity and efficiency for its intended purpose.&lt;ref name="1037C" /&gt;

Maintenance is strictly connected to the utilization stage of the product or technical system, in which the concept of maintainability must be included. In this scenario, maintainability is considered as the ability of an item, under stated conditions of use, to be retained in or restored to a state in which it can perform its required functions, using prescribed procedures and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|publisher=[[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]|work=NATO Standardization Agency|title=AAP-6 - Glossary of terms and definitions|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.247electricalservices.co.uk/|title=Commercial Electrical Contractor and Domestic Electrician Leeds|website=247 Electrical Services Leeds|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some domains like [[aircraft maintenance]], terms ''maintenance, repair and overhaul''&lt;ref&gt;United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 14, Part 43 - Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, Rebuilding, and Alteration&lt;/ref&gt; also include inspection, rebuilding, alteration and the supply of spare parts, accessories, raw materials, adhesives, sealants, coatings and [[consumables]] for aircraft maintenance at the [[utilization]] stage. In international civil aviation maintenance means: 
* The performance of tasks required to ensure the continuing airworthiness of an aircraft, including any one or combination of overhaul, inspection, replacement, defect rectification, and the embodiment of a modification or a repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Airworthiness Manual, Doc 9760 |url=https://store.icao.int/airworthiness-manual-english-printed.html |edition=3 |location=Montreal (Canada) |publisher=[[International Civil Aviation Organization]] |date=2014 |pages=375 |isbn=978-92-9249-454-4 |quote=The Airworthiness Manual (Doc 9760) contains a consolidation of airworthiness-related information previously found in other ICAO documents ... provides guidance to States on how to meet their airworthiness responsibilities under the Convention on International Civil Aviation. This third edition is presented based on States' roles and responsibilities, thus as State of Registry, State of the Operator, State of Design and State of Manufacture. It also describes the interface between different States and their related responsibilities. It has been updated to incorporate changes to Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention — Airworthiness of Aircraft, and to Annex 6 — Operation of Aircraft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition covers all activities for which [[aviation regulations]] require issuance of a maintenance release document (aircraft certificate of return to service - CRS).

==Types==
The basic types of maintenance falling under MRO include:
* [[preventive maintenance|Preventive]] or [[scheduled maintenance|scheduled]] maintenance, where equipment or facilities are inspected, maintained and protected before break down or other problems occur.
* [[Corrective maintenance|Corrective]] maintenance where equipment is repaired or replaced after wear, malfunction or break down.
* Predictive maintenance, which uses sensor data to monitor a system, then continuously evaluates it against historical trends to predict failure before it occurs.&lt;ref name=simap /&gt;

[[Architectural conservation]] employs MRO to preserve, rehabilitate, restore, or reconstruct historical structures with stone, brick, glass, metal, and wood which match the original constituent materials where possible, or with suitable polymer technologies when not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Materials for Conservation: Organic Consolidants, Adhesives and Coatings|first=Charles Velson|last=Horie|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|edition=2nd|date=2010|isbn=978-0-75-066905-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventive===

{{Further|Planned maintenance}}
[[File:C-130J Hercules cleaning.jpg|thumb|C-130J Hercules preventive cleaning at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi after a period of operation over the Gulf of Mexico (salt and moisture which lead to active corrosion require regular cleaning)]]

Preventive maintenance is maintenance performed with the intent of avoiding failures, safety violations, unnecessary production costs and losses, and to conserve original materials of fabrication.
The effectiveness of a preventive maintenance schedule depends on the [[Reliability centered maintenance|RCM analysis]] which it was based on, and the ground rules used for cost efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCM Reliability Centered Maintenance Analysis|url=http://www.mtain.com/logistics/logrcm.htm|website=MTain.com|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corrective===
{{Main|Corrective maintenance}}

Corrective maintenance is a type of maintenance used for equipment after equipment break down or malfunction is often most expensive – not only can worn equipment damage other parts and cause multiple damage, but consequential repair and replacement costs and loss of revenues due to down time during overhaul can be significant. Rebuilding and resurfacing of equipment and infrastructure damaged by erosion and corrosion as part of corrective or preventive maintenance programmes involves conventional processes such as welding and metal flame spraying, as well as engineered solutions with [[Thermosetting polymer|thermoset polymeric]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial Polymer Applications: Essential Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=United Kingdom|edition=1st|date=2016|isbn=978-1782628149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictive===
{{Main|Predictive maintenance}}

More recently, advances in sensing and computing technology have given rise to ''predictive maintenance''. This maintenance strategy uses sensors to monitor key parameters within a machine or system, and uses this data in conjunction with analysed historical trends to continuously evaluate the system health and predict a breakdown before it happens.&lt;ref name=simap&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Garcia | first1 = Mari Cruz| last2 = Sanz-Bobi | first2 = Miguel A.| last3 = Del Pico | first3 = Javier| title = SIMAP: Intelligent System for Predictive Maintenance: Application to the health condition monitoring of a windturbine gearbox| journal = Computers in Industry| volume = 57| issue = 6| pages = 552–568| date = August 2006| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361506000534| doi = 10.1016/j.compind.2006.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy allows maintenance to be performed more efficiently, since more up-to-date data is obtained about how close the product is to failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Kaiser | first1 = Kevin A.| last2 = Gebraeel | first2 = Nagi Z.| title = Predictive Maintenance Management Using Sensor-Based Degradation Models| journal =  IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans| volume = 39| issue = 4| pages = 840–849| date = 12 May 2009| url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4914831/| doi = 10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2016429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51011">'''Natural capital accounting''' is the process of calculating the total [[stocks and flows]] of [[natural resources]] and services in a given ecosystem or region.&lt;ref name="Pembina"&gt;[http://www.pembina.org/economics/natural-capital,, "Natural Capital"], "Pembina Institute", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Accounting for such goods may occur in physical or monetary terms. This process can subsequently inform government, corporate and consumer decision making as each relates to the use or consumption of natural resources and land, and sustainable behaviour.&lt;ref name="Pembina" /&gt;

== Methods of accounting ==

There are several methods of [[accounting]] which aim to address the issue of sustainability. These are: large and eclectic [[Dashboard (business)|dashboard]]s; [[composite (finance)|composite indices]]; indices focusing on [[overconsumption]]; adjusted economic indicators.

=== Large and eclectic dashboards ===

These dashboards bring together a number of indicators that are directly and indirectly related to the durability of socio-economic progress.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090916235317/http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/documents/rapport_anglais.pdf "Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress"], "Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this is the [[Eurostat]] Sustainable Development Indicators, which is a list of over 100 indicators used to monitor the EU Sustainable Development Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/sdi/indicators, "Indicators"], "Eurostat", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism associated with these dashboards is that a large number of indicators risks muddling a clear message about sustainability that resonates with policy makers or citizens.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/greengrowthindicators.htm, "Green growth indicators"], "OECD"&lt;/ref&gt; In response, there has been a greater tendency to select headline indicators that "track central elements of green growth and [are] representative of a broader set of green growth issues."&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt;

=== Composite indices ===

Composite indices normalize and aggregate various data into a single number.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; For example, the [[Human Development Index]], Osberg and Sharpe's Index of Economic Well-Being, the Changing Wealth of Nations, or the [[Environmental Sustainability Index]], which ranks countries based on an assessment of 76 variables covering 5 domains.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; It is often instructive to examine the separate dimensions of these indices.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; However, they may present a skewed view of countries' contributions to environmental problems and make problematic, normative assumptions about the values of certain variables.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt;

=== Adjusted GDPs ===

Adjusted gross domestic product, or [[green GDP]], systematically corrects conventional [[GDP]] by taking into account aspects of a country's production of goods and services (e.g. [[environmental degradation]] and natural resource depletion) that would not otherwise be included in the indicator, but are relevant to sustainability.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt;

=== Indices focusing on overconsumption ===

Indicators that fall in this category conceive of sustainability with respect to consumption levels and investment in natural resources.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; Examples include [[adjusted net savings]] (ANS) and [[ecological footprint]] accounts. ANS is calculated as the change in total wealth over a given time period, while ecological footprint assessments determine how much of the regenerative capacity of the biosphere is required to maintain the consumption habits of a defined population.&lt;ref name="Monfreda"&gt;C. Monfreda et al., [http://www.sze.hu/fk/kornyezet/cikkek8/kcx1415.pdf, "Establishing national natural capital accounts based on detailed Ecological Footprint and biological capacity assessments"], "Land Use Policy 21", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit emphasis on [[sustainability]] makes these indices useful; however computing them by country fails to capture the global nature of sustainability.

=== Monetary or physical indicators ===

All sustainability indicators can be grouped broadly into two types. Specifically, they will be calculated in monetary terms, using one or more valuation techniques, or in physical terms. It is more likely for monetary indicators to be expressed as flows, and physical indicators as stocks.

== Global initiatives ==

General commitment by the international community to support the development of natural capital accounting was motivated early on by the [[Brundtland Report]] in 1987 and the 1992 [[Rio Summit]].&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; At the Summit in particular, [[Agenda 21]] – in which Chapter 40 called for signatories to develop quantitative information regarding their activities – was adopted.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt;

=== System of environmental-economic accounting ===

In September 1992, the Commission on the Environment of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) Permanent Council held a Seminar on Natural Resource and Environmental Accounts for Development Policy.&lt;ref name="OAS"&gt;Committee on the Environment
of the OAS Permanent Council, [http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea38e/oea38e.pdf, "Natural Resource and Environmental Accounts for Development Policy"], "OAS Permanent Council", 13–14 April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the country participants expressed interest in developing accounting capacities for natural resources.&lt;ref name="OAS" /&gt; A proposal was made at that time to create a program to coordinate and strengthen the efforts of countries and institutions undertaking such initiatives.&lt;ref name="OAS" /&gt;

The development of the first [[system of environmental-economic accounting]] (SEEA) in 1993 (SEEA-1993) was a major step towards establishing standards around integrating the environment into national accounts, and subsequently, environmentally-adjusting or "greening" macroeconomic indicators such as GDP.&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;Joy Hecht, [http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C13/E1-21-03-04.pdf, "The Evolving System of Integrated Economic and Environmental Accounts"], "Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; While the SEEA-2003 and subsequent revisions being undertaken for 2013 have expanded the range of analyses within the framework, the purpose of the SEEA has remained the same. It is an accounting framework that records the stocks and flows that are relevant to both the environment and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Committee of Experts on Environmental Economic Accounting, [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seearev/Chapters/SEEA_CentralFramework_Ch1.pdf, "SEEA Central Framework"], "United Nations Statistics Division", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Its Central Framework comprises three main accounts that can be integrated with the existing [[United Nations System of National Accounts]] (SNA), and each focuses on a different aspect of the interaction between the economy and the environment: physical flow accounts; functional accounts for environmental transactions; and asset accounts in physical and monetary terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/4655.0.55.002Appendix12013?opendocument&amp;tabname=Notes&amp;prodno=4655.0.55.002&amp;issue=2013&amp;num=&amp;view=, "Information Paper – Toward the Australian Environmental-Economic Accounts, 2013"], "Australian Bureau of Statistics", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest version of the SEEA (Q3, 2012) has two other parts, aside from the Central Framework: SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounts and SEEA Extensions.&lt;ref name="Experimental"&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seearev/Chapters/SEEA_EEA_v1.pdf, "SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting – Consultation Draft"], "United Nations Statistics Division", 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The Experimental Ecosystem Accounts, specifically, introduces an accounting framework for ecosystems, despite the fact that many of its relevant stocks and flows are centered on non-market assets.&lt;ref name="Experimental" /&gt; While some of the measurement concepts involved in the accounting process are still evolving, it is possible that the eventual valuation of ecosystems and their depletion could be included in the calculations of environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators. This has implications for future policy, since the emphasis on certain projects or activities undertaken by governments will likely change, depending on how the above-mentioned measurements impact their respective accounts, and subsequent environmental adjustments to certain indicators.

The London Group on Environmental Accounting and the UN Committee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting are two groups, created in 1994 and 2005 respectively, to assist in the development of the SEEA and its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seearev/, "SEEA Revision"], "United Nations Statistics Division", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the Working Group on Environmental Auditing, a subgroup of the [[International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions]], is working to improve auditing standards related to environmental issues.

=== Wealth Accounting and Ecosystem Partnership Services ===

The ability of developing countries to build their natural capital account capacities is being improved significantly through the Wealth Accounting and Ecosystem Partnership Services (WAVES), by encouraging the development of relevant measurement frameworks. WAVES is global partnership that was inaugurated in October 2010 by [[World Bank]] President [[Robert Zoellick]] at the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] COP-10 meeting in Japan.&lt;ref name="WAVES1"&gt;[http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/about-us, "About Us"], "Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to promote sustainable development by encouraging the inclusion of natural capital measurements in national accounts. Several projects have been initiated in developing countries such as Botswana, Colombia and Madagascar with a view to improving their capacity to implement the SEEA, in collaboration with [[UNEP]], the [[UNDP]], the [[United Nations Statistical Commission]], and the financial support of NGOs and the governments of Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Norway and the United States.&lt;ref name="WAVES1" /&gt;

=== Ecological footprint accounts ===

Alternately, there have been many attempts to move away from integrated accounts, and towards novel sustainability indices or statistics. [[Ecological footprint]] accounts, developed by [[Mathis Wackernagel]] and [[William E. Rees]], and since 200, further developed by [[Global Footprint Network]], compare human demand against what the planet or a region can regenerate. An overview paper documenting the accounting method of the 20018 edition of the National Footprint Accounts was published by David Lin et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=David|last2=Hanscom|first2=Laurel|last3=Murthy|first3=Adeline|last4=Galli|first4=Alessandro|last5=Evans|first5=Mikel|last6=Neill|first6=Evan|last7=Mancini|first7=Maria|last8=Martindill|first8=Jon|last9=Medouar|first9=Fatime-Zahra|date=2018-09-17|title=Ecological Footprint Accounting for Countries: Updates and Results of the National Footprint Accounts, 2012–2018|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/7/3/58|journal=Resources|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=58|doi=10.3390/resources7030058}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the proposal for nine planetary boundaries within which humans can safely operate, by Rockström et al., are projects which advocate for new approaches to global sustainability.&lt;ref name="Monfreda" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Rockstrom et al., [http://www.stockholmresilience.org/download/18.8615c78125078c8d3380002197/ES-2009-3180.pdf, "Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity"], "Ecology and Society, 14:2", 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusive Wealth Index ===

The UN International Human Dimensions Programme has created an inclusive sustainability indicator, the [[Inclusive Wealth Index]] (IWI), which measures the productive bases of an economy: produced, natural and human capital, and based on these three assessments, calculates the trajectory of a country's wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Partha Dasgupta and Anantha Duraiappah, [http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-chapter-1, "Well-being and wealth"], "International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation of natural capital in the IWI is based on the shadow value of an economy's natural capital assets.

A similar conceptual direction was taken by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, under the direction of economists Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, at the behest of former French President Nicholas Sarkozy, in 2008. The authors concluded that a pragmatic measure of sustainability would combine an indicator based on the extended wealth approach, and a small dashboard of physical indicators.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt;

While they have different theoretical underpinnings, what these approaches have in common with each other is a fundamental recognition of the limitations of traditional indicators in measuring economic performance and social progress, and the importance of sustainability in the long-run.

=== Beyond GDP ===

There have been several initiatives organized at the regional level that seek to move away from traditional GDP as the major indicator of wealth and well-being. The first of these is Beyond GDP, an initiative started by the EU in 2007 to develop highly aggregated environmental and social indicators and extend the national accounts to environmental and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/background.html, "About Beyond GDP"], "European Commission", 2007-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the Summit for Sustainability in Africa was held in Gaborone, Botswana. It also brought together leaders from ten African countries to discuss sustainable development planning, and in particular, to commit to a set of goals on fully accounting for natural capital, and integrating it into national planning, reporting and policies. This commitment took the form of the ''[[Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa]]''&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;[http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/5050-initiative-next-steps, "The 50:50 Initiative: Next Steps"], "Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Four publications were presented at the CBD COP-10 by [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB) initiative: TEEB Ecological and Economic Foundations, TEEB in National and International Policy Making, TEEB in Local and Regional Policy, and TEEB in Business and Enterprise.&lt;ref name="AboutTEEB"&gt;[http://www.teebweb.org/about/, "About TEEB"], "The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB)"&lt;/ref&gt; These, along with an Interim Report released at the CBD COP-9 in Bonn, Germany, represent a comprehensive analysis of the economic value of biodiversity, and the consequences it holds for different levels of public and private policy analysis.&lt;ref name="AboutTEEB" /&gt; TEEB also seeks to systematize the role of corporations, under the TEEB for Business Coalition (2012), by formulating standards and assessing externalities.&lt;ref name="Declaration"&gt;[http://www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org/the-declaration/, "The Declaration"], "UNEP FI, GCP &amp; FGV", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Since natural capital accounting requires the identification of replenishment activities as well as environmental degradation, the inclusion of corporations into the valuation process is key.

=== Natural Capital Declaration ===

In June 2012, the Rio+20 conference "marked a watershed in the world wide interest on Natural Capital Accounting".&lt;ref name="fifty" /&gt; The Natural Capital Declaration (NCD), a commitment by CEOs in the financial sector to embed ESG considerations in management and investment activities, was revealed prior to the conference.&lt;ref name="Declaration" /&gt; As well, the World Bank started the WAVES 50:50 Initiative to analyze the progress and next steps required for improving efforts to account for natural capital and enhance countries' sustainable decision-making capabilities.&lt;ref name="fifty" /&gt;  At the time of the conference, 62 countries, 90 corporations, and 17 civil society members had signed on to the campaign.&lt;ref name="fifty" /&gt;

== Country initiatives ==

Many countries are undertaking projects to develop environmental accounts, to integrate them with national accounts or to create environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators, including Green GDP. Early adopters of integrated environmental-economic accounts include the Netherlands, France, and the Philippines. This section documents the initiatives undertaken by, or concerning the G20 countries.

===Argentina===

A team of researchers at the University of Buenos Aires and CONICET organized the ARKLEMS+LAND project. Their research, based on the KLEMS database framework (Capital, Labour, Energy, Material and Service Inputs), measures and analyses the sources of economic growth, productivity and competitiveness in the Argentinian economy.&lt;ref name="KLEMS"&gt;Ariel Coremberg, [http://www.econ.uba.ar/www/institutos/economia/Ceped/actividades/Seminario%20Interdisciplinario/Mesa%20Exposici%C3%B3n%201%20-%20Estructura,%20productividad%20y%20mercado%20de%20trabajo/Coremberg.pdf, "Measuring Productivity in Unstable and Natural Resources Dependent Economies: Argentina"], "Second World KLEMS Conference Harvard University", 9–10 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The database includes the contributions of "Natural Resource as Land and Subsoil Assets" services to GDP growth.&lt;ref name="KLEMS" /&gt;

Professor George Santopietro, at Radford University in Virginia, examined several alternative methods for estimating resource rent and relatedly, depletion costs of natural capital. The methods he engages with are: net price, El Serafy's depletion cost, sustainable price, transaction value and replacement cost.&lt;ref name="YPF"&gt;George Santopietro, [http://bbs.cenet.org.cn/uploadimages/20041292103137830.pdf, "Alternative methods for estimating resource rent and depletion cost: the case of Argentina's YPF"], "Resources Policy", 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He derives data from the privatization of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF), Argentina's state-owned oil enterprise, and using each method, generates estimated resource rent and depletion cost values for Argentina's reserves of petroleum.&lt;ref name="YPF" /&gt; The results show that the net price and transaction value methods overvalue the resource rent of petroleum reserves. He concludes that rent should be derived using the value of a firm's stock.&lt;ref name="YPF" /&gt;

===Australia===

Several Australian organizations produce national environmental accounts. The Australian Bureau of Statistics produces Water Account Australia and a pilot Land Account for the Great Barrier Reef, both of which are based on the SEEA framework. The Bureau of Meteorology produces a complementary National Water Account on the water available to be used. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency reports on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists has created a trial, environmental accounting model that can be applied to regions of any size. These regional accounts use a common unit of measurement, which allows comparisons to be made between different natural capital assets. The Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment is in the process of developing experimental ecosystem accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/environment/activities/accounts.shtml, "Environmental Accounts"], "Australian Bureau of Meteorology", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy and water accounts found on the National Balance Sheet are produced annually.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/F7B724440108BF5BCA25773700169D0D?opendocument, "Year Book Australia, 2009-10"], "Australian Bureau of Statistics", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As well, subsoil assets, timber for producing logs, and land are valued monetarily, and included on the non-produced assets in the National Balance Sheet.&lt;ref name="Yearbook" /&gt; The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is currently working with several other national departments on the National Plan for Environmental Information (NPEI), the State of the Environment Report, and planning for national environmental accounts.

In 2012, following the adoption of the SEEA as an international statistical standard, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) also published a report titled "Completing the Picture – Environmental Accounting in Practice," which develops a number of accounting tables rooted in SEEA formatting, and explores how these could influence policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4628.0.55.001main+features10May+2012, "Completing the Picture – Environmental Accounting in Practice, May 2012"], Australian Bureau of Statistics", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===

The UK produces Environmental Accounts, consistent with the SEEA framework, that are separated into three dimensions: natural resource accounts, physical flows and monetary accounts.&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/agriculture-environment/environment/environmental-accounts, "Topic guide to: Environmental Accounts"], "UK National Statistics", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the data is measured in physical units; monetary units are used where relevant, and if the necessary data is available.&lt;ref name="UK" /&gt;

The current environmental asset accounts produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are: oil and gas reserves, forestry and land cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/environmental/uk-environmental-accounts/2011---blue-book-update/artnaturalcapital.html#tab-UK-experience-of-environmental-asset-accounting, "Towards a sustainable environment – UK natural capital and ecosystem economic accounting"], "Office for National Statistics", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the ONS planned to run a study on producing a full ecosystem account, with high priority on physical and monetary forestry accounts.&lt;ref name="UK2"&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/environmental/uk-environmental-accounts/2011---blue-book-update/artnaturalcapital.html#tab-Conclusions-and-the-way-forward, "Towards a sustainable environment – UK natural capital and ecosystem economic accounting"], "Office for National Statistics", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Office also set out a series of goals to include land use and cover accounts in the 2013 Environmental Accounts.&lt;ref name="UK2" /&gt;

The UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA) was a two-year initiative from 2009 to 2011 that assessed the benefits of the natural environment to society and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/, "What is the UK National Ecosystem Assessment"], "UK National Ecosystem Assessment", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government has pledged to develop full UK Environmental Accounts by 2020. This work is being led by the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) and the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (Defra). The UK [[Natural Capital Committee]] is providing advice to help inform this project.
In December 2012, the ONS published a 'roadmap' that set out the work-plan for the project. 
The incorporation of natural capital into the national accounts, if done properly, would enable a high level picture to be obtained of trends in the state of the nation's natural assets through time.  This in turn would help demonstrate the implications of actions impacting on the natural environment and may, therefore, encourage policy-makers to ensure natural assets are in future used sustainably through the appropriate use of policy levers.

The [http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/home.html Natural Capital Committee] is also developing a methodology for corporate natural capital accounting. It is undertaking a pilot project throughout 2014 with a range of organisations to test and refine this methodology and is encouraging organisations that own or manage land to develop [http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/corporate-natural-capital-accounting.html corporate natural capital accounts].

===Brazil===

Despite reports that Brazil would produce a Green GDP in the lead-up to the Rio+20, there is no indication that this process was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurofoodlaw.com/policy/environment/green-gdp-shapes-brazilian-food-production-policy--1.htm, "Green GDP shapes Brazilian food production policy"], "EU Food Law", 16 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Statistics Canada does not redefine or supplement existing national accounts aggregates with environmental information. However, it has developed the Canadian System of Environmental and Resource Accounts (CSERA), which "provides some information for those who may wish to calculate such "green aggregates.""&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/nea-cen/faq-foq/env-eng.htm#q2, "Environmental and resource accounts"], "Statistics Canada", 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes estimates of land in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the Canadian balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Elva Bova, et al.,[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp1395.pdf, "Another Look at Governments' Balance Sheets: The Role of Non-financial Assets"], "International Monetary Fund", 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSERA has three dimensions: Natural Resource Stock Accounts; Material and Energy Flow Accounts; and Environmental Protection Expenditure Accounts.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/16-505-g/16-505-g1997001-eng.pdf, "Concepts, Sources and Methods of the Canadian System of Environmental and Resource Accounts"], "Statistics Canada", 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Natural Resource Stock Accounts are measured in physical and monetary units.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt; These, in turn, comprise natural resource wealth estimates that are included on the National Balance Sheet Accounts.

In 2005, the Pembina Institute published a report on the Canada Boreal Initiative, which sought to quantify the full economic value of goods and services provided by Canada's Boreal region. The Boreal Ecosystem Wealth Accounting System (BEWAS) was constructed for this purpose. It considered the physical conditions in the boreal region by using physical inventory and spatial data.&lt;ref name="Canada2"&gt;[http://www.borealcanada.ca/documents/Boreal_Wealth_Report_Nov_2005.pdf, "Counting Canada's Natural Capital: Assessing the real value of Canada's Boreal Ecosystems"], "Pembina Institute", 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The two-year study approximated the market value, for 2002, of the region's forestry, mining, oil and gas, and hydroelectric generation sectors at $48.9 billion.&lt;ref name="Canada2" /&gt;  For the same time period, it also estimated the net market value of natural capital extraction at $37.8 billion and the non-market value of ecosystem services at $93.2 billion.&lt;ref name="Canada2" /&gt;

Professor Nancy Olewiler, at Simon Fraser University, conducted several case studies to value natural capital in settled areas of Canada. Her agricultural lands case studies found the total net value of conservation efforts to be approximately $195/ha/yr in the Ontario Grand River Watershed, $65/ha/yr in the Upper Assiniboine River Basin and $126/ha/yr in the Prince Edward Island Mill River Watershed.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Olewiler, [https://www.sfu.ca/mpp-old/04research/pdfs/natural_capital.pdf, "The Value of Natural Capital in Settled Areas of Canada"], "Simon Fraser University", 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

In 1997, Beijing authorities carried out a project assessing the city's Green GDP.&lt;ref name="China1"&gt;Vic Li and Graeme Lang, [https://www.academia.edu/1622586/Chinas_Green-GDP_Experiment_and_the_Struggle_for_Ecological_Modernization_by_Vic_Li_and_Graeme_Lang, "China's "Green GDP" Experiment and the Struggle for Ecological Modernization"], "Journal of Contemporary Asia, 40: 1", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This set a series of precedents for environmentally adjusted indicators in the country. Over the next decade, several regional pilot projects were undertaken by local authorities. Between 2001 and 2004, Chinese authorities worked with Statistics Norway to carry out a Green GDP assessment of Chongqing.&lt;ref name="China1" /&gt;

Then, in 2004, the Green GDP Accounting Research Project was launched by the State Environmental Protection Administration of China (SEPA) and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The findings, released in the China Green National Accounting Study Report 2004 in 2006, reported that environmental pollution cost the economy 511.8 billion yuan or 3.5% of GDP in 2004.&lt;ref name="China2"&gt;Du Jing, [http://www.gov.cn/english/2006-09/11/content_384596.htm, "Green GDP Accounting Study Report 2004 issued"], "Chinese Government's Official Web Portal", 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A breakdown of the figure shows that water pollution, air pollution, and solid waste and accidents cost 286.28 billion yuan, 219.8 billion yuan, and 5.74 billion yuan, respectively.&lt;ref name="China2" /&gt; According to the report, only about ten of the items the project intended to distinguish were accounted for.&lt;ref name="China2" /&gt; The costs of resource depletion and ecological damage were not included in the calculations because of methodological difficulties, limited technological capabilities and a lack of relevant data.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/nature/greengdp.html, "Opinion: Green GDP"], "Public Broadcasting Station", 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the report was released, SEPA Vice Minister Zhu Guangya issued an independent report stating that each year, environmental damage in the country cost approximately 10% of GDP.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; This estimate was consistent with the one that scientists, economists and the World Bank had expected, of 8-12% of GDP.

The government withdrew its official support for Green GDP in 2007, after early results showed the reduction of growth rates in some provinces to nearly zero. It also did not release an official Green GDP report for 2005, which had been scheduled for publication in March 2007.

Reports have periodically surfaced about re-calculating China's green GDP. In 2007, the All-China Environment Federation (ACEF) called on the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to carry out a national accounting system.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Xiaohua, [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/19/content_853917.htm, "Call for return to green accounting"], "China Daily", 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''China Daily'' reported that the Ministry of Environmental Protection valued the cost of pollution to the economy at 1.4 trillion yuan in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lelyveld, [http://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/energy_watch/greengdp-02132012120520.html, "China's 'Green GDP' Resurfaces"], "Radio Free Asia", 13 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1998, the NBS developed rudimentary environmental accounts in forestry and energy. Since then, the NBS has expanded its environmental accounts to include pollution treatment, water, and minerals, along with the development of a comprehensive SEEA for China.&lt;ref name="China1" /&gt;

===European Union===

The interaction between Eurostat and national statistical offices of EU Member States was formalized in 2011, by the adoption of Regulation No 691 on European Environmental Economic Accounts. It requires Member States to report data and accounts on air emissions, taxes related to the environment, and material flows from 2012.&lt;ref name="EU1"&gt;Leonardo Mazza and Patrick ten Brink, [http://www.ieep.eu/assets/1111/Background_paper_on_Indicators_and_accounts_in_the_7th_EAP.pdf, "Improving Measurement to Manage Through the 7th EAP: The Role of Indicators and Accounting"], "Institute for European Environmental Policy", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Eurostat is also constructing environmental accounts expressed in physical and monetary terms, and asset accounts, as a step towards developing a regional SEEA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/environmental_accounts/introduction, "What do environmental accounts measure?"], "Eurostat", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of inclusive wealth indicators is also a recognized priority of the EU. The proposed 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) of the EC explicitly identifies this issue, by calling for further development and integration of economic and environmental indicators. The Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) proposes to streamline the collection of data required for designing environmental indicators.&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt; The EU also committed to the Aichi Accord at the CBD COP-10, in which Parties agree to integrate biodiversity into their national accounts.&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt; This is on top of the experimental ecosystem accounting framework that was launched in 2009. The European Environment Agency (EEA) proposed that given the compatibility of the design with the SNA, it would be possible to use one particular indicator, Consumption of Ecosystem Capital (CEC) to adjust National Accounts aggregates to create, in particular, CEC Adjusted Net Domestic Product and CEC Adjusted Net National Income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/an-experimental-framework-for-ecosystem, "An experimental framework for ecosystem capital accounting in Europe"], "European Environment Agency", 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC Communication Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe sets 2020 as the year by which businesses, along with public authorities, will properly account for natural capital and ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/resource_efficiency/pdf/com2011_571.pdf, "Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe"], "European Commission", 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===

The French Ministry of Sustainable Development produces satellite, environmental-economic accounts each year.&lt;ref name="France"&gt;Frédéric Nauroy, [http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/sites/waves/files/documents/Second%20Partnership%20Meeting/France_WAVES_Presentation.pdf, " France's Commitment to Environmental Accounting"], "Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, Housing and Transport", 22 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is planning on fully expanding the accounts to correspond with the SEEA (2012).&lt;ref name="France" /&gt; The National Institute of Statistics and Economics also includes estimates of land, subsoil assets, and non-cultivated bio and water resources in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the French balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

From 2008 to 2010, an exploratory study on ecosystem valuation was carried out.&lt;ref name="France" /&gt; In accordance with the adoption of the Aichi Accord at the CBD COP-10, the French National Biodiversity Strategy Target 7 was set to "include preservation of biodiversity in economic decisions."&lt;ref name="France" /&gt; The Ministry of Sustainable Development is presently consulting with stakeholders and refining methodological options in order to begin assembling physical ecosystem assessments.&lt;ref name="France" /&gt; Annual expert workshops on monetary valuation and economic instruments are also organized by the Ministry.&lt;ref name="France" /&gt;

===Germany===

The German Environmental Economic Accounts (GEEA) follow the SEEA framework. The data from these accounts, along with the German Socio-economic Accounts, is used to calculate an indicator set, as outlined in the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (2002).&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;Karl Schoer, [https://www.destatis.de/EN/Publications/Specialized/EnvironmentalEconomicAccounting/Policyuse.pdf?__blob=publicationFile, "Policy use of Environmental-Economic Accounting in Germany"], "Federal Statistical Office Germany", 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While no adjusted macroeconomic aggregates are estimated in the GEEA, two of the GEEA indicators are embedded into the National Accounts: productivity of energy and raw materials, and transport intensity and share of the railways in providing transport.&lt;ref name="Germany" /&gt;

===India===

An Expert Group, led by IHDP Scientific Committee chairman Professor Partha Dasgupta, is in the process of developing a system to "green" India's national accounts.&lt;ref name="India1"&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/ihdp-scientific-committee-chair-sir-partha-dasgupta-to-lead, "IHDP Scientific Committee chair Sir Partha Dasgupta to lead India's Green National Accounts Committee"], "International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change", 12 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It plans to adjust GDP to account for environmental costs and impacts by 2015.&lt;ref name="India1" /&gt; Some of the issues the Group will address include establishing coordination mechanisms within the country and with international partners, and standardizing data collection and valuation methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Suresh Kumar, [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/londongroup/meeting18/LG18_p27_Green%20National%20Accounts%20for%20India%20-%20The%20State%20of%20Progress.pdf, "Green National Accounts for India"], "UN Statistics", 2–4 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Accounting for Indian States Project (GAISP) was the first initiative of the Green Indian States Trust (GIST), an NGO started in 2004.&lt;ref name="GAISP"&gt;[http://www.gistindia.org/, "Green Accounting for Indian States Project"], "Green Indian States Trust", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Project used data from Indian national databases to measure sustainable development and create green accounts at the state-level that were consistent with SEEA-2003 guidelines.&lt;ref name="GAISP" /&gt; Following this, GIST calculated a Green GDP total which adjusted the traditional indicator for "all major externalities."&lt;ref name="GAISP" /&gt;

The South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE) and the Indian Society for Ecological Economics operate in India, although SANDEE is based in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandeeonline.org/about_us.php, "About Us"], "South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Both are networks that conduct research on and analyses of environmental accounting, which is instructive for teachers, researchers and members of the policy community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoinsee.org/], "Indian Society for Ecological Economics", 8 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===

Members of the World Resources Institute, led by David Repetto, integrated environmental effects into Indonesia's national accounts in 1990.&lt;ref name="Asafu"&gt;John Asafu-Adjaye, [http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf, "Green National Accounting and the Measurement of Genuine (Extended) Saving"], "United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He subtracted net natural resource depreciation for the petroleum, timber, and soils sectors from GDP to estimate the environmentally-adjusted NDP.&lt;ref name="Asafu" /&gt; They found that estimates of net income and growth of net income were overstated when calculated using the conventional accounts.&lt;ref name="Joy" /&gt;

In 1997, the United Nations University-Institute of Advanced Studies (UNU-IAS) measured the environmental impacts of industrialization and trade in Indonesia (along with China and Japan).&lt;ref name="UNUIAS"&gt;[http://www.ias.unu.edu/sub_page.aspx?catID=97&amp;ddlID=360, "Green GDP Estimates in China, Indonesia, and Japan: An Application of the UN Environmental and Economic Accounting System"], "United Nations University – Institute of Advanced Studies", 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, the UNU-IAS constructed an international environmental input-output model for the Asia Pacific region, and from this, was able to compile a preliminary SEEA and Green GDP approximation.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt; In 1990, environmental costs were equal to 4.9% of NDP for Indonesia. In particular, changes in land use and oil exploitation were major costs.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt;

Since 2002, Statistics Indonesia (BPS) has produced several Indicators of Sustainable Development reports, based on the 134 UN Commission on Sustainable Development Indicators developed by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. BPS also regularly generates environmental statistics and statistics of marine and coastal resources.

===Italy===

The National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) currently constructs three types of environmental accounting modules: material flows (MFA), the environmental account matrix integrated with national economic account (NAMEA), and the expenditure estimate for environmental protection (SERIEE-EPEA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/italy/Italian%20NSDS.pdf, "Environmental Action Strategy for Sustainable Development in Italy"], "Ministry for the Environment and Territory", 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Silvia Teizzi at the University of Sienna applied a method of monetary valuation to externalities arising from agricultural production in Italy.&lt;ref name="Silvia"&gt;Silvia Teizzi, [http://econpapers.repec.org/article/kapenreec/v_3a13_3ay_3a1999_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a459-472.htm, "External Effects of Agricultural Production in Italy and Environmental Accounting"], "Environmental and Resource Economics, 13: 4", 1999&lt;/ref&gt; She separately estimated a shadow price and a quantity for the externalities and calculated their values between for each year between 1961 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Silvia" /&gt; She subtracted these figures from the value added of the agricultural sector "as a first step towards the correction of national accounting aggregates to take environmental degradation into account."&lt;ref name="Silvia" /&gt;

In their case study on Trento, Italy, Professors Andrea Francesconi and Paolo Penasa analyze the accounting schemes for environmental expenditures developed by local governments in Italy.&lt;ref name="Andrea"&gt;Andrea Francesconi and Paola Penasa, [http://sydney.edu.au/business/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/56601/Environmental_Accounting_for_Local_Govt.pdf, "Environmental accounting for Local Government. The experience of the Municipality of Trento, Italy"], University of Sydney"&lt;/ref&gt; Under the local Agenda 21 process, the City and Local Environmental Accounting and Reporting (CLEAR) project and the CONTAROMA project were undertaken by Italian municipalities.&lt;ref name="Andrea" /&gt; The CLEAR project was started in 2001 to pair the financial statements of municipalities with an environmental report.&lt;ref name="Andrea" /&gt; The CLEAR method reclassified the aforementioned financial statements such that expenditures for environmental purposes could be identified, and compiled into separate monetary accounts.&lt;ref name="Andrea" /&gt; Similarly, the CONTAROMA project developed an environmental accounting system for the municipal budget of Rome.&lt;ref name="Andrea" /&gt;

===Japan===

In 1995, the Japanese Economic Planning Agency made initial estimates of the SEEA and Green GDP from 1985 to 1990.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt; In 1998, they extended their estimates from 1970 to 1995.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt; According to these calculations, environmental costs in Japan fell from 8% of NDP in 1970 to nearly 1% in 1995.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt;

The E-10 are the official economic-environmental accounts produced by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref name="Japan"&gt;[http://www.env.go.jp/en/statistics/contents/pdfdata/201203_e.pdf, "Towards development of the Input-Output Tables for Environmental Analysis"], "Ministry of the Environment", March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They are based on data compiled by 10 government ministries, and describe the environmental burden of particular natural resources in physical units.&lt;ref name="Japan" /&gt; There are three tables which make up the E-10: a Basic Transaction Table; resource and environmental burden tables; and supplementary tables.&lt;ref name="Japan" /&gt;

The Statistics Bureau of Japan currently includes estimates of land in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the Japanese balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Republic of Korea===

In 2001, the Korean Ministry of the Environment planned to introduce an environmentally-adjusted GDP indicator.&lt;ref name="Korea1"&gt;[http://eng.me.go.kr/content.do?method=moveContent&amp;menuCode=pol_pol_com_intergrated, "Integrated Index of Environment and Economy"], "Ministry of Environment"&lt;/ref&gt; It began developing a SEEA (KORSEEA) in 2002, and the development of Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts, and NAMEA took place in the following years.&lt;ref name="Korea1" /&gt; Several government institutions and departments provide economic and environmental data required for the KORSEEA. Statistics Korea also includes estimates of land, subsoil assets, and non-cultivated bio and water resources in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the Koreah balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The Korea Rural Economic Institute calculated the Green GDP of the Korean agricultural sector in the period 1980 to 1997 using pilot economic-environmental accounts.&lt;ref name="Korea2"&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/stat/envstat/stwes-24.pdf, "Pilot Compilation of Environmental-Economic Accounts in Korean Agricultural Sector"], "Korea Rural Economic Institute", 8–19 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental adjustment in this study is limited to the subtraction of "degradation costs of natural resources" from NDP.&lt;ref name="Korea2" /&gt; They report that the ratio of environmentally adjusted domestic product to NDP decreases from 100.6% to 99.5% in the agricultural sector during the specified period.&lt;ref name="Korea2" /&gt;

===Mexico===

In 1985, the UN, World Bank and Mexican government executed a joint pilot project using 1985 data to produce two environmentally-adjusted indicators: resource depletion subtracted from NDP and environmental degradation subtracted from NDP.&lt;ref name="Mexico"&gt;Raúl Figueroa Díaz et al., [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/green_economy/korea/presentations/Grreen%20Growth.pdf, "Economic and Environmental Accounting and Green Growth"], "National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico", July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican System of Economic and Ecological Accounts (MSEEA) was started in 1988, and has been published annually since 1991.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; The National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico (INEGI) have used the accounts to derive key information about environmental sustainability in the country. Yearly environmental costs are equal to 8.5% of GDP. Since 2003, the INEGI has calculated a yearly Green GDP aggregate.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; Between 2003 and 2009, the ratio of Green GDP to GDP increased from 90.4% to 92.1%.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; The INEGI reports that while the scope of action should be increased, this trend reflects the successful efforts of the government to reduce impacts that negatively affect the environment.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt;

===Russia===

The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) currently includes estimates of land and non-cultivated bio and water resources in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the Russian balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rosstat has outlined a series of priorities for developing a Russian SEEA. Its highest priority is asset accounts, and with respect to the environment, a particular record of environmental protection expenditures.&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;[unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/ceea/meetings/UNCEEA-7-7-4.ppt, "Development of Environmental Accounts in Russia: Plans and Experience"], "Federal State Statistics Service, Russian Federation", 11–13 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After 2015, the basis for integration will appear with the creation of input-output tables.&lt;ref name="Russia" /&gt; Physical flow accounts are a medium priority; further development will depend on the completion of the input-output tables and whether new surveys are introduced on time.&lt;ref name="Russia" /&gt; While accounts for extended SNA aggregates, such as the depletion or degradation of natural capital are being given conceptual consideration, they are the lowest priority of Rosstat.&lt;ref name="Russia" /&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===

Saudi Arabia has not undertaken any relevant initiatives.

===South Africa===

The environmental-economic accounts are developed in the National Accounts Division of Statistics South Africa (SA). Information for the accounts is sourced from various government departments, surveys and geographic and spatial data.&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;Riaan Grobler, [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/green_economy/korea/presentations/Stats%20SA%20Position%20on%20environmental%20statistics.PDF, "Statistics South Africa's position on environmental statistics"], "Statistics South Africa", 6–8 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 report to the United Nations, environmental statistics are not a mainstream priority for the country, and Statistics SA does not have adequate resources to collect environmental data.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; Additionally, a "lengthy institutionalization process" has prevented the publication of any official reports.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt;

===Turkey===

The Turkish Statistical Institute produces a range of environmental statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreTablo.do?alt_id=10, "Environment and Energy"], "Turkish Statistical Institute", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===

In 1992, the Bureau of Economic Analysis within the Department of Commerce began intensively developing environmental accounting methodologies.&lt;ref name="NN"&gt;William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg, [http://training.fws.gov/bart/Resources/nrdar/injury_quantification/Natures's_Numbers.pdf, "Natures Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment"], "National Academy Press", 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However, Congress directed the Department to suspend all activities in this area in 1994, after the first U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic Satellite Accounts were published.&lt;ref name="NN" /&gt; It also ordered an external review of environmental accounting. This review, Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment was concluded in 1999.&lt;ref name="NN" /&gt;

William Nordhaus (Nature's Numbers), along with Nicholas Muller and Robert Mendelsohn, co-authored a study on integrating environmental externalities into a SNA. Their model estimates gross damages from air pollution in each industry in the United States. It estimates that damages from activities such as combustion of waste, sewage treatment and firing power plants by oil or coal are larger than their value added.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;Nicholas Muller et al., [www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.5.1649, " Environmental Accounting for Pollution in the United States Economy"], "American Economic Review", August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The largest externalities, for which damages range from 0.8 to 5.6 times value added, arise from coal-fired electric generation.&lt;ref name="US" /&gt;

In [[software development]], '''obfuscation''' is the deliberate act of creating [[source code|source]] or [[machine code]] that is difficult for humans to understand. Like [[obfuscation]] in [[natural language]], it may use needlessly roundabout expressions to compose statements.
Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to conceal its purpose ([[security through obscurity]]) or its logic or implicit values embedded in it, primarily, in order to prevent tampering, deter [[reverse engineering]], or even as a [[puzzle]] or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code. This can be done manually or by using an automated tool, the latter being the preferred technique in industry.

==Overview==
The architecture and characteristics of some languages may make them easier to obfuscate than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Binstock |first=Andrew |url=http://www.devx.com/microsoftISV/Article/11351 |title=Obfuscation: Cloaking your Code from Prying Eyes |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-03-06 |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420165109/http://www.devx.com/microsoftISV/Article/11351 |archivedate=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atwood |first=Jeff |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000291.html |title=Jeff Atwood, May 15, 2005 |publisher=Codinghorror.com |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C (programming language)|C]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenter.demon.nl/obfuscate.html |title=Obfuscation |publisher=Kenter.demon.nl |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C++]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=38102 |title=C++ Tutorials - Obfuscated Code - A Simple Introduction |publisher=DreamInCode.net |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/rcorcs/posts/obfuscatedcode |title=C Tutorials - Obfuscated Code in C |publisher=Sites.google.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Perl]] [[programming language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=As of 2013-11-25 18:22 GMT |url=http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=291267 |title=Pe(a)rls in line noise |publisher=Perlmonks.org |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are some examples of languages easy to obfuscate.

==Recreational obfuscation==

Writing and reading obfuscated source code can be a [[brain teaser]]. A number of programming contests reward the most creatively obfuscated code, such as the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] and the [[Obfuscated Perl Contest]].

Types of obfuscations include simple keyword substitution, use or non-use of whitespace to create artistic effects, and self-generating or heavily compressed programs.

According to [[Nick Montfort]], techniques may include: 
# naming obfuscation, which includes naming variables in a meaningless or deceptive way; 
# data/code/comment confusion, which includes making some actual code look like comments or confusing syntax with data; 
# double coding, which can be displaying code in poetry form or interesting shapes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Montfort |first=Nick |url=http://obfuscationsymposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Montfort__Obfuscated_Code.pdf |title=Obfuscated code |accessdate=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short obfuscated [[Perl]] programs may be used in [[Signature block|signatures]] of Perl programmers.  These are JAPHs ("[[Just another Perl hacker]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rochester.pm.org/talks/japh_discussion.txt |title=JAPH - Just Another Perl Hacker |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=pm.org |publisher=Perl Mongers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516074850/http://rochester.pm.org/talks/japh_discussion.txt |archive-date=16 May 2013 |access-date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of obfuscation==
There are several advantages of automated code obfuscation that have made it popular and widely useful across many platforms. On some platforms (such as Java.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5765412-decompiling-java|title="Decompiling Java" by Godfrey Nolan|publisher=Apress;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14975259-decompiling-android|title="Decompiling Android" by Godfrey Nolan|publisher=Apress;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and .NET) a [[decompiler]] can reverse-engineer source code from an executable or library. 
A main advantage of automated code obfuscation is that it helps protect the trade secrets (intellectual property) contained within software by making reverse-engineering a program difficult and economically unfeasible. Other advantages might include helping to protect licensing mechanisms and unauthorized access, and shrinking the size of the executable. Decompilation is sometimes called a man-at-the-end attack, based on the traditional cryptographic attack known as "[[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]]".

==Disadvantages of obfuscation==
While obfuscation can make reading, writing, and reverse-engineering a program difficult and time-consuming, it will not necessarily make it impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ias.edu/~boaz/Papers/obf_informal.html |title="Can We Obfuscate Programs?" by Boaz Barak |publisher=Math.ias.edu |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anti-virus software, such as [[AVG AntiVirus]],{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} will also alert their users when they land on a site with code that is manually obfuscated, as one of the purposes of obfuscation can be to hide malicious code. However, some developers may employ code obfuscation for the purpose of reducing file size or increasing security. The average user may not expect their antivirus software to provide alerts about an otherwise harmless piece of code, especially from trusted corporations, so such a feature may actually deter users from using legitimate software.

==Obfuscating software==
A variety of tools exist to perform or assist with code obfuscation.
These include experimental research tools created by academics, hobbyist tools,
commercial products written by professionals, and [[open-source software]].
There also exist deobfuscation tools that attempt to perform the reverse
transformation.

Although the majority of commercial obfuscation solutions work by transforming
either program source
code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/JavaScript/Tools/Obfuscators/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Languages: JavaScript: Tools: Obfuscators |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2013-08-03 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/PHP/Development_Tools/Obfuscation_and_Encryption/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Languages: PHP: Development Tools: Obfuscation and Encryption |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or platform-independent bytecode as used by
Java&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/Java/Development_Tools/Obfuscators/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Languages: Java: Development Tools: Obfuscators |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
.NET,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Component_Frameworks/NET/Tools/Obfuscators/ |title=Open Directory - Computers: Programming: Component Frameworks: .NET: Tools: Obfuscators |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=2007-01-02 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are also some that work directly on compiled binaries.

==Obfuscation and copyleft licenses==

There has been debate on whether it is illegal to skirt [[copyleft]] software licenses by releasing source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The issue is addressed in the [[GNU General Public License]] by defining source code as the "preferred" version of the source code be made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/431651/ |title=Reasoning behind the "preferred form of the work for making modifications to it" language in the GPL |publisher=Lwn.net |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNU website states "Obfuscated 'source code' is not real source code and does not count as source code." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |title=What is free software? |publisher=gnu.net |accessdate=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open architecture''' is a type of [[computer architecture]] or [[software architecture]] intended to make adding, upgrading, and swapping components easy.&lt;ref name="II2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clifton A.

Miller |date=August 8, 2011|work=[[pcmag.com]] |quote=''"In some ways, the most far-reaching decision made by the team that built the IBM PC was to use an open architecture, rather than one that was proprietary to IBM. That decision led to the market for add-in boards, for large numbers of third party applications, and eventually to a large number of competitors all creating "IBM-compatible" machines. [[William C. Lowe|Bill Lowe]] went to IBM's Corporate Management Committee in July 1980 to propose the project"''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amiga 500]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/history-of-computers,4518-31.html Computer History: From The Antikythera Mechanism To The Modern Era] on [[tomshardware.com]] by Aris Mpitziopoulos "''Amiga was one of the first computers with an open architecture. It had two expansion slots, one on the side and one on the bottom.''" (July 3, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apple IIe]] have an open architecture supporting plug-in cards, whereas the [[Apple IIc]] computer has a '''closed architecture'''. Open architecture systems may use a standardized [[system bus]] such as [[S-100 bus|S-100]], [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] or [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] or they may incorporate a proprietary bus standard such as that used on the [[Apple II]], with up to a dozen slots that allow multiple hardware manufacturers to produce add-ons, and for the user to freely install them. By contrast, closed architectures, if they are expandable at all, have one or two "expansion ports" using a proprietary connector design that may require a license fee from the manufacturer, or enhancements may only be installable by technicians with specialized tools or training.

[[Computer platform]]s may include systems with both open and closed architectures. The [[Mac mini]] and [[Compact Macintosh]] are closed; the [[Macintosh II]] and [[Power Macintosh G5]] are open. Most [[desktop PC]]s are open architecture, but [[nettop]]s are typically closed.

Similarly, an open software architecture is one in which additional software modules can be added to the basic framework provided by the architecture. Open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to major software products are the way in which the basic functionality of such products can be modified or extended.  The [[Google APIs]] are examples. A second type of open software architecture consists of the messages that can flow between computer systems. These messages have a standard structure that can be modified or extended per agreements between the computer systems. An example is IBM's [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]].

Open architecture allows potential users to see inside all or parts of the architecture without any proprietary constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zk2qCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP6&amp;lpg=PP6 |title=TRON Project 1987 Open-Architecture Computer Systems: Proceedings of the Third TRON Project Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, an open architecture publishes all or parts of its architecture that the developer or integrator wants to share. The [[open business]] processes involved with an open architecture may require some license agreements between entities sharing the architecture information. Open architectures have been successfully implemented in many diverse fields, including the [[US Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/spring08/HowAndWhy.html|title=The HOW and WHY of OPEN ARCHITECTURE|work=[[navy.mil]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
PathVisio was created primarily at [[Maastricht University]] and [[Gladstone Institutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pathvisio.org/about/|accessdate=10 February 2014|title=About/Core development team}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software is developed in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and it's also used as part of the [[WikiPathways]] framework as an applet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pico|first=AR|author2=Kelder T |author3=van Iersel MP |author4=Hanspers K |author5=Conklin BR |title=WikiPathways: Pathway Editing for the People|date=22 July 2008|page=e184|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060184|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0060184|accessdate=19 September 2013|pmid=18651794|pmc=2475545|volume=6|issue=7|display-authors=etal |journal=PLoS Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting from version 3.0 (released in 2012) plugins are [[OSGi]] compliant and a [http://www.pathvisio.org/plugins/plugins-repo/ plugin directory], describing them, was developed.
In 2015 version 3.2 was released. This was the first signed version with a certificate issued by a certification authority. Many of the running issues introduced by java 1.7 and 1.8 with the new security rules were solved.
Since 2013 a javascript version (PVJS) is being developed to replace the applet. From 2015 it also allows small edits and in the future it will be a full editor.

PetroSkills was founded in 1963 and is based out of Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of PetroSkills LLC|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=31072180|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 PetroSkills began the [[PetroSkills Alliance]] by partnering with BP and Shell to involve large oil and gas companies directly into the design of course material, instructor review, and competency analysis.

In 2008 PetroSkills expanded their number of courses through the acquisition of PetrEX International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PetroSkills Snags New Drilling Training, Consulting Company|url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=65040|publisher=RigZone|date=2008-08-04|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 PetroSkills was acquired by BV Investment Partners. Previous owners, Ford Brett and Dennis Wing retained a minority ownership position during the acquisition. BV partner Justin Harrison was quoted as saying, "We share management's view that long-term demand drivers for oil and gas resources, the increasing technological complexity of finding and extracting oil and gas, and a demographic shift in the industry's workforce composition will drive a growing and sustainable need for quality technical training and competency-based solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marino |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/bv-investment-partners-petroskills-211433-1.html |title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions |publisher=Themiddlemarket.com |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Also in 2010 PetroSkills partnered with the [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]] and began providing training to operations and maintenance technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petrocomputing.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/petroskills-announces-new-om-jv/ |title=PetroSkills Announces New O&amp;M JV " PetroComputing |publisher=Petrocomputing.wordpress.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership was a "response to the bigger crew change that will be occurring across operator ranks over the next decade. The demographic changes impacting the engineering ranks within E&amp;P represent a small percentage of the numbers that will be impacted in the operations and maintenance ranks.” With the introduction of PetroSkills O&amp;M, a specific focus was placed on both operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) technicians employed in upstream, midstream and downstream roles, PetroSkills O&amp;M offers companies training through both instructor-led training and e-learning content.

In 2011 PetroSkills opened its own 325,000 square foot Conference Center on January 14.  The center is located in Katy, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katyconfidential.com/2011/08/petroskills/ |title=PetroSkills Conference Center |publisher=Katy Confidential |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011 PetroSkills launched PetroCore, a browser-based application offering technical professionals in the oil and gas industry anytime, online access to PetroSkills course materials and other technical knowledge resources.

In 2012 PetroSkills opened a training facility in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3496/news/read/647737/1.html |title=Minister of Energy Opens Regional Office for PetroSkills |publisher=Al Wasat News |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2012, PetroSkills announced that it acquired John M. Campbell &amp; Co., a training provider that's focus was heavily on the facilities side of the Oil and Gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/122508/PetroSkills_Acquires_Training_Consulting_Businesses |title=PetroSkills Acquires Training, Consulting Businesses |publisher=RigZone |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TGSEATAGMOD.jpg|thumb|Thomas Gray, CLS America, is holding a SeaTag-MOD pop-up satellite tag which is ready for deployment on a whale shark (Isla Mujeres, MX).]]

'''Pop-up satellite archival tags''' ('''PSATs''') that use the [[Argos system]] which is managed by CLS in Toulouse, France or CLS America in Lanham, Maryland (US) are used to track movements of (usually large, migratory) [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] animals. A PSAT (also commonly referred to as a PAT tag) is an archival tag (or [[data logger]]) that is equipped with a means to transmit the collected data via the Argos satellite system.  Though the data are physically stored on the tag, its major advantage is that it does not have to be physically retrieved like an archival tag for the [[data]] to be available making it a viable, fishery independent tool for animal behavior and migration studies.  They have been used to track movements of [[ocean sunfish]],&lt;ref name="TrackingSunfish"&gt;{{Cite web

Location, depth, temperature, oxygen levels, and body movement data are used to answer questions about migratory patterns, seasonal feeding movements, daily habits, and survival after catch and release, for examples.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples include: Block, B, Dewar, H, Farwell, C, Prince, ED. A new satellite technology for tracking the movements of Atlantic bluefin tuna. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 95, pp. 9384–9389, August 1998; Hoolihan, John P. Horizontal and vertical movements of sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) in the Persian Gulf, determined by ultrasonic and pop-up satellite tagging. Marine Biology (2005) 146: 1015–1029 DOI 10.1007/s00227-004-1488-2;Stokesbury, MJW, Harvey-Clark, C, Gallant, J, Block, BA, Myres, RA. Movement and environmental preferences of Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) electronically tagged in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada. Marine Biology (2005) 148: 159–165 DOI 10.1007/s00227-005-0061-y&lt;/ref&gt;

A satellite tag is generally constructed of several components: a data-logging section, a release section, a float, and an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]].  The release sections include an energetically popped off release section or a corrosive pin that is actively corroded on a preset date or after a specified period of time.  Some limitations of using satellite tags are their depth limitations (2000m), their costs ($499–$4000+), their vulnerability to loss by environmental issues (biofouling), or premature release through ingestion by a [[predator]].

There are two methods of underwater geolocation that PSATs employ.  The first method is through light based geolocation which uses the length of the day and a noon time calculation to estimate the tags location while underwater.  This method has a functional depth limitation of light penetration which can be as shallow as a few meters to upwards of hundreds of meters.  Geolocation estimates based on light are usually coupled with additional satellite data like sea surface temperature or other available data input such as bathymetry, land avoidance, and physical limitations of the tagged animal.  The other method available is through measuring ambient light and the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. This method has a functional depth limitation equivalent of the maximum depth limitation, generally 1800m.  Magnetic based geolocation is generally not coupled with additional satellite data or other inputs, and relies on the Earth magnetic field for latitude estimations and light (noon time) for longitude estimations.

==General information==
[[File:Thunnus orientalis (Osaka Kaiyukan Aquarium).jpg|thumb|left|225px|PSATs are usually used on large marine animals and have been used in several studies of the bluefin tuna.]]
[[File:Spawning-Behaviour-and-Post-Spawning-Migration-Patterns-of-Atlantic-Bluefin-Tuna-(Thunnus-thynnus)-pone.0076445.s001.ogv|thumb|Deployment of a PSAT on a bluefin tuna.]]

Pop-up satellite tags range in length from about {{convert|125|-|215|mm|abbr=on}} and weigh 36-108 grams in air. A tag must be small compared to the size of the animal, anywhere from 3-5% of the total fish weight, so that it does not interfere with normal behavior. 

These tags record information such as temperature, magnetics, acceleration, light level, oxygen levels and pressure at set intervals of a few seconds to several hours.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Ba, Dewar, H, Farwell, C, Prince, ED. A new satellite technology for tracking the movements of Atlantic bluefin tuna. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 95, pp. 9384–9389, August 1998; Nielson, A, Bigelow, KA, Musyl, MK, Sibert, JR. Improving light-based geolocation by including sea surface temperature. Fish. Oceanogr. 15:4, 314–325, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Data are often collected for several weeks or months, but with new advances in memory technology [[microSD cards]] tags can store data for centuries. PSATs record data in [[non-volatile memory]] so that data are retained even if the power source fails.

When the PSAT releases from the animal on which it was attached, it floats to the surface, and begins to transmit data to the Argos satellites at a frequency of 401.65&amp;nbsp;MHz +/-. Therefore, the tag does not have to be physically recovered for the data to be obtained. Summarized data illustrating where the fish's migration started and ended is usually recovered from the tag within about seven days; however, tags can transmit significant amounts of oceanic data for months after they release from the fish.

Limitations of PSAT technology are that it is subject to loss by malfunction of the power source, environmental effects such as biofouling, ingestion by a [[predator]], its depth limitation and cost. Most PSATS have internal [[software]] designed to detect damaging or sub-optimal conditions that will trigger an early release and transmission of data. For example, PSATs can withstand pressures to depths of {{convert|2000|to|2500|m|ft}} depending on the model. If data indicate no change in pressure (depth) for a period of time, this could trigger an early release due to premature release (a tag pulling out of the fish early) or death of the animal to which it was attached. Such internal checks can alert researchers to unexpected or undesirable events. Ingestion by a predator is more difficult to detect in the sense of forcing a tag to report; however, in data processing it is indicated by an immediate loss of light and an increase in temperature that stabilizes while it is inside the predator.&lt;ref&gt;Kerstetter, DW, Polovina, JJ, Graves JE. Evidence of shark predation and scavenging on fishes equipped with pop-up satellite archival tags. Fish. Bull. 102:750–756 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Using light level===
The most popular method of determining an animal's location underwater requires the tag to acquire light levels throughout the day. Observing the length of the day, from when the tag observed the first light until the last light, the tag can determine its latitudinal location (with accuracy exceeding 1 degree). From the length of day the tag computes the noon time which is converted to a longitude location (with accuracy averaging about 0.5 degree or 30–50 nautical miles). This method of geolocation is suitable for animals that inhabit clear waters near the surface. At depths or in turbid waters, light based geolocation does not work as well due to light attenuation. It also does not work well during the equinoxes when the length of day is globally uniform. Manufacturers of this technology include Wildlife Computers, Microwave Telemetry, and Lotek Wireless. Star-Oddi is in the development phase of a pop-up satellite tag as well.

===Using Earth’s magnetic field and light level===
Another approach to geolocation couples light and magnetics. This method measures the total Earth's [[magnetic fields|magnetic field]] for latitude estimations while using light based noon time detection for longitude. These tags measure the Earth's magnetic field on their built-in magnetometers throughout the day and then take the average value as the tag's daily location. Average accuracy of this method is approximately 35 nautical miles. Manufacturers of this technology include Desert Star Systems.

The '''Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation (PPNF)''' is a U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[501(c)(3)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] established "to teach the public and professionals about foods, lifestyle habits, healing modalities, and environmental practices that can help people attain vibrant health."&lt;ref&gt;https://price-pottenger.org/about/ppnfs-mission&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1952, it was first known as the '''Santa Barbara Medical Research Foundation''' and later renamed the '''Weston A. Price Memorial Foundation''', in 1965, after the 20th century researcher [[Weston Price]] who emphasized the importance of nutrition for health and dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://price-pottenger.org/about-us|title=About Us|date=2015-10-13|work=Price Pottenger|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other half of the foundation's current namesake is [[Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.]] whose [[Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.#Pottenger's cats|study of nutrition in cats]] sparked interest in a diet high in raw animal products including uncooked meats and unpasteurized dairy.  In 1969, after Price's death, the organization became the ''Price Pottenger Foundation'', and then the ''Price Pottenger Nutrition Foundation'', which it bears today.

PPNF primarily advocates: 1) that consumption of animal fats is not dangerous to human health, and 2) that mainstream agricultural methods which emphasize the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides as well as factory farming and significant processing of whole foods, reduces overall nutritional quality of food and human health.  The first set of claims go against the mainstream scientific consensus among researchers, doctors, and nutritionists, that a diet high in saturated fat presents serious risks to cardiovascular health and longevity.  The second set of claims is aligned with the increasingly popular [[organic food]] movement, although major food growers and producers consistently affirm the taste and nutritional quality of their food as identical or better than organics.

PPNF now houses over 10,000 books and publications, including the works of Dr. Royal Lee, Dr. Melvin Page, Dr. Emanuel Cheraskin, Dr. William Albrecht, and others.  The foundation today owns and protects the original copyrighted material of Weston A. Price, DDS, and Francis M. Pottenger, Jr., MD. They continue to republish Price's ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'', and Pottenger's ''Pottenger's Cats – A Study in Nutrition''.

==Origin==

===Weston Price===
{{Main|Weston Price}}
Price was a [[dentist]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio]], whose 1939 book, ''Nutritional and Physical Degeneration'',&lt;ref name=N&amp;PD&gt;Weston A. Price, DDS, ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'', 8th ed. (2008), {{ISBN|0-916764-20-6}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-916764-20-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the fieldwork he did in the 1920s and 1930s &lt;!-- specific dates? --&gt; among various world cultures, with the original goal of recording and studying the [[oral hygiene|dental health]] and development of pre-industrial populations including tribal Africans and Pacific islanders, Inuit, North and South American natives, and Australian aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DshCwAAQBAJ|title=100 Million Years of Food: What Our Ancestors Ate and Why It Matters Today|last=Le|first=Stephen|date=2016-02-02|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9781250050410|location=|pages=181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains numerous photographs of the people he studied, and includes comparison photographs of the teeth and facial structure of people who lived on their traditional diet and people who had adopted or grown up on industrialized food. In certain instances it was possible for Price to examine and photograph traditional and industrialized eaters from the same family.&lt;ref name="N&amp;PD" /&gt;

===Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.===
{{Main|Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.}}
Pottenger was a doctor whose 1932-1942 ''Pottenger Cat Study'' addressed the nutritive value of heat-labile elements — nutrients destroyed by heat and available only in raw foods. Pottenger used donated laboratory cats to test the potency of the adrenal extract [[hormone]]s he was making. The adrenal glands of these cats were removed for the experiments and Pottenger noted that most of the cats died during or following the operation.  He was feeding the cats a supposedly nutritive diet consisting of raw milk, cod liver oil and cooked meat scraps of liver, tripe, sweetbread, brains, heart and muscle. When the number of donated cats exceeded the supply of food available, Pottenger began ordering raw meat scraps from a local meat packing plant, including organs, meat, and bone; and fed a separate group of cats from this supply.  Within months this separate group appeared in better health than the cooked meat group. Pottenger conducted subsequent studies involving approximately 900 cats over a period of ten years, with three generations of cats studied.  His experiments showed that cats were healthiest after being fed raw meat and raw dairy.

==Key individuals==

===Joseph and Pat Connolly===
Marion Patricia ("Pat") Connolly was the curator for PPNF, overseeing the archiving and promotion of the organization's materials.  Pat studied health and nutrition for over 66 years and lectured on a variety of nutritional subjects.  According to the PPNF, she was the foremost authority on the work of Price and Pottenger.  In 1962 Pat took a course on nutrition by Alfreda Rooke, then Curator of PPNF, who had studied under Price.  In 1972, she became a PPNF Nutrition Instructor and began teaching Rooke's course.   Pat Connolly taught classes educating people on Price's research and its applications.   She authored several books, including ''Dietotherapy (The Kelley Research Foundation)'', ''Mini Guide To Living Foods'', ''The Guide to Living Foods (PPNF)'', ''Food Alive (Livingston-Wheeler Medical Clinic)'', ''A Modern Approach to the Primitive Diet (Nero)'', and ''The Candida-Albicans Yeast-Free Cookbook (McGraw Hill)''.  She was also listed as a co-author of the first edition of [[Nourishing Traditions]].  She died in November 2010. 
&lt;ref name="ppnf.org2"&gt;http://ppnf.org/about/living-memorial/marion-patricia-connolly&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband Joseph Connolly practiced dentistry in San Diego for 40 years and helped found PPNF.   He died in 1996.

===George Meinig===
In 1994 George E. Meinig published ''Root Canal Cover-up Exposed'' which resurrected Price's old studies.&lt;ref name=Baumgartner2&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Baumgartner JC, Bakland LK, Sugita EI | year = 2002 | title = Endodontics, Chapter 3: Microbiology of endodontics and asepsis in endodontic practice | url = http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/Dr.Hanan/BooksIngle/ch03.pdf |format=PDF| publisher  = Hamilton, Ontario: BC Becker | pages = 63–94 | accessdate = 2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the book, Hasselgren in New York Academy of Dentistry's ''Annals of dentistry'' stated "[t]he focal infection theory, supported by many including Dr. Price, has been attacked, debated, accepted, criticized, agreed upon, etc. but it has not been covered up." Hasselgren noted that Meinig would sometime confuse the meanings of "infection" and "inflammation" and based all his work on Price's 1923 ''Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic'' book.&lt;ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42"&gt;Hasselgren, Gunnar (1994) Annals of dentistry: Volumes 53-54 ''New York Academy of Dentistry'' pg 42)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hasselgren observed: "Many clinicians appear today to have lost sight of the fact that endodontical treatment shall be based on biology and not on the use of various gadgets to sweep canals. Also, one-visit treatment of necrotic, infected teeth is being advocated and practiced even if no long-term study has been performed to investigate this kind of treatment.  The work of Dr. Weston Price is therefore still to a great extent valid and important and the role of infection can not be underestimated."&lt;ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42"/&gt; Meinig died in May 2008 at the age of 93.

==Publications and education==
The PPNF houses an archive of books related to Price and Pottenger's work as well as the works of authors in related fields.  The foundation publishes its own journal, the ''Journal of Health and Healing''.&lt;ref name=ppnf.org3&gt;http://ppnf.org/resources/journal-article-archives&lt;/ref&gt; They also sell a variety of books, DVD, and CDs, publish an online newsletter, and offer classes.

'''The Regional Research Institute (RRI)''' at [[West Virginia University]] is a university-wide [[regional science]] research center for graduate students and faculty members in the fields of economics, resource economics, geography, history and sociology. Professor William H. Miernyk, a regional economist trained at Harvard, came to West Virginia University and founded RRI and served as the 1st Director. Since its opening in 1965, the Regional Research Institute has helped scholars do research. For numerous individuals, both at West Virginia University and elsewhere, it has provided crucial encouragement, stimulation, and opportunities. Its programs involve faculty members, graduate students, and an extensive network of scholars in the United States and abroad.

== About ==
The Regional Research Institute conducts and promotes interdisciplinary research on the economic and social development of lagging regions. As a center of regional research excellence for more than four decades, the RRI has served as an international recognized center for the advancement of regional science-an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of geography, economics, and planning.

The orientation William H. Miernyk established is at the heart of the Institute today:
* The Regional Research Institute exists for scholarly research. Scholars define the research projects, and scholars evaluate the proposals and results. The overall objective is to increase knowledge through publication of journal articles and books.
* Graduate students are an integral part of the Institute.  As their educations progress, so do their roles on research projects.  They learn research skills, conduct and publish research, and present papers at conferences in the U.S. and worldwide.
* The scope of the Institute extends beyond the economic and social problems of Appalachia to similar regions elsewhere.  It incorporates an enduring focus on quantitative methods for studying regions and evaluating policy directions.
*The Institute encourages and nurtures international and multidisciplinary research.  It organizes conferences and seminars, initiates research activities, creates research opportunities abroad, and hosts visiting scholars.

For 50 years, the Regional Research Institute has helped scholars do research. For numerous individuals, both at West Virginia University and elsewhere, it has provided crucial encouragement, stimulation, and opportunities.  Its programs involve faculty members, graduate students, and an extensive network of scholars in the United States and abroad.

In [[cattle]], genetic expression of the scur gene is different from that of the dominant polled gene, in that the scur gene's expression depends on the sex of the animal. The scur gene is dominant in males and recessive in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allison|first=B.C.|title=Inheritance of Polledness, Horns and Scurs in Beef Cattle|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/an_sci/extension/animal/news/aug96/aug96-3.html|publisher=North Carolina State University|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27001">The '''Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study''' (SSMCIS) was the name of an American [[mathematics education]] program that stood for both the name of a curriculum and the name of the project that was responsible for developing curriculum materials. It is considered part of the second round of initiatives in the "[[New Math]]" movement of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  The program was led by Howard F. Fehr, a professor at [[Columbia University Teachers College]].

The program's signature goal was to create a unified treatment of mathematics and eliminate the traditional separate per-year studies of [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], and so forth, that was typical of American secondary schools.&lt;ref name="walmsley"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of the 'New Mathematics' Movement and Its Relationship with Current Mathematical Reform | first=Angela Lynn Evans | last=Walmsley | publisher=[[University Press of America]] | location=Lanham, Maryland | year= 2003 | isbn=0-7618-2511-8 | pages=30, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, the treatment unified those branches by studying fundamental concepts such as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], and [[Mapping (mathematics)|mappings]], and fundamental structures such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[Field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s.  The SSMCIS program produced six courses' worth of class material, intended for grades 7 through 12, in textbooks called '''''Unified Modern Mathematics'''''.  Some 25,000&amp;nbsp;students took SSMCIS courses nationwide during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==Background==
The program was led by Howard F. Fehr, a professor at [[Columbia University Teachers College]] who was internationally known and had published numerous mathematics textbooks and hundreds of articles about mathematics teaching.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/07/obituaries/dr-howard-f-fehr-author-helped-start-system-of-new-math.html | title=Dr. Howard F. Fehr: Author Helped Start System of New Math | first=Walter H. | last=Waggoner | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 7, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1961 he had been the principal author of the 246-page report "New Thinking in School Mathematics", which held that [[traditional mathematics|traditional teaching of mathematics]] approaches did not meet the needs of the new technical society being entered into or of the current language of mathematicians and scientists.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"/&gt;  Fehr considered the separation of mathematical study into separate years of distinct subjects to be an American failing that followed an educational model two hundred years old.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The new curriculum was inspired by the seminar reports from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in the early 1960s&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt; and by the [[Cambridge Conference on School Mathematics]] (1963),  which also inspired the [[Comprehensive School Mathematics Program]].&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathcurriculumcenter.org/PDFS/CCM/summaries/cambridge_summary.pdf | title=Goals for School Mathematics | publisher=Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum | year=2004 | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were some interactions among these initiatives in the early stages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imacs.org/imacsadmin/parser?pageid=37 | title=Burt Kaufman | publisher=Institute for Mathematics &amp; Computer Science | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of SSMCIS was part of a general wave of cooperation in the mathematics education reform movement between Europe and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icmihistory.unito.it/portrait/steiner.php | title=The first century of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (1908–2008) – History of ICMI – Hans Georg Steiner | first=Gert | last=Schubring  | publisher=[[University of Turin]] | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum ==
{{Quote box|width=27%|align=right|quote="The construction is to be free of any restrictions of traditional content or sequence."|source=&lt;small&gt;—From the initial announcement of the curriculum work of the SSMCIS &lt;ref name="fehr-1966"&gt;{{cite journal | first=H. F. | last=Fehr | title=Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study | journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume=73 | issue=5 |date=May 1966 | page=533 | doi=10.2307/2315483| jstor=2315483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}}

Work on the SSMCIS program began in 1965&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt; and took place mainly at Teachers College.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Fehr was the director of the project from 1965 to 1973.&lt;ref name="nyt-fehr-obit"/&gt;  The principal consultants in the initial stages and subsequent yearly planning sessions were [[Marshall H. Stone]] of the [[University of Chicago]], [[Albert W. Tucker]] of [[Princeton University]], [[Edgar Lorch]] of [[Columbia University]], and Meyer Jordan of [[Brooklyn College]].&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Howard F. | last=Fehr | title=The Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study: A Unified Mathematics Program | journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume=67 | issue=1 |date=January 1974 | pages=25–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was targeted at the junior high and high school level and the 15–20&amp;nbsp;percent best students in a grade.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;

Funding for the initiative began with the U.S. [[Office of Education]] and covered the development first three courses produced; the last three courses produced, as well as teacher training, were funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and by Teachers College itself.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"/&gt; The scope and sequence of the curriculum was developed by eighteen mathematicians from the U.S. and Europe in 1966 and subsequently refined in experimental course material by mathematical educators with high school level teaching experience.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"&gt;{{cite journal | first=H. F. | last=Fehr | first2=James | last2=Fey | title=The Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study | journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume=76 | issue=10 |date=December 1969 | pages=1132–1137 | doi=10.2307/2317192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1971, some thirty-eight contributors to course materials were identified, eight from Teachers College, four from Europe, one from Canada, and the rest from various other universities (and a couple of high schools) in the United States.&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"/&gt;  Fehr did not do much curriculum development himself, but rather recruited and led the others and organized the whole process.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-79"&gt;Howson, Keitel, and Kilpatrick, ''Curriculum Development in Mathematics'', pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduate students from the Department of Mathematical Education at Teachers College also served each year in various capacities on the SSMCIS program.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;

The central idea of the program was to organize mathematics not by algebra, geometry, etc., but rather to unify those branches by studying the fundamental concepts of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], and [[Mapping (mathematics)|mappings]], and fundamental structures such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[Field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Other terms used for this approach included "global" or "integrated";&lt;ref name="lhs-cos"/&gt; Fehr himself spoke of a "spiral" or "helical" development, and wrote of "the spirit of global organization that is at the heart of the SSMCIS curriculum – important mathematical systems unified by a core of fundamental concepts and structures common to all.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;

For example, as the courses progressed, the concept of mappings were used to describe, and visually illustrate, the traditionally disparate topics of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|line reflection]], [[Probability space|probability of an event]], [[trigonometric functions]], [[isomorphism]] and [[complex number]]s, and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[Linear map|linear mappings]].&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;  Traditional subjects were broken up, such that the course material for each year included some material related to algebra, some to geometry, and so forth.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;&lt;!-- TODO ... more descr and examples --&gt;

Even when abstract concepts were being introduced, they were introduced in concrete, intuitive forms, especially at the younger levels.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Logical proofs were introduced early on and built in importance as the years developed.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  At least one year of university-level mathematics education was incorporated into the later courses.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;  Solving traditional applications problems was de-emphasized, especially in the earlier courses, but the intent of the project was to make up for that with its focus on real numbers in measurements, computer programming, and probability and statistics.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  In particular, the last of these was a pronounced element of SSMCIS, with substantial material on it present in all six courses, from measures of [[statistical dispersion]] to [[combinatorics]] to [[Bayes' theorem]] and more.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The curriculum that SSMCIS devised had influences from earlier reform work in Europe,&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt; going back to the [[Bourbaki group]]'s work in France in the 1930s and the ''Synopses for Modern Secondary School Mathematics'' published in Paris in 1961.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Indeed, most European secondary schools were teaching a more integrated approach.&lt;ref name="nys-integrated"/&gt;  Also, this was one of several American efforts to address a particularly controversial issue, the teaching of a full year of [[Euclidean geometry]] in secondary school.&lt;ref name="acmdl"&gt;{{cite conference | first=Joseph K. | last=McAdams | first2=Arlan R. |last2=DeKock | title=Computer graphics as an aid to teaching geometric transformations | conference=SIGCSE '76 Proceedings of the ACM SIGCSE-SIGCUE Technical Symposium on Computer Science and Education | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] | location=New York | &lt;!-- doi=10.1145/800107.803463 --&gt; | pages=137–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like many of the others, it did this by teaching [[Transformation geometry|geometric transformations]] as a unifying approach between algebra and geometry.&lt;ref name="acmdl"/&gt;  

Regardless of all these influences and other projects, the SSMCIS study group considered its work unique in scope and breadth, and Fehr wrote that "nowhere [else] had a total 7–12 unified mathematics program been designed, produced, and tested."&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  It was thus considered one of the more radical of the reform efforts lumped under the "New Math" label.&lt;ref name="kline"&gt;{{cite book | first=Morris | last=Kline | authorlink=Morris Kline | title=Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math | publisher=[[Vintage Books]] | location= | year=1974 | isbn=0394719816 | at=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Fehr believed that the SSMCIS could not just improve students' thinking in mathematics, but in all subjects, by "develop[ing] the capacity of the human mind for the observation, selection, generalization, abstraction, and construction of models for use in the other disciplines."&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

==Materials==
[[Image:Unified Modern Mathematics Course III Part 1 cover.jpg|thumb|223px|right|upright|The paper covers of the course books had a different color for each of the six courses: light blue, yellow, light green (here), red, blue, dark red.]]

The course books put out by SSMCIS were titled ''Unified Modern Mathematics'', and labeled as Course I through Course VI, with the two volumes in each year labeled as Part I and Part II.&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"&gt;{{cite book | title=Unified Modern Mathematics: Course V: Part II | publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] | location=New York | edition=Revised | year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Materials for the next year's course were prepared each year, thus keeping up with the early adoption programs underway.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Using largely [[formative evaluation]] methods for gaining teacher feedback,&lt;ref name="curdev-math-196"/&gt; revised versions were put out after the first year's teaching experience.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;  By 1973, the revised version of all six courses had been completed.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"&gt;{{cite book | title=Curriculum Development in Mathematics | type=Paperback | first=Geoffrey |last=Howson |first2=Christine |last2=Keitel |first3= Jeremy |last3=Kilpatrick | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location= | year=1982 | pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first three volumes were put into the public domain for any organization to use.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

The pages of the books were formatted by typewriter, augmented by some mathematical symbols and inserted graphs, bound in paper, and published by Teachers College itself.&lt;ref name="umm-v-ii"/&gt; A more polished hardcover version of Courses I through IV was put out in subsequent years by [[Addison-Wesley]]; these were adaptations made by Fehr and others and targeted to students with a broader range of mathematical ability.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;

[[Computer programming]] on [[Time-sharing|time-shared computer systems]] was included in the curriculum both for its own importance and for understanding numerical methods.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  The first course introduced [[flow chart]]s and the notion of [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref name="umm-i-ii"&gt;{{cite book | title=Unified Modern Mathematics: Course I: Part II | publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] | location=New York | edition=Revised | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The beginning portion of the fourth-year course was devoted to introducing the [[BASIC]] programming language, with an emphasis on fundamental [[control flow]] statements, continued use of flow charts for design, and [[numerical programming]] applications.  Interactive teletype interfaces on slow and erratic [[dial-up modem|dial-up connections]], with troublesome [[paper tape]] for offline storage, was the typical physical environment.&lt;ref name="umm-iv-i"&gt;{{cite book | title=Unified Modern Mathematics: Course IV: Part I | publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] | location=New York | edition=Revised | year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1966, teachers from nine junior high and high schools, mostly in the [[New York metropolitan area]], began getting training in the study program at Teachers College.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Such training was crucial since few junior high or high school teachers knew all the material that would be introduced.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-79"/&gt;  They then returned to their  schools and began teaching the experimental courses,&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt; two teachers per grade.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;    For instance, [[Leonia High School]], which incorporated grades 8–12 (since there was no middle school then), called the program "Math X" for experimental, with individual courses called Math 8X, Math 9X, etc.&lt;ref name="lhs-cos"&gt;{{cite book | title=Program of Studies: 1970–1971 | publisher=[[Leonia High School]] | location=Leonia, New Jersey | year=1970 | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hunter College High School]] used it as the basis for its Extended Honors Program; the school's description stated that the program "includes many advanced topics and requires extensive preparation and a considerable commitment of time to the study of mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hchs.hunter.cuny.edu/images/uploads/CourseOutline_Math7.pdf | title=Mathematics: Departmental Philosophy | publisher=[[Hunter College High School]] | accessdate=September 13, 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Students were periodically given standardized tests to make sure there was no decline in performance due to the unusual organization of material.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Some 400&amp;nbsp;students were involved in this initial phase.&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt;

Because the program was so different from standard U.S. mathematics curricula, it was quite difficult to students to enter after the first year; students did, however, sometimes drop out of it and return to standard courses.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;  As teaching the program was a specialized activity, teachers tended to move along from each grade to the next with their students, and so it was typical for students to have one of the same two teachers, or even the same teacher, for five or six years in a row.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;
  
More teachers were added in 1968 and 1969 and the [[University of Maryland]] and [[University of Arizona]] were added as teaching sites.&lt;ref name="fehr-1969"/&gt;  Eighteen schools in [[Los Angeles]] adopted SSMCIS in what was called the Accelerated Mathematics Instruction program; some 2,500&amp;nbsp;gifted students took part.&lt;ref name="la-ami"&gt;{{cite journal | title=New Programs | first=Robert J. | last=Kansky | first2=Arthur A. | last2=Hiatt | first3=Mary Margaret |last3=Odom | journal=

==Results==

The Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study program did show some success in its educational purpose.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;  A study of the Los Angeles program found that SSMCIS-taught students had a better attitude toward their program than did students using [[School Mathematics Study Group]] courses (another "New Math" initiative) or traditional courses.&lt;ref name="la-ami"/&gt;  In [[New York State]] schools, special examinations were given to tenth and eleventh grade SSMCIS students in lieu of the standard [[Regents Examinations]]&lt;ref name="fehr-1974"/&gt; due to a mismatch in curriculum.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-196"&gt;Howson, Keitel, and Kilpatrick, ''Curriculum Development in Mathematics'', pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, SSMCIS was one of the direct inspirations for the [[New York State Education Department]], in the late 1970s and 1980s, adopting an integrated, three-year mathematics curriculum for all its students, combining algebra, geometry, and trigonometry with an increased emphasis in probability and statistics.&lt;ref name="nys-integrated"&gt;{{cite journal | title=An Integrated Approach for Secondary School Mathematics | first=Fredric | last=Paul | journal=[[The Mathematics Teacher]] | volume= 79 | issue= 4 |date=April 1986 | pages= 236–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;

Given the differences in subject matter and approach, how SSMCIS-taught students would perform on [[College Entrance Examination Board]] tests became a major concern of parents and students and teachers.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-196"/&gt;  A 1973 report compared the test performance of such students with those from traditional mathematics curricula.  It found that the SSMCIS students did better on the mathematics portion of the [[PSAT/NMSQT|Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT)]], even when matched for background and performance on the verbal portion. It also found that SSMCIS students did just as well on the [[SAT Subject Test in Mathematics Level 2|Mathematics Level II Achievement Test]] as traditional students taking college preparatory courses or, indeed, as college freshmen taking introductory calculus courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED081847 | title=Performance of SSMCIS-Trained Students on College Board Mathematics Examinations | last=Williams | first=S. Irene | last2= Jones | first2=Chancey O. | publisher=Test Development Report | year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found SSMCIS students well prepared for the mathematics portion of the regular [[SAT|Scholastic Aptitude Test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=An Overview of the Mathematics Achievement Tests Offered in the Admissions Testing Program of the College Entrance Examination Board | first=Chancey O. | last=Jones | first2=Mildred R. | last2=Rowen | first3=Howard E. | last3=Taylor | journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume=70 | issue= 3 |date=March 1977 | pages= 197–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, SSMCIS developed slowly.&lt;ref name="kline"/&gt; Funding became an issue,&lt;ref name="record"/&gt; and indeed it was never funded as well as some other mathematics curriculum efforts had been.&lt;ref name="curdev-math"/&gt;  Despite the federal funding source, there was no centralized, national focal point in the U.S. for curriculum changes – such as some European countries had – and that made adoption of SSMCIS innovations a harder task.&lt;ref name="curdev-math-45"&gt;Howson, Keitel, and Kilpatrick, ''Curriculum Development in Mathematics'', pp. 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-1970s there was a growing backlash against the "New Math" movement, spurred in part by a perceived decline in standardized test scores and by [[Morris Kline]]'s critical book ''Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math''.&lt;ref name="fey-1978"&gt;{{cite journal | first=James T. | last=Fey | title=Change in Mathematics Education Since the Late 1950's – Ideas and Realisation U.S.A. | journal=[[Educational Studies in Mathematics]] | volume=9 | issue=3 |date=August 1978 | pages=339–353 | doi=10.1007/bf00241036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many reform efforts had underestimated the difficulty of getting the public and the mathematics educational community to believe that major changes were really necessary, especially for secondary school programs where college entrance performance was always the key concern of administrators.&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  Federal funding for curriculum development also came under attack from [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] in the [[U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  As one of the participants in creating SSMCIS, James T. Fey of Teachers College, later wrote, "Schools and societal expectations of schools appear to change very slowly."&lt;ref name="fey-1978"/&gt;  In the end, SSMCIS never became widely adopted.&lt;ref name="walmsley"/&gt;

==Legacy==
One SSMCIS student, [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] of [[Leonia High School]], decades later became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Estonia)|Foreign Minister]] and then [[President of Estonia]].&lt;ref name="nj2016"/&gt;  He credited the SSMCIS course, the early exposure it gave him to computer programming, and the teacher of the course, Christine Cummings, with his subsequent interest in computer infrastructure, which in part resulted in the country leaping over its [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era technological backwardness; computer-accessible education became pervasive in [[Education in Estonia|Estonian schools]], and the [[Internet in Estonia]] has one of the highest penetration rates in the world.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.president.ee/en/media/interviews/3304-qfrom-estonia-to-leoniaq-the-record-23-april-2008/ | title=From Estonia to Leonia | first=Herb | last=Jackson | newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]] | location = | date=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.riponsociety.org/forum131thi.htm | title=The Estonian Example: Q&amp;A with Toomas Hendrik Ilves | work=[[The Ripon Forum]] | publisher=[[Ripon Society]] | date=Winter 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As his tenure as president came to a close in 2016, Ilves visited his old school building with Cummings and said, "I owe everything to her. Because of what she taught us, my country now uses it."&lt;ref name="nj2016"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2016/09/president_of_estonia_visits_his_old_nj_high_school_before_un_talk.html | title=President of Estonia visits his old N.J. high school before UN talk | first=Sara | last=Jerde | publisher=[[NJ.com]] | date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cummings said that SSMCIS not only introduced beginning computer programming but also taught students "how to think".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/estonian-president-a-leonia-h-s-grad-stops-by-middle-school-1.1663775 | title=Estonian president, a Leonia H.S. grad, stops by middle school | first=Andrew | last=Wyrich | newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]] | date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSMCIS did represent a productive exercise in thinking about mathematics curriculum, and the mathematics education literature would cite it in subsequent years, including references to it as a distinct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Review: Geometry in the Mathematics Curriculum, Thirty-sixth Yearbook | first=James D. | last=Bristol |journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume= 67 | issue= 5 |date=May 1974 | page= 442}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most radical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=What Do Mathematics Teachers Think About the High School Geometry Controversy | first=George | last=Gearhart | journal=The Mathematics Teacher | volume= 68 | issue= 6 |date=October 1975 | pages= 486–493}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach to teaching geometry; as using functions as a unifying element of teaching mathematics;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Intuitions on Functions | first=Tommy |last=Dreyfus | first2=Theodore |last2=Eisenberg | journal=The Journal of Experimental Education | volume= 52 | issue= 2 | date=Winter 1984 | pages= 77-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as its course materials having value when used as the vehicle for further research in mathematics education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Communication of Mathematical Structure and Its Relationship to Achievement | first=Nicholas A. |last=Branca|journal=[[Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]] | volume=11 | issue= 1 |date=January 1980 | pages= 37–49 | doi=10.2307/748731}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Two mentions in here, maybe some legacy stuff, maybe not: books.google.com/books?id=8FTKCaDjhZ0C&amp;pg=PA512 --&gt;

A '''shell grotto''' is a type of [[folly]], a [[grotto]] decorated with [[sea shell]]s.

==History==
The shell grotto was a popular feature of British country house in the 17th and 18th centuries.
It arose from the influence of the [[Rococo style]] (which used swirling motifs similar to sea shells)&lt;ref name=HJ&gt;Hazelle Jackson, ''Shell Houses and Grottoes'' ( 2001) {{ISBN|9780747805229}} ([http://www.londongardenstrust.org/features/grotto.htm abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;
and mimicry of architectural features from the [[Italian renaissance]] (themselves copies from Classical times).
The idea of a grotto was originally a means to enhance a dank [[undercroft]], or provide an antechamber before a ''[[piano nobile]]'', but later became a garden feature independent of the house.
Early grottos were mainly of the shell grotto type, mimicking a sea-cave, or in the form of a [[nymphaeum]]; later there was a move towards more naturalistic cave-like grottoes.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

The first recorded shell grotto in England was at [[Whitehall Palace]]; [[James VI and I|James I]] had it built in the undercroft of the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] in 1624, but it hasn't survived. Two years later the [[Duke of Bedford]] had a shell room built at [[Woburn Abbey]], featuring shell mosaics and carved stone.
This, and another at [[Skipton Castle]], built in 1627, are the only surviving examples from the 17th century.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

Shell grottoes were an expensive luxury: The grotto at [[Oatlands Park]] cost £25,000 in 1781 and took 11 years to build; and at [[Fisherwick|Fisherwick Park]] the [[Marquess of Donegall]] spent £10,000 on shells alone in 1789.&lt;ref name=Tat&gt;[https://www.tatler.com/article/the-poshest-grottoes  ''The 4 poshest garden grottoes''] [[Tatler]] 27 July 2015; retrieved 30 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shell Grotto, Margate|The Grotto]] at [[Margate]] has 2000 square feet of mosaic, using some 4.6 million shells.

By the end of the 18th century fashion had moved on to more naturalistic cave-like structures, before falling out of favour altogether. Many were demolished or have fallen into disrepair, but 
some 200 grottos of all types are known to have survived in some form in the UK.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">The concept of '''smart environments''' evolves from the definition of [[ubiquitous computing]] that, according to [[Mark Weiser]], promotes the ideas of "a physical world that is richly and invisibly interwoven with sensors, actuators, displays, and computational elements, embedded seamlessly in the everyday objects of our lives, and connected through a continuous network."&lt;ref name="Weiser-99"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Smart environments are envisioned as the byproduct of [[pervasive computing]] and the availability of cheap computing power, making human interaction with the system a pleasant experience.

==Definition==
Cook and Das&lt;ref name="Cook-Sajal"&gt;
{{cite book
  | last = Cook
  | first = Diane
  | authorlink = 
  |author2=Das, Sajal

&lt;/ref&gt; define smart environment as "a small world where different kinds of [[smart device]] are continuously working to make inhabitants' lives more comfortable." Smart environments aim to satisfy the experience of individuals from every environment, by replacing the hazardous work, physical labor, and repetitive tasks with automated agents. 
Poslad&lt;ref name="Poslad"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
differentiates three different kinds of smart environments for systems, services and devices: virtual (or distributed) computing environments, physical environments and human environments, or a hybrid combination of these:
* ''Virtual computing environments'' enable smart devices to access pertinent services anywhere and anytime.
* ''Physical environments'' may be embedded with a variety of smart devices of different types including tags, sensors and controllers and have different form factors ranging from nano- to micro- to macro-sized.
* ''Human environments'': humans, either individually or collectively, inherently form a smart environment for devices. However, humans may themselves be accompanied by smart devices such as mobile phones, use surface-mounted devices (wearable computing) and contain embedded devices (e.g., pacemakers to maintain a healthy heart operation or [[Augmented reality|AR]] contact lenses).

==Features==
Smart environments are broadly classified to have the following features
# ''Remote control of devices'', like power line communication systems to control devices.
# ''Device Communication'',  using middleware, and Wireless communication to form a picture of connected environments.
# ''Information Acquisition/Dissemination from sensor networks''
# ''Enhanced Services by Intelligent Devices''
# ''Predictive and Decision-Making capabilities''

==Technologies==
To build a smart environment, involves technologies of
# Wireless communication
# Algorithm design, signal prediction &amp; classification, information theory
# Multilayered software architecture, [[CORBA|Corba]], middleware
# [[Speech recognition]]
# Image processing, image recognition
# Sensors design, calibration, [[motion detection]], temperature, pressure sensors, accelerometers
# [[Semantic Web]] and [[knowledge graph]]s
# Adaptive control, [[Kalman filter]]s
# Computer networking
# Parallel processing
# Operating systems

==Existing projects==
The [[Aware Home Research Initiative]] at Georgia Tech "is devoted to the multidisciplinary exploration of emerging technologies and services based in the home" and was launched in 1998 as one of the first "living laboratories."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[MavHome]] (Managing an Adaptive Versatile Home) project, at [[University of Texas at Arlington|UT Arlington]], is a smart environment-lab with state-of-the-art algorithms and protocols used to provide a customized, personal environment to the users of this space. The MavHome project, in addition to providing a safe environment, wants to reduce the energy consumption of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;

Between the population types, significant differences were found with their individual observed stellar spectra. These were later shown to be very important, and was possibly related to star formation, observed [[kinematics]]&lt;ref name="Gibson2013" /&gt;, stellar age, and even [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy evolution]] in both [[Spiral galaxy|spiral]] or [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] galaxies.

By definition, each population group shows the trend where decreasing metal content indicates increasing age of stars. Hence, the first stars in the universe (very low metal content) were deemed Population&amp;nbsp;III, old stars (low metallicity) as Population&amp;nbsp;II, and recent stars (high metallicity) as Population&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref name="Byant2005" /&gt;

==Stellar populations==
Observation of [[Astronomical spectroscopy#Stars and their properties|stellar spectra]] has revealed that stars older than the Sun have fewer heavy elements compared to the Sun.&lt;ref name="Gibson2013" /&gt; This immediately suggests that metallicity has evolved through the generations of stars by the process of [[stellar evolution]].&lt;ref name="Shapley1977" /&gt; 

===Formation of the first stars===

Under current cosmological models, all matter created in the [[Big Bang]] was mostly hydrogen and helium, with only a very tiny fraction consisting of light elements. e.g. [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]]. When the universe had cooled sufficiently, the first stars were born as Population&amp;nbsp;III stars without any contaminating heavier metals. This is postulated to have affected their structure so that their stellar masses became hundreds of times more than that of the Sun. In turn, these massive stars also evolved very quickly, and their [[nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthetic]] processes  created the first 26 elements (up to [[iron]] in the [[periodic table]]).&lt;ref name="Heger2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author=A. Heger | author2=S. E. Woosley | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=2002 | title=The Nucleosynthetic Signature of Population III | volume=567 | issue=1 | pages=532–543|bibcode=2002ApJ...567..532H | doi=10.1086/338487|arxiv = astro-ph/0107037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theoretical stellar models show that most high-mass Population III stars rapidly exhausted their fuel and likely exploded in extremely energetic [[pair-instability supernova]]e. Those explosions would have thoroughly dispersed their material, ejecting metals into the interstellar medium (ISM), to be incorporated into the later generations of stars. Their destruction suggests that no galactic high-mass Population III stars should be observable. However, some Population III stars might be seen in high-[[redshift]] galaxies whose light originated during the earlier history of the universe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} None have been discovered. 

Stars too massive to produce pair-instability supernovae would have likely collapsed into [[black hole]]s through a process known as [[photodisintegration]]. Here some matter may have escaped during this process in the form of [[relativistic jet]]s, and this could have distributed the first metals into the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fryer|first1=C.

It has been speculated that these stars could have formed relatively recently in [[dwarf galaxies]] containing primordial metal-free [[interstellar matter]]; past supernovae in these galaxies could have ejected their metal-rich contents at speeds high enough for them to escape the galaxy, keeping the metal content of the galaxy very low.

[[File:Treasures3.jpg|thumb|right|Population I star [[Rigel]] with [[reflection nebula]] [[IC 2118]]]]
Population I, or metal-rich, stars are young stars with the highest metallicity out of all three populations, and are more commonly found in the [[spiral arm]]s of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.  The [[Earth]]'s [[Sun]] is an example of a metal-rich star and is considered as an intermediate Population I star, while the solar-like [[Mu Arae]] is much richer in metals.&lt;ref name="soriano2009"&gt;{{cite journal

Population I stars usually have regular [[elliptical orbit]]s of the galactic centre, with a low [[relative velocity]]. It was earlier hypothesized that the high metallicity of Population I stars makes them more likely to possess [[planetary system]]s than the other two populations, because [[planet]]s, particularly [[terrestrial planet]]s, are thought to be formed by the [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect|author=Charles H.

[[File:Milky way profile.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Schematic profile of the Milky Way. Population II stars appear in the galactic bulge and within the globular clusters]]
Population II, or metal-poor, stars are those with relatively little metal. The idea of ''a relatively small amount'' must be kept in perspective as even metal-rich astronomical objects contain low percentages of any element other than hydrogen or helium; metals constitute only a tiny percentage of the overall chemical makeup of the universe, even 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years after the Big Bang. However, metal-poor objects are even more ancient. These objects are formed during an earlier time of the universe. Intermediate Population I stars are common in the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] near the centre of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], whereas Population II stars found in the [[Galactic spheroid#Galactic spheroid|galactic halo]] are older and thus more metal-poor. [[Globular clusters]] also contain high numbers of population II stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=T. S. van Albada | author2=Norman Baker | title=On the Two Oosterhoff Groups of Globular Clusters | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=185 | date=1973 | pages=477–498 | doi=10.1086/152434 | bibcode=1973ApJ...185..477V}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is thought that population II stars created all the other [[chemical element|elements]] in the [[periodic table]], except the more unstable ones. An interesting characteristic of Population II stars is that despite their lower overall metallicity, they often have a higher ratio of [[alpha elements]] ([[Oxygen|O]], [[Silicon|Si]], [[Neon|Ne]], etc.) relative to [[Iron|Fe]] as compared to Population I stars; current theory suggests this is the result of Type II supernovae being more important contributors to the [[interstellar medium]] at the time of their formation, whereas Type Ia supernovae metal enrichment came later in the universe's evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Gawiser, Prochaska, "DAMPED Lyalpha SYSTEMS", Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 2005. 43: 861–918 http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept05/Wolfe/Wolfe3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have targeted these oldest stars in several different surveys, including the HK objective-prism survey of [[Timothy C. Beers]] et al. and the Hamburg-[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] survey of [[Norbert Christlieb]] et al., originally started for faint [[quasars]]. Thus far, they have uncovered and studied in detail about ten ultra metal poor (UMP) stars (such as [[Sneden's Star]], [[Cayrel's Star]], [[BD +17° 3248]]) and three of the oldest stars known to date: [[HE0107-5240]], [[HE1327-2326]] and [[HE 1523-0901]]. [[SDSS J102915+172927|Caffau's star]] was identified as the most metal-poor star yet when it was found in 2012 using [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] data. However, in February 2014 the discovery of an even lower metallicity star was announced, [[SMSS J031300.36-670839.3]] located with the aid of [[SkyMapper]] astronomical survey data. Less extreme in their metal deficiency, but nearer and brighter and hence longer known, are [[HD 122563]] (a [[red giant]]) and [[HD 140283]] (a [[subgiant]]).

The '''Story Workshop''' Method is a method of teaching [[writing]] originated in 1965 by [[John Schultz (writer)|John Schultz]]. The [[Story Workshop Institute]] was founded to bring the method to [[Elementary school|elementary]] and [[Secondary school|secondary]] classrooms and other forums for writing instruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.storyworkshop.john-schultz.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The former Fiction Writing Department at [[Columbia College Chicago]] used this [[methodology]] in its core writing course progression, and ''[[Hair Trigger]]'' is its award-winning annual of student [[fiction]] and [[creative nonfiction]] writing.

== Main features ==

The Story Workshop method "focuses on helping you hear your own individual voice and provides a supportive, interactive, and challenging environment for developing your reading, writing, listening, speaking, [[critical thinking]], and imaginative [[problem-solving]] capacities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colum.edu/Academics/Fiction_Writing/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310160217/http://www.colum.edu/Academics/Fiction_Writing/index.php |archivedate=2009-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Story Workshop Method differs from [[critique]]-based writing [[pedagogy]] in that it focuses upon developing one's writing process, trusting that a good writing process will lead to good writing. Story Workshop instructors are called "Directors" and they coach students through different parts of the writing process during class, such as:

:published selections with an eye out for elements that may inform their own work, keeping a journal, oral story telling, reading aloud to an audience writing, rewriting, problem-solving (through word games; experiments with form, point-of-view, voice and other elements; coaching and questions), developing a sense of one's own voice, and developing an inner sense for one's [[audience]].

"You can identify the Story Workshop method of teaching writing by its structured, flexible time-period format; by its theory of seeing and voice; by its repertoire of oral word, oral telling, oral reading, writing and recall exercises; by its semicircle format, which heightens and facilitates the group process and the sense of audience; and by its teaching approaches, techniques, strategies, and tactics made possible by the exercises and their many variations. Used in class sessions and in one-to-one tutorial sessions, the Story Workshop method assumes that all forms of writing derive from image and story, from image and movement of voice organizing the expression of perceptions through time. The development of these human perceptual, imaginative, and verbal capacities through their many derivations in oral and written forms is always the Story Workshop objective." From "The Story Workshop Method Writing From Start to Finish," by John Schultz&lt;ref&gt;''College English'' Vol. 39, No. 4, Dec. 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The Story Workshop pedagogy aims to allow writers to move beyond dependence upon the [[Teacher|instructor]] and the [[classroom]]. With the emphasis upon process development, Story Workshop Methodology sometimes frustrates students who are used to a pedagogical model that features red pen markings on their papers and direct negative [[criticism]] as its primary form of [[feedback]]. When feedback instead comes in coaching from the instructor during activities, in what classmates are able to recall (retell with a full sense of storytelling detail), and questions that the instructor or peers ask—all of which require some [[decision-making]] and responsibility from the writer—such a student will react negatively, claiming that the method "doesn't give any feedback." Successful students develop the ability to internalize various coachings heard in class, to read published [[literature]] with a critical eye and apply the techniques and approaches gleaned to his or her own writing, to use, and, where necessary and appropriate, combine a wide variety of [[prose]] forms and points-of-view in their writing, and to rewrite with a solid sense of what a particular [[manuscript]] needs.

== Measured results ==

The Story Workshop approach has been used on all levels and is modified to meet the needs of each level. In cases that have been tested comprehensively comparing results from classes of several teachers (in a major urban [[community college]] system over fourteen full [[semester]]s) 90% of the Story Workshop trained students passed a rigorous post-test successfully (two hours of argumentative writing), while only 50% to 70% of students from other traditional and ad hoc composition classes in the same college passed the test.&lt;ref&gt;See also quantified results of Story Workshop Composition classes in "My Own Voice: Students Say it Unlocks the Writing Process," by Zoe Keithley, in the ''Journal of Basic Writing'', Vol. II, No. 2, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.storyworkshop.john-schultz.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable writers ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39445">{{short description|Set of policies, procedures, and provision to equip teachers to perform their tasks effectively}}
'''Teacher education (TE)''' or '''teacher training''' refers to the policies, procedures, and provision designed to equip (prospective) [[teacher]]s with the [[knowledge]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, [[behavior]]s, and [[skill]]s they require to perform their tasks effectively in the [[classroom]], [[school]], and wider community.
The professionals who engage in this activity are called [[#teacher education|teacher educators]] (or, in some contexts, teacher trainers).

There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the most appropriate term to describe these activities. The term 'teacher training'  (which may give the impression that the activity involves training staff to undertake relatively routine tasks) seems to be losing ground, at least in the U.S., to 'teacher education' (with its connotation of preparing staff for a professional role as a reflective practitioner).&lt;ref name="tda.gov.uk"&gt;see for example Cecil H. Allen, In-Service Training of Teachers in ''[[Review of Educational Research]]''. 1940; 10: 210–215. In the UK, however, the term 'teacher training' is still in general use: [http://www.tda.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/teacher-training-options.aspx see for instance the UK government's information on tda.gov.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404015753/http://www.tda.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/teacher-training-options.aspx |date=2011-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy and related issues ==

The process by which teachers are educated is the subject of political discussion in many countries, reflecting both the value attached by societies and cultures to the preparation of young people for life, and the fact that education systems consume significant financial resources.

However, the degree of political control over Teacher Education varies. Where TE is entirely in the hands of universities, the state may have no direct control whatever over what or how new teachers are taught; this can lead to anomalies, such as teachers being taught using teaching methods that would be deemed inappropriate if they used the same methods in schools, or teachers being taught by persons with little or no hands-on experience of teaching in real classrooms. In other systems, TE may be the subject of detailed prescription (e.g. the state may specify the skills that all teachers must possess, or it may specify the content of TE courses).

Policy cooperation in the European Union (EU) has led to a broad description of the kinds of attributes that teachers in EU Member States should possess: the Common European Principle for Teacher Competences and Qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/2010/doc/principles_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708042400/http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/2010/doc/principles_en.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuum==
Although ideally it should be conceived of, and organised as, a seamless continuum, teacher education is often divided into these stages

*''initial teacher training / education'' (a pre-service course before entering the classroom as a fully responsible teacher);
*''induction'' (the process of providing training and support during the first few years of teaching or the first year in a particular school);
*''teacher development'' or ''continuing professional development (CPD)'' (an in-service process for practicing teachers).
There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the most appropriate term to describe these activities. The term 'teacher training'  (which may give the impression that the activity involves training staff to undertake relatively routine tasks) seems to be losing ground, at least in the U.S., to 'teacher education' (with its connotation of preparing staff for a professional role as a reflective practitioner).&lt;ref name="tda.gov.uk"/&gt;

=== Initial ===

==== Organization ====
In many countries, Initial Teacher Education (also known as preservice teacher training) takes place largely or exclusively in institutions of [[Higher Education]]. It may be organized according to two basic models.

In the 'consecutive' model, a teacher first obtains a qualification in one or more subjects (often an undergraduate bachelor's degree), and then studies for a further period to gain an additional qualification in teaching (this may take the form of a post-baccalaureate credential or master's degree).

In the alternative 'concurrent' model, a student simultaneously studies both one or more academic subjects, and the ways of teaching that subject, leading to a combined bachelor's degree and teaching credential to qualify as a teacher of that subject.

Other pathways are also available. In some countries, it is possible for a person to receive training as a teacher by working in a school under the responsibility of an accredited experienced practitioner. In the United Kingdom there is a long tradition of partnerships between universities and schools in providing state supported teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Research and the Teaching Profession. Building the capacity for a self-improving education system|last=BERA/RSA|first=|publisher=BERA|year=2014|isbn=978-0-946671-37-3|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is not without tensions and controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Oancea |first=Alis |year=2014 |title=Teachers' professional knowledge and state-funded teacher education: a (hi)story of critiques and silences |doi=10.1080/03054985.2014.939413 |journal=Oxford Review of Education |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=497–519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, approximately one-third of new teachers come through alternative routes to teacher certification, according to testimony given by Emily Feistritzer, the President of National Center for Alternative Certification and the National Center for Education Information, to a congressional subcommittee on May 17, 2007. However, many alternative pathways are affiliated with schools of education, where candidates still enroll in university-based coursework. A supplemental component of university-based coursework is community-based teacher education, where teacher candidates immerse themselves in communities that will allow them to apply teaching theory to practice. Community-based teacher education also challenges teacher candidates' assumptions about the issues of gender, race, and multicultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/imo/media/doc/051707EmilyFeistritzerTestimony.pdf |title=Preparing Teachers for the Classroom: The Role of the Higher Education Act and No Child Left Behind |date=May 17, 2007 |work=U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor |access-date=December 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Curriculum ====
The question of what knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and skills teachers should possess is the subject of much debate in many cultures. This is understandable, as teachers are entrusted with the transmission to learners of society's beliefs, attitudes and deontology, as well as of information, advice and wisdom, and with facilitating learners' acquisition of the key knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that they will need to be active in society and the economy.

Generally, Teacher Education curricula can be broken down into four major areas:
*[[foundational knowledge]] in education-related aspects of [[philosophy of education]], [[history of education]], [[educational psychology]], and [[sociology of education]].
*skills in assessing student learning, supporting English Language learners,{{dubious|date=November 2015}} using technology to improve teaching and learning, and supporting students with special needs.
*content-area and methods knowledge and skills—often also including ways of teaching and assessing a specific subject, in which case this area may overlap with the first ("foundational") area. There is increasing debate about this aspect; because it is no longer possible to know in advance what kinds of knowledge and skill pupils will need when they enter adult life, it becomes harder to know what kinds of knowledge and skill teachers should have. Increasingly, emphasis is placed upon 'transversal' or 'horizontal' skills (such as 'learning to learn' or 'social competences'), which cut across traditional subject boundaries, and therefore call into question traditional ways of designing the Teacher Education curriculum (and traditional school curricula and ways of working in the classroom).
*practice at classroom teaching or at some other form of educational practice—usually supervised and supported in some way, though not always. Practice can take the form of field observations, student teaching, or (U.S.) internship (See Supervised Field Experiences below).

==== Rural ====
Those training to teach in rural and remote areas face different challenges from those who teach in urban centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eaton |first=S. E. |last2=Dressler |first2=R. |last3=Gereluk |first3=D. |last4=Becker |first4=S. |year=2015 |title=A review of the literature on rural and remote pre-service teacher preparation with a focus on blended and e-learning models |work=Werklund School of Education Research &amp; Publications |doi=10.5072/PRISM/31625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibson |first=I. W. |year=1994 |title=Policy, practice and need in the professional preparation of teachers for rural teaching |journal=Journal of Research in Rural Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=68–77 |doi= |url=https://sites.psu.edu/jrre/wp-content/uploads/sites/6347/2014/02/10-1_5.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Alberta Advanced Education |date=2005 |title=A Learning Alberta: Advanced Education in Rural Alberta: Challenges And Opportunities: A Discussion Document |location=Edmonton |url=http://advancededucation.alberta.ca/media/134955/rural.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a different approach to teacher education is needed for those who aspire to each in rural and remote areas. It has been proposed that rural and remote communities may have more success recruiting teachers who already live in these communities, rather than trying to recruit urbanites to move to rural communities once they have completed their teacher training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Northern Alberta Development Council |date=2010 |title=Rural and Remote Education Report |url=http://www.nadc.gov.ab.ca/Docs/rural-remote-education.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online and blended teacher education programs are becoming more prevalent to help meet the needs of teacher shortages in rural and remote areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eaton |first=S.

==== Supervised field experiences ====
*field observations—include observation and limited participation within a classroom under the supervision of the classroom teacher
*student teaching—includes a number of weeks teaching in an assigned classroom under the supervision of the classroom teacher and a supervisor (e.g. from the university)
*internship—teaching candidate is supervised within his or her own classroom

These three areas reflect the organization of most teacher education programs in North America (though not necessarily elsewhere in the world)—courses, modules, and other activities are often organized to belong to one of the three major areas of teacher education. The organization makes the programs more rational or logical in structure. The conventional organization has sometimes also been criticized, however, as artificial and unrepresentative of how teachers actually experience their work. Problems of practice frequently (perhaps usually) concern foundational issues, curriculum, and practical knowledge simultaneously, and separating them during teacher education may therefore not be helpful.
However, the question of necessary training components is highly debated as continuing increases in attrition rates by new teachers and struggling learners is evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosser-Cox|first=Michelle|title=CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS AND MOTIVATION IN PREPARING TEACHERS: PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS: DOES CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS AFFECT ANTICIPATED SELF-DETERMINATION TO TEACH IN SPECIFIC SETTINGS?|year=2011|publisher=LAMBERT Academic Publishing|isbn=3844384693|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, with the increasing demands of the "teacher" research is beginning to suggest that teachers must not only be trained to increase learning experiences for their students, but how to also be a leader in an increasingly challenging field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosser and Massey|title=Educational Leadership: The Power of Oneself|year=2013|publisher=Peter Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate of how best to prepare teachers for teaching in today's demanding environments will continue to be an important focus of the United States, where the education of all children successfully is priority.

=== Induction of beginning teachers ===

Teaching involves the use of a wide body of knowledge about the subject being taught, and another set of knowledge about the most effective ways to teach that subject to different kinds of learner; it, therefore, requires teachers to undertake a complex set of tasks every minute. Many teachers experience their first years in the profession as stressful. The proportion of teachers who either do not enter the profession after completing initial training, or who leave the profession after their first teaching post, is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/gse_pubs/134/|title=Do Teacher Induction and Mentoring Matter?|first1=Ingersoll,|last1=Richard|first2=Smith, Thomas|last2=M|date=1 January 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is sometimes made between inducting a teacher into a new school (explaining the school's vision, procedures etc.), and inducting a new teacher into the teaching profession (providing the support necessary to help the beginning teacher develop a professional identity, and to further develop the basic competences that were acquired in college).

A number of countries and states have put in place comprehensive systems of support to help beginning teachers during their first years in the profession. Elements of such a programme can include:
* mentoring: the allocation to each beginning teacher of an experienced teacher, specifically trained as a mentor; the mentor may provide emotional and professional support and guidance; in many U.S. states, induction is limited to the provision of a mentor, but research suggests that, in itself, it is not enough.&lt;ref&gt;Wong H; Induction programs that keep new teachers teaching and improving; NASSP Bulletin � Vol. 88 No. 638 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* a peer network: for mutual support but also for peer learning.
* input from educational experts (e.g. to help the beginning teacher relate what she learned in college with classroom reality).
* support for the process of self-reflection that all teachers engage in (e.g. through the keeping of a journal).

Some research&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, P., Hobson, A., Tracey, L., Malderez, A., Tomlinson, P., Roper, T., Chambers, G. and Healy, J. (2008). Beginner teachers' experiences of initial teacher preparation, induction and early professional development: a review of literature. London: DCSF&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that such programmes can: increase the [[Employee retention|retention]] of beginning teachers in the profession; improve teaching performance; promote the teachers' personal and professional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Huling-Austin, J. A synthesis of research on teacher induction programs and practices; paper presented to the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, New Orleans LA, April 5–9, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

However, numerous authors &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Villegas | first1 = A. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = T. | year = 2002 | title = Preparing culturally responsive teachers rethinking the curriculum | url = | journal = Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 20–32 | doi = 10.1177/0022487102053001003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jabbar, Abdul and Hardaker, Glenn (2013) The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools. ''Teaching in Higher Education'' , 18 (3). pp. 272-284.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that current teacher education is highly flawed and primarily geared towards a western dominated curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = Y | year = 2006 | title = Chinese Students in a UK Business School: Hearing the Student Voice in Reflective Teaching and Learning Practice | url = | journal = Higher Education Quarterly | volume = 60 | issue = 1| pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2273.2006.00306.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, they suggest that teacher education should be inclusive and take into account multiple backgrounds and variables to allow teachers to be responsive to the requirements of their students.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This falls into the area of culturally responsive teaching and requires teaching education and teachers to address issues of diversity education and disadvantage as a part of a teacher education curriculum. Jabbar &amp; Hardaker (2013) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jabbar | first1 = Abdul | last2 = Hardaker | first2 = Glenn | year = 2013 | title = The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools | url = http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/15029/ | journal = Teaching in Higher Education | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 272–284 | doi=10.1080/13562517.2012.725221}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that this is an essential process in helping students of ethnicity, colour and diversity achieve and attain.

=== Continuous professional development ===

Because the world that teachers are preparing young people to enter is changing so rapidly, and because the teaching skills required are evolving likewise, no initial course of teacher education can be sufficient to prepare a teacher for a career of 30 or 40 years. In addition, as the student body continues to change due to demographic issues there is a continuous pressure on academics to have mastery of their subjects but also to understand their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howard | first1 = T.

The extent to which education authorities support this process varies, as does the effectiveness of the different approaches. A growing research base suggests that to be most effective, CPD activities should:
*be spread over time,
*be collaborative,
*use active learning,
*be delivered to groups of teachers,
*include periods of practice, coaching, and follow-up,
*promote reflective practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccdc.in/theatre-oppressed-in-education|title=Theatre of the Oppressed in Education - Centre for Community Dialogue and Change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*encourage experimentation, and
*respond to teachers' needs.&lt;ref&gt;see: Snow-Renner and Lauer, ‘Professional Development Analysis (synthesis of 54 studies), McREL, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garet | first1 = See | last2 = Porter | first2 = Desmoine | last3 = Birman | first3 = Kwang | year = 2001 | title = What makes professional development effective? | url = | journal = American Education Research Journal | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 915–946 | doi=10.3102/00028312038004915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see General Teaching Council for England, 'Teachers' Professional Learning', London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several educations around the world which have been working to improve CPD for teachers. One such organisation is Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) which has designed teaching standards for different stages in a teacher's career. Further, it conducts a Certification for teachers to engage with them on these standards and recognise those who are outstanding, thereby providing an incentive for CPp

== Quality assurance in teacher education==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}

The concept of 'Quality' in education is contested and understood in numerous different ways.

It is sometimes taken to relate to the quality of the work undertaken by a teacher, which has significant effects upon his or her pupils or students. Further, those who pay teachers' salaries, whether through taxes or through school fees, wish to be assured that they are receiving value for money. Ways to measure the quality of work of individual teachers, of schools, or of education systems as a whole, are therefore often sought.

In most countries, teacher salary is not related to the perceived quality of his or her work. Some, however, have systems to identify the 'best-performing' teachers, and increase their remuneration accordingly. Elsewhere, assessments of teacher performance may be undertaken with a view to identifying teachers' needs for additional training or development, or, in extreme cases, to identify those teachers that should be required to leave the profession. In some countries, teachers are required to re-apply periodically for their license to teach, and in so doing, to prove that they still have the requisite skills.

Feedback on the performance of teachers is integral to many state and private education procedures, but takes many different forms. The 'no fault' approach is believed by some to be satisfactory, as weaknesses are carefully identified, assessed and then addressed through the provision of in house or school based training. These can, however, be seen as benefiting the institution and not necessarily fully meeting the CPD needs of the individual as they lack educational gravitas.

A teacher educator (also called a teacher trainer) is a person who helps other people to acquire the knowledge, competences and attitudes they require to be effective teachers.
Several individual teacher educators are usually involved in the initial or ongoing education of each teacher; often each specialises in teaching about a different aspect of teaching (e.g. educational [[ethics]], [[philosophy of education]], [[sociology of education]], [[curriculum]], [[pedagogy]], subject-specific teaching methods etc.).

Not every culture has a concept that precisely matches the English term 'teacher educator'...&lt;ref name="Caena"&gt;Francesca Caena: Perspectives on Teacher Educator policies in European countries: an overview. Retrieved January 2017 at  http://www.lerarenopleider.nl/velon/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/summary_national_situations_teacher_educator_policies_europe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Even where the concept exists, the range of roles that is covered by the term varies significantly from country to country.&lt;ref name="European Commission"&gt;see, for example, the analysis of how this term is used within Europe in: European Commission (2012), 'Supporting the Teaching Professions for Better Learning Outcomes' retrieved January 2017 at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0374:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; 
In some traditions, the term '[[teacher trainer]]' may be used instead of 'teacher educator'.

A teacher educator may be narrowly defined as a higher education professional whose principle activity is the preparation of beginning teachers in universities and other institutions of teacher education, such as teacher colleges. A broader definition might include any professional whose work contributes in some way to the initial education or the continuing professional development of school and other teachers.&lt;ref name="Caena"/&gt;

Even within a single educational system, teacher educators may be employed in different roles by different kinds of organisation. In the European context, for example, people who could be considered to be teacher educators include: 
:-[[Higher Education]] academics with a responsibility 
::--for [[Teacher Education]] as such, 
::--for teaching a subject (such as chemistry or mathematics) to students who will later become teachers;
::--for [[research]] into teaching, 
::--for subject studies or 
::--for [[didactics]]; 
:-teachers in schools who supervise student teachers during periods of [[teaching practice]];
:-school teachers or school managers responsible for inducting new teachers during their first year of teaching; or
:-those in charge of school teaching staff’s [[continuous professional development]].&lt;ref name="EC2"&gt;these examples are taken from the European Commission's text 'Supporting teacher educators' retrieved January 2017 from [http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/school/doc/support-teacher-educators_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Teacher educators may therefore work in many different contexts including ([[universities]], [[schools]], private sector training organisations or [[trade unions]])&lt;ref name="EC2" /&gt; and their working time may be fully, or only partly, dedicated to the preparation of teachers.

===Professional knowledge and competences of teacher educators===
Being able to educate teachers requires different knowledge and skills than those required to teach pupils or students.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, J., Male, T. (2005) ‘Becoming a teacher educator: evidence from the field’ Teaching and Teacher Education 21 125–142[000]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teacher educators' fields of knowledge====
Some recent research has highlighted the many fields of knowledge that are required by teacher educators; these include knowledge about: the pedagogy of teacher education; learning and learners; teaching and coaching; and the profession of teacher educator itself. In addition, teacher educators need to know about the specific contexts their students will work and working in (e.g. for primary, or secondary education) and the subjects they will teach. More experienced teacher educators need expertise in: curriculum development and assessment; the wider context of teacher education, the way it is organised, and in research.&lt;ref name="Dengerinck"&gt;These are taken from: Dengerink J, Lunenberg M and Kools Q (2015) ‘What and how teacher educators prefer to learn’, Journal of Education for Teaching, 41:1, 78-96; but see also a similar list of required competences in European Commission (2012), 'Supporting the Teaching Professions for Better Learning Outcomes' retrieved January 2017 at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0374:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiple identities====
The complexity of the tasks of the teacher educator arises in part because, as research has shown, they have multiple professional identities. (This is linked to the issues of definition of the term, highlighted above). While some of those who carry responsibility for the education of teachers do self-identify as 'teacher educator', others may self-identify rather as '[[researcher]]' or '[[academic]]'; others may relate primarily to their academic discipline, such as '[[chemist]]' or '[[geographer]].'&lt;ref name="Swen"&gt;see, for example: Swennen A., Jones K, Volman M (2010). ‘Teacher Educators: their identities, sub-identities and implications for professional development’, Professional Development in Education, 36 (1-2), March- June 2010, 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the key duality of identity that lies at the core of the teacher educator profession is that of first-order and second order teaching. A teacher educator must be a highly competent ‘first-order educator’ (i.e. a good teacher) but also a skilled ‘second-order educator’ (i.e. capable of teaching effectively about the skill of teaching and facilitating others to acquire teaching skills). As first-order educators, they need to be proficient teachers (of 'adult' students). As second-order educators, they require, in addition, specific competences and dispositions, such as modelling and meta-reflection, that enable them to teach about teaching.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

The acquisition or improvement of teacher competences requires training, through which it will be improved educational planning and assessment. This results in a better learning of students, as evidences show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferretti &amp; Lovece|first=|date=2015|title=LA VALUTAZIONE FORMATIVA PER LA DIDATTICA DELLA MATEMATICA NELL’AMBITO DEL PROGETTO FAMT&amp;L.

Reaching this goal supposes to design training programs for teachers of mathematics, starting from identificating their needs, believes, expectations and the use of formative assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00413|title=Improvement of teachers’ competences. [Social Impact]. FAMT&amp;L. Formative Assessment for Mathematics' Teaching and Learning (2013-2016).|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Modelling=====
The way in which teacher educators teach has a greater impact on student teachers’ thinking about practice than what teacher educators teach.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, 1997 cited in Loughran J. and Berry A.: ‘Modelling by teacher educators’, Teaching and Teacher Education 21 (2005) 193–203&lt;/ref&gt; So, teacher educators need to be able to model the competences and attributes they wish their students to adopt.&lt;ref name="Loughran"&gt;Loughran and Berry 2005; Lunenberg M., Korthagen F. and Swennen A. (2007): ‘The teacher educator as a role model’, Teaching and Teacher Education 23 586–601; Davey, R. and Ham, V. (2011), ‘ ‘It’s all about paying attention!’ … but to what?’ in Bates et al.: ‘The Professional Development of teacher educators’, Routledge, London, 2011; pp 232-247
&lt;/ref&gt; Swennen et al. (2008).&lt;ref name="Swennen"&gt;Swennen, A., Lunenberg, M. and Korthagen, F. (2008): ‘Preach what you teach! Teacher educators and congruent teaching’, Teachers and Teaching: theory and practice, 14(5), 531–542&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that, in order to ‘model’ what they teach, teacher educators need to develop the ability to link their own (tacit) theories and practice of teaching to public theory, i.e., in Korthagen’s &lt;ref name="Korthagen"&gt;Korthagen FAJ, (2001), ‘Linking practice and theory: The pedagogy of realistic teacher education’. Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; words, to translate Theory with a capital ‘T’ to theory with a small ‘t’.

=====Meta-reflection=====
Just as teaching is no longer seen as simply transferring factual information, so educating teachers also requires a more sophisticated approach, based upon professional awareness&lt;ref name="Yaffe"&gt;see, for example: Yaffe E. and Maskit D, ‘Discussing pedagogical dilemmas with teacher educators …’ In Bates et al 'The Professional Development of teacher educators', Routledge, London, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; that comes from [[reflective practice]].&lt;ref name="Zachner"&gt;see for example Ken Zeichner 'Becoming a teacher educator: a personal perspective;'Teaching and Teacher Education 21 (2005) 117–124&lt;/ref&gt; For Loughran,&lt;ref name="Loughran2"&gt;Loughran J (2014) ‘Professionally Developing as a Teacher Educator’; Journal of Teacher Education 2014, Vol. 65(4) 271–283(2014)&lt;/ref&gt; being a professional teacher educator requires “genuinely reflecting on, and responding to, the needs, demands, and expectations of teaching about teaching within the academy”.

===Professional standards for teacher educators===
In some parts of the world (notably the United States, [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]]) specific standards of professional practice have been developed for, or by, teacher educators. These set out the range of competences that a member of the teacher educator profession is expected to be able to deploy, as well as the attitudes, values and behaviours that are deemed to be acceptable for membership of the profession).&lt;ref name="prof"&gt;See examples from United States: http://www.ate1.org/pubs/uploads/tchredstds0308.pdf and the Netherlands: http://www.lerarenopleider.nl/velon/beroepsstandaard/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy and legislation on the teacher educator profession===
While schools and school teachers are often in the news and in political debate, research shows that the teacher educator profession is largely absent from such public discussions and from policy discourse in Education &lt;ref name="Snoek et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Snoek, Swennen, vanderKlink |date=2009 |title=The teacher educator: A Neglected Factor in the Contemporary Debate on Teacher Education, |url= |journal=Advancing quality cultures for teacher education in Europe: tensions and opportunities. Umea University. |volume= |issue= |pages=288–299 |doi= |pmc= |pmid= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which often focuses exclusively on teachers and school leaders.

Some research suggests that, while most countries have policies, and legislation, in place concerning the teaching profession, few countries have a clear policy or strategy on the teacher educator profession. Caena (2012) &lt;ref name="Caena2"&gt;Caena F (2012) ‘Perspectives on Teacher Educator policies in European countries: an overview’ paper prepared for the European Commission conference ‘Education²: Policy support for Teacher Educators’; downloaded August 2013 at http://ec.europa.eu/education/school-education/teacher-educator_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; found that some of the consequences of this situation can include a teacher educator profession that is poorly organised, has low status or low formal recognition, has few regulations, professional standards - or even minimum qualifications, and no coherent approach to the selection, induction, or continuing professional development of Teacher Educators.

In India, the [[National_Council_for_Teacher_Education|National Council of Teacher Education]] (NCTE) released the '[[National_Curriculum_Framework_for_Teacher_Education|National Curricular Framework for Teacher Education]], 2010 (NCFTE), which aims to remedy many of the ills of teacher training in India. It calls for preparing a 'humane and reflective practitioner' and for fostering the agency and autonomy of the teacher, who can interpret the curriculum meaningfully to the contextual needs of the learners, than merely focus on 'teaching the text book'.

===Research into the teacher educator profession===

The teacher educator profession has also been seen as under-researched;&lt;ref name="Murray3"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murray J, Male T |date=2005 |title=Becoming a teacher educator: evidence from the field |url= |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=21 |issue= |pages=125–142 |doi= |pmc= |pmid= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; empirical research on professional practice is also scarce.&lt;ref name="Willemse"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Willemse M, Lunenberg M, Korthagen F |date=2005 |title=‘Values in education: a challenge for teacher educators’ |url= |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=21 |issue= |pages=205–217 |doi= |pmc= |pmid= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the importance of the quality of this profession for the quality of teaching and learning has been underlined by international bodies including the OECD and the European Commission. &lt;ref name="European Commission3"&gt;see, for example: European Commission (2012), 'Supporting the Teaching Professions for Better Learning Outcomes' retrieved January 2017 at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0374:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have therefore identified a need for more research into “what teachers of teachers themselves need to know”, and what institutional supports are needed to “meet the complex demands of preparing teachers for the 21st century.”&lt;ref name="Cochran"&gt;Cochran-Smith M (2003): ‘Learning and unlearning: the education of teacher educators’, Teaching and Teacher Education 19 (2003) 5–28)&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this perceived need, more research projects are now focussing on the teacher educator profession.&lt;ref name="infoted"&gt;For one example, see the InfoTED project at https://www.ntnu.edu/info-ted&lt;/ref&gt; Several academic journals cover this field.

'''UGENE''' is computer [[software]] for [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref name="OkonechGolFursov2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FursovNovikova2008"/&gt; It works on [[desktop computer]] operating systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], or [[Linux]]. It is released as [[free and open-source software]], under a [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) version 2.

UGENE helps biologists to analyze various [[Biology|biological]] [[genetics]] data, such as [[DNA sequencer|sequences]], annotations, [[multiple alignment]]s, [[phylogenetic tree]]s, [[Sequencing|NGS assemblies]], and others. The data can be stored both locally (on a personal computer) and on a shared storage (e.g., a lab database).

UGENE integrates dozens of well-known biological tools, algorithms, and original tools in the context of [[genomics]], [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary biology]], [[virology]], and other branches of life science. UGENE provides a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) for the pre-built tools so biologists with no [[computer programming]] skills can access those tools more easily.

Using UGENE Workflow Designer, it is possible to streamline a multi-step analysis. The workflow consists of blocks such as data readers, blocks executing embedded tools and algorithms, and data writers. Blocks can be created with command line tools or a script. A set of sample workflows is available in the Workflow Designer, to annotate sequences, convert data formats, analyze NGS data, etc.

Beside the graphical interface, UGENE also has a [[command-line interface]]. Workflows may also be executed thereby.

To improve performance, UGENE uses [[multi-core processor]]s (CPUs) and [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs) to optimize a few algorithms.&lt;ref name="FursovOshchepkov2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EfremovFursov2009" /&gt;

==Sequence View==
The Sequence View is used to visualize, analyze and modify [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleic acid]] or [[Protein sequence|protein]] sequences. Depending on the sequence type and the options selected, the following views can be present in the Sequence View window:
* [[Protein structure|3D structure]] view
* Circular view
* [[Chromatography|Chromatogram]] view
* Graphs View: GC-content, AG-content, and other
* [[Dot plot (bioinformatics)|Dot plot]] view

==Alignment Editor==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:UGENE-1.9.0-alignment editor.png|thumb|right|250px|Alignment Editor|250px]] --&gt;
The Alignment Editor allows working with multiple [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleic acid]] or [[Amino acid|protein]] sequences - [[Multiple alignment|aligning]] them, editing the alignment, analyzing it, storing the [[consensus sequence]], building a phylogenetic tree, and so on.

==Phylogenetic Tree Viewer==
The Phylogenetic Tree Viewer helps to visualize and edit phylogenetic trees. It is possible to synchronize a tree with the corresponding multiple alignment used to build the tree.

==Assembly Browser==
[[Image:Ugene-1.9.3-ab.png|thumb|right|250px|Assembly Browser|250px]]
The ''Assembly Browser'' project was started in 2010 as an entry for Illumina iDEA Challenge 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130126033841/http://www.illumina.com/idea Illumina iDEA Challenge 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The browser allows users to visualize and browse large (up to hundreds of millions of short reads) next generation sequence assemblies. It supports SAM,&lt;ref&gt;[http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf SAM]&lt;/ref&gt; BAM (the binary version of SAM), and ACE formats. Before browsing assembly data in UGENE, an input file is converted to a UGENE database file automatically. This approach has its pros and cons. The pros are that this allows viewing the whole assembly, navigating in it, and going to well-covered regions rapidly. The cons are that a conversion may take time for a large file, and needs enough disk space to store the database.

==Workflow Designer==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:UGENE-1.9.0-wd.png|thumb|right|250px|Workflow Designer|250px]] --&gt;
''UGENE Workflow Designer'' allows creating and running complex computational [[workflow]] schemas.&lt;ref name="FursovVarlamov2009"/&gt;

The distinguishing feature of Workflow Designer, relative to other [[Scientific workflow system|bioinformatics workflow management systems]] is that workflows are executed on a local computer. It helps to avoid data transfer issues, whereas other tools’ reliance on remote file storage and internet connectivity does not.

The elements that a workflow consists of correspond to the bulk of algorithms integrated into UGENE. Using Workflow Designer also allows creating custom workflow elements. The elements can be based on a command-line tool or a script.

Workflows are stored in a special text format. This allows their reuse, and transfer between users.

A workflow can be run using the graphical interface or launched from the command line. The graphical interface also allows controlling the workflow execution, storing the parameters, and so on.

There is an embedded library of workflow samples to convert, filter, and annotate data, with several pipelines to analyze NGS data developed in collaboration with NIH NIAID.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx NIH NIAID]&lt;/ref&gt; A wizard is available for each workflow sample.

==Supported biological data formats==
* [[Sequence (biology)|Sequence]]s and [[Annotation#Computational biology|annotation]]s: [[FASTA format|FASTA]] (.fa), [[GenBank]] (.gb), [[EMBL]] (.emb), [[General feature format|GFF]] (.gff)
* [[Multiple sequence alignment]]s: [[Clustal]] (.aln), MSF (.msf), [[Stockholm format|Stockholm]] (.sto), [[Nexus file|Nexus]] (.nex)
* [[Protein structure|3D structures]]: [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] (.pdb), [[Molecular Modeling Database|MMDB]] (.prt)&lt;ref name="MMDB" /&gt;
* [[Chromatogram]]s: ABIF (.abi), SCF (.scf)
* Short reads: Sequence Alignment/Map(SAM) (.sam), binary version of SAM (.bam), [[ACE file format|ACE]] (.ace), FASTQ (.fastq)
* [[Phylogenetic tree]]s: [[Newick format|Newick]] (.nwk), PHYLIP (.phy)
* Other formats: Bairoch ([[enzyme]]s info), HMM ([[HMMER]] profiles), PWM and PFM ([[Position-specific scoring matrix|position matrices]]), SNP and VCF4 (genome variations)

==Release cycle==
UGENE is primarily developed by Unipro LLC&lt;ref&gt;[http://unipro.ru/ Unipro LLC]&lt;/ref&gt; with headquarters in Akademgorodok of Novosibirsk, Russia. Each [[Iteration#Project management|iteration]] lasts about 1–2 months, followed by a new [[Software release life cycle|release]]. Development snapshots may also be downloaded.

The features to include in each release are mostly initiated by users.
