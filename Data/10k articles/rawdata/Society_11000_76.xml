[[File:Agraharam.jpg|right|thumb|An Agraharam from [[Tirunelveli]] assembled within the [[DakshinaChitra]] museum.]]
An '''''Agraharam''''' or '''''Agrahara''''' was a grant of land and royal income from it, typically by a king or a noble family, to religious purposes, particularly to [[Brahmin]]s to maintain temples in that land or a pilgrimage site and to sustain their families.&lt;ref name="Talbot2001p89"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cynthia Talbot|title=Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfAKljlCJq0C|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803123-9|pages=89, 161, 169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AA Macdonnell, [http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/macdonell_query.py?page=9 A practical Sanskrit dictionary with transliteration, accentuation, and etymological analysis throughout] London: Oxford University Press, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Agraharams were also known as '''Chaturvedimangalams''' in ancient times. They were also known as ghatoka, and boya.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The name originates from the fact that the agraharams have lines of houses on either side of the road and the  temple to the village god at the centre, thus resembling a garland around the temple. According to the traditional [[Hindu architecture|Hindu practice of architecture]] and town-planning, an agraharam is held to be two rows of houses running north-south on either side of a road at one end of which would be a temple to [[Shiva]] and at the other end, a temple to [[Vishnu]]. An example is [[Vadiveeswaram]] in Tamil Nadu.

With Brahmins taking up professions in urban areas and some migrating abroad agraharams are vanishing fast. Many of the traditional houses are giving way to concrete structures and commercial buildings.

== History ==

The earliest existing description of an ''agraharam'' has been found in a 3rd-century AD Sangam Age work called ''[[Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai]]''.&lt;ref name="srinivasaiyengar"&gt;{{cite book | title=History of the Tamils from the Earliest Times to 600 A. D.|author= P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar| authorlink= P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar | year=1929| publisher= | location=|pages=388–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The houses had in front of them, a shed with short legs to which were tied fat calves; the houses were washed with cowdung and had idols (inside them). Domestic fowl and dogs did not approach them. It was the village of the guardians of the Veda who teach its sounds to the parrots with the bent mouth. If you (bard) reach (the place), fair faced bangled ladies who are as chaste as (Arundhathi) the little star which shines in the north of the bright, broad sky, will after sunset feed you on the well-cooked rice named after the bird (explained by the commentator as the rice called ''irasanam'') along with slices of citron boiled in butter taken, from the buttermilk derived from red cows and scented with the leaves of the karuvembu, and mixed with pepper-powder, and the sweet-smelling tender fruit plucked from the tall mango tree and pickled&lt;ref name="srinivasaiyengar" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12163">[[File:Enfantin.png|thumb|right|Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin (1796–1864)]]
'''Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin''' (8 February 1796{{snd}}1 September 1864) was a [[France|French]] [[Reform movement|social reformer]], one of the founders of [[Saint-Simonianism]]. He was also a proponent of a [[Suez canal]].

== Early life ==
Enfantin was born in [[Paris]], the son of a banker of [[Dauphiné]]. After receiving his early education at a [[lyceum]], he was sent in 1813 to the [[École polytechnique]]. In March 1814 he was one of the band of students who, on the heights of [[Montmartre]] and [[Saint-Chaumont]], attempted resistance to the armies of the [[Sixth Coalition]] which had engaged in the invasion of Paris. In consequence of this outbreak of [[Patriotism|patriotic]] enthusiasm, the school was soon after closed by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], and the young student was compelled to seek another career.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

Initially, he began working for a country wine merchant, travelling to [[German Confederation|Germany]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. In 1821 he entered a banking-house newly established at [[Saint Petersburg]], but returned two years later to Paris, where he was appointed [[cashier]] to the ''[[Caisse Hypothécaire]]''. At the same time, he became a member of the [[secret society]] of the ''[[Carbonari]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

In 1825 a new turn was given to his thoughts and his life by the friendship which he formed with [[Olinde Rodriguez]], who introduced him to the [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Comte de Saint-Simon]]. He affiliated to Saint-Simon's version of [[utopian socialism]], and, by 1829, he had become one of the acknowledged heads of the [[Sectarianism|sect]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

== Preaching and politics ==
After the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 Enfantin resigned his office of cashier, and devoted all his energy to the cause. Besides contributing to ''[[Le Globe]]'', he made appeals to the people by systematic [[Sermon|preaching]], and organized centres of action in some of the main cities of France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

The headquarters in Paris were moved from the modest rooms in the Rue Taranne to the large halls near the [[Boulevard des Italiens]]. Enfantin and [[Amand Bazard]] were proclaimed ''Pères Suprêmes'' ("Supreme Fathers") – a union which was, however, only nominal, as a divergence was already manifest. Bazard, who concentrated on organizing the group, had devoted himself to political reform, while Enfantin, who favoured teaching and preaching, dedicated his time to social and moral change. The antagonism was widened by Enfantin's announcement of his theory of the relation of man and woman, which would substitute a system of "[[free love]]" for the "tyranny of [[marriage]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

Bazard and his disciples broke with Enfantin's group. The latter became sole "father", leading a chiefly religiously-oriented movement, joined by new converts (according to Enfantin's estimate, the total number of followers would have reached 40,000). He wore on his breast a badge with his title of ''Père'', was referred to by his preachers as "the living law", declared himself to be the [[Messiah|chosen of God]], and sent out emissaries in a quest of a woman predestined to be the "female Messiah," and the mother of a new [[Salvation|Saviour]] (the latter quest was very costly and altogether fruitless).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

== Success and repression ==
Meanwhile, the new religion gathered believers in all parts of [[Europe]]. His extravagances and success at length brought him to the attention of authorities, who argued that he was endangering [[public morality]] - Enfantin had announced that the gulf between the sexes was too wide and this social inequality would impede rapid growth of society. Enfantin called for the abolition of prostitution and for the ability for women to divorce and obtain legal rights. This was considered radical for the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=29|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1832 the halls of the new sect were closed by the government, and the ''Père'', with some of his followers, appeared before the tribunals. He then retired to his estate at [[Menilmontant]], near Paris, where with forty disciples, all of them men, he continued to carry out his socialist views. In August of the same year he was again arrested, and on his appearance in court he desired his defence to be undertaken by two women who were with him, alleging that the matter was of special concern to women; the request was promptly refused. The trial occupied two days and resulted in a verdict of guilty, and a sentence of imprisonment for a year with a small fine.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

This prosecution discredited the new society. Enfantin was released in a few months.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}} 

==Turkey and Egypt==
Then, accompanied by twenty of his followers, many of whom were also engineers from the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], including [[:fr:Charles Joseph Lambert|Charles Joseph Lambert]], also known as Lambert-Bey, and some women, he went first to [[Constantinople]]. Enfantin had declared 1933 the Year of the Mother, and upon arrival in Constantinople the group began to strongly preach their views about gender relations and New Christianity. The [[Ottoman Empire]] told them to leave to avoid prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=31|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enfantin and his group then arrived in [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egypt]], where he planned to penetrate the feminine [[Orient]] with the masculine [[Occident]] in a consumation of progression - build a canal connecting the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[Red Sea]]. In Egypt at that time, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], the Egyptian Viceroy, was at odds with the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, and also practiced public-private contracts known as concessions with mostly European companies to build cheap infrastructure. Ali did not agree to a project linking the two seas because he did not want to cut out the duties he collected from overland trade in Egypt, but did allow Enfantin's group to work on the [[Delta Barrage]] - a type of [[Barrage (dam)|dam]] - north of [[Cairo]] - with unpaid laborers - that would act to limit Nile flooding and create predictable crop yields. During his time in Egypt, Enfantine also established technical schools based on the Ecole Polytechnique model with Ali's blessing. Also in Egypt he encountered and influenced [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. Enfantine returned to France in 1836, lacking the patience to finish the Nile barrage project that was encountering delays.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|pp=31-37|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to France ==
[[File:Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin.jpg|thumb|left]]
On his return to France, he occupied minor offices. He became first a [[postmaster]] near [[Lyon]], and in 1841 was appointed, through the influence of some of his friends who had risen to posts of power, member of a scientific commission on [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], which led him to engage in researches concerning [[North Africa]] and [[French colonial empires|colonization]] in general.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=402-403}}

In 1845 he was appointed a director of the Paris &amp; Lyons [[Rail transport|railway]]. Three years later he established, in conjunction with Duveyrier, a daily journal, entitled ''Le Credit'', which was discontinued in 1850. He was afterwards attached to the administration of the railway from Lyons to the Mediterranean. 

==Société d'Études du Canal de Suez==
Father Enfantin held fast by his ideal to the end, but he had renounced the hope of giving it a local habitation and a name in the degenerate obstinate world. His personal influence over those who associated with him was immense. "He was a man of a noble presence, with finely formed and expressive features. He was gentle and insinuating in manner, and possessed a calm, graceful and winning delivery" (''Gent. M .'' Jan. 1865). His evident sincerity, his genuine enthusiasm, gave him his marvellous ascendancy. The [[Société d'Études du Canal de Suez]] was established by Enfantin in 1846 to continue study of the Suez Canal. Its members included [[François Barthélemy Arlès-Dufour|Arlès-Dufour]], Jules, Lon and [[Paulin Talabot]], the British [[Robert Stephenson]] and Edward Starbuck, the Austrian [[Alois Negrelli]], inspector of the [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway]], and Feronce and Sellier of Leipzig as representatives of the German interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/suezcanal032262mbp Wilson, Arnold T. (1939). ''The Suez Canal''. 2nd ed., London: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Société sent surveying teams to Egypt, developed engineering plans, determined that the elevation difference between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea was negligible, but Muhammad Ali was still reticent to the idea of a canal. Upon his death in 1848, the activities of the Société were minimized until his successor was assassinated in 1854 and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] took up the initiative to build a canal. Lessups had corresponded at least once with the Société in the intervening years and had known the new Egyptian viceroy, [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id]], when he was a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pp=58-61,65,70-71,76|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enfantin was listed by Lessups as a founder of the [[Suez Canal Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=2003|pp=81-82|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not a few of his disciples ranked afterwards amongst the most distinguished men of France. Enfantin died suddenly at Paris on September 1, 1864.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=403}}

== Literary works ==
Amongst his works are: ''Doctrine de Saint-Simon'' (written in conjunction with several of his followers), published in 1830, and several times republished; ''Economie politique et politique Saint-Simonienne'' (1831); ''{{lang|fr|Correspondance politique}}'' (1835–1840); ''Corresp. philos. et religieuse'' (1843–1845); and ''La Vie eternelle passee, presente, future'' (1861). A large number of articles by his hand appeared in ''Le Producteur'', ''L'Organisateur'', ''[[Le Globe]]'', and other periodicals. He also wrote in 1832 ''Le Livre nouveau'', intended as a substitute for the Christian Scriptures, but it was not published.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=403}}

'''Bube''', '''Bohobé''' or '''Bube–Benga''' (Bobe, Bubi), is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] or [[Bantoid language]] spoken by the [[Bubi people|Bubi]], a [[Bantu people]] native to, and once the primary inhabitants of, [[Bioko Island]] in [[Equatorial Guinea]]. The language was brought to Bioko from continental Africa more than three thousand years ago when the [[Bubi people|Bubi]] began arriving on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990903061913/http://www.equatorialguinea.org/event1390/event_show.htm?doc_id=2715  EquatorialGuinea.org; Retrieved 12/08/1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has around 50,000 speakers, with three variants: North, South and Central-East. It is noted for its [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] character and the divergence of words by gender. The language is also spoken by Bubi native to [[Gabon]] and [[Cameroon]].

The Bube language is divided into six different dialects that vary in the northern and southern regions of Bioko Island. For example, in the North, people speak ''Rebola'' and its variations: ''Basile'', ''Banapa'' and ''Basupa''. However, in the North-East, ''Bakake'' is spoken.

Bube is also spoken in a small area on the mainland closest to the island, where speakers are shifting to [[Wumboko language|Wumboko]].&lt;ref&gt;Harald Hammarström (2013) ''Review of the Ethnologue, 16th Ed.''&lt;/ref&gt; This has been reported as "Bube", "Bubia" or "Wovea" (see [[Wovea people]]).

The first Bube-to-English [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] was authored in 1875 by [[William Barleycorn]], a colonial era [[Primitive Methodist]] [[missionary]] of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandino]] descent, while he was serving in the Bubi village of [[Basupu]]. An official language dictionary and grammar guide was published by the ethnic Bubi scholar [[Justo Bolekia Boleká]].

== Other names==
Other names and forms of the name include Bubé, eVoové, eBubée, Bhubhi, Bubi, Ibubi, Ibhubhi, Pove and Eviia.

'''Buryat''' or '''Buriat'''&lt;ref name="e19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʊr|i|æ|t}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyrillic-derived alphabets#Buryat|Buryat Cyrillic]]: буряад хэлэн, ''buryaad xelen'') is a variety of the [[Mongolic languages]] spoken by the [[Buryats]] that is classified either as a language or major [[dialect]] group of [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]].

== Geographic distribution ==
[[File:Idioma_buriato.png|thumb|300px|Buryat language - Geographic distribution]]
The majority of Buryat speakers live in [[Russia]] along the northern border of [[Mongolia]] where it is an official language in the [[Buryat Republic]], [[Ust-Orda Buryat Autonomous Okrug|Ust-Orda Buryatia]] and [[Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug|Aga Buryatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Skribnik 2003: 102, 105&lt;/ref&gt; In the Russian census of 2002, 353,113 people out of an ethnic population of 445,175 reported speaking Buryat (72.3%). Some other 15,694 can also speak Buryat, mostly ethnic Russians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russian Census (2002)]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least 100,000 ethnic Buryats in [[Mongolia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;Skribnik 2003: 102&lt;/ref&gt; Buryats in Russia have a separate [[literary language|literary standard]], written in a [[Cyrillic alphabets#Buryat|Cyrillic alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;Skribnik 2003: 105&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the Russian alphabet with three additional letters: [[Ue (Cyrillic)|Ү/ү]], [[Oe (Cyrillic)|Ө/ө]] and [[Һ|Һ/һ]].

==Dialects==

The delimitation of Buryat mostly concerns its relationship to its immediate neighbors, Mongolian proper and Khamnigan. While Khamnigan is sometimes regarded as a dialect of Buryat, this is not supported by [[isoglosses]]. The same holds for Tsongol and Sartul dialects, which rather group with [[Khalkha Mongolian]] to which they historically belong. Buryat dialects are:

* Khori group east of Lake Baikal comprising Khori, Aga, Tugnui, and North Selenga dialects. Khori is also spoken by most Buryats in Mongolia and a few speakers in [[Hulunbuir]].
* Lower Uda (Nizhneudinsk) dialect, the dialect situated furthest to the west and which shows the strongest influence by [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]
* Alar–Tunka group comprising Alar, Tunka–Oka, Zakamna, and Unga in the southwest of [[Lake Baikal]] in the case of Tunka also in Mongolia.
* Ekhirit–Bulagat group in the Ust’-Orda National District comprising Ekhirit–Bulagat, Bokhan, Ol’khon, Barguzin, and Baikal–Kudara
* Bargut group in Hulunbuir (which is historically known as Barga), comprising Old Bargut and New Bargut&lt;ref&gt;Skribnik 2003: 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on loan vocabulary, a division might be drawn between Russia Buriat, Mongolia Buriat and China Buriat.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (ed.) 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the influence of Russian is much stronger in the dialects traditionally spoken west of Lake Baikal, a division might rather be drawn between the Khori and Bargut group on the one hand and the other three groups on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;Skribnik 2003: 102, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

Buryat has the [[vowel]] [[phoneme]]s /i, ɯ, e, a, u, ʊ, o, ɔ/ (plus a few diphthongs),&lt;ref&gt;Poppe 1960: 8&lt;/ref&gt; short /e/ being realized as [ɯ], and the [[consonant]] phonemes /b, g, d, tʰ, m, n, x, l, r/ (each with a corresponding [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] phoneme) and /s, ʃ, z, ʒ, h, j/.&lt;ref&gt;Svantesson, Tsendina and Karlsson 2008, &lt;abbr&gt;p.&lt;/abbr&gt; 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Svantesson et al. 2005: 146; the status of [ŋ] is problematic, see Skribnik 2003: 107. In Poppe 1960's description, places of vowel articulation are somewhat more fronted.&lt;/ref&gt; These vowels are restricted in their occurrence according to [[vowel harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;Skribnik 2003: 107&lt;/ref&gt; The basic syllable structure is (C)V(C) in careful articulation, but word-final CC clusters may occur in more rapid speech if short vowels of non-initial syllables get dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Poppe 1960: 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress===

Lexical [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] (word accent) falls on the last [[Syllable weight|heavy]] nonfinal [[syllable]] when one exists. Otherwise, it falls on the word-final heavy syllable when one exists. If there are no heavy syllables, then the initial syllable is stressed. Heavy syllables without primary stress receive [[secondary stress]]:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Walker 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Secondary stress may also occur on word-initial [[Syllable weight|light]] syllables without primary stress, but further research is required. The stress pattern is the same as in [[Khalkha Mongolian]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Grammar ==
Buryat is an [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] language that makes exclusive use of [[postpositions]]. Buryat is equipped with eight grammatical cases:
[[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[Instrumental_case|instrumental]], [[ablative]], [[comitative]], [[dative]]-[[locative]] and a particular oblique form of the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparent.com/learn-buriat/overview.html |title=Overview of the Buriat Language |work=Learn the Buriat Language &amp; Culture |publisher=Transparent Language |accessdate=4 Nov 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Castlemorton Common Festival''' was a week-long [[free party|free festival]] and [[rave]] held in the [[Malvern Hills (district)|Malvern Hills]] near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]], [[England]] between 22nd–29th May 1992.&lt;ref name="lynskey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/castlemorton-triggers-rave-crackdown| title=Castlemorton triggers the rave crackdown| author= Lynskey, Dorian | work=The Guardian| date= 15 June 2011| accessdate= 26 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The media interest and controversy surrounding the festival, and concerns as to the way it was policed, inspired the legislation that would eventually became the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].&lt;ref name="fielding page 113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-39960232|title= Castlemorton Common: The rave that changed the law |last= Chester| first= Jerry |date= 28 May 2017|publisher= BBC News | accessdate= 28 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
In May 1992 [[Avon and Somerset Constabulary|Avon and Somerset Police]] tried to end the annual Avon Free Festival, which had been held in the [[Bristol]] area around the May [[Bank Holiday]] for several years.&lt;ref name="mckay page 120"&gt;McKay, G. (1996) ''Senseless Acts of Beauty: Cultures of Resistance'', Page 120, Verso {{ISBN|1-85984-908-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, hundreds of [[new age travellers]] en-route to the area for the expected festival were shunted into neighbouring counties by Avon and Somerset’s Operation Nomad police manoeuvres, with [[West Mercia Police]] deciding to confine them to common land at [[Castlemorton]].&lt;ref name="lynskey"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rave===
The high-profile coverage in the national media only served to swell the crowd further as ravers from far afield made their way to join the festival, thus making it an impossible task for the authorities to close the event down.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 20,000-40,000 people gathered on Castlemorton Common for the party which lasted a full week, the biggest of its kind since the [[Stonehenge Free Festival]] in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="page 131 During"&gt;During, S. (2005) ''Cultural Studies: A Critical Introduction'', Page 131, Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-24656-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Castlemorton hosted many of the large [[Sound system (DJ)|sound systems]] of the time such as [[Bedlam sound system|Bedlam]], Circus Warp, [[Spiral Tribe]] and [[DiY Sound System]], and bands such as [[Back To The Planet]], Xenophobia (fronted by Spiral Tribe's MC Skallywag), [[AOS3]] and [[Poisoned Electrick Head]].&lt;ref name="djmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://djmag.com/content/free-party-politics-castle-morton | title=Free Party Politics: Castle Morton|author=Whitehurst, Andrew|work=DJ Mag | date= 28 March 2014 | accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Carney page 141"&gt;Carney, B. (2010) ''Take Your Protein Pills...'', Page 141, Lulu {{ISBN|978-1-4452-6411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Reynolds wrote that "during the next five days of its existence, Castlemorton will inspire questions in Parliament, make the front page of every newspaper in England and incite nationwide panic about the whereabouts of the next destination on the crusty itinerary." &lt;ref name="reynolds"&gt;Reynolds, S. (1998) ''Energy Flash'', Pages   135-140, Picador {{ISBN|0-5712-8914-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The then local [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] [[Michael Spicer]], speaking in a [[House of Commons]] debate remarked: "The invasion that took place at Castlemorton common in my constituency, on Friday 22 May, has prompted me to do so again. On that day, new age travellers, ravers and drugs racketeers arrived at a strength of two motorised army divisions, complete with several massed bands and, above all, a highly sophisticated command and signals system. However, they failed to bring latrines. The numbers, speed and efficiency with which they arrived--amounting at one time to as many as 30,000 people--combined to terrorise the local community to the extent that some residents had to undergo psychiatric treatment in the days that followed. Such an incident must never happen again, in my constituency or elsewhere. We need tighter laws, especially to give banning powers to the police ; a Cabinet Committee to bring responsible Departments together ; quicker and more co-ordinated police action ; and a more effective application of existing policies by national and local authorities".&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{cite hansard | house=House of Commons |date = 29 June 1992 |volume=6, 210|column = 688}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Aftermath===
Thirteen members of [[Spiral Tribe]] were arrested after the event, and charged with public order offences. After a lengthy and costly trial, they were acquitted.&lt;ref name="lynskey"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the festival and the way in which it was policed inspired the legislation which developed into the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].&lt;ref name="fielding page 113"&gt;Fielding, N. (2005) ''The Police and Social Conflict'', Page 113, Routledge Cavendish {{ISBN|1-904385-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This wide-ranging Act effectively made illegal such outdoor parties that played music, which was defined in section 63(1)(b) to include "sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats."

Whilst some have argued that Castlemorton, with its attendant publicity, led directly to the Criminal Justice Act and was the "final nail in the coffin of the unlicensed event",&lt;ref&gt;ed. South N. (1999) ''Drugs: Cultures, Controls and Everyday Life'', Page 30, SAGE Publications {{ISBN|0-7619-5235-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; others have seen the Act as a draconian piece of legislation which was "explicitly aimed at suppressing the activities of certain strands of alternative culture".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert J. (1999) ''Discographies: Dance Music, Culture, and the Politics of Sound'', Page 150, Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-17032-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2314">[[File:Historical map of the Casuari in the time of Ptolemy.png|thumb|This is a map of where roughly the ancient Germanic tribe the Casuari lived as described by Ptolemy.]]
The '''Casuari''' were an ancient Germanic people. [[Ptolemy]] mentions them as living on the southern border of Germany, east of the Abnoba mountains, that are east of the Rhine. They were therefore neighbours of the [[Tencteri]], a tribe living between the Rhine and the Abnoba mountains. Their origins can be traced back to those of the [[Alemanni]] and Khatti, they descend from Assyrian tribes who migrated into Europe to settle. Ptolemy also mentions them as having founded the town of Suevos Casuari. The Casuari were most likely numerous during and around the time of Ptolemy, which is around 90 to 168 AD. Being a small tribe, very little remains of them, and most evidence comes from written sources.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OlA1BGEV3QwC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=casuari+germanic+tribe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lf5m-PNam3&amp;sig=83f7yBM9V9UMMpvysmafMXmB8_c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=32C5VPKOLcvV7QbnrIHIBg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=casuari%20germanic%20tribe&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/10/limited.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

The Casuari spoke a [[South Germanic]] dialect, related to the High, or Upper Germanic languages. The location of their tribe was in fact a crossroad between the [[Weser-Rhine Germanic]] and [[Elbe Germanic]] languages. If so, their language originated from the Rhine, Alps, Elba or the North Sea from Friesland to Jutland.

==Fall of the Western Roman Empire==

By the time of the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the Casuari had most probably been conquered by the Romans, or had either become part of the Alemanni or another major Germanic tribe on the Rhine river.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/rome4/section3.rhtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''census in Malaysia''', or officially, the '''Population and Housing Census''', is a descriptive count of everyone who is in [[Malaysia]] on the [[Census Day]], and of their [[dwellings]]. The decennial Malaysian census has been conducted six times, As of 2010. It has been conducted every 10 years, beginning in 1960.

==Overview==
The decennial publication provides users with the final Malaysian Census population figures for basic demographic characteristics such as gender, age distribution, ethnic group, citizenship, religion and marital status at the state and the administrative district levels. Some of the tables also provide a breakdown by urban and rural areas.

Malaysia consists of thirteen [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|states and three federal territories]]. Each state is divided into several [[Districts of Malaysia|administrative districts]]. In Kelantan, the administrative district is known as "Jajahan". Each state is also stratified into urban and rural areas. Urban and rural areas are not legally defined administrative areas but are statistically defined to distinguish areas with certain socio-economic characteristics.

==Data source==
The data in the decennial publication represent final Malaysian Census population figures for respective decades. As in censuses in most other countries, the information obtained during enumeration is subject to coverage and content errors. In term of coverage errors, part of living quarters, households or population maybe left out, erronerously included or duplicated. Content errors in particular were based on erronerous responses on gender, age, ethnic group, citizenship, religion and marital status. As a result, the figures were "adjusted" based on the estimates of under-enumeration derived from the Census Coverage Evaluation Survey.

==Census approach==
As of Census 2010, a multi-modal data collection data method was used as follows:
* Face to face interview
** The enumerator will visit every living quarters to interview and obtain the individual's information.
* Self enumeration
** Drop-off and pick-up (DOPU)
*** The enumerator will drop-off the Census Kit containing a [[questionnaire]] and related documents. The questionnaire should be completed by the respondent and the enumerator will pick-up the duly completed questionnaire upon on agreed date and time.
** e-Census
*** The respondent will complete the questionnaire online via the website www.statistic.com.my. The identification particulars are provided in the Census Kit to enable respondent to access e-Census.

Two types of census questionnaires were used. The first questionnaire for persons living in private living quarters, whilst the second questionnaire was for persons living in collective living quarters such as college or university hostels, charitable or social welfare institutions, prisons and homeless persons.

==Census coverage==

==Concepts and definitions==

===Urban areas===
Urban areas adopted by the previous censuses refer to gazetted local council areas with a specified population threshold. The urban areas in Census 1980 refers to a gazetted area with population of 10,000 persons or more.

Urban areas in Census 1991 and 2000, were defined as gazetted areas with their adjoining built-up areas which had a combined population of 10,000 or more. Built-up areas were defined as areas contiguous to a gazetted area and had at least 60 per cent of their population (aged 10 and above) engaged in non-agricultural activities as well as having modern toilet facilities in their housing units. The definition of urban areas for Census 2000 also takes into account the special development area namely development area which is not gazetted and can be identified and separated from the gazetted area or built-up area of more than 5&amp;nbsp;km and a population of at least 10,000 with 60 per cent of their population (aged 10 and above) engaged in non-agricultural activities as well as having modern toilet facilities in their housing units.

Meanwhile, urban areas in Census 2010, were defined as:
{{quote|Gazetted areas with their adjoining built-up areas which had a combined population of 10,000 or more. Built-up areas were defined as areas contiguous to a gazetted areas and had at least 60 per cent of their population (aged 15 years and above) engaged in non-agricultural activities. The definition of urban areas also takes into account the special development area namely development area which is not gazetted and can be identified and separated from the gazetted area or built-up area of more than 5 km and a population of at least 10,000 with 60 per cent of their population (aged 15 and above) engaged in non-agricultural activities as well as having modern toilet facilities in their housing units.}}

Urbanisation is a dynamic process and keeps changing with development and growth. Thus, the urban areas for 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010 Censuses do not necessarily refer to the same areas, as areas fulfilling the above criteria of urban continue to expand and grow.

===Ethnic groups and citizenship===
Classification of 2010 Census ethnic group is as set by Inter-Agency Technical Committee (IATC) in Appendix 1. IATC is a committee formed to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation and use of standardised codes, classifications and definitions used by the Department of Statistics, Malaysia and other government agencies. For the purpose of tabulation and analysis, as well as taking into account the diverse ethnic group in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Federal Territory of Labuan and Sarawak, major ethnic groups according to region as follows:

The '''Centre for Social Investigation''' ('''CSI''') is an [[interdisciplinary]] research group based at [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], in [[England]].

The CSI is led by Professor [[Anthony Heath]], CBE, FBA, Emeritus Professor of [[Sociology]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and Professor of Sociology at [[University of Manchester|The University of Manchester]]. It was launched officially in March 2015. The Centre aims to address contemporary [[social issues]] of [[public interest]], carrying out authoritative, research on central social issues which draws upon interdisciplinary expertise &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/study%20here/Pages/Interdisciplinary%20studies.aspx|title=Interdisciplinary studies - Nuffield College, University of Oxford|website=Ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in economics, politics and sociology and related disciplines such as social policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk/?page_id=6|title=About CSI|website=Ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular focus is on examining social progress in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk/?page_id=11|title=Social progress in Britain|website=Ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to this aim, the Centre has undertaken research covering topics including crime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CSI_4_Crime.pdf |format=PDF |title=CSI 4 : Is crime really falling?

CSI's research is independent and non-partisan; as such, it has no political affiliation or leaning.{{fact|date=December 2015}} The Centre is counselled by an advisory board whose members work in research, policy and the private sector.

In [[baseball]], '''charging the mound''' is an assault by a [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] against the [[pitcher]], usually the result of being [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] or nearly being hit by a pitch, such as a [[brushback pitch|brushback]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/mlb/charging-the-mound.aspx|title=Charging the Mound Definition - Sporting Charts|website=www.sportingcharts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first incidence of a professional charging of the mound has not been identified, but the practice dates back to the game's early days. Charging the mound is the most common initiator of a [[bench-clearing brawl]].

Before charging, the batter usually throws his [[Baseball bat|bat]] and [[Batting helmet|helmet]] aside so that he may face the pitcher unarmed (it is a very serious breach of baseball [[etiquette]], not to mention dangerous, for the batter to charge the mound with a bat). Though serious injuries have occurred from charging in the past, usually fights are either broken up or joined by all other players so the conflict turns into posturing and name-calling; in baseball parlance, this is known as a [[wikt:rhubarb|rhubarb]].

Charging the mound is typically about responding to an indignity rather than an attempt to injure the pitcher. There is long-standing etiquette in baseball regarding what is an acceptable offense to warrant a [[Beanball|beaning]], and there are similar "unwritten rules" for charging in response to being hit.  While these unwritten rules have become more vague, the response of [[Major League Baseball]] to the incidents has become far more strict. Whereas suspensions in the past were rare and usually short, [[Commissioner]] [[Fay Vincent]] and his successor [[Bud Selig]] reacted harshly to both instances of beaning and charging during their respective tenures.  Recently, most incidents which have caused the benches to clear have been met with large fines and lengthy suspensions.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In Japan, pitchers tip their cap to a batter hit by a pitch if it was not their intent to hit the batter to avoid a mound charging incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1987/04/13/106777648/no-tip-of-the-hat-from-this-japanese-pitcher|title=NO TIP OF THE HAT FROM THIS JAPANESE PITCHER|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=NO TIP OF THE HAT FROM THIS JAPANESE PITCHER|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|date=|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese|t=鬥蟋蟀|s=斗蟋蟀|p=dòu xīshuài}}

'''Cricket fighting''' is a [[blood sport]] involving the fighting of male [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/0904/fo8-1.html Cricket matches - Chinese style] Xu Xiaomin ''Shanghai Star''. 2003-09-04&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CTV"&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20111010/cricket-fighting-loses-popularity-in-china-111011/ CTV: Ancient sport of cricket fighting loses popularity in China]&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike most blood sports such as [[bullfighting]] and [[cockfighting]], cricket fighting rarely causes injuries to the animals.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/world/asia/chirps-and-cheers-chinas-crickets-clash-and-bets-are-made.html |title=Chirps and Cheers: China’s Crickets Clash |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular pastime in [[China]] and dates back more than 1,000 years to the [[Tang Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; However, the sport has been losing its popularity in China.&lt;ref name="CTV"/&gt;

==History==
Cricket fighting was nurtured by [[Tang Dynasty]] emperors more than 1,000 years ago, and later popularized by commoners.  In the thirteenth century, the [[Southern Song Dynasty]] prime minister [[Jia Sidao]] wrote a how-to guide for the blood sport.  Jia's obsession with cricket fighting is believed to have contributed to the fall of the empire.  During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976) China's Communist government banned cricket fighting as a bourgeois predilection, but it is now undergoing a revival among a younger generation eager to embrace genuinely Chinese pastimes.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[Image:Cricket-Coffin.png|right|thumb|A coffin for a prized and loved  cricket on display at the [[Museum of Macau]]]]
Many famous hotels around Macau hold cricket fights where bets up to thousands of [[Macanese pataca|patacas]] would be waged on a single fight.  Prized crickets become famous and actual funeral services would be held for them.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Cricket season begins in summer and championships take place after the [[autumn equinox]] in late September.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In [[Beijing]], the Association for Cricket Fighting organizes cricket fighting events and championships.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

While it is illegal in China to gamble on cricket fights,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/16/cricket_fighting_ring HK feds bust illegal cricket fighting ring]&lt;/ref&gt; the fights themselves are legal and occur in most big cities in China. Crickets are sold openly in street markets, with more than a dozen cricket markets in [[Shanghai]] alone.  In 2010 more than 400 million yuan (US$63 million) were spent in China on crickets.

==Care and breeding==
The best crickets are from a few counties in northeastern [[Shandong Province]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Crickets have pedigrees and would be carefully bred by knowledgeable keepers.  Each cricket must be kept in its own clay pot and their diets include ground shrimp, red beans, goat liver, and maggots.  Before fight night, female crickets are dropped in the pot to increase the male's fighting spirit.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Flight and anger==

When both crickets are sufficiently agitated, a divider separating the pair will be lifted, and the two crickets will begin the match. The loser is the cricket that first begins avoiding contact, runs away from battle, stops chirping, or is thrown from the fighting container.

The '''Daingnet people''' ({{lang-my|ဒိုင်းနက်လူမျိုး}}), also known as the '''Thetkama people''' ({{lang-my|သက္ကမ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://burmese.dvb.no/archives/247045|title=သက္ကမ (ဒိုင်းနက်) တိုင်ရင်းသားများ အမျိုးသားနေ့ ကျင်းပ |website=burmese.dvb.no|language=my|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; are an [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]] indigenous to northern [[Rakhine State]], [[Myanmar]]. According to their own internal census in 1995 they numbered about 60,000. In 2011, the number is estimated to be around 80,000. From appearance they are indistinguishable from the [[Rakhine people]]; however, the Daingnet people have a distinct language and culture. Ethnically, they are closely related to the [[Chakma people]] of Bangladesh and Northeast India. The languages of the Daingnet and Chakma people are mutually intelligible. Daingnet people are one of 135 ethnic groups officially recognized by the [[Myanmar government]] as indigenous to [[Myanmar]]. Daingnets are one of the Tibeto-Burman tribes. Genetically they are closely related to the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Burman people|Burmans]] and [[Rakhine people|Rakhines]].

== Etymology ==
Daingnets do not call themselves ''Daingnet''; instead they call themselves ''Thaikhma'' like the nearby [[Chakma people]] of [[Bangladesh]] and [[Northeast India]]. They are believed to have originated from greater Arakan Yoma North, presently [[Chin State]] (previously Sak Buddhist homeland "Chacomas", occupied by Zo people from [[Lushai Hills]]). Daingnet is an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] originally used by [[Rakhine people]]. In [[Arakanese language|Rakhine language]], Daingnet means "shield warriors" or "armored warriors". Centuries ago the Rakhine kings hired the Daingnets as soldiers and they showed their mastery with shield and sword. The Daingnets no longer fight with shield and sword, but the name Daingnet stuck''.''

== History ==
Daingnets are indigenous to Rakhine State. They were among the first people who settled in northern Rakhine State. During [[British rule in Burma]], the Daingnets were classified as Sak people. ''Sak'' is a generic term used by the [[Bamar people|Bamar]] and Rakhine peoples to denote the [[Chakma people]].

In the spring of 1798, British explorer Francis Buchanan visited [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], he asked a Chakma man if they were the same as ''Sak'' people in Rakhine State. The man replied, the ''Saks'' of Rakhine State were ''Moishang Saks''.&lt;ref name=Buchanan&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Francis|title=Francis Buchanan in Southeast Bengal|year=1992|publisher=Dhaka University Press|location=|isbn=984-05-1192-0|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rakhine language ''Moishang'' means primary or superior. What the man meant was, the Saks of Rakhine State retained the original Chakma language. Though Francis Buchanan did not visit Rakhine State he was aware of the ''Sak'' people from his earlier visit to [[Cox's Bazar]]. He might have heard about them from the [[East India Company]] officials or the Rakhine refugees who were pouring into [[Cox's Bazar]] to flee Burma-Rakhine conflict.

According to Burmese historian [[Gordon Luce]], the ''Saks'' (i.e. ancestors of the Daingnets) attained higher cultural level than any other minority peoples in Arakan. They were the smelters of iron, the distillers of spirits, the makers of earthen vessels, manufacturers of salt, builders of boats etc.&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=Pamela|title=Ancient Arakan|year=1976|publisher=Australian National University Press|location=|isbn=|pages=13}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
The Daingnet people are found in and around [[Maungdaw]], [[Buthidaung]], [[Kyauktaw]], [[Paletwa Township|Paletwa]] and [[Mrauk-U]]. Many Daingnets also live in the [[Arakan Yoma]] mountains, close to the [[Chin state]] and [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]].

== Culture ==
The Daingnets are culturally similar to the [[Chakma people|Chakmas]] and [[Rakhine people|Rakhines]] in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Northeast India]]. Rice, fish and vegetables are their favorite foods. They prefer hot food. Daingnet people consider cow as a sacred animal and as such they do not eat beef. Men sport ''lungi'' and women sport sarong ([[Pinuin]]) like dress ''thami''. Usually men do the agricultural work and women look after children and cook for the family. They usually like to settle near rivers. Some of them also live in mountains whose livelihood is [[slash and burn]] cultivation. Daingnet people usually marry early, but never before the age of 17.

Their original language was [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]. Due to prolonged interaction with the [[Assamese language]], their language gradually became a mix of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]. Majority of the Daingnets are multi-lingual. Apart from their own [[Chakma language]], they can speak [[Rakhine language|Rakhine]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and in [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]] (a dialect of [[Bengali language|Bengali]]).

== Religion ==
Daingnets are followers of [[Theravada Buddhism]] and for centuries the Daingnets have strictly adhered to its teachings.&lt;ref name=Hattaway&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattaway|first=Paul|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World|year=2004|publisher=Authentic Media|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1-903689-90-2|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost every village has a Buddhist temple. A Daingnet male at least once in his lifetime becomes a Buddhist monk. However most of them do not remain Buddhist monks for life. Wedding and funeral ceremonies are performed by Buddhist monks. Besides wedding and funeral, the Daingnet people flock to Buddhist temples on major Buddhist festivals which usually fall on full moon days.

== Economy ==
Majority of the Daingnets are farmers. Some of them are traders. Their economy is highly dependent on agriculture and hence vulnerable to weather pattern. However, due to lack of economic development there is widespread poverty among the Daingnets.&lt;ref name=Diran&gt;{{cite book|last=Diran|first=Richard K.|title=Vanishing Tribes of Burma|year=1997|publisher=Amphoto Books-Random House|location=|isbn=0-8174-5559-0|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious conviction of [[Buddhism]] forbids them to work as fishermen or butchers. There are 2 kinds of farmers among the Daingnets, those who farm land on permanent basis and those who farm hills and mountains by [[slash and burn]] or [[shifting cultivation]] technique.

The evidence raises suspicion; in some instances quite strong suspicion. But discreditable conduct does not prove guilt, and suspicion, even strong suspicion, falls well short of proof beyond reasonable doubt."&lt;ref name=full_judgment/&gt; The Judgment Summary further explained: "Evidence concerning such conduct was not admitted to show that the accused is a person of bad character. The fact that the accused engaged in discreditable conduct and could, therefore, be viewed as a person of bad character, cannot be used to reason that the accused is the type of person who might kill his wife, or that by reason of his bad character he is likely to have killed her.

An appeal by prosecutors against the verdict was held in the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] in August 2013, before three judges brought in from other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-05/names-of-judges-revealed-for-rayney-appeal/4866218?section=wa|title=Prosecutors appealing Lloyd Rayney's murder acquittal want a retrial|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution, if granted leave to appeal, proposed to rely on the grounds that the trial judge's findings in relation to motive were not supported by the facts his Honour found in relation to the respective attitudes of the respondent and the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jade.io/article/302686] ''The State of Western Australia v Rayney'' [2013] WASCA 219, [7].&lt;/ref&gt; The judges unanimously dismissed the appeal, and upheld the trial judge's verdict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://decisions.justice.wa.gov.au/supreme/supdcsn.nsf/PDFJudgments-WebVw/2013WASCA0219/%24FILE/2013WASCA0219.pdf The State Of Western Australia -v- Rayney (2013) Wasca 219 (Appeal judgment)] at [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]], delivered 23 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://decisions.justice.wa.gov.au/supreme/supdcsn.nsf/PDFJudgments-WebVw/2013WASCA0219A/%24FILE/2013WASCA0219A.pdf Appeal Judgment Summary] at [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]], delivered 23 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kaitlyn|last=Offer|url=http://perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/prosecution-appeal-decision-looms-for-lloyd-rayney/story-fnhocxo3-1226724421937|title=Case dismissed: no retrial for Lloyd Rayney|newspaper=[[Perth Now|Sunday Times]]|date=23 September 2013|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-23/appeal-judges-deliver-verdict-in-appeal-against-rayney27s-acqu/4975132|title=Court dismisses appeal against acquittal of Lloyd Rayney over murder of wife Corryn|publisher=ABC News|date=23 September 2013|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office of the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (New South Wales)|NSW Director of Public Prosecutions]], which ran the case, announced on 18 October 2013 that it would not be seeking a further appeal to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].&lt;ref name=caseclosed&gt;{{cite news|author = Christiana Jones|title = Case closed for Rayney over murder|newspaper = [[The West Australian|The Weekend West]]| page=15|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Mr Rayney indicated interest {{citation needed|reason=Cite your source of indicated interest|date=May 2015}} in whether there would be consequences for "police who the trial judge said gave misleading evidence, pressured a forensic pathologist to change his report, abused their position of authority and behaved reprehensibly".

An investigation by the Western Australian [[Corruption and Crime Commission]] later cleared two police officers of "any serious misconduct" after their behaviour in threatening a female lawyer had been described as ranging from "inappropriate to reprehensible" by the trial judge. A second matter reviewed by the CCC related to "attempts by a third officer to encourage an independent pathologist involved in the case to change a report to better fit police evidence. That officer was found to have acted unreasonably."&lt;ref&gt;"Watchdog clears Rayney cops", ''[[The West Australian]]'', 1 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Rayney was acquitted of two charges of tapping his own residential telephone line.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Menagh. "[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-07/lloyd-rayney-cleared-after-phone-tapping-trial/6452294 Lloyd Rayney, former Perth barrister, cleared of phone tapping charges]."

"Rayney back in court." ''[[The West Australian]]'', 21 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Rayney's licence was cancelled by the Legal Practice Board, stripping him of his right to practise law in WA. This action resulted from a finding by a magistrate that he had breached the Surveillance Devices Act by taping conversations with Corryn Rayney, then deliberately disposing of the recording devices when he knew the police had a warrant to search for them.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Clarke. "Lloyd Rayney law licence cancelled". ''[[The West Australian]]'', 5 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, Rayney was cleared by the State Administrative Tribunal of the alleged "unlawful destruction of evidence and/or an attempt to pervert the course of justice" and his right to practise was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Campbell. [http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/state-administrative-tribunal-hands-down-decision-on-lloyd-rayneys-legal-career/news-story/60b521dc259c3b10a4212a9ea21bc1c7 State Administrative Tribunal hands down decision on Lloyd Rayney's legal career] ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times]]'', 10 February 2016.

"Rayney returns to win meth case" ''[[The West Australian]]'', 18 March 2016, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls for new investigation==
In his judgment summary, Justice Martin noted that police and forensic evidence was consistent with a sexual attack on Mrs Rayney,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see Full Judgment, paragraphs 1454–59,1580–81,1588–90.&lt;/ref&gt; while defence lawyers identified at least two possible criminals who "should have been investigated with as much rigour as Mr Rayney".&lt;ref name=hickey31aug&gt;P. Hickey; Emily Moulton. "New charges strengthen case for review", ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times]]'', 31 August 2014, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In a prime-time TV presentation on 21 August 2014 that was dismissed by Attorney General [[Michael Mischin]] as "infotainment that is one-sided", Rayney, backed by senior lawyers and a forensic scientist, spoke out for the first time and called for independent investigators to re-examine the unsolved case.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Moulton.

The '''demographics of [[Sierra Leone]]''' are made up of an indigenous population from 18 ethnic groups. The [[Temne people|Temne]] in the north and the [[Mende people|Mende]] in the South are the largest. About 60,000 are [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Krio]], the descendants of freed slaves who returned to Sierra Leone from [[Great Britain]], [[North America]] and [[Slavery|slave]] ships captured on the high seas. In addition, about 5,000 [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], 1,000 [[India]]ns, and 5,000 [[Europe]]ans reside in the country.

In the past, some Sierra Leoneans were noted for their [[education]]al achievements, trading activity, entrepreneurial skills, and arts and crafts work, particularly [[wood carving|woodcarving]]. Many are part of larger ethnic networks extending into several countries, which link West African states in the area. Their level of education and [[infrastructure]] have declined sharply over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name="statedept"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5475.htm |title=Sierra Leone (02/08) |accessdate=2008-02-17 |work="U.S. Department of State" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-ethnic tensions escalated in [[Bhutan]], resulting in the flight of many [[Lhotshampa]], or ethnic [[Nepal]]is, from Bhutan to Nepal, many of whom were expelled by the Bhutanese military. By 1996, over 100,000 [[Bhutanese refugees]] were living in refugee camps in Nepal.

'''Freedom Day''' ({{lang-be|Дзень Волі}}) is an unofficial holiday in [[Belarus]], which is celebrated on March 25 to commemorate the creation of the [[Belarusian Democratic Republic]] on that date in 1918.

[[File:DzenVoli2007.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Freedom Day'' celebration rally held by the Belarusian opposition in 2007]]

The day has been celebrated as the [[Independence Day (Belarus)|Independence Day of Belarus]] by the Belarusian independence movement since the early 1920s. The day has been widely celebrated by the [[Belarusian diaspora]].

In the United States, governors and US presidents have traditionally issued official greetings to the [[Belarusian American]] community on the occasion of March 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radabnr.org/?p=2494 BELARUSIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY IN NEW YORK – PROCLAMATION BY MAYOR RUDI GIULIANI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radabnr.org/?p=2173 ANNIVERSARY OF THE BELARUSIAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC – GREETING FROM US PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

In today's [[Belarus]], people and groups largely opposed to the current Belarusian government under president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] celebrate the holiday. The government does not recognize it for the stated reason that the Belarusian Democratic Republic was created by the [[Germany|Germans]], who were occupying Belarus in 1918. Celebrations of the holiday are an annual occasion for anti-government protests.

== History of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs ==
Approximately 78% of earth's atmosphere is N gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is an inert compound and biologically unavailable to most organisms. In order to be utilized in most biological processes, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be converted to reactive N (Nr), which includes inorganic reduced forms (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), inorganic oxidized forms (NO, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and organic compounds ([[urea]], [[amine]]s, and [[protein]]s).&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a strong triple bond, and so a significant amount of energy (226 kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) is required to convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Nr.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Prior to industrial processes, the only sources of such energy were solar radiation and electrical discharges.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Utilizing a large amount of metabolic energy and the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], some [[bacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]] convert atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a process known as biological [[nitrogen fixation]] (BNF).&lt;ref name="Schles"&gt;Schlesinger, W. H. 1997. ''Biogeochemistry : An analysis of global change'', San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropogenic analogue to BNF is the [[Haber-Bosch]] process, in which H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reacted with atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at high temperatures and pressures to produce NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=smil&gt;Smil, V. 2001. ''Enriching the earth : Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the transformation of world food production''. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is converted to NO by energy from [[lightning]], which is negligible in current temperate ecosystems, or by [[fossil fuel]] combustion.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt;

Until 1850, natural BNF, cultivation-induced BNF (e.g., planting of [[leguminous]] crops), and incorporated organic matter were the only sources of N for agricultural production.&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; Near the turn of the century, Nr from [[guano]] and [[sodium nitrate]] deposits was harvested and exported from the arid Pacific islands and South American deserts.&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; By the late 1920s, early industrial processes, albeit inefficient, were commonly used to produce NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Due to the efforts of [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]], the Haber-Bosch process became the largest source of nitrogenous fertilizer after the 1950s, and replaced BNF as the dominant source of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; From 1890 to 1990, anthropogenically created Nr increased almost ninefold.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; During this time, the human population more than tripled, partly due to increased food production.

Since the [[industrial revolution]], an additional source of anthropogenic N input has been [[fossil fuel]] combustion, which is used to generate energy (e.g., to power automobiles). During combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, high temperatures and pressures provide energy to produce NO from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Additionally, when [[fossil fuel]] is extracted and burned, fossil N may become reactive (i.e., NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions).&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; During the 1970s, scientists began to recognize that N inputs were accumulating in the environment and affecting ecosystems.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt;

== Impacts of anthropogenic inputs on the nitrogen cycle ==
Between 1600 and 1990, global reactive nitrogen (Nr) creation had increased nearly 50%.&lt;ref name=gallocowl&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1639/0044-7447(2002)031[0064:RNATWY]2.0.CO;2|year=2002|volume=31|pages=64|title=Reactive Nitrogen and the World: 200 Years of Change|last1=Galloway|first1=James N.|last2=Cowling|first2=Ellis B.|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, atmospheric emissions of Nr species reportedly increased 250% and deposition to marine and terrestrial ecosystems increased over 200%.&lt;ref name=gallocowl/&gt; Additionally, there was a reported fourfold increase in riverine dissolved inorganic N fluxes to coasts.&lt;ref name=gallocowl/&gt; Nitrogen is a critical limiting nutrient in many systems, including forests, wetlands, and coastal and marine ecosystems; therefore, this change in emissions and distribution of Nr has resulted in substantial consequences for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitousek | first1 = P. | last2 = Howarth | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1007/BF00002772 | title = Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: How can it occur? | journal = Biogeochemistry | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | year = 1991 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raba"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1639/0044-7447(2002)031[0102:NIAE]2.0.CO;2|year=2002|volume=31|pages=102|title=Nitrogen in Aquatic Ecosystems|last1=Rabalais|first1=Nancy N.|authorlink1=Nancy Rabalais|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
Atmospheric N inputs mainly include oxides of N (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems,&lt;ref name="Schles"/&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; from [[fossil fuel]] and biomass combustion.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt;

In [[agroecosystem]]s, fertilizer application has increased microbial [[nitrification]] (aerobic process in which microorganisms oxidize ammonium [NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] to nitrate [NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]) and [[denitrification]] (anaerobic process in which microorganisms reduce NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; to atmospheric nitrogen gas [N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]). Both processes naturally leak nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Schles"/&gt; Of particular concern is N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which has an average atmospheric lifetime of 114–120 years,&lt;ref&gt;[[John T.

Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems receive Nr inputs from the atmosphere through wet and dry deposition.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Atmospheric Nr species can be deposited to ecosystems in precipitation (e.g., NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, organic N compounds), as gases (e.g., NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and gaseous nitric acid [HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]), or as aerosols (e.g., ammonium nitrate [NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]).&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Aquatic ecosystems receive additional nitrogen from [[surface runoff]] and [[river]]ine inputs.&lt;ref name="raba"/&gt;
 
Increased N deposition can acidify soils, streams, and lakes and alter forest and grassland productivity. In grassland ecosystems, N inputs have produced initial increases in productivity followed by declines as critical thresholds are exceeded.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Nitrogen effects on [[biodiversity]], [[carbon cycling]], and changes in species composition have also been demonstrated. In highly developed areas of near shore coastal ocean and estuarine systems, rivers deliver direct (e.g., [[surface runoff]]) and indirect (e.g., groundwater contamination) N inputs from agroecosystems.&lt;ref name="raba"/&gt; Increased N inputs can result in [[freshwater acidification]] and [[eutrophication]] of marine waters.

====Terrestrial ecosystems====

=====Impacts on productivity and nutrient cycling=====

Much of terrestrial growth in temperate systems is limited by N; therefore, N inputs (i.e., through deposition and fertilization) can increase N availability, which temporarily increases N uptake, plant and microbial growth, and N accumulation in plant biomass and [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=aber89&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1311067 Aber, J.

NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, the product of nitrification, is highly mobile and can be leached from the soil, along with positively charged alkaline minerals such as calcium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Schles"/&gt; In acid soils, mobilized aluminium ions can reach toxic concentrations, negatively affecting both terrestrial and adjacent aquatic ecosystems.

However, ecosystem responses to N additions are contingent upon many site-specific factors including climate, land-use history, and amount of N additions. For example, in the Northeastern United States, hardwood stands receiving chronic N inputs have demonstrated greater capacity to retain N and increase annual net primary productivity (ANPP) than conifer stands.&lt;ref name=magill&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Magill | first1 = A.

When available N exceeds the ecosystem's (i.e., vegetation, soil, and [[microbe]]s, etc.) uptake capacity, N [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] occurs and excess N is lost to surface waters, groundwater, and the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=aber89/&gt;&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;&lt;ref name=magill/&gt; N saturation can result in nutrient imbalances (e.g., loss of calcium due to nitrate leaching) and possible forest decline.&lt;ref name=aber92/&gt;

A 15-year study of chronic N additions at the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research ([[LTER]]) program has elucidated many impacts of increased nitrogen deposition on nutrient cycling in temperate forests. It found that chronic N additions resulted in greater leaching losses, increased pine mortality, and cessation of biomass accumulation.&lt;ref name=magill/&gt; Another study reported that chronic N additions resulted in accumulation of non-photosynthetic N and subsequently reduced photosynthetic capacity, supposedly leading to severe carbon stress and mortality.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt; These findings negate previous hypotheses that increased N inputs would increase NPP and [[carbon sequestration]].

=====Impacts on plant species diversity=====

Many plant communities have evolved under low nutrient conditions; therefore, increased N inputs can alter biotic and abiotic interactions, leading to changes in community composition. Several nutrient addition studies have shown that increased N inputs lead to dominance of fast-growing plant species, with associated declines in species richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Laura Foster Huenneke |author2=Steven P.

In a more recent experimental study of N fertilization and disturbance (i.e., tillage) in old field succession, it was found that species richness decreased with increasing N, regardless of disturbance level. Competition experiments showed that competitive dominants excluded competitively inferior species between disturbance events. With increased N inputs, competition shifted from belowground to aboveground (i.e., to competition for light), and patch colonization rates significantly decreased. These internal changes can dramatically affect the community by shifting the balance of competition-colonization tradeoffs between species.&lt;ref name=wiltil/&gt; In patch-based systems, regional coexistence can occur through tradeoffs in competitive and colonizing abilities given sufficiently high disturbance rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hastings | first1 = A. | title = Disturbance, coexistence, history, and competition for space | doi = 10.1016/0040-5809(80)90059-3 | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 363–373 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, with inverse ranking of competitive and colonizing abilities, plants can coexist in space and time as disturbance removes superior competitors from patches, allowing for establishment of superior colonizers. However, as demonstrated by Wilson and Tilman, increased nutrient inputs can negate tradeoffs, resulting in competitive exclusion of these superior colonizers/poor competitors.&lt;ref name=wiltil/&gt;

====Aquatic ecosystems====

Aquatic ecosystems also exhibit varied responses to nitrogen enrichment. NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; loading from N saturated, terrestrial ecosystems can lead to [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] of downstream freshwater systems and [[eutrophication]] of downstream marine systems. [[Freshwater acidification]] can cause aluminium toxicity and mortality of pH-sensitive fish species. Because marine systems are generally nitrogen-limited, [[Nutrient pollution|excessive N inputs]] can result in water quality degradation due to toxic algal blooms, oxygen deficiency, habitat loss, decreases in [[biodiversity]], and fishery losses.&lt;ref name=raba/&gt;

=====Acidification of freshwaters=====

Atmospheric N deposition in terrestrial landscapes can be transformed through soil microbial processes to biologically available nitrogen, which can result in surface-water [[Freshwater acidification|acidification]], and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; inputs from terrestrial systems and the atmosphere can acidify freshwater systems when there is little buffering capacity due to [[soil acidification]].&lt;ref name=raba/&gt; N pollution in Europe, the Northeastern United States, and Asia is a current concern for [[freshwater acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings%5CBioSci.51.180.198.pdf Driscoll, C.

=====Eutrophication of marine systems=====

Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers.&lt;ref name=raba/&gt; Increased nutrient inputs to marine systems have shown both short-term increases in productivity and fishery yields, and long-term detrimental effects of [[eutrophication]]. Tripling of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; loads in the Mississippi River in the last half of the 20th century have been correlated with increased fishery yields in waters surrounding the Mississippi delta;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1577/1548-8446(2001)026&lt;0017:FPATMR&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=2001|volume=26|pages=17-26|title=Fishery Production and the Mississippi River Discharge|last1=Grimes|first1=Churchill B.|journal=Fisheries|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, these nutrient inputs have produced seasonal [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (oxygen concentrations less than 2–3&amp;nbsp;mg L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, "[[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]s") in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=gallo2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=raba/&gt; In estuarine and coastal systems, high nutrient inputs increase primary production (e.g., [[phytoplankton]], sea grasses, macroalgae), which increase [[turbidity]] with resulting decreases in light penetration throughout the water column. Consequently, submerged vegetation growth declines, which reduces habitat complexity and oxygen production. The increased primary (i.e., phytoplankton, macroalgae, etc.) production leads to a flux of carbon to bottom waters when decaying organic matter (i.e., senescent primary production) sinks and is consumed by aerobic bacteria lower in the water column. As a result, oxygen consumption in bottom waters is greater than diffusion of oxygen from surface waters. Additionally, certain algal blooms termed harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce toxins that can act as neuromuscular or organ damaging compounds. These algal blooms can be harmful to other marine life as well as to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skulberg|first=Olav M.|last2=Codd|first2=Geoffrey A.|last3=Carmichael|first3=Wayne W.|date=1984-01-01|title=Toxic Blue-Green Algal Blooms in Europe: A Growing Problem|jstor=4313034|journal=Ambio|volume=13|issue=4|pages=244–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=V.H.|last2=Tilman|first2=G.D.|last3=Nekola|first3=J.C.|title=Eutrophication: impacts of excess nutrient inputs on freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=100|issue=1–3|pages=179–196|doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(99)00091-3|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration ==
The above system responses to reactive nitrogen (Nr) inputs are almost all exclusively studied separately; however, research increasingly indicates that nitrogen loading problems are linked by multiple pathways transporting nutrients across system boundaries.&lt;ref name=gallo2003/&gt; This sequential transfer between ecosystems is termed the nitrogen cascade.&lt;ref name=gallocowl/&gt; ([http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050802102955/http://www.unep.org/GEO/yearbook/yb2003/089.htm see illustration from United Nations Environment Programme]). During the cascade, some systems accumulate Nr, which results in a time lag in the cascade and enhanced effects of Nr on the environment in which it accumulates. Ultimately, anthropogenic inputs of Nr are either accumulated or denitrified; however, little progress has been made in determining the relative importance of Nr accumulation and [[denitrification]], which has been mainly due to a lack of integration among scientific disciplines.&lt;ref name=gallo2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=davseit&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = E.

'''Human rights in Australia''' have largely been developed under [[Australian Parliament|Australian Parliamentary democracy]] through laws in specific contexts (rather than a stand-alone, abstract [[bill of rights]]) and safeguarded by such institutions as an [[independent judiciary]] and [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] which implement the [[Common Law]], the [[Australian Constitution]] and various other [[Australian Law|laws of Australia]] and its [[States and Territories of Australia|states and territories]].  Australia also has an independent statutory human rights body, the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], which investigates and conciliates complaints, and more generally promotes human rights through education, discussion and reporting.

[[Universal suffrage|Universal voting rights]] and rights to [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]], [[freedom of religion]] and freedom from discrimination are protected in Australia. The Australian colonies were among the first political entities in the world to grant [[male suffrage|male]] (1850s) and [[female suffrage]] (1890s). Contemporary Australia is a [[liberal democracy]] and heir to a large post-[[World War II]] [[multicultural]] program of immigration in which forms of [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|racial discrimination have been prohibited]].

As a founding member of the [[United Nations]], Australia assisted in the drafting of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and it is signatory to various other international treaties on the subject of [[Human Rights|human rights]]. Australia is the only democratic country in the world without a national bill of rights of some kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities: Origins and Scope|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/2006/27.html |author=Williams, G |author-link=George Williams (lawyer)}} (2006) 30(3) Melbourne University Law Review 880 .&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racism in Australia]] traces both historical and contemporary racist community attitudes, as well as political non-compliance and alleged governmental negligence on United Nations human rights standard &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/countries/AsiaRegion/Pages/AUIndex.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and incidents in Australia.

An ongoing human rights issue in Australia is the legacy of mistreatment of [[indigenous Australians]], who are disproportionately of disadvantaged socioeconomic standing, have shorter life spans, and make up a disproportionately high number of imprisoned persons, thus receiving disproportionately high levels of social welfare payment as well as preferential employment and tertiary educational placement in state sectors. In 2016–17, the estimated direct expenditure per person was $44,886 for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, which was around twice the rate for non-Indigenous Australians ($22 356).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pc.gov.au/research/ongoing/indigenous-expenditure-report/2017/ier-2017-indigenous-expenditure-report.pdf 2017 Indigenous Expenditure Report]; Productivity Commission; October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of rights ==
As Australia does not have a Bill of Rights to implement all international human rights, some states have implemented their own charters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.humanrights.gov.au/how-are-human-rights-protected-australian-law&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Victoria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|cohrara2006433|Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ACT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|hra2004148|Human Rights Act 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, other sources of rights exist to protect rights in Australia (the Constitution, through statutes, common law, and through implementation of international treaties).

=== Australian Constitution ===
Human rights are protected under the [[Australian Constitution]] in several ways: 
* Self-determination is protected by the creation of a system of responsible government chosen by the people in the form of the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]]; 
* [[Section 41 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 41]] provides a right to vote; 
* [[Section 51(xxiii) of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51(xxiii)]] prohibits civil conscription in relation to medical and dental services; 
* [[Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution of Australia|section 51(xxxi)]] empowers the Commonwealth to acquire property only "on just terms"; 
* [[Section 80 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 80]] provides a right to a jury trial for indictable offences; 
* [[Section 92 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 92]] protects freedom of interstate trade, commerce and intercourse; 
* [[Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 116]] prohibits the Commonwealth from passing laws establishing religion, imposing religious observance, or requiring a religious test for qualification for public office; 
* [[Section 117 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 117]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of State residence. 
In addition, as a result of certain structural implications and principles, the Constitution protects human rights indirectly through several means, including: 
* An [[implied freedom of political communication]] on government and political matters;&lt;ref name="Lange"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|25|1997|litigants=[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |parallelcite=(1997) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 520 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A requirement that punishment (and, with some exceptions, imprisonment) only occur pursuant a court order, arising from the [[separation of powers]];&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1992|litigants=[[Chu Kheng Lim v Minister of Immigration]] |parallelcite=(1992) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A requirement that courts be independent and impartial from the executive and legislature;&lt;ref name=Totani&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|39|2010|litigants=Totani v South Australia |link=South Australia v Totani |parallelcite=(2010) 242 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The right to challenge the legality of government action for [[jurisdictional error]], even where legislation purports to preclude judicial review.&lt;ref name=S157&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|2|2003|litigants=Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth |parallelcite=(2003) 211 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 476 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirk&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|1|2010|litigants=[[Kirk v Industrial Court of NSW]] |parallelcite=(2010) 239 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 531 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statutes ===
Human rights are protected through various statutory enactments in a broad variety of specific contexts. For example, there are statutes which prescribe and regulate police powers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|leara2002451|Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; use of personal information,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|pa1988108|Privacy Act 1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; secret recording of conversations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|sda2007210|Surveillance Devices Act 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; equal treatment when buying goods and services,&lt;ref name="RDA s13"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|rda1975202|Racial Discrimination Act 1975|13}} Provision of goods and services.&lt;/ref&gt; consumer rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|caca2010265|Competition and Consumer Act 2010}} Schedule 2 The Australian Consumer Law.&lt;/ref&gt; and many other statutes.

=== Common law ===
The common law of Australia protects rights indirectly through various causes of action (such as in contract, tort, and property rights).  The common law also protects human rights through principles of statutory interpretation. One example is found in Gleeson CJ's statement that it is presumed that it is not Parliament's intention to remove a fundamental human right(s) or freedom(s) unless such an intention is outlined and manifested by clear language.&lt;ref name=Coco&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|15|1994|litigants=[[Coco v The Queen]] |parallelcite=(1994) 179 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 427 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the [[principle of legality]] which acts as an extra layer of protection for human rights against vague or ambiguous legislation.  Furthermore, Former [[Chief Justice of New South Wales]], [[James Spigelman]], has compiled a list of a number of rights-depriving acts which the common law presumes the legislature does not intend without clear wording, including retrospectively changing rights and obligations, infringing personal liberty, interfering with freedom of movement or speech, restricting access to the courts, interfering with vested property rights, and denying procedural fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Spigelman |author-link=James Spigelman |title=The Common Law Bill of Rights |ssrn=1806775 |date=10 March 2008 |work=speech given at the University of Queensland, Brisbane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are various common law principles which afford certain protections, such as legal professional privilege, and the privilege against self-incrimination.

=== International Human Rights Laws in Australia===
Australia has signed various international treaties and conventions regarding human rights. Australia has agreed to be bound by the following treaties: 
* ICCPR
* ICESCR 
* Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
* Convention on the Political Rights of Women
* International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination
* Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women
* Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment
* Convention on the Rights of the Child
* Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness
* Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons
* Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
* Slavery Convention of 1926
* Supplementary Convention on Slavery
* Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities &lt;ref name="humanrights.gov.au"&gt;https://www.humanrights.gov.au/human-rights-explained-fact-sheet-7australia-and-human-rights-treaties&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Australia is a signatory to these, the rights given in the treaties are only applicable in Australia if domestic legislation is established.&lt;ref name="humanrights.gov.au"/&gt; For example, the ''Racial Discrimination Act'' 1975 (Cth),&lt;ref name=RDA&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|rda1975202|Racial Discrimination Act 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; implements the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the ''Sex Discrimination Act'' 1984 (Cth),&lt;ref name=SDA&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|sda1984209|Sex Discrimination Act 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provides some of the rights outlined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.&lt;ref name="humanrights.gov.au"/&gt;

However, another way the rights provided in a treaty can be seen in Australian law is where provisions of a treaty are already a part of domestic legislation (for example, the Convention of the Rights of People of Disabilities can be seen as incorporated into domestic law through similar provisions in the ''Disability Discrimination Act'' 1992 (Cth)).&lt;ref name="humanrights.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DDA&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|dda1992264|Disability Discrimination Act 1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australian Human Rights Commission ==
{{Main article|Australian Human Rights Commission}}
The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) (previously known as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission) is a national independent statutory body of the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]]. Established under the ''Australian Human Rights Commission Act'' 1986 (Cth),&lt;ref name="AHRC Act"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ahrca1986373|Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it has responsibility for the investigation of alleged infringements under Australia’s anti-discrimination legislation.

Matters that can be investigated by the Commission include discrimination on the grounds of [[ageing|age]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], colour or [[ethnic]] origin, [[racial vilification]], [[sex]], [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[Intersex people|intersex status]], marital or relationship status, actual or potential [[pregnancy]], [[breastfeeding]] or [[disability]].&lt;ref name="AHRC Act s46P"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ahrca1986373|Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986|46p}} Lodging a complaint.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHRC Act s3"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ahrca1986373|Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986|3}} Interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the protection of human rights has several significant limitations. For instance, human rights will often trump other public goods as it enjoys a prima facie;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Henkin, ''The Age of Rights'' (Columbia University Press, 1990) 1131&lt;/ref&gt; human rights may be violated in some circumstances or reasons like national emergency or security;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rix,'Australia and the 'War against Terrorism': Terrorism, National Security and Human Rights', (Paper Presented at Proceedings of the Second Workshop on the Social Implications of National Security, University of Wollongong 2007), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;[http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=gsbpapers] human rights are protected in various States (ACT and Victoria) through legislation. However, it cannot be implemented nor enforceable at the Federal level.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Human Rights Commission, ''National Human Rights Consultation'' (2009) 50 Australian Human Rights Commission [https://www.humanrights.gov.au/submission-national-human-rights-consultation-2009#20_6]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil and political rights ==

=== Freedom of expression ===
Under the Australian Constitution, there is an [[implied freedom of political communication]] on government and political matters.&lt;ref name="Lange" /&gt;

Some restrictions on political expression exist in Australia, including laws on [[defamation]], [[Hate speech laws in Australia|racial vilification]], and contempt of Parliament.

In 2015, Tasmania's Anti Discrimination Commissioner found that the Catholic Church and the Archbishop of Hobart had a "case to answer" under Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination legislation for promoting the Catholic view of marriage. [[Australian Greens]] candidate Martine Delaney brought the matter to the Commission. The ABC reported that case has "raised concerns about freedom of speech ahead of a national debate on same-sex marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood, Fiona. (13 November 2015) [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-13/catholic-church-has-discrimination-case-to-answer/6939942 Catholic Church has discrimination case to answer over anti same-sex marriage booklet – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]. Abc.net.au. Retrieved on 2016-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Parliamentarian [[Lee Rhiannon]] of the [[Australian Greens]] referred remarks made by an Australian Catholic Cardinal opposing [[embryonic stem cell]] research to the New South Wales parliamentary privileges committee for allegedly being in "contempt of parliament". The Cardinal was cleared of the charge and described the move as a "clumsy attempt to curb religious freedom and freedom of speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cathnews.acu.edu.au/706/83.php |title=Pell slams "stalinist" parliamentary contempt probe |publisher=Cathnews.acu.edu.au |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/73A134BD8CA52844CA2572FB0014E42B |title=Inquiry into comments made by Cardinal George Pell – NSW Parliament |publisher=Parliament.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=1 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316143541/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/73A134BD8CA52844CA2572FB0014E42B |archivedate=16 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voting rights ===
{{main article|Suffrage in Australia}}
[[File:NSWParliament1.jpg|thumb|The [[New South Wales Parliament]] is [[Australia]]'s oldest parliament. First elections were held in 1843.]]

Australians achieved voting rights decades before most other [[History of Western civilization|Western nations]]. The [[History of Australia|Australian colonies]] granted male suffrage from the 1850s and in 1895 the women of [[South Australia]] achieved the right to both vote and stand for Parliament, enabling [[Catherine Helen Spence]] to be the first to stand as a political candidate in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Change name |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/milestone.htm |title=Electoral Milestones for Women – Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Federation of Australia|federation]] of the colonies in 1901, the ''Franchise Act 1902'' was passed, granting the right to vote to men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Change name |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/righttovote.htm |title=The Right to Vote in Australia – Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Act also restricted votes for '[[Indigenous Australians|natives]]' unless they were already enrolled. These restrictions were unevenly applied and were relaxed after World War II, with full rights restored by the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1962''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Change name |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=Electoral Milestones – Timetable for Indigenous Australians – Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, an innovative [[secret ballot]] was introduced in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia, in which the government supplied voting paper containing the names of candidates and voters could select in private. This system was adopted around the world, becoming known as the "[[Australian Ballot]]". the "[[Australian Ballot]]" became well known throughout Australia.

The first woman elected to any Australian Parliament was [[Edith Cowan]], to the West Australian Legislative Assembly in 1921. Dame [[Enid Lyons]], in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] and Senator [[Dorothy Tangney]] became the first women in the Federal Parliament in 1943. In 1971, [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Neville Bonner]] became the first [[Aboriginal Australian]] to sit in the [[Australian Parliament|federal Parliament]]. [[Rosemary Follett]] was elected [[Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory]] in 1989, becoming the first woman elected to lead a state or territory. In 2010, [[Julia Gillard]] became the first female [[Prime Minister of Australia]].

By 2010, the people of Australia's oldest city, [[Sydney]], had female leaders occupying every major political office above them, with [[Clover Moore]] as Lord Mayor, [[Kristina Keneally]] as Premier of New South Wales, [[Marie Bashir]] as Governor of New South Wales, [[Julia Gillard]] as Prime Minister, [[Quentin Bryce]] as [[Governor General of Australia]] and [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Australia]].

=== Capital punishment ===
{{Main article|Capital punishment in Australia}}
The last use of the death penalty in Australia was in Victoria in 1967. [[Ronald Ryan|Ronald Joseph Ryan]] was hanged at Pentridge Prison on 3 February 1967 for the murder of a prison guard, George Hodson. However, Australian criminologist, [[Gordon Hawkins]], director of Sydney University's Institute of Criminology, doubts that Ryan was guilty.

Capital punishment was officially abolished for federal offences by the ''[[Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973]]''. The various states abolished capital punishment at various times, starting with Queensland in 1922 and ending with New South Wales in 1985.

=== People with a disability ===
Discrimination against persons with disabilities in various contexts is prohibited under the ''[[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]]'' (Cth) ('''DDA'''). The Act makes it unlawful to treat a disabled person less favorably, or to fail to make reasonable adjustments for the person, in the contexts of employment, education, publicly available premises, provision of goods and services, accommodation, clubs and associations, and other contexts.  Complaints made under the DDA are made to the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]].

The Australian Government requested the [[Productivity Commission]] to evaluate the effectiveness of the DDA, and the Commission published its findings in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The Commission found that while there is still room for improvement, particularly in reducing discrimination in employment, overall the DDA has been reasonably effective. The Commission found that people with a disability were less likely to finish school, to have a TAFE or university qualification and to be employed. They are more likely to have a below average income, be on a pension, live in public housing and in prison. The average personal income for people with a disability is 44 per cent of the income of other Australians.

[[DisabilityCare Australia]], formerly known as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, is a [[Health care in Australia|healthcare program]] initiated by the [[Australian government]]. The bill was introduced into parliament in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/gillard-introduces-ndis-legislation/story-e6frf7kf-1226526333897|title=PM introduces NDIS bill to parliament|publisher=Herald Sun|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013 the first stage of DisabilityCare Australia commenced in South Australia, Tasmania, the [[Hunter Region]] in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria, while the Australian Capital Territory will commence in July 2014.

== Treatment of particular groups and minorities ==

=== Indigenous Australians ===
{{See also|History of Indigenous Australians}}
The current wellbeing of indigenous Australians is an ongoing issue in Australia.

There is significant disparity in health between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. In 2010–2012, the estimated life expectancy at birth for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males was 69.1 years, and for females 73.7 years. This was 10.6 years lower than the life expectancy of non-Indigenous males, and 9.5 years lower than that of non-Indigenous females.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government - Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, '[http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129548468 Mortality and life expectancy of Indigenous Australians 2008 to 2012]' (2014), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that 70% of the Aboriginal population die before the age of 65, compared with 20% of non-indigenous Australians.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}  Additionally, the suicide rate among Aboriginal Australians is almost three times higher (at 4.2%) than the national average (1.5%).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}[[File:Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Parkes (3).jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Aboriginal Tent Embassy]] set up in [[Canberra]] by activist agitating for the rights of Indigenous Australians.]]

The roots of the present condition can be traced to the historical treatment of Aboriginals and the dispossession of land that occurred following arrival of the British settlers in the late 1700s, where a combination of disease, loss of land (and thus food resources) and violence reduced the Aboriginal population. Later, from the 1830s, colonial governments established the now controversial offices of the [[Protector of Aborigines]] in an effort to avoid mistreatment of Indigenous peoples and conduct government policy towards them. [[Christianity in Australia|Christian churches in Australia]] sought to convert Aborigines, and were often used by government to carry out welfare and assimilation policies.

The [[Caledon Bay crisis]] of 1932–4 saw one of the last incidents of frontier violence, which began when the spearing of Japanese poachers who had been molesting [[Yolngu]] women was followed by the killing of a policeman. As the crisis unfolded, national opinion swung behind the Aboriginal people involved, and the first appeal on behalf of an [[Indigenous Australian]] to the [[High Court of Australia]] was launched. Elsewhere around this time, activists like Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] were commencing their campaigns for Aboriginal rights within the established Australian political system and the age of frontier conflict closed.

In 1962, the [[Menzies Government]]'s ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' provided that all [[Indigenous Australians]] should have the right to enroll and vote at federal elections (prior to this, indigenous people in Queensland, Western Australia and some in the Northern Territory had been excluded from voting unless they were ex-servicemen).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|author=Change name |url=http://aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=Electoral Milestones – Timetable for Indigenous Australians – Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Aec.gov.au |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successor [[Holt Government]] called the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 Referendum]] which removed the discriminatory clause in the [[Australian Constitution]] which excluded [[Aboriginal Australians]] from being counted in the census – the referendum was one of the few to be overwhelmingly endorsed by the Australian electorate (over 90% voted 'yes').&lt;ref name="primeministers.naa.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx |title=In office – Harold Holt – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s, Australian writers began to re-assess European assumptions about Aboriginal Australia – with works including [[Geoffrey Blainey|Geoffrey Blainey's]] landmark history ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975) and the books of historian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]].[[File:Pastor Sir Douglas and Lady Gladys Nicholls Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Aboriginal rights campaigner Sir [[Doug Nicholls]], Parliament Gardens, [[Fitzroy, Victoria]]]]From the late 1960s a movement for [[Indigenous land rights]] developed. In the mid-1960s, one of the earliest Aboriginal graduates from the [[University of Sydney]], [[Charles N. Perkins|Charles Perkins]], helped organise [[Freedom Ride (Australia)|freedom rides]] into parts of Australia to expose discrimination and inequality. In 1966, the [[Gurindji strike|Gurindji]] people of Wave Hill station (owned by the [[Vestey Group]]) commenced strike action led by [[Vincent Lingiari]] in a quest for equal pay and recognition of land rights.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bolton (1990) p.193 and 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam Labor]] and [[Fraser Government|Fraser Liberal Government]]s instigated the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]], which, while limited to the Northern Territory, affirmed "inalienable" freehold title to some traditional lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/fraser/in-office.aspx |title=In office – Malcolm Fraser – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the [[Hawke Government]] returned ownership of [[Uluru]] (formerly known as Ayers Rock) to the local Pitjantjatjara Aboriginal people.

Indigenous Australians began to take up representation in Australian parliaments during the 1970s. In 1971 [[Neville Bonner]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] was appointed by the Queensland Parliament to replace a retiring senator, becoming the first Aborigine in Federal Parliament. Bonner was returned as a Senator at the 1972 election and remained until 1983. [[Hyacinth Tungutalum]] of the [[Country Liberal Party]] in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Eric Deeral]] of the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] of Queensland, became the first Indigenous people elected to territory and state legislatures in 1974. In 1976, Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] was appointed [[Governor of South Australia]], becoming the first Aborigine to hold vice-regal office in Australia. [[Aden Ridgeway]] of the [[Australian Democrats]] served as a senator during the 1990s, but no indigenous person was elected to the House of Representatives, until West Australian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] [[Ken Wyatt]], in August 2010.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;[[File:Noel Pearson 8Feb10.jpg|thumb|Lawyer and rights activist, [[Noel Pearson]] of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]].]]In 1992, the [[High Court of Australia]] handed down its decision in the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo Case]], recognising [[Native title in Australia|native title]]. That same year, Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] said in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] that European settlers were responsible for the difficulties Australian Aboriginal communities continued to face. In 1999 Parliament passed a [[Motion of Reconciliation]] drafted by Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Aboriginal Senator [[Aden Ridgeway]] naming mistreatment of Indigenous Australians as the most "blemished chapter in our national history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title=The History of Apologies Down Under [Thinking Faith – the online journal of the British Jesuits&amp;#93; |publisher=Thinkingfaith.org |accessdate=12 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archivedate=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the calling of a [[Australian general election, 2007|2007 federal election]], the then Prime Minister, John Howard, revisited the idea of bringing a referendum to seek recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Constitution (his government first sought to include recognition of Aboriginal peoples in the Preamble to the Constitution in a 1999 referendum). The Labor opposition initially supported the idea; however, [[Kevin Rudd]] withdrew this support just prior to the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22809264-601,00.html |title=Noel Pearson's statement on Kevin Rudd|work= The Australian |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Indigenous Affairs Minister [[Mal Brough]] launched the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response]]. In response to the [[Little Children are Sacred]] Report into allegations of child abuse among indigenous communities in the Territory, the government banned alcohol in prescribed communities in the Northern Territory; quarantined a percentage of welfare payments for essential goods purchasing; despatched additional police and medical personnel to the region; and suspended the permit system for access to indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/one-policy-two-camps--the-takeover-rift/2007/10/26/1192941339555.html |publisher=SMH.au |work=Sydney Morning Herald  |date= 27 October 2007|accessdate=27 June 2010 |title=One policy, two camps – the takeover rift}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was largely maintained under the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd]] and [[Gillard Government]]s.

=== Immigrants and asylum seekers ===
{{See also|Asylum in Australia|Immigration to Australia|Immigration detention in Australia}}
Australia is an immigrant nation with a large and longstanding multi-ethnic migration program.

Historically, from the 1890s to the 1950s the country adhered to the [[White Australia policy|White Australia Policy]], which effectively barred or impeded people of non-European descent from [[Immigration to Australia|immigrating to Australia]]. The policy was dismantled by successive governments after [[World War II]], and from the 1970s successive governments officially supported [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/fraser/ |title=Malcolm Fraser – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date=11 November 1975 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Woomera-irpc.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The entrance of the former Woomera IRPC.]]Australia is a signatory to the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Refugee Convention]] and a component of the Australian immigration program is devoted to providing protection for [[refugee]]s. The majority of refugees received by Australia are identified and referred by the [[UNHCR]]. The Special Humanitarian Program further offers refuge to people subject to "substantial discrimination amounting to gross violation of human rights in their home country" and who are supported by a proposer within Australia. In 2009–10 a total of 13,770 visas were granted under these categories. The annual figure remained roughly stable for the years between 2004–2010 and accepted applicants from such nations as Myanmar, Iraq, Bhutan, Afghanistan and six African countries.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/60refugee.htm|title=Australian Immigration Fact Sheet 60 – Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian Program|date=29 October 2008|publisher=Immi.gov.au|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To varying degrees of success, recent Australian governments have sought to discourage unauthorised arrivals by people seeking refugee status in Australia by maintaining a system of [[Immigration detention in Australia|mandatory detention]] for processing of people who arrive without a visa.  In 1992, Australia adopted a policy of under which the Australian government could [[detainee|detain]] any person in the country without a valid [[visa (document)|visa]]. In 1994 the detention of 'unlawful non-citizens' was made mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050718203527/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/INTGUIDE/SP/asylum_seekers.htm E-Brief – The detention and removal of asylum seekers]&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s and early 2000s, these unauthorised arrivals, popularly referred to as "[[boat people]]", were transferred to one of the [[Australian immigration detention facilities]] on the Australian mainland, or to [[Manus Island]] or [[Nauru]] as part of the [[Pacific Solution]]. These offshore processing and mandatory detention policies have attracted criticism. In 2014, the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] published a report, which found that many basic rights outlined in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] were denied to children living in immigration detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/publications/forgotten-children-national-inquiry-children|title=The Forgotten Children: National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention (2014)|last=ahrc.admin|date=2014-11-24|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human sacrifice]] was common to many parts of Mesoamerica. Thus the rite was nothing new to the Aztecs when they arrived to the [[Valley of Mexico]], nor was it something unique to pre-Columbian Mexico. Other Mesoamerican cultures, such as the [[Purépecha culture|Purépechas]] and [[Toltec]]s, performed  sacrifices as well and from archaeological evidence, it probably existed since the time of the [[Olmecs]] (1200–400 BC), and perhaps even throughout the early farming cultures of the region. Although the extent of human sacrifice is unknown among several Mesoamerican civilizations, such as [[Teotihuacán]],&lt;ref&gt;Sahagun Bk 2: 24: 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; what distinguished [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|Maya]] and Aztec human sacrifice was the importance with which it was embedded in everyday life.

In 1521, Spanish explorers such as [[Hernán Cortés]] conquered the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] and made observations of and wrote reports about the practice of human sacrifice. [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], who participated in the Cortés expedition, made frequent mention of human sacrifice in his memoir [[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España|''True History of the Conquest of New Spain'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The True History of the Conquest of New Spain|last=Diaz de Castillo|first= Bernal|year= |publisher =|location= |isbn= |pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harner 1977 117–135" /&gt; There are a number of second-hand accounts of human sacrifices written by Spanish [[friar]]s, that relate to the testimonies of native eyewitnesses. The literary accounts have been supported by archeological research. Since the late 1970s, excavations of the offerings in the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]], and other archaeological sites, have provided physical evidence of human sacrifice among the Mesoamerican peoples.&lt;ref&gt;

A wide variety of interpretations of the Aztec practice of human sacrifice have been proposed by modern scholars. Many scholars now believe that Aztec human sacrifice was performed in honor of the gods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Most scholars of Pre-Columbian civilization see human sacrifice among the Aztecs as a part of the long cultural tradition of human sacrifice in Mesoamerica.

==The role of sacrifice in Aztec culture==

Sacrifice was a common theme in [[Mesoamerican|the Aztec]] culture. In the Aztec "Legend of the Five Suns", all the gods sacrificed themselves so that mankind could live. Some years after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]], a body of [[Franciscans]] confronted the remaining Aztec priesthood and demanded, under threat of death, that they desist from this traditional practice. The Aztec priests defended themselves as follows:

[[File:Codex Magliabechiano (141 cropped).jpg|300px|right|thumb|Human sacrifice as shown in the [[Aztec codices#Codex Magliabechiano|Codex Magliabechiano]], Folio 70.
Heart-extraction was viewed as a means of liberating the ''istli'' and reuniting it with the Sun: the victim's transformed heart flies Sun-ward on a trail of blood.]]
{{quote|Life is because of the gods; with their sacrifice they gave us life.&amp;nbsp;... They produce our sustenance&amp;nbsp;... which nourishes life.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What the Aztec priests were referring to was a central Mesoamerican belief: that a great, continuing sacrifice of the gods sustains the Universe. A strong sense of indebtedness was connected with this worldview. Indeed, ''nextlahualli'' (debt-payment) was a commonly used metaphor for human sacrifice, and, as [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] reported, it was said that the victim was someone who "gave his service".

Human sacrifice was in this sense the highest level of an entire panoply of offerings through which the Aztecs sought to repay their debt to the gods. Both Sahagún and [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Toribio de Benavente]] (also called "Motolinía") observed that the Aztecs gladly parted with everything. Even the "stage" for human sacrifice, the massive temple-pyramids, was an offering mound: crammed with the land's finest art, treasure and victims, then buried underneath for the deities.

Additionally, the sacrifice of animals was a common practice, for which the Aztecs bred dogs, eagles, jaguars and deer. The cult of [[Quetzalcoatl]] required the sacrifice of butterflies and hummingbirds.

Self-sacrifice was also quite common; people would offer [[Agave americana|maguey]] thorns, tainted with their own blood and would offer blood from their tongues, ear lobes, or genitals. Blood held a central place in Mesoamerican cultures. The 16th-century [[Florentine Codex]] by Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún reports that in one of the creation myths, Quetzalcóatl offered blood extracted from a wound in his own genitals to give life to humanity. There are several other myths in which [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] gods offer their blood to help humanity.

It is debated whether these rites functioned as a type of atonement for Aztec believers. Some scholars argue that the role of sacrifice was to assist the gods in maintaining the cosmos, and not as an act of propitiation.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00548v0|title=The Aztecs|website=In Our Time|archive-date=27 February 2003|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aztec society viewed even the slightest tlatlacolli ('sin' or 'insult') as an extremely malevolent supernatural force. To avoid such calamities befalling their community, those who had erred punished themselves by extreme measures such as slitting their tongues for vices of speech or their ears for vices of listening. Other methods of atoning wrongdoings included hanging themselves, or throwing themselves down precipices.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;

What has been gleaned from all of this is that the sacrificial role entailed a great deal of social expectation and a certain degree of acquiescence.

=== Flower Wars ===
{{Main|Flower wars}}
According to [[Diego Durán]]'s History of the Indies of New Spain, and a few other sources that are also based on the [[Crónica X]], the Flower Wars were an act of ritual between the cities of [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] and [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]], Huexotzingo and Cholula.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isaac|first=Barry L|date=1983|title=The Aztec "Flowery War": A Geopolitical Explanation|url=|journal=Journal of Anthropological Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of ritual was motivated by the Mesoamerican cultures in 1450 after a series of droughts and famine caused many deaths within the Mexican highlands.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The droughts and damage to the crops were believed to be punishment by the gods for feeling disvalued instead of being honored properly. Therefore, the [[Flower war|Flower Wars]] became a way to obtain human sacrifices in a very structured and ceremonial manner which were then used as offerings.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

This type of warfare differed from regular political warfare, as the Flower war was also used for combat training and as first exposure to war for new military members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, regular warfare included the use of long range weapons such as atlatl darts, stones, and sling shots to damage the enemy from afar.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During Flower wars, warriors were expected to fight up close and exhibit their combat abilities while aiming to injure the enemy, rather than kill them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The main objective of Aztec Flower warfare was to capture victims alive for use later as human sacrifice, and offerings to the gods. When death occurred from battling in a Flower War, it was considered much more noble than dying in a regular military battle.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, death in the Flower Wars contained religious importance as those who died were thought to live in heaven with the war god, Huitzilopochtli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook to Life in the Aztec World|last=Aguilar-Moreno|first=Manuel|publisher=Facts on File, Inc|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sacrifice Ritual ===
Human sacrifice rituals were performed during the appropriate times each month with the appropriate number of living bodies, and other goods, to properly appease and honor the gods. These individuals were previously chosen to be sacrificed, as was the case for people embodying the gods themselves, or were members of an enemy party which had been captured and prepared to be sacrificed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Even enemies of the Aztecs understood their roles as sacrifices to the gods since many also practiced the same type of religion.  For many rites, the victim had such a quantity of prescribed duties that it is difficult to imagine how the accompanying festival would have progressed without some degree of compliance on the part of the victim. For instance, victims were expected to bless children, greet and cheer passers-by, hear people's petitions to the gods, visit people in their homes, give discourses and lead sacred songs, processions and dances.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagun Bk 5: 8; Bk 2: 5:9; Bk 2:24:68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20041229-Ocelotl-Cuauhxicalli (Museo Nacional de Antropología) MQ.jpg|300px|right|thumb|A jaguar-shaped [[cuauhxicalli]] in the [[National Museum of Anthropology]].  This altar-like stone vessel was used to hold the hearts of sacrificial victims.  See also [[chacmool]].]]

A great deal of cosmological thought seems to have underlain each of the Aztec sacrificial rites. Most of the sacrificial rituals took more than two people to perform. In the usual procedure of the ritual, the sacrifice would be taken to the top of the temple. The sacrifice would then be laid on a stone slab, a ''chacmool'', by four priests, and his/her abdomen would be sliced open by a fifth priest with a ceremonial knife made of [[flint]]. The most common form of human sacrifice was heart-extraction. The Aztec believed that the heart (''tona'') was both the seat of the individual and a fragment of the Sun's heat (''istli''). The ''chacmool'' was a very important religious tool used during sacrifices. The cut was made in the abdomen and went through the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The priest would grab the heart which would be placed in a bowl held by a statue of the honored god, and the body would then be thrown down the temple's stairs. The body would land on a terrace at the base of the pyramid called an ''apetlatl''.

Before and during the killing, priests and audience, gathered in the plaza below, stabbed, pierced and bled themselves as auto-sacrifice. Hymns, whistles, spectacular costumed dances and percussive music marked different phases of the rite.

The body parts would then be disposed of, the viscera fed the animals in the zoo, and the bleeding head was placed on display in the ''[[tzompantli]]'' or the skull rack. When the consumption of individuals was involved, the warrior who captured the enemy was given the meaty limbs while the most important flesh, the stomach and chest, were offerings to the gods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Other types of human sacrifice, which paid tribute to various deities, killed the victims differently. The victim could be shot with arrows, die in gladiatorial style fighting, be sacrificed as a result of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], burned, [[Flaying|flayed]] after being sacrificed, or drowned.

Those individuals who were unable to complete their ritual duties were disposed of in a much less honorary matter. This "insult to the gods"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; needed to be atoned, therefore the sacrifice was slain while being chastised instead of revered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conquest of New Spain|last=Diaz|first=Bernal|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquistadors Cortés and Alvarado found that some of the sacrificial victims they freed "indignantly rejected [the] offer of release and demanded to be sacrificed".&lt;ref name="townsend79"/&gt;

=== Scope of Human Sacrifice In Aztec Culture ===
[[File:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|left|350px|thumb|A ''[[tzompantli]]'', or skull rack, as shown in the post-Conquest [[Ramirez Codex]].]]Some post-conquest sources report that at the re-consecration of [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] in 1487, the Aztecs sacrificed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days. This number is considered by Ross Hassig, author of ''Aztec Warfare'', to be an exaggeration. Hassig states "between 10,000 and 80,400 persons" were sacrificed in the ceremony.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassig|first=Ross|year=2003|title=El sacrificio y las guerras floridas|journal=[[Arqueología mexicana]]|volume=XI|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher estimate would average 14 sacrifices per minute during the four-day consecration. Four tables were arranged at the top so that the victims could be jettisoned down the sides of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Davis Hanson (2000), ''Carnage and Culture,'' Doubleday, New York, pp. 194–195. Hanson, who accepts the 80,000+ estimate, also notes that it exceeded "the daily murder record at either Auschwitz or Dachau".&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, according to [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]], old Aztecs who talked with the missionaries told about a much lower figure for the reconsecration of the temple, approximately 4,000 victims in total.

[[Michael Harner]], in his 1977 article ''The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice'', cited an estimate by [[Woodrow Borah|Borah]] of the number of persons sacrificed in central Mexico in the 15th century as high as 250,000 per year which may have been one percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Harner-NH1977"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistory86newy/page/n353|volume=86|issue=4|pages=46-51|last1=Harner|first1=Michael|title=The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice|accessdate=October 8, 2018|publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]]|year=1977|journal=Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]], a Mexica descendant and the author of [[Codex Ixtlilxochitl]], estimated that one in five children of the Mexica subjects was killed annually. [[Victor Davis Hanson]] argues that a claim by Don Carlos Zumárraga of 20,000 per annum is "more plausible".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars believe that, since the Aztecs often tried to intimidate their enemies, it is more likely that they could have inflated the number as a [[propaganda]] tool.&lt;ref&gt;Duverger (op. cit), 174–177&lt;/ref&gt; The same can be said for Bernal Díaz's inflated calculations when, in a state of visual shock, he grossly miscalculated the number of skulls at one of the seven Tenochtitlan tzompantlis. The counter argument is that both the Aztecs and Diaz were very precise in the recording of the many other details of Aztec life, and inflation or propaganda would be unlikely. According to the [[Florentine Codex]], fifty years before the conquest the Aztecs burnt the skulls of the former tzompantli. Archeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma has unearthed and studied some tzompantlis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Muerte a filo de obsidiana|last=Matos-Moctezuma|first=Eduardo|publisher=[[Fondo de Cultura Económica]]|year=2005|pages=111–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, archaeologist Elizabeth Graham noted that the largest number of skulls yet found at a single tzompantli was only about a dozen.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Every Aztec warrior would have to provide at least one prisoner for sacrifice. All the male population was trained to be warriors, but only the few who succeeded in providing captives could become full-time members of the warrior elite. Accounts also state that several young warriors could unite to capture a single prisoner, which suggests that capturing prisoners for sacrifice was challenging.&lt;ref name="Harner 1977 117–135"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harner|first=Michael|date=|year=1977|title=The Ecological Basis for Aztec Sacrifice|url=|journal=[[American Ethnologist]]|volume=4|issue=1|pages=117–135|doi=10.1525/ae.1977.4.1.02a00070|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still much debate as to what social groups constituted the usual victims of these sacrifices. It is often assumed that all victims were 'disposable' commoners or foreigners. However, slaves – a major source of victims – were not a permanent class but rather persons from any level of Aztec society who had fallen into debt or committed some crime.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Duran, ''Book of the Gods and Rites,'' p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, most of the earliest accounts talk of prisoners of war of diverse social status, and concur that virtually all child sacrifices were locals of noble lineage, offered by their own parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letter 105|last=Cortes|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Motolinia, ''History of the Indies'', 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  That women and children were not excluded from potential victims is attested by a [[tzompantli]] found in 2015 at [[Templo Mayor]] in the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aztec tower of human skulls uncovered in Mexico City|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40473547|accessdate=3 July 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is doubtful if many victims came from far afield. In 1454, the Aztec government forbade the slaying of captives from distant lands at the capital's temples. Duran's informants told him that sacrifices were consequently 'nearly always&amp;nbsp;... friends of the [Royal] House' – meaning warriors from allied states.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Aztecs: History of the Indies|last=Duran|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacrifices to specific gods==

===Huitzilopochtli===
[[Huitzilopochtli]] was the tribal deity of the [[Mexica]] and, as such, he represented the character of the Mexican people and was often identified with the sun at the zenith, and with warfare, who burned down towns and carried a fire-breathing serpent, [[Xiuhcoatl]]. He was considered the primary god of the south and a manifestation of the sun, and a counterpart of the black Tezcatlipoca, the primary god of the north, "a domain associated with Mictlan, the underworld of the dead".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Ingham, John M. "Human Sacrifice at Tenochtitlan"&lt;/ref&gt;

Huitzilopochtli was worshipped at the [[Templo Mayor]], which was the primary religious structure of the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]]. The Templo Mayor consisted of twin pyramids, one for Huitzilopochtli and one for the rain god Tlaloc (discussed below).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Duran, ''Book of the Gods and Rites''&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Aztecs sacrificed people to Huitzilopochtli (the god with warlike aspects) the victim would be placed on a sacrificial stone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernardino de Sahagún]], ''Historia General de las Cosas de la Nueva España'' (op. cit.), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The priest would then cut through the abdomen with an obsidian or flint blade.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagún, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The heart would be torn out still beating and held towards the sky in honor to the Sun-God. The body would then be pushed down the pyramid where the Coyolxauhqui stone could be found. The Coyolxauhqui Stone recreates the story of Coyolxauhqui, Huitzilopochtli's sister who was dismembered at the base of a mountain, just as the sacrificial victims were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8626972|title=Quetzalcoatl and the irony of empire: myths and prophecies in the Aztec tradition|last=David.|first=Carrasco,|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226094871|location=Chicago|oclc=8626972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body would be carried away and either cremated or given to the warrior responsible for the capture of the victim. He would either cut the body in pieces and send them to important people as an [[Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica|offering]], or use the pieces for ritual [[cannibalism]]. The warrior would thus ascend one step in the hierarchy of the Aztec social classes, a system that rewarded successful warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the festival of Panquetzaliztli, of which Huitzilopochtli was the patron, sacrificial victims were adorned in the manner of Huitzilopochtli's costume and blue body paint, before their hearts would be sacrificially removed. Representations of Huitzilopochtli called teixiptla were also worshipped, the most significant being the one at the Templo Mayor which was made of dough mixed with sacrificial blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boone|first=Elizabeth|date=|title=Incarnations of the Aztec Supernatural: The Image of Huitzilopochtli in Mexico and Europe|url=|journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|volume=79|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Codex Magliabechiano ritual sacrificial combat.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Victim of sacrificial gladiatorial combat, from [[Codex Magliabechiano]]. Note that he is tied to a large stone and his [[macuahuitl]] (sword/club) is covered with what appears to be feathers instead of obsidian.]]

===Tezcatlipoca===
[[Tezcatlipoca]] was generally considered the most powerful god, the god of night, sorcery and destiny (the name ''tezcatlipoca'' means "smoking mirror", or "[[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]]"), and the god of the north.&lt;ref name="Olivier 2003 pp. 14-15"&gt;Olivier (2003) pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztecs believed that Tezcatlipoca created war to provide food and drink to the gods. Tezcatlipoca was known by several epithets including "the Enemy" and "the Enemy of Both Sides", which stress his affinity for discord. He was also deemed the enemy of Quetzalcoatl, but an ally of Huitzilopochtli.&lt;ref name="Olivier 2003 pp. 14-15"/&gt; Tezcatlipoca had the power to forgive sins and to relieve disease, or to release a man from the fate assigned to him by his date of birth; however, nothing in Tezcatlipoca's nature compelled him to do so. He was capricious and often brought about reversals of fortune, such as bringing drought and famine. He turned himself into [[Mixcoatl]], the god of the hunt, to make fire. To the Aztecs, he was an all-knowing, all-seeing nearly all-powerful god. One of his names can be translated as "He Whose Slaves We Are".&lt;ref name="Olivier 2003 pp. 14-15"/&gt;

Some captives were sacrificed to Tezcatlipoca in ritual gladiatorial combat. The victim was tethered in place and given a mock weapon. He died fighting against up to four fully armed [[jaguar knights]] and [[eagle warriors]].

During the 20-day month of [[Toxcatl]], a young impersonator of Tezcatlipoca would be sacrificed. Throughout a year, this youth would be dressed as Tezcatlipoca and treated as a living incarnation of the god. The youth would represent Tezcatlipoca on earth; he would get four beautiful women as his companions until he was killed. In the meantime he walked through the streets of Tenochtitlan playing a flute. On the day of the sacrifice, a feast would be held in Tezcatlipoca's honor. The young man would climb the pyramid, break his flute and surrender his body to the priests. Sahagún compared it to the Christian [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahagún, Op. cit., p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Huehueteotl/Xiuhtecuhtli ===
[[Xiuhtecuhtli]] is the god of fire and heat and in many cases is considered to be an aspect of [[Huehueteotl]], the "Old God" and another fire deity.

Both Xiuhtecuhtli and Huehueteotl were worshipped during the festival of ''Izcalli.'' For ten days preceding the festival various animals would be captured by the Aztecs, to be thrown in the hearth on the night of celebration.&lt;ref&gt;López Austin 1998, p.10. Sahagún 1577, 1989, p.48 (Book I, Chapter XIII&lt;/ref&gt;

To appease [[Huehueteotl]], the fire god and a senior deity, the Aztecs had a ceremony where they prepared a large feast, at the end of which they would burn captives; before they died they would be taken from the fire and their hearts would be cut out. [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Motolinía]] and Sahagún reported that the Aztecs believed that if they did not placate Huehueteotl, a plague of fire would strike their city. The sacrifice was considered an offering to the deity.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Historia General de las Cosas de la Nueva España'' (op. cit.), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Xiuhtecuhtli was also worshipped during the [[New Fire ceremony|New Fire Ceremony,]] which occurred every 52 years, and prevented the ending of the world. During the festival priests would march to the top of the [[volcano]] ''[[Cerro de la Estrella (archeological site)|Huixachtlan]]'' and when the constellation "the fire drill" ([[Orion (constellation)|Orion's belt]]) rose over the mountain, a man would be sacrificed. The victims heart would be ripped from his body and a ceremonial hearth would be lit in the hole in his chest. This flame would then be used to light all of the ceremonial fires in various temples throughout the city of Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref&gt;Roy 2005, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tlaloc===

{{Main|Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures}}

[[Tlaloc]] is the god of rain, water, and earthly fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagun, Fray Bernardino de (1569). ''Florentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztecs believed that if sacrifices were not supplied for Tlaloc, rain would not come, their crops would not flourish, and leprosy and rheumatism, diseases caused by Tlaloc, would infest the village.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Mary (1993). ''The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya''. Thames and Hudson Inc. p. 166-167, 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists have found the remains of at least 42 children sacrificed to Tlaloc at the [[Templo Mayor|Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]]. Many of the children suffered from serious injuries before their death, they would have to have been in significant pain as Tlaloc required the tears of the young as part of the sacrifice. The priests made the children cry during their way to [[Fire sacrifice|immolation]]: a good omen that Tlaloc would wet the earth in the raining season.&lt;ref&gt;Duverger, Christian (2005). ''La flor letal''. Fondo de cultura económica. pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Florentine Codex, also known as ''General History of the Things of New Spain'', Sahagún wrote:

{{quote|According to the accounts of some, they assembled the children whom they slew in the first month, buying them from their mothers. And they went on killing them in all the feasts which followed, until the rains really began. And thus they slew some on the first month, named Quauitleua; and some in the second, named Tlacaxipeualiztli; and some in the third, named Tocoztontli; and others in the fourth, named Ueitocoztli; so that until the rains began in abundance, in all the feasts they sacrificed children.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Sahagun Bk 2: 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Xipe Totec ===
[[Xipe Totec]], known as "Our Lord the Flayed One", is the god of rebirth, agriculture, the seasons, and craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández 1992, 1996, pp. 60–63. Matos Moctezuma 1988, p.181. Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, pp. 54–55. Neumann 1976, pp. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xipe Totec was worshipped extensively during the festival of ''Tlacaxipehualiztli'', in which captured warriors and slaves were sacrificed in the ceremonial center of the city of Tenochtitlan. For forty days prior to their sacrifice one victim would be chosen from each ward of the city to act as ''ixiptla,'' dress and live as Xipe Totec. The victims were then taken to the Xipe Totec's temple where their hearts would be removed, their body dismembered and their body parts divided up to be later eaten. Prior to their death and dismemberment the victims skin would be removed, and worn by individuals who traveled throughout the city fighting battles and collecting gifts from the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carrasco|first=David|date=1995|title=Give Me Some Skin: The Charisma of the Aztec Warrior|url=|journal=History of Religions|volume=35|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calendar of sacrifice ==
{{Main|Aztec calendar}}

=== The 52-year cycle ===
The cycle of fifty-two years was central to Mesoamerican cultures. The Nahua's religious beliefs were based on a great fear that the universe would collapse after each cycle if the gods were not strong enough. Every fifty-two years a special [[New Fire ceremony]] was performed.&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt; All fires were extinguished and at midnight a human sacrifice was made. The Aztecs then waited for the dawn. If the [[Sun]] appeared it meant that the sacrifices for this cycle had been enough. A fire was ignited on the body of a victim, and this new fire was taken to every house, city and town. Rejoicing was general: a new cycle of fifty-two years was beginning, and the end of the world had been postponed, at least for another 52-year cycle.

Sacrifices were made on specific days. Sahagún, [[Juan Bautista de Pomar]] and Motolinía report that the Aztecs had eighteen festivities each year, one for each Aztec month. The table below shows the festivals of the 18-month year of the [[Aztec calendar]] and the deities with which the festivals were associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Relación de Juan Bautista Pomar|last=Bautista Pomar|first=Juan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motolinia's History of the Indians of New Spain|last=Andros Foster|first=Elizabeth|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Primeros Memoriales|last=Sahagun|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Florentine Codex|last=Sahagún|first=Bernadino|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

[[File:Kodeks tudela 21.jpg|right|250px|thumb|''[[Codex Tudela]]''.]]Visual accounts of Aztec sacrificial practice are principally found in codices and some Aztec statuary. Many visual renderings in the codices were created for Spanish patrons, and thus may reflect European preoccupations and prejudices. Produced during the 16th century, the most prominent codices include the [[Codex Ríos|Ríos]], [[Codex Tudela|Tudela]], [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis|Telleriano-Remensis]], [[Codex Magliabechiano|Magliabechiano]], and Sahagún’s [[Florentine Codex|Florentine]]. A contrast is offered in the few Aztec statues that depict sacrificial victims, which show an Aztec understanding of sacrifice. Rather than showing a preoccupation with debt repayment, they emphasize the mythological narratives that resulted in human sacrifices, and often underscore the political legitimacy of the Aztec state.&lt;ref name="townsend79"&gt;{{Cite book|title=State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan|last=Townsend|first=Richard|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University|year=1979|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[Coyolxauhqui]] stone found at the foot of the [[Templo Mayor]] commemorates the mythic slaying of Huitzilopochli's sister for the [[matricide]] of [[Coatlicue]]; it also, as Cecelia Kline has pointed out, "served to warn potential enemies of their certain fate should they try to obstruct the state's military ambitions".&lt;ref&gt;

In addition to the accounts provided by Sahagún and Durán, there are other important texts to be considered.

[[Juan de Grijalva]], [[Hernán Cortés]], Juan Díaz, Bernal Díaz, Andrés de Tapia, Francisco de Aguilar, Ruy González and the Anonymous Conqueror wrote about the Conquest of Mexico. Martyr d'Anghiera, Lopez de Gomara, Oviedo y Valdes and Illescas, while not in Mesoamerica, wrote their accounts based on interviews with the participants. [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] and Sahagún arrived later to [[New Spain]] but had access to direct testimony, especially of the indigenous people.

===Juan de Grijalva and Juan Díaz===
[[Juan de Grijalva]] was one of the first Spaniards to explore Mexico and traveled on his expedition in 1518 with [[Juan Díaz (Spanish conquistador)|Juan Díaz]]. Diaz wrote ''Itinerario de Grijalva'' before 1520, in which he describes the aftermath of a sacrifice on an island off the coast of [[Veracruz]]. He said,&lt;blockquote&gt;When he reached said tower the Captain asked him why such deeds were committed there and the Indian answered that it was done as a kind of sacrifice and gave to understand that the victims were beheaded on the wide stone; that the blood was poured into the vase and that the heart was taken out of the breast and burnt and offered to the said idol. The fleshy parts of the arms and legs were cut off and eaten. This was done to the enemies with whom they were at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=Zelia|date=1910|title=The Island of Sacrificios|url=|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=12|pages=258|via=|doi=10.1525/aa.1910.12.2.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bernal Díaz===
{{Main|The Conquest of New Spain}}

[[Bernal Díaz]] corroborates Juan Díaz's history:

{{quote|On these altars were idols with evil looking bodies, and that every night five Indians had been sacrificed before them; their chests had been cut open, and their arms and thighs had been cut off. The walls were covered with blood. We stood greatly amazed and gave the island the name ''isleta de Sacrificios'' [Islet of Sacrifices].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The Conquest of New Spain'' Díaz recounted that, after landing on the coast, they came across a temple dedicated to Tezcatlipoca. "That day they had sacrificed two boys, cutting open their chests and offering their blood and hearts to that accursed idol". Díaz narrates several more sacrificial descriptions on the later Cortés expedition. Arriving at [[Great Pyramid of Cholula|Cholula]], they find "cages of stout wooden bars ... full of men and boys who were being fattened for the sacrifice at which their flesh would be eaten".&lt;ref&gt;Díaz (op. cit.), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; When the conquistadors reached Tenochtitlan, Díaz described the sacrifices at the Great Pyramid:
{{quote|They strike open the wretched Indian's chest with flint knives and hastily tear out the palpitating heart which, with the blood, they present to the idols&amp;nbsp;... They cut off the arms, thighs and head, eating the arms and thighs at ceremonial banquets. The head they hang up on a beam, and the body is ... given to the beasts of prey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9511/dsouza.html] [[Dinesh D'Souza]]'s article&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Bernal Díaz, the chiefs of the surrounding towns, for example [[Cempoala]], would complain on numerous occasions to Cortés about the perennial need to supply the Aztecs with victims for human sacrifice. It is clear from his description of their fear and resentment toward the Mexicas that, in their opinion, it was no honor to surrender their kinsmen to be sacrificed by them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Conquest of New Spain]]'', chap. XLVI&lt;/ref&gt;

At the town of Cingapacigna Cortez told the chiefs that for them to become friends and brothers of the Spaniards they must end the practice of making sacrifices. According to Bernal Diaz: {{quote| Every day we saw sacrificed before us three, four or five Indians whose hearts were offered to the idols and their blood plastered on the walls, and their feet, arms and legs of the victims wer cut off and eaten, just as in our country we eat beef bought from the butchers. I even believe that they sell it by retain in the ''tianguez'' as they call their markets.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Conquest of New Spain]]'', chap. XXXV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On meeting a group of inhabitants from Cempoala who gave Cortes and his men food and invited them to their village:
{{quote|Cortes thanked them and made much of them, and we continued our march and slept in another small town, where also many sacrifices had been made, but as many readers will be tired of hearing of the great number of Indian men and women whom we found sacrificed in all the towns and roads we passed, I shall go on with my story without saying any more about them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Conquest of New Spain]]'', chap. XXIX&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Hernán Cortés and the Anonymous Conquistador ===
Cortés was the Spanish conquistador whose expedition to Mexico in 1519 led to the fall of the Aztecs, and led to the conquering of vast sections of Mexico on behalf of the [[Crown of Castile]].

Cortés wrote of Aztec sacrifice on numerous occasions, one of which in his ''Letters,'' he states:

{{quote|They have a most horrid and abominable custom which truly ought to be punished and which until now we have seen in no other part, and this is that, whenever they wish to ask something of the idols, in order that their plea may find more acceptance, they take many girls and boys and even adults, and in the presence of these idols they open their chests while they are still alive and take out their hearts and entrails and burn them before the idols, offering the smoke as sacrifice. Some of us have seen this, and they say it is the most terrible and frightful thing they have ever witnessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Esto habemos visto algunos de nosotros, y los que lo han visto dicen que es la más cruda y espantosa cosa de ver que jamás han visto.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}The Anonymous Conquistador was an unknown travel companion of Cortés who wrote ''[[Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitan]]'' which details Aztec sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famsi.org/research/christensen/anon_con/section16.htm] - [[Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitan]], México, Chapter XV, written by a Companion of Hernán Cortés, The Anonymous Conquistador.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anonymous Conquistador wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;They lead him to the temple, where they dance and carry on joyously, and the man about to be sacrificed dances and carries on like the rest. At length the man who offers the sacrifice strips him naked, and leads him at once to the stairway of the tower where is the stone idol. Here they stretch him on his back, tying the hands to the sides and fastening the legs ... Soon comes the sacrificing priest—and this is no small office among them—armed with a stone knife, which cuts like steel, and is as big as one of our large knives. He plunges the knife into the breast, opens it, and tears out the heart hot and palpitating. And this as quickly as one might cross himself. At this point the chief priest of the temple takes it, and anoints the mouth of the principal idol with the blood; then filling his hand with it he flings it towards the sun, or towards some star, if it be night. Then he anoints the mouths of all the other idols of wood and stone, and sprinkles blood on the cornice of the chapel of the principal idol. Afterwards they burn the heart, preserving the ashes as a great relic, and likewise they burn the body of the sacrifice, but these ashes are kept apart from those of the heart in a different vase.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous Conquistador. ''Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitan''. XV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Archaeological evidence of human sacrifice ==
Modern excavations in Mexico City have found evidence of human sacrifice in the form of hundreds of skulls at the site of old temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal | last =Wade |first =Lizzie |title =Aztec Human Sacrifice: Feeding the Gods |year = 2018 |journal=Science|volume=360 |issue=6395 |pages=1288-1292 |doi=10.1126/science.360.6395.1288 |publisher=Science Magazine |url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6395/1288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological explanation===
{{Main| Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America}}
Different anthropological or other sources have attempted to explain a possible ecological explanation of the need for human sacrifices to supplement overall Aztec diet. Harner's main argument lies within his claim that cannibalism is needed to assist the diet of the Aztecs. He claimed that very high population pressure and an emphasis on maize agriculture, without domesticated herbivores, led to a deficiency of essential amino acids amongst the Aztecs.&lt;ref name="Harner 1977 117–135" /&gt; As population increased and the amount of available game decreased, the Aztecs had to compete with other carnivorous mammals, such as dogs, to find food. Harner believes that although intensified agricultural practices provided the Aztec society a surplus of carbohydrates, they did not provide sufficient nutritional balance;&lt;ref name="Harner 1977 117–135" /&gt; for this reason, the cannibalistic consumption of sacrificed humans was needed to supply an appropriate amount of protein per individual. Harris, author of ''[[Cannibals and Kings]]'', has propagated the claim, originally proposed by Harner, that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16420059|title=Cannibals and kings : the origins of cultures|last=1927-2001.|first=Harris, Marvin,|date=1978|publisher=Fontana|isbn=9780006356035|location=[London]|oclc=16420059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bernard Ortiz Montellano offers a counter argument and points out the faults of Harner's sources. First off, Ortiz challenges Harner's claim of the Aztecs needing to compete with other carnivorous mammals for protein packed food. Many other types of foods were available to the Aztecs, including meat from salamanders, fowls, armadillos, and weasels.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Montellano|first=Bernard R. Ortiz|date=1983-06-01|title=Counting Skulls: Comment on the Aztec Cannibalism Theory of Harner-Harris|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1983.85.2.02a00130/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=85|issue=2|pages=403–406|doi=10.1525/aa.1983.85.2.02a00130|issn=1548–1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resources were also plenty available due to their need to subsist in Lake Texcoco, the place where the Aztecs had created their home. In addition, even if no herbivores were available to eat, the nutrients needed were found in the leaves and seeds of amaranth which also provided protein.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Lastly, the Aztecs had a highly structured system in which ''chinampas'' and tribute provided a surplus of materials and therefore ensured the Aztec were able to meet their caloric needs.

Ortiz's argument helps to frame and evaluate the gaps within Harner's argument. Part of the issue with Harner's reasoning for Aztec use of cannibalism was the lack of reliability of his sources. Harner recognized the numbers he used may be contradicting or conflicting with other sources, yet he continued to use these sources and claimed them as reliable. Ortiz qualifies Harner's sources as Spanish propaganda, and states the need to critique primary sources of interactions with the Aztecs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By dehumanizing and villainizing Aztec culture, the Spaniards were able to justify their own actions for conquest. Therefore, encounters with sacrificial cannibalism were grossly exaggerated and Harner used the sources to aid his argument.  Overall, ecological factors alone are not sufficient to account for human sacrifice and, more recently, it is posited that religious beliefs have a significant effect on motivation.&lt;ref name="Winkelman"&gt;Winkelman, Michael. "[http://asu.academia.edu/michaelwinkelman/Papers/512947/Aztec_human_sacrifice_Cross-cultural_assessments_of_the_ecological_hypothesis Aztec human sacrifice: Cross-cultural assessments of the ecological hypothesis]". ''Ethnology'' Vol 37 No. 3 1998 pp. 285–298&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious explanation ===
Sacrifices were ritualistic and symbolic acts accompanying huge feasts and festivals, and were a way to properly honor the gods. Victims usually died in the "center stage" amid the splendor of dancing troupes, percussion orchestras, elaborate costumes and decorations, carpets of flowers, crowds of thousands of commoners, and all the assembled elite. Aztec texts frequently refer to human sacrifice as ''neteotoquiliztli'', "the desire to be regarded as a god".&lt;ref&gt;Duran, ''Book of the Gods and Rites'', p. 177 Note 4&lt;/ref&gt; These members of the society became an ''ixiptla''—that is, a god's representative, image or idol.

[[File:Aztec sacrificial knives.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ceremonial offering of Aztec sacrificial knife blades ''tecpatlixquahua'' {{IPA-nah|tekpat͡ɬiʃˈkawa|}}&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;''Nahuatl dictionary.''(1997). Wired humanities project. Retrieved September 2, 2012, from [http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso link].&lt;/ref&gt; at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.]]

For each festival, at least one of the victims took on the paraphernalia, habits, and attributes of the god or goddess whom they were dying to honor or appease. Through this performance, it was said that the divinity had been given 'human form'—that the god now had an ''ixitli'' (face).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Duran says such victims were 'worshipped&amp;nbsp;... as the deity'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or 'as though they had been gods'.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Even whilst still alive, ''ixiptla'' victims were honored, hallowed and addressed very highly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Particularly the young man who was indoctrinated for a year to submit himself to Tezcatlipoca's temple was the Aztec equivalent of a celebrity, being greatly revered and adored to the point of people "kissing the ground" when he passed by.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagún, ''Historia general'', op. cit, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Posthumously, their remains were treated as actual relics of the gods which explains why victims' skulls, bones and skin were often painted, bleached, stored and displayed, or else used as ritual masks and oracles. For example, Diego Duran's informants told him that whoever wore the skin of the victim who had portrayed god [[Xipe Totec|Xipe]] (Our Lord the Flayed One) felt he was wearing a holy relic. He considered himself 'divine'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Political explanation===
Politically human sacrifice was important in Aztec culture as a way to represent a social hierarchy between their own culture and the enemies surrounding their city. Additionally, it was a way to structure the society of the Aztec culture itself.&lt;ref&gt;Peregrine, Peter N, and Melvin Ember. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy of cities like Tenochtitlan were tiered with the ''Tlatoani'' (emperor) on the top, the remaining nobles (''pipiltin'') next who managed the land owned by the emperor. Then the warriors, the ''pochteca'' (merchants), commoners and farmers. Then the lowest level of the hierarchy consisted of slaves and indentured servants.&lt;ref&gt;Peregrine, Peter N, and Melvin Ember. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The only way of achieving social mobility was through successful performance as a warrior. This shows how important capturing enemies for sacrifice was as it was the singular way of achieving some type of "nobility".

Within the system of organization based on hierarchy, there was also a social expectation contributing to the status of an individual at the time of their sacrifice. An individual was punished if unable to confidently address their own sacrifice, i.e. the person acted cowardly beforehand instead of brave.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then, instead of being sacrificed honorably, their lowly death paralleled their new lowly status. Where one's body traveled in the afterlife also depended on the type of death awarded to the individual. Those who died while being sacrificed or while battling in war went to the second-highest heaven, while those who died of illness were the lowest in the hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those going through the lowest hierarchy of death were required to undergo numerous torturous trials and journeys, only to culminate in a somber underworld. Additionally, death during Flower Wars was considered much more noble than death during regular military endeavors.

[[File:John Vassall 1984.jpg|thumb|right|John Vassall, photographed in 1984]]
'''William John Christopher Vassall''' (20 September 1924 &amp;ndash; 18 November 1996) was a [[British people|British]] [[Civil service|civil servant]] who spied for the [[Soviet Union]], allegedly under pressure of [[blackmail]], from 1954 until his arrest in 1962. Although operating only at a junior level, he was able to provide details of naval technology which were crucial to the modernising of the [[Soviet Navy]]. He was sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment, and was released in 1972 after ten. The Vassall scandal greatly embarrassed the [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] government, but was soon eclipsed by the more dramatic [[Profumo affair]].

==Early life==
Born in 1924 and known throughout his life as John Vassall, he was the son of William Vassall, chaplain at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], London, and Mabel Andrea Sellicks, a nurse at the same hospital.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Martland 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Monmouth School]]. In [[World War II]], he worked as a photographer for the [[Royal Air Force]]. After the war, in 1948, he became a clerk (clerical officer)  at the [[Admiralty]].

Although his father was an [[Church of England|Anglican]] priest, his mother [[Religious conversion|converted]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], a decision that led to tensions within their marriage. John himself converted in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Vassall 1975, pp. 12–13, 26–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spying career==
In 1952, Vassall was appointed, still as a clerical officer, to the staff of the [[Military attaché|Naval Attaché]] at the British embassy in [[Moscow]]. There, he said later, he found himself socially isolated by the snobberies and class hierarchies of diplomatic life, his loneliness further exacerbated by his [[homosexuality]], which was still illegal in both Britain and the Soviet Union at the time.&lt;ref name=koymasky&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biov1/vass1.html |title=William John Christopher Vassall |accessdate=14 June 2007 |date=16 November 2002 |work=AndrejKoymasky.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606061315/http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biov1/vass1.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became acquainted with a Pole named Mikhailsky, who worked for the Embassy, and who introduced him to the homosexual underworld of Moscow. In 1954, he was invited to a party, where he was encouraged to become extremely drunk, and where he was photographed in compromising positions with several men.&lt;ref&gt;Vassall 1975, pp. 53–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tweedie 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party, arranged by the [[KGB]], had been a classic "[[Recruitment of spies#Love, honeypots, and recruitment|honeytrap]]". The Soviets used the photographs to blackmail Vassall into working for them as a spy, initially in the Moscow embassy, and later in London, following his return there in June 1956. He returned to the [[Admiralty]], where he worked first in the [[Naval Intelligence Division]], and then, as the clerical officer assistant to the Private Secretary, in the Private Office of [[Tam Galbraith]], a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician and [[Civil Lord of the Admiralty]]. At the time of his arrest he was working in Military Branch II. During his espionage career, Vassall provided the Soviets with several thousand classified documents, including information on British radar, torpedoes, and anti-submarine equipment. His obituary-writer in ''[[The Times]]'' commented that "Vassall was never more than a low-level functionary, but there was nothing low-level about the damage he was able to inflict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Anon. |title=Obituary: John Vassall |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=6 December 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Chapman Pincher]] regarded Vassall as "the classic example of the spy who, while of lowly rank, can inflict enormous damage because of the excellence of his access to secret information". Pincher continued: "I am in no doubt that the recruitment and running of Vassall was a major triumph for the K.G.B. He provided information of the highest value to the Soviet defence chiefs in their successful drive to expand and modernise the [[Soviet Navy|Red Navy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pincher 1984, pp. 283–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Rebecca West]], in her book ''The New Meaning of Treason'' (1964) demurred from the notion that Vassall was "a weak and silly little man … This was unlikely to be the correct view of a man who for seven years had carried on an occupation [espionage] demanding unremitting industry in a skilled craft carried on in clandestine conditions, an endless capacity for dissimulation, and sustained contempt for personal danger." West termed him, rather, "a professional spy, working within the conventions of his profession, [who] had no more been blackmailed into the exercise of his profession than any lawyer". West suggested that the claim of blackmail was "putting up a smoke-screen to conceal what he had done." Observing that Vassall had been well paid by the Soviets for his spying, West wrote: "The drunken party may have taken place, but it was probably engineered so that Vassall might refer to it should his treachery ever be discovered … Only a very stupid and helpless man would have succumbed [to a blackmail threat], and Vassall was not stupid; he was extremely resourceful."&lt;ref&gt;West 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure==
Vassall was identified as a potential spy after [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], a senior member of the KGB, [[defection|defected]] to the [[United States]] in 1961. The KGB, worried that Vassall would be exposed, ordered him to cease operations until further notice. Another defector, [[Yuri Nosenko]], added to the case against Vassall, but doubts about the evidence provided by both Golitsyn and Nosenko persisted. Vassall soon resumed his work. It had become obvious to his colleagues that Vassall had some other source of income, for he moved to an expensive flat in [[Dolphin Square]], took foreign holidays, and was said to own 36 [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row suits]].&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt; His annual expenditure was later estimated at about £3,000, when his official salary was £750;&lt;ref&gt;Norton-Taylor 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; but he explained that he had an inheritance from a distant relative.

On 12 September 1962, Vassall was arrested and charged with spying. He made a full confession, and directed detectives to the cameras and films concealed in his flat.&lt;ref&gt;Vassall 1975, pp. 139–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The documents which he admitted to stealing did not account for everything believed to have been taken, however, which led to speculation that there was another spy still operating in the Admiralty. Some{{who|date=October 2015}} have suggested that Vassall was deliberately sacrificed by the KGB in an attempt to protect the other (possibly more senior) spy. In October, Vassall was sentenced to 18 years in jail.

The scandal caused the [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] government considerable embarrassment, erupting as it did at the height of the [[Cold War]], and only a year before the still more dramatic revelations of the [[Profumo affair]]. A [[Vassall Tribunal|tribunal]] was held to inquire into whether the failure to detect Vassall earlier amounted to a failure of intelligence, as many British newspapers had claimed. It also investigated suggestions that the close relations between Vassall and Galbraith had been improper. However, in its conclusions it found no evidence for impropriety, and largely exonerated the government.

==Later years==
Vassall served ten years of his sentence, in [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]], [[Maidstone (HM Prison)|Maidstone]] and [[Durham (HM Prison)|Durham]] prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Vassall 1975, pp. 147–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Many considered him to have been a relatively innocent victim of circumstances, and he was befriended in prison by the social reformer, [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Lord Longford]]. He was eventually released on parole in October 1972.

He then wrote a memoir, published in 1975 as ''Vassall: the autobiography of a spy''. He described it as "a kind of self-justification, not as regards my espionage activities, but as regards my position as a human being, and, perhaps, my ability to make and keep friends in all walks of life".&lt;ref&gt;Vassall 1975, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rex Winsbury]] called the book "[a] cross between [[Betty Kenward|Jennifer's Diary]] [the society column of ''[[Queen (magazine)|Queen]]'' magazine] and [[James Bond]], ... bewildering both for Vassall's own transparent naivety and social snobbism, ... and for the equally transparent naivety of the British Foreign Office and security forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Winsbury |first=Rex |authorlink=Rex Winsbury |title=Innocent abroad |newspaper=Financial Times |location=London |date=23 January 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian émigré [[George Mikes]] similarly concluded that it was Vassall's "vanity, his childish snobbery, his devouring ambition and complete lack of humour that pushed him so deep into the quagmire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mikes |first=George |authorlink=George Mikes |title=Weaker Vassall |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=26 January 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vassall subsequently changed his surname to Phillips, settled in [[St John's Wood]], London, and worked quietly as an administrator at the [[British Records Association]], and for a firm of solicitors in [[Gray's Inn]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;''Telegraph'' Obituary, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He died after suffering a heart-attack on a London bus in November 1996: it was not until nearly three weeks later that the press became aware of his death.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Media portrayals==
The suggestion of an improper relationship between Vassall and Tam Galbraith inspired a memorable sketch on the satirical BBC programme ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'', broadcast in 1963, in which [[Lance Percival]] played a senior civil servant detecting sexual innuendo in such conventional pleasantries as the [[salutation]] "My Dear Vassall" at the beginning of a letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lance Percival – obituary |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=8 September 2015 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11335607/Lance-Percival-obituary.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 the [[BBC]] broadcast a [[docudrama]] about the affair, in which Vassall was played by [[John Normington]] as "weak, vain and keen to be thought a gentleman".&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt; The play caused some controversy when it became known that neither Lady Hayter, the Ambassador's wife when Vassall arrived in Moscow, nor Captain [[Geoffrey Bennett]], the naval attaché, had been consulted or advised that they were to be portrayed: they only learnt when ''[[Radio Times]]'' was published four days before the broadcast.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''Joseph Rowntree''' (24 May 1836 – 24 February 1925) was an English [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] philanthropist and businessman from [[York]]. Rowntree is perhaps best known for being a champion of social reform, partner and friend of [[Charles_Booth_(philanthropist)|Charles Booth]], and his time as a [[chocolatier]] at family business ''[[Rowntree's]]'', one of the most important in Britain. Even as a powerful businessman, he was deeply interested in improving the [[quality of life]] of his employees; this led to him becoming a philanthropist, pursuing many [[charitable organization|charitable causes]]. In 1904 he created [[Rowntree trusts|three trusts]], the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation|Joseph Rowntree Village Trust]] (JRVT) which was originally set up to build and manage the garden village of [[New Earswick]], the [[Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust]] (JRCT) and the Joseph Rowntree Social Services Trust (JRSST). The latter two were both set up to effect social reform, the difference between them being that whereas the Charitable Trust was set up as a charity, the Social Services Trust was set up as a limited company so that if necessary it would be able to undertake social and political work not legally allowed by a charitable Trust. He suggested that only the JRVT would be permanent but in fact all the trusts are still in existence although the Social Services Trust has changed its name to the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust and with the separation of the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust from the Village Trust in 1968, there are now four trusts that exist today.

==Early life==
Rowntree was born the son of Sarah and [[Joseph Rowntree (educationist)|Joseph Rowntree]], on Pavement Street in York where his father owned a grocer's shop.&lt;ref name="Vernon2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Vernon|title=Quaker Business Man: The Life of Joseph Rowntree|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-38160-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Bootham School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/view/article/35857 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At fourteen he accompanied his father on a visit to Ireland, and witnessed the effects of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]].&lt;ref name=jrfbiog&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/biography.html Joseph Rowntree Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829193103/http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/biography.html |date=29 August 2008 }} – ''[[Joseph Rowntree Foundation|The Joseph Rowntree Foundation]]'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This experience was to provide the grounding for his political views and business ideas later in life.

== Career ==
He started working in his [[Joseph Rowntree (educationist)|father's]] grocery business as an apprentice the following year, and after his father's death in 1859 he took over the running, jointly managing the business with his brother [[John Stephenson Rowntree]].
[[File:Joseph Rowntree house in York.jpg|thumb|The house where Rowntree lived, on Bootham in York.]]
In 1869 he joined his brother, [[Henry Isaac Rowntree]], who owned a chocolate factory in York.   When Henry Isaac died in 1883, Joseph became the owner of the company.  Joseph pursued his progressive ideas within the running of [[Rowntree's]], in the design of the new factory opened in 1881, and in the business practices followed therein, including the founding of one of the first [[Retirement plan|Occupational Pension Schemes]].&lt;ref name=jrfbiog /&gt;

The company, [[Rowntree's]], grew from 30 to over 4,000 employees by the end of the 19th century making it Britain's eightieth largest manufacturing employer.&lt;ref name=JRBODNB /&gt; It merged with John Mackintosh and Co. in 1969 and was taken over by [[Nestlé]] in 1988.

He had two marriages, to Julia Eliza Seebohm in 1862 who died in 1863, and then to her cousin Emma Antoinette Seebohm in 1867 with whom he had six children.&lt;ref name=JRBODNB&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35857 Joseph Rowntree Biography] – ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; The social investigator [[Seebohm Rowntree]] was one of their children.

Joseph Rowntree's grave, along with many other members of his family, can be seen in the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] cemetery within the grounds of [[The Retreat]] on Heslington Road, [[York]].

Philosophical and political views: Joseph Rowntree was a supporter of liberal values, and was anxious to improve the quality of life of his employees. He provided them with a library, free education, a works magazine, a social welfare officer, a doctor, a dentist and a pension fund.

==The Joseph Rowntree School==
The [[Joseph Rowntree School]] was built in York in 1942 by the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust. In 2010 the school relocated to new premises costing £29 million. Students refer to it as "Jo Ro".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex Joseph Rowntree School pupils invited to step back into the classroom|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/4862833.Ex_Joseph_Rowntree_School_pupils_invited_to_step_back_into_the_classroom/|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=York Press|date=21 Jan 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Joseph Rowntree statue campaign==
A campaign was started in summer 2012 to put a statue of Joseph Rowntree at a prominent site in the centre of York, with a [[Facebook]] page – "A Joseph Rowntree statue for York City Centre" – that stated: "York should be proud of its greatest son! This campaign aims to place a statue of Joseph Rowntree, philanthropist, social reformer, and chocolatier, in Parliament Square, York, on the site of the repulsed and now-demolished toilet block."&lt;ref&gt;Kate Liptrot, [http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/9884273.Campaign_for_statue_of_Joseph_Rowntree/ "Campaign for statue of Joseph Rowntree on former “splash palace” site in York"], ''The Press'', 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judaeo-Portuguese''', or '''Lusitanic''', is the extinct [[Jewish language]] that was used by the [[Portuguese Jews|Jews]] of [[Portugal]].

== Description ==
It was the vernacular of [[Sephardi Jews]] in [[Portugal]] before the 16th century and also in many places of the Portuguese Jewish diaspora. Its texts were written in the [[Hebrew script]] (''[[aljamiado|aljamiado português]]'') or the [[Latin alphabet]].

As Portuguese Jews intermarried with other expelled Sephards, the language influenced the nearby [[Judeo-Spanish]]. Close similarity to Standard [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] made Judeo-Portuguese go extinct in Portugal, having survived in everyday usage in the diaspora until the late 18th/early 19th century. Judeo-Portuguese influenced the [[Papiamento]] and [[Saramaccan language|Saramaccan]] languages.

'''Københavns Lufthavne''' is a [[public limited company]] that operates two [[airport]]s in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Airport]] and [[Roskilde Airport]]. In addition, the company previously held a 49% stake in [[Newcastle International Airport]] and 10% of [[Aeropuertos del Sureste]] that operated nine airports in [[Mexico]].

The largest owners of Københavns Lufthavne are [[Macquarie Infrastructure Company]] (52.4%) and the [[Government of Denmark]] (39.2%).  The company was created by the government in 1925 to operate the airport. Until 1990 the company was a government enterprise called '''Københavns Lufthavnsvæsen'''. In 1990 it was transformed to a [[aktieselskab|limited company]]. The government sold 25% of its stake in the company in 1994, and Københavns Lufthavne was listed on the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. In 1996 and 2000 the government sold additional 24% and 17%, respectively.

Ethnologue: Languages of the world, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=AR Online version: Languages of Argentina], Retrieved on 2007-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of some now [[extinct languages]].

==Spanish==
{{Original research section|date=July 2010}}
{{Main|Argentine Spanish}}
Argentina is predominantly a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country — the fourth largest after [[Mexico]], [[Spain]], and [[Colombia]] (according to a compilation of national census figures and [[United Nations]] estimates, see [[Spanish speaking countries#List of countries with Spanish-speaking populations|List of countries with Spanish-speaking populations]]). Based on the 2010 national census and supporting research, there are about 40.9 million Spanish speakers in Argentina (almost the entire population).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indec.mecon.ar/ INDEC national census estimates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221215704/http://www.indec.mecon.ar/ |date=2016-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmlaruta.com/noticias/ver_nota.php?id=8936 Aún hay niños que sólo hablan el guaraní y no entienden el castellano]&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina is one of several Spanish-speaking countries (along with [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and [[Costa Rica]]) that almost universally use what is known as ''[[voseo]]''—the use of the [[pronoun]] ''vos'' instead of ''tú'' (the familiar "you") as well as its corresponding verb forms. The most prevalent dialect is ''[[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]]'', whose speakers are located primarily in the basin of the [[Río de la Plata]].

A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of [CONICET] and the [[University of Toronto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colantoni, Laura and Gurlekian|first=Jorge|year=2004|title=Convergence and intonation: historical evidence from Buenos Aires Spanish|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/convergence-and-intonation-historical-evidence-from-buenos-aires-spanish/A00B78ED8A23C98AA997E8D9B51769C9|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=7|pages=107–119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the intonation [[Rioplatense Spanish|Porteño Spanish]] is unlike that of other Spanish varieties, and suggested that it may be a result of convergence with Italian. [[Italy|Italian]] immigration influenced ''[[Lunfardo]]'', the slang spoken in the Río de la Plata region, permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other regions as well.

As in other large countries, the accents vary depending on geographical location. Extreme differences in pronunciation can be heard within [[Argentina]]. One notable pronunciation difference found in [[Argentina]] is the “sh” sounding y and ll. In most Spanish speaking countries the letters y and ll are pronounced somewhat like the “y” in yo-yo, however in most parts of Argentina they are pronounced like “sh” in English (such as "shoe") or like "zh" (such as the sound the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;s&gt; makes in "measure").&lt;/nowiki&gt;

As previously mentioned ''voseo'' is commonly used in Argentina. See the article on [[voseo]] for more details.

In many of the central and north-eastern areas of the country the trilled /r/ takes on the same sound as the &lt;ll&gt; and &lt;y&gt; ('zh' - a voiced palatal fricative sound, similar to the "s" in the English pronunciation of the word "vision".) For Example, “Río Segundo” sounds like “Zhio Segundo” and “Corrientes” sounds like “Cozhientes”.

The [[ISO639]] code for Argentine Spanish is "es-AR".

== Italian ==

Argentina has more than 1,500,000 [[Italian language|Italian]] speakers; this tongue is the second most spoken language in the nation as a native language.{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}}{{efn-ua|Many elder people also speak a [[macaronic language]] of Italian and Spanish called ''[[cocoliche]]'', which was originated by the Italian immigrants in the late 19th century.}} [[Italy|Italian]] [[immigration]], which effectively began in the middle of the 19th century and reached its peak in the first two decades of the 20th century, made a lasting and significant impact on the pronunciation and vernacular of Argentina's variety of Spanish, giving it an Italian flair. In fact, Italian dialects (not Standard Italian) have contributed so much to Rioplatense that many foreigners mistake it for Italian.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Levantine Arabic ==

There are around one million [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speakers in Argentina,&lt;ref name="LAR"/&gt; as a result of immigration from the [[Middle East]], mostly from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

== More than 100,000 speakers ==

=== Quechua ===
[[South Bolivian Quechua]] is a [[Quechuan language]] spoken by some 800,000 people, mostly immigrants who have arrived in the last years.  There are an estimated 70,000 speakers in [[Salta Province]].  The language is also known as Central Bolivian Quechua, which has six dialects. It is classified as a Quechua II language and is referred to as Quechua IIC by linguists.

=== German ===
[[Standard German]] is spoken by between 400,000&lt;ref name="LAR"/&gt; and 500,000&lt;ref name="website"&gt;WorldLanguage [http://www.worldlanguage.com/Italian/Countries/Argentina.htm website]. Retrieved on 2007-01-29&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yiddish ===
There are around 200,000 [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] speakers in Argentina.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

=== Guaraní ===
[[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] is spoken by 200,000 people,{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}} mostly in Corrientes (where it is official ''de jure'') and Misiones.&lt;ref name=gn&gt;{{cite Argentine law|jur=CN|l=5598|date=22 de octubre de 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalan ===
There are 174,000 speakers of the [[Catalan language]].{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}}

=== Mapudungun ===
[[Mapudungun]] is spoken by 100,000 [[Mapuche]] people in the provinces of [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Province of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]], and [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]].

== More than 1,000 speakers ==

[[Chinese language|Chinese]] is spoken by at least half of the over 60,000 Chinese immigrants, mostly in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/09/22/conexiones/t-01276347.htm Jóvenes Argenchinos] Clarin.com 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wichí languages|Wichí]] is an indigenous language spoken by 53,700 people, mainly in Chaco{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}} where, along with [[Kom language (South America)|Kom]] and [[Moqoit language|Moqoit]], it is official ''de jure''.&lt;ref name=kom&gt;{{cite Argentine law|jur=CC|l=6604|bo=9092|date=28 de julio de 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vlax Romani language|Vlax Romani]] is spoken by 52,000 people.{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}}

[[Japanese language|Japanese]] is spoken by 32,000 people.{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}}

[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is spoken by 27,000 people.{{sfn|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2014}}

[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=crq Online version: Chorote, Iyo'wujwa], Retrieved on 2007-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

== More than 100 speakers ==

Several Native American languages spoken in Argentina by the native people (1% of the population) are declining at rates that may result in only a handful of speakers within a generation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Kaiwá language|Kaiwá]] has 512 speakers, [[Nivaclé language|Nivaclé]] 200, [[Tapieté]] and [[Wichí Lhamtés Nocten]] only 100. These indigenous languages have suffered slow linguistic and cultural genocide. In this category in terms of number of speakers, one can also include some immigrant languages for instance [[Plautdietsch]] with only 140.

== Endangered languages ==

Some languages are critically endangered, spoken only by a handful of isolated elderly people whose children do not speak the language;&lt;ref name="LAR"/&gt; they are likely to become dead languages once the remaining speakers die. [[Vilela language|Vilela]] has about 20 speakers; [[Puelche]] has 5 or 6 speakers; in 2000 [[Chon languages|Tehuelche]] had 4 speakers, out of about 200 ethnic Tehuelche people, (2000 W. Adelaar); and in 1991 [[Ona language|Selk'nam]] (also known as Ona) had 1 to 3 speakers and is nearly extinct; full blooded Ona people are already extinct. Most endangered speakers speak {{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

== Extinct languages ==

[[Abipón language|Abipón]], [[Cacán language|Cacán]], [[Chané language|Chané]] and [[Haush language|Haush]] are now extinct languages that were spoken by people indigenous to Argentina before European contact. Very little is known of Cacán and Chané.

The Abipón language was a Native American language of the [[Mataco–Guaycuru]] family that was spoken by the [[Abipón people]].&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;John Mackenzie (ed.), ''Peoples, Nations and Cultures''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cacán was spoken by [[Diaguita]] and [[Calchaquí]] aboriginals, and became extinct during the late 17th century or early 18th century; the only manuscript documenting this language was lost, and now there is not enough information to make it possible to link it to any existing language family.&lt;ref name="gencat"&gt;{{cite web

Chané was spoken in the [[Salta Province]], and was either a [[dialect]] of or closely related to the [[Terena language]] of the [[Arawakan]] [[language family]].&lt;ref name="LAR"/&gt;

The Haush language, belonging to the [[Chonan languages|Chonan]] family, was an indigenous language spoken by the [[Haush people]] and was  formerly spoken on the island of [[Tierra del Fuego]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar, Willen F. H. and Pieter Muysken.

Page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cocoliche]], a Spanish-Italian creole, was spoken mainly by first and second-generation immigrants from Italy, but is no longer in daily use; it is sometimes used in comedy.  Some Cocoliche terms were adopted into Lunfardo slang.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== Other languages ==

[[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and [[Vlax Romani]] are all reportedly spoken, but the number of speakers are not known.&lt;ref name="LAR"/&gt; Many [[Aymara language|Aymará]] speakers have migrated to Argentina for sugar mill and other work; of more than 2.2 million speakers globally, many are in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005.

'''Le Cercle des Gourmettes''' was an exclusive club or "circle" of women in [[Paris]] devoted to [[Gourmet|gourmet food]]. The circle was started in 1929 by an American, Paulette Edlinger, and the name may have been a [[bon mot]] in protest of the non-feminine form of the word ''gourmet''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Le Trésor de la Langue Française Informatisé'', where ''gourmet'' is a masculine noun meaning ''foodie'', but ''gourmette'' is a feminine word for ''bling'' or ''bracelet''. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Guagnini | first =Enrico | title =Gourmettes | journal =Grand Gourmet | date =September 1996 | language = Italian}} reprinted in {{Citation | last =Guagnini | first =Enrico | title =LE GOUREMETTES CAMBIANO DIZIONARIO | journal =Bolgher News | volume =2 | issue =12 | pages =4 | date =April 11, 2010 | language =Italian | url =http://www.nextec.it/bolgherinews/bolgherinewsn12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club began at a time of economic prosperity just prior to the [[Great Depression in France]]. It was started by the wives of members of [[Club des Cent]] and convened on alternate Fridays to enjoy lunches and dinners at the electric company headquarters in Paris, Electricité et Gaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Child | first =Julia | last2 = Prud'homme | first2 = Alex | title =[[My Life in France]] | publisher =Anchor Books (Knoph Doubleday) | date =2006 | location =New York | pages =133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's most famous members were [[Julia Child]], [[Simone Beck]], and [[Louisette Bertholle]]. Each joined the club in the late 1940s.

Versions of the club later existed in Canada and Switzerland.

'''Lishana Deni''' is a modern [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Jewish Aramaic language]], often called ''[[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]]'' or ''Judeo-Aramaic''. It was originally spoken in [[northern Iraq]] and southeastern Turkey in the lands west of the [[Great Zab]] river (Athura). Following the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|exodus of Jews from the Muslim lands]], most speakers now live in [[Israel]], principally [[Jerusalem]] and surrounding villages.

The name ''Lishana Deni'' means 'our language', and is similar to names used by other [[Jew]]ish Neo-Aramaic dialects ([[Lishan Didan]], [[Lishanid Noshan]]). Other popular names for the language are ''Lishan Hozaye'', 'the language of the Jews', and ''Kurdit'', 'Kurdish'. Scholarly sources tend simply to refer to Lishana Deni as ''Zakho Jewish Neo-Aramaic'' although it was spoken in the entire region west of the Great Zab river.

== Origins ==
Various Neo-Aramaic dialects were spoken across a wide area from the [[Zakho]] region, in the west, to [[Lake Urmia]], in the northeast to [[Sanandaj]], in the southeast (the area covers northern Iraq and northwestern [[Iran]]). The upheavals in their traditional region after the [[First World War]] and the founding of the State of [[Israel]] led most of the Jews of Kurdistan to move to Jerusalem and villages nearby.

However, uprooted from northern Iraq, and thrown together with so many different language groups in the fledgling nation, Lishana Deni began to be replaced in the speech of younger generations by [[Modern Hebrew]].

Fewer than 8,000 people are known to speak Lishana Deni, and all of them are over 50 years old. Lishana Deni is written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Spelling tends to be highly phonetic, and elided letters are not written.

==Intelligibility==
The language faces extinction in the next few decades. Although there is very little intelligibility between Lishana Deni and the other Jewish dialects, there is quite reasonable intelligibility between it and the Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects spoken in the region.

The Christian dialect of [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] is closest to Lishana Deni, followed by the ''Ashiret'' dialects of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]. Like other Judaeo-Aramaic dialects, ''Lishana Deni'' is sometimes called ''[[Targum (Aramaic dialect)|Targumic]]'', due to the long tradition of translating the [[Hebrew Bible]] into [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and the production of [[targum]]im.

==Region==
Lishana Deni was spoken in Athura (which means Assyria in NENA dialects), which is located west of the Great Zab river in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey. Most Lishana Deni speakers are rural and were farmers and shepherds but there are urban speakers as well in cities such as [[Dohuk|Nohadra]], [[Zakho]], [[Amadiya|Amedya]] and more.

The regions where Lishana Deni was spoken are Bohtan, Zakho and Nineveh Plains in Upper Mesopotamia, as well as Nerwa, Sapna, Barwari and Hakkari mountains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45997">A '''microaggression''' is a term used for brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioural, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative prejudicial slights and insults toward any group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The term was coined by [[psychiatrist]] and [[Harvard University]] professor [[Chester Middlebrook Pierce|Chester M. Pierce]] in 1970 to describe insults and dismissals which he regularly witnessed non-black Americans inflicting on [[African Americans]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation| first = Derald Wing | last = Sue | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Wiley|year=2010|isbn=0-470-49140-X|location=|pages=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Multiplication Is for White People": Raising Expectations for Other People's Children|last=Delpit|first=Lisa | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=The New Press|year=2012|isbn=1-59558-046-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Stereotypes in Black and White: How Everyday Leaders Can Build Healthier Opportunities for African American Boys and Men|last=Treadwell|first=Henrie M.|publisher=Praeger | name-list-format = vanc |year=2013|isbn=1-4408-0399-4|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Counseling and Psychotherapy Theories in Context and Practice: Skills, Strategies, and Techniques|last=Sommers-Flanagan|first=Rita | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Wiley|year=2012|isbn=0-470-61793-4|location=|pages=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 21st century, use of the term was applied to the casual degradation of any socially marginalized group, including LGBT, the poor and the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paludi | first = Michele | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2010 | title = Victims of Sexual Assault and Abuse: Resources and Responses for Individuals and Families (Women's Psychology). | publisher = Praeger | page = 22 | isbn = 0-313-37970-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Derald Wing Sue]] defines microaggressions as "brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to certain individuals because of their group membership". The persons making the comments may be otherwise well-intentioned.&lt;ref name="Praege"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Managing Diversity in Today's Workplace: Strategies for Employees and Employers|last=Paludi|first=Michele A. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Praeger|year=2012|isbn=0-313-39317-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars and social commentators have critiqued the microaggression concept on various grounds, including that it is not well substantiated scientifically, that it is overly dependent on anecdotal evidence, and it assumes without sufficient evidence that slights perceived by the listener or recipient are always due to bias or prejudice. Critics also suggest that avoiding behaviours which may be interpreted as microaggressions restricts freedom and may itself cause emotional distress, and further that this robs both sides of the practice in skills to mediate disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haidt |first1=Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan |title=How Trigger Warnings Are Hurting Mental Health on Campus |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some suggest that while microaggressions are minor relative to serious offences (e.g. assault), and may be unintentional; they may be abused to exaggerate harm, resulting in disproportionate retribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Friedersdorf |first1=Conor |title=Why Critics of the 'Microaggressions' Framework Are Skeptical |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/why-critics-of-the-microaggressions-framework-are-skeptical/405106/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=2 September 2018 |date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these critics suggest that the concept is not yet developed well enough to be applied in the real world and that its current applications may be harmful to individuals and society.

== Description ==
Microaggressions have been defined as brief and common daily verbal, behavioral, and environmental communications, whether intentional or unintentional, that transmit hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to a target person because they belong to a stigmatized group.&lt;ref name="Sue, D. 2007" /&gt; Although these communications typically appear harmless to observers, they are considered a form of covert racism or everyday discrimination.&lt;ref name="Kanter 2017" /&gt; Microaggressions differ from what Pierce referred to as “macroaggressions”, which are more extreme forms of racism (such as lynchings or beatings) due to their ambiguity, size and commonality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pierce |first1=C. |editor1-last=Barbour |editor1-first=F.  | name-list-format = vanc |title=In the Black Seventies |date=1970 |publisher=Porter Sargent |location=Boston, MA |page=265-282 |ref=Pierce |chapter=Offensive mechanisms}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microaggressions are experienced by most stigmatized individuals and occur on a regular basis. These can be particularly stressful for people on the receiving end as they are easily denied by those committing them. They are also harder to detect by members of the [[dominant culture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alabi |first1=J. |date=2015 |title=Racial microaggressions in academic libraries: results of a survey of minority and non-minority librarians. |journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=47-53|url=http://aurora.auburn.edu/bitstream/handle/11200/48541/racial%20microaggressions%20in%20the%20academic%20library%20environment_for%20aurora.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are often unaware they are causing harm.&lt;ref name="Sue, D. 2007" /&gt; Sue describes microaggressions as including statements that repeat or affirm [[Stereotype|stereotypes]] about the minority group or subtly demean its members. Such comments also position the dominant culture as normal and the minority one as aberrant or pathological, express disapproval of or discomfort with the minority group, assume that all minority group members are the same, minimize the existence of discrimination against the minority group, seek to deny the perpetrator's own bias, or minimize real conflict between the minority group and the dominant culture.

In conducting two focus groups with [[Asian-Americans]], for instance, Sue proposed eight distinct themes of racial microaggression:&lt;ref name="Sue, D. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sue asian american study"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sue DW, Capodilupo CM, Torino GC, Bucceri JM, Holder AM, Nadal KL, Esquilin M | title = Racial microaggressions in everyday life: implications for clinical practice | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–86 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17516773 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.62.4.271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Alien in own land: When people assume People of Color (POC) are foreigners or from a different country.
** E.g.: "So where are you really from?" or "Why don't you have an accent?"
* Ascription of intelligence: When POC are stereotyped as being intelligent or assumed to be at a certain level of intelligence based on their race.
** E.g.: "You people always do well in school." or "If I see a lot of Asian students in my class, I know it's going to be a hard class."
* Denial of racial reality: This is when a person emphasizes that a POC does not suffer any discrimination, thus implying they do not face inequality. It correlates to the idea of [[model minority]].
* Exoticization of non-white women: It stereotypes these Americans as being in the "exotic" category. They are stereotyped by their physical appearance and gender based on media and literature. One example is Asian-American women portrayed as the submissive or obedient type; alternatively, they may be portrayed or described as Dragon Lady or Lotus Blossom, using symbols from their cultures. On the other hand, Asian-American men are portrayed as being emasculated or are seen as nerdy, weak men.
* Refusal to acknowledge intra-ethnic differences: The homogeneity of broad ethnic groups is emphasized and assumed; the speaker ignores intra-ethnic differences. The focus groups identified the statement that "all Asian-Americans look alike" as a main assumption for this theme. Similarly, thinking that all members of an ethnic minority group speak the same language or have the same values or culture falls under this theme.
* Pathologizing cultural values/communication styles: When Asian Americans' cultures and values are viewed as less desirable. For example, many people from the focus groups felt disadvantaged by the expectation in school and higher education of verbal participation in class, when Asian cultural norms value silence. Because of this discrepancy, many Asian-Americans felt that they were being forced to conform to Western cultural norms in order to succeed academically.
* Second-class citizenship: This theme emphasizes the idea that People of color are being treated as lesser beings, and are not treated with equal rights or presented as a first priority.
** E.g.: A Korean man walks into a bar and asks for a drink, but the bartender ignores the man when he serves a white man first.
* Invisibility: This theme focuses on the idea that Asian Americans are considered invisible or outside discussions of race and racism. According to some focus group members, recent dialogues on race in the United States have often focused only on issues between whites and blacks, excluding Asian-Americans.

In a 2017 peer-reviewed review of the literature, [[Scott Lilienfeld]] critiqued microaggression research for hardly having advanced beyond taxonomies such as the above, which was proposed by Sue nearly ten years ago.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lilienfeld SO | title = Microaggressions | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 138–169 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28073337 | doi = 10.1177/1745691616659391 | authorlink = Scott Lilienfeld }}&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging the reality of "subtle slights and insults directed toward minorities", Lilienfeld concluded that the concept and programs for its scientific assessment are "far too underdeveloped on the conceptual and methodological fronts to warrant real-world application".&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld2" /&gt; He recommended abandonment of the term ''microaggression'' since "the use of the root word 'aggression' in 'microaggression' is conceptually confusing and misleading". In addition, he called for a moratorium on microaggression training programs until further research can develop the field.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld2" /&gt;

In 2017 Althea Nagai, who works as a research fellow at the [[conservative]] [[Center for Equal Opportunity]], published an article criticizing microaggression research as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="nagai"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nagai|first=Althea|date=9 February 2017|title=The Pseudo-Science of Microaggressions|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/the_pseudo_science_of_microaggressions|journal=Academic Questions|publisher=Springer Nature|volume=30|issue=1|pages=47–57|doi=10.1007/s12129-016-9613-5|issn=0895-4852|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagai said that the prominent [[Critical race theory|critical race]] researchers behind microaggression theory "reject the methodology and standards of modern science."&lt;ref name="nagai" /&gt; She lists various technical shortcomings of microaggression research, including "biased interview questions, reliance on narrative and small numbers of respondents, problems of reliability, issues of replicability, and ignoring alternative explanations."&lt;ref name="nagai" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2017/08/02/rutgers-orders-freshmen-to-add-microagre|title=Rutgers Orders Freshmen to Add Microaggression to Their Course Lists|last=Marchello|first=Lindsay|date=August 2, 2017|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|access-date=August 4, 2017|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race or ethnicity ===
{{Main|Racism}}
Social scientists Sue, Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, and Torino (2007) described microaggressions as "the new face of racism", saying that the nature of racism has shifted over time from overt expressions of [[racial hatred]] and [[hate crime]]s, toward expressions of [[aversive racism]], such as microaggressions, that are more subtle, ambiguous, and often unintentional. Sue says this has led some Americans to believe wrongly that non-white Americans no longer suffer from racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://library.standrews-de.org/lists/courseguides/sas-specific_topic-research/diversity-readings/microaggressions_black.pdf|title = Racial Microaggressions Against Black Americans: Implications for Counseling| first = Derald Wing | last = Sue | name-list-format = vanc |date = Summer 2008|journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development|access-date = 11 September 2014|doi = |pmid = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such subtle expressions of racism is Asian students being either pathologized or penalized as too passive or quiet.&lt;ref name="Sue, D. 2007"/&gt; Another is a teacher correcting a student's use of "indigenous" in a paper by changing it from upper- to lowercase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/25/ucla-grad-students-stage-sit-during-class-protest-what-they-see-racially-hostile|title=UCLA grad students stage sit-in during a class to protest what they see as racially hostile climate|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sue ''et al''.,&lt;ref name="Sue, D. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sue DW, Capodilupo CM, Torino GC, Bucceri JM, Holder AM, Nadal KL, Esquilin M | title = Racial microaggressions in everyday life: implications for clinical practice | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–86 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17516773 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.62.4.271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; microaggressions seem to appear in three forms:
* Microassault: an explicit racial derogation; verbal/nonverbal; e.g. name-calling, avoidant behavior, purposeful discriminatory actions.
* Microinsult: communications that convey rudeness and insensitivity and demean a person's racial heritage or identity; subtle snubs; unknown to the perpetrator; hidden insulting message to the recipient of color.
* Microinvalidation: communications that exclude, negate, or nullify the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person belonging to a particular group.

Some psychologists have criticized microaggression theory for assuming that all verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities are necessarily due to bias.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lilienfeld SO | title = Microaggressions | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 138–169 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28073337 | doi = 10.1177/1745691616659391 | authorlink = Scott Lilienfeld }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas KR | title = Macrononsense in multiculturalism | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 274–5; discussion 277-9 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18473616 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.63.4.274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris RS | title = Racial microaggression?

Gendered microaggressions and more overt aggression can also be found in violent rape pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makin DA, Morczek AL | title = X Views and Counting: Interest in Rape-Oriented Pornography as Gendered Microaggression | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 31 | issue = 12 | pages = 2131–55 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 25724876 | doi = 10.1177/0886260515573572 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other examples of sexist microaggressions are "[addressing someone by using] a sexist name, a man refusing to wash dishes because it is 'women's work,' displaying nude pin-ups of women at places of employment, someone making unwanted sexual advances toward another person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wing |first=D.

=== Sexuality and sexual orientation ===
{{See also|Transphobia|Homophobia|Biphobia|Heterophobia}}

In [[focus group]]s, individuals identifying as [[bisexual]] report such microaggressions as others denying or dismissing their self-narratives or identity claims, being unable to understand or accept bisexuality as a possibility, pressuring them to change their bisexual identity, expecting them to be sexually promiscuous, and questioning their ability to maintain [[monogamy|monogamous]] relationships.&lt;ref name="Bostwick"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bostwick W, Hequembourg A | title = 'Just a little hint': bisexual-specific microaggressions and their connection to epistemic injustices | journal = Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 488–503 | pmid = 24666221 | doi = 10.1080/13691058.2014.889754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transgender]] people classify being labelled as being of a gender other than the one with which they identify as an example of microaggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Management: Global Issues and Promising Solutions|last=Paludi|first=Michele A. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Praeger|year=2013|isbn=0-313-39941-7|location=|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[LGBT]] individuals report receiving expressions of microaggression from people even within the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref name="Roffee Waling pp. 190–201"/&gt; They say that being excluded, or not being made welcome or understood within the gay and lesbian community is a microaggression.&lt;ref name="Bostwick"/&gt; Roffee and Waling suggest that the issue arises, as occurs among many groups of people, because a person often makes assumptions based on individual experience, and when they communicate such assumptions, the recipient may feel that it lacks taking the second individual into account and is a form of microaggression.&lt;ref name="Roffee Waling pp. 190–201"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Roffee | first=James A. | last2=Waling | first2=Andrea | name-list-format = vanc | year=2016 | title=Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ youth | journal=Safer Communities | publisher=Emerald | volume=15 | issue=4 | issn=1757-8043 | pages=190–201 | doi=10.1108/sc-02-2016-0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersectionality ===
{{Further information|Intersectionality}}

People who are members of overlapping marginal groups (e.g., a gay Asian-American man or a trans woman) experience microaggressions based in correspondingly varied forms of marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racial Microaggressions and College Student Wellbeing |date=July 25, 2013 | last = Zesiger | first = Heather | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://studenthealth.emory.edu/hp/documents/pdfs/Racial%20Microaggressions%20and%20College%20Student%20Wellbeing.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014170818/http://studenthealth.emory.edu/hp/documents/pdfs/Racial%20Microaggressions%20and%20College%20Student%20Wellbeing.pdf |archive-date=October 14, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2016}}

=== People with mental illnesses ===
{{Further|Disability abuse}}
People with mental illness report receiving more overt forms of microaggression than subtle ones, coming from family and friends as well as from authority figures.&lt;ref name=Gonzales/&gt; In a study involving college students and adults who were being treated in community care, five themes were identified: invalidation, assumption of inferiority, fear of mental illness, shaming of mental illness, and being treated as a second-class citizen.&lt;ref name=Gonzales&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonzales L, Davidoff KC, Nadal KL, Yanos PT | title = Microaggressions experienced by persons with mental illnesses: An exploratory study | journal = Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 234–41 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25402611 | doi = 10.1037/prj0000096 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268450566_Microaggressions_Experienced_by_Persons_With_Mental_Illnesses_An_Exploratory_Study }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
Members of marginalized groups have also described microaggressions committed by performers or artists associated with various forms of media, such as television, film, photography, music, and books. Some researchers believe that such cultural content reflects but also molds society,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Chester M.|last2=Carew|first2=Jean V.|last3=Pierce-Gonzalez|first3=Diane|last4=Wills|first4=Deborah| name-list-format = vanc |title=An Experiment in Racism|journal=Education and Urban Society|volume=10|issue=1|pages=61–87|doi=10.1177/001312457701000105}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for unintentional bias to be absorbed by individuals based on their media consumption, as if it were expressed by someone with whom they had an encounter. 

A study of racism in TV commercials describes microaggressions as gaining a cumulative weight, leading to inevitable clashes between races due to subtleties in the content.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; As an example of a racial microaggression, or microassault,&lt;ref name="Sue, D. 2007"/&gt; this research found that black people were more likely than white counterparts to be shown eating or participating in physical activity, and more likely to be shown working for, or serving others.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The research concludes by suggesting that microaggressive representations can be omitted from a body of work, without sacrificing creativity or profit.

The article gives examples of negative stereotypes of Mexicans and Latinos in books, print, and photos, associating them with the state of racial discourse within majority culture and its dominance over minority groups in the US. The personification of these attitudes through media can also be applied to microaggressive behaviors towards other marginalized groups. 

A 2015 review of the portrayal of LGBT characters in film &lt;!-- covering what time span and in what country? what types of film? --&gt; says that gay or lesbian characters are presented in "offensive" ways.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stein|first=Peter L. | name-list-format = vanc |date=November-December 2015|title=A cinematic trend emerges: 'gays gone bad'|journal=The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide|volume=22 (6)|pages=|via=Gale Literature Resource Center|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/9c5bb0f3946732f36afcf10f450b0c1e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=45917}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, LGBT characters portrayed as complex characters who are more than a cipher for their sexual orientation or identity are a step in the right direction. Ideally, "queer film audiences finally have a narrative pleasure that has been afforded to straight viewers since the dawn of film noir: a central character who is highly problematical, but fascinating."&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

=== Ageism and intolerance ===
Microaggression can target and marginalize any definable group, including those who share an age grouping or belief system. Microaggression is a manifestation of bullying that employs micro-linguistic power plays in order to marginalize any target with a subtle manifestation of intolerance by signifying the concept of "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gendron |first1=Tracey L. |last2=Welleford |first2=E.

== Perpetrators ==

Because perpetrators may be well-meaning and microaggressions are subtle, the recipients often experience [[attributional ambiguity]], which may lead them to dismiss the event and blame themselves as overly sensitive to the encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Internalized Oppression: The Psychology of Marginalized Groups|last = David|first = E.J.R. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = Springer Publishing Company|year = 2013|isbn = 0-8261-9925-9|location = |pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If challenged by the minority person or an observer, perpetrators will often defend their microaggression as a misunderstanding, a joke, or something small that should not be blown out of proportion.&lt;ref name="Love" /&gt;

== Effects ==

A 2013 scholarly review of the literature on microaggressions concluded that "the negative impact of racial microaggressions on psychological and physical health is beginning to be documented; however, these studies have been largely correlational and based on recall and self-report, making it difficult to determine whether racial microaggressions actually cause negative health outcomes and, if so, through what mechanisms".&lt;ref name="wong"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wong G, Derthick AO, David EJ, Saw A, Okazaki S|date=June 2014|title=How: A Review of Racial Microaggressions Research in Psychology|journal=Race and Social Problems|volume=6|issue=2|pages=181–200|doi=10.1007/s12552-013-9107-9|pmc=4762607|pmid=26913088}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 review of microaggression research pointed out that as scholars try to understand the possible harm caused by microaggressions, they have not conducted much cognitive or behavioural research, nor much experimental testing, and they have overly relied on small collections of anecdotal testimonies from samples who are not representative of any particular population.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld" /&gt;

Recipients of microaggressions may feel anger, frustration, or exhaustion. African-Americans have reported feeling under pressure to "represent" their group or to suppress their own cultural expression and "act white".&lt;ref name="Sue, D. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sue D, Capodilupo CM, Holder AM | year = 2008 | url = https://nature.berkeley.edu/garbelottoat/wp-content/uploads/sue2008.pdf | title = Racial microaggressions in the life experience of black Americans | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 39 | pages = 329–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the cumulative effect of microaggressions is thought by some to lead to diminished [[self-confidence]] and a poor [[self-image]] for individuals, and potentially also to such mental-health problems as depression, anxiety, and trauma.&lt;ref name="Love"&gt;{{cite thesis | degree = Ph.D. |title = An Emancipatory Study with African-American Women in Predominantly White Nursing Schools|last = Love|first = Katie Lynn | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = University of Connecticut |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 221|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/72975e56514073eb23b5679f036b7cd1/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sue, D. 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{Cite book|title = African Americans and Community Engagement in Higher Education: Community Service, Service-learning, and Community-based Research|last = Evans|first = Stephanie Y. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = State University of New York Press|year = 2009|isbn = 1-4384-2874-X|location = |pages = 126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lundberg"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women and Mental Disorders|last = Lundberg|first = Paula K. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = Praeger|year = 2011|isbn = 0-313-39319-2|location = |pages = 89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers have argued that microaggressions are more damaging than overt expressions of bigotry precisely because they are small and therefore often ignored or downplayed, leading the victim to feel self-doubt for noticing or reacting to the encounter, rather than justifiable anger, and isolation rather than support from others about such incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Greer | first=Tawanda M | last2=Chwalisz | first2=Kathleen | name-list-format = vanc | title=Minority-Related Stressors and Coping Processes Among African American College Students | journal=Journal of College Student Development | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | volume=48 | issue=4 | year=2007 | pages=388–404 | url=https://doi.org/10.1353/csd.2007.0037 | doi=10.1353/csd.2007.0037 | access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Solórzano |first1=Daniel |last2=Ceja |first2=Miguel |last3=Yosso |first3=Tara | name-list-format = vanc |title=Critical Race Theory, Racial Microaggressions, and Campus Racial Climate: The Experiences of African American College Students | work=Journal of Negro Education |volume=69 |number=1 |date=2000 |p=60–73 | jstor=2696265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watkins |first1=Nicole L. |last2=Labarrie |first2=Theressa L. |last3=Appio |first3=Lauren M. | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Black undergraduates’ experience with perceived racial microaggressions in predominantly White colleges and universities |p=25–58 |editor-last=Sue | editor-first=D.W. | title=Microaggressions and Marginality: Manifestation, Dynamics, and Impact | publisher=Wiley | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-470-62720-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WZxpPnnjzkC | access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have found that in the U.S. when people color perceived microaggressions from mental health professionals, client satisfaction with therapy is lower.&lt;ref name="constantine 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Constantine|first1=Madonna G. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Racial microaggressions against African American clients in cross-racial counseling relationships |journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2007|volume=54|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.54.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Owen |first1=Jesse |last2=Tao |first2=Karen W. |last3=Imel |first3=Zac E. |last4=Wampold |first4=Bruce E. |last5=Rodolfa |first5=Emil | name-list-format = vanc |title=Addressing racial and ethnic microaggressions in therapy. |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |date=2014 |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=283–290 |doi=10.1037/a0037420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Public discourse and harm to speakers ===

&lt;!-- This paragraph needs a good opening line to summarize; it's a bit of a hodge-podge --&gt;
Kenneth R. Thomas claimed in ''[[American Psychologist]]'' that recommendations inspired by microaggression theory, if "implemented, could have a chilling effect on free speech and on the willingness of White people, including some psychologists, to interact with people of color."&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; Sociologists Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning have written in the academic journal ''Comparative Sociology'' that the microaggression concept "fits into a larger class of conflict tactics in which the aggrieved seek to attract and mobilize the support of third parties" that sometimes involves "building a case for action by documenting, exaggerating, or even falsifying offenses".&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; The concept of microaggressions has been described as a symptom of the breakdown in civil discourse, and that microaggressions are "yesterday's well-meaning faux pas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Demetriou |first1=Dan |chapter=Fighting Together: Civil Discourse and Agonistic Honor|title= Honor in the Modern World: Interdisciplinary Perspectives |editor-first1 = Laurie | editor-last1 = Johnson | editor-first2 = Dan | editor-last2 = Demetriou | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Lexington Books |year=&lt;!-- unpublished --&gt; |isbn= |url=http://philpapers.org/rec/DEMFTC|access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One suggested type of microaggression by an Oxford University newsletter was avoiding eye contact or speaking directly to people. This spurred a controversy when it was pointed out that such assumptions are insensitive to autistic people who may have trouble making eye contact.&lt;ref name=eye1&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-39742670|title=Oxford sorry for eye contact racism claim|date=2017-04-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eye2&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/04/29/oxford-university-apologises-everyday-racism-advice-offended/|title=Oxford University apologises for 'everyday racism' advice which offended autistic people|last=Turner|first=Camilla|date=2017-04-29|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture of victimhood ===

In their article "[[Microaggression and Moral Cultures]]", sociologists Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Bradley |last2=Manning |first2=Jason | name-list-format = vanc |date=2014 |title=Microaggression and Moral Cultures |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15691330-12341332 |journal=Comparative Sociology |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=692–726 |doi=10.1163/15691330-12341332 |access-date=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; say that the discourse of microaggression leads to a [[Victim mentality|culture of victimhood]]. Social psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]] states that this culture of victimhood lessens an individual's "ability to handle small interpersonal matters on one's own" and "creates a society of constant and intense moral conflict as people compete for status as victims or as defenders of victims".&lt;ref name="Haidtblog1"&gt;{{Cite web | first = Jonathan | last = Haidt | name-list-format = vanc | work = Righteous Mind  |title=Where microaggressions really come from: A sociological account|url=http://righteousmind.com/where-microaggressions-really-come-from/|access-date=20 September 2015|quote=The key idea is that the new moral culture of victimhood fosters 'moral dependence' and an atrophying of the ability to handle small interpersonal matters on one's own. At the same time that it weakens individuals, it creates a society of constant and intense moral conflict as people compete for status as victims or as defenders of victims.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[John McWhorter]], linguist and social commentator suggests that "it infantilizes black people to be taught that microaggressions, and even ones a tad more macro, hold us back, permanently damage our psychology, or render us exempt from genuine competition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/07/26/starbucks-and-the-swimming-pool/|title=Starbucks and the Swimming Pool - The American Interest|date=2018-07-26|work=The American Interest|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/32618/microaggression-is-the-new-racism-on-campus/|title='Microaggression' Is the New Racism on Campus|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/15/the-privilege-of-checking-white-privilege|title=The Privilege of Checking White Privilege|last=McWhorter|first=John|date=2015-03-15|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional distress ===

In ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Greg Lukianoff]] and [[Jonathan Haidt]] expressed concern that the focus on microaggressions can cause more emotional trauma than the experience of the microaggressions at the time of occurrence. They believe that self-policing by an individual of thoughts or actions in order to avoid committing microaggressions may cause emotional harm as a person seeks to avoid becoming a microaggressor, as such extreme self-policing may share some characteristics of pathological thinking.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{Citation|last=Lukianoff|first=Greg|title=''"The Coddling of the American Mind"''|date=September 2015|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/|year=|last2=Haidt|first2=Jonathan| name-list-format = vanc |author-link=|author2-link=|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|access-date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring especially to prevention programs at schools or universities, they say that the element of protectiveness, of which identifying microaggression allegations are a part, prepares students "poorly for professional life, which often demands intellectual engagement with people and ideas one might find uncongenial or wrong".&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; They also said that it has become "unacceptable to question the reasonableness (let alone the sincerity) of someone's emotional state", resulting in adjudication of alleged microaggressions having characteristics of witch trials.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Federalist (website)|The Federalist]]'', Paul Rowan Brian argued that microaggression theory pools trivial and ignorable instances of racism with real, genuine prejudice and exclusion.&lt;ref name="Rowan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2013/12/16/unmasking-mustachioed-menace-microaggression/|title=Unmasking The Mustachioed Menace Of Microaggression | first = Paul Rowan | last = Brian | name-list-format = vanc |date=December 16, 2013|work=The Federalist}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amitai Etzioni]], writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', suggested that attention to microaggressions distracts individuals and groups from dealing with much more serious acts.&lt;ref name="Etzioni"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/dont-sweat-the-microaggressions/360278/|work=The Atlantic|title=Don't Sweat the Microaggressions|date=April 8, 2014|first=Amitai|last=Etzioni | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Derald Wing Sue, whose works popularized the term, many critiques are based on the term being misunderstood or misused. He said that his purpose in identifying such comments or actions was to educate people and not to silence or shame them. He further notes that, for instance, identifying that someone has used racial microaggressions is not intended to imply that they are racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zamudio-Suaréz|first1=Fernanda | name-list-format = vanc |title=What Happens When Your Research Is Featured on ‘Fox &amp; Friends’ |url=http://chronicle.com/article/What-Happens-When-Your/236949|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

India has several vigilante groups that claim to protect the [[Indian culture]].

==Laws==
In India, the Sections 292 to 294 of the [[Indian Penal Code]] are used to deal with obscenity. Most of these laws date back to 1860.&lt;ref name=AfraidKissing&gt;{{cite news|title=Who’s afraid of kissing?|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090218/jsp/opinion/story_10552589.jsp|accessdate=6 December 2014|work=[[The Telegraph (India)]]|date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code deals with sales and distribution of obscene books and other material. It criminalises materials like books and paintings if it is deemed to be "lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest".&lt;ref name=IPC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Indian Penal Code, 1860|url=http://chddistrictcourts.gov.in/THE%20INDIAN%20PENAL%20CODE.pdf|publisher=Chandigarh District Courts|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Section 292 was amended in 1969 to exclude material that are for public good (like condom ads),&lt;ref name=AfraidKissing/&gt; scientific material, art and religious figures.&lt;ref name="FreedomOfPress"&gt;{{cite book|title=Freedom of the Press: Using the Law to Defend Journalists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBkNQZT0fLQC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=7 December 2014|year=2009|publisher=Socio Legal Information Cent|isbn=978-81-89479-59-6|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police also use Section 292 of the IPC to file cases against film posters and advertisement hoardings that are deemed to be "obscene".&lt;ref name=posters&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Zeher-poster-makers-face-obscenity-plaint/articleshow/1067343.cms?referral=PM |title='Zeher' poster makers face obscenity plaint |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |work=[[The Times of India]]|date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Section 293 deals with the sale of obscene material to people under 20.&lt;ref name=IPC/&gt; The [[Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code]] deals with "obscene acts and songs" and it states that:

{{Cquote|''Whoever, to the annoyance of others''

''(a) Does any obscene act in any public place, or''&lt;br&gt;
''(b) Sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place,''

''Shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.''&lt;ref name=KissingObscene/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34318">'''Municipal disinvestment''' is a term in the [[United States]] which describes an [[urban planning]] process in which that a city or town or other municipal entity decides to abandon or neglect an unproductive zone. It can happen when a municipality is in a period of economic prosperity, and it seeks to improve its communities and infrastructure, and sees that its [[Poverty in the United States|poorest]] and most blighted communities are both the cheapest targets for revitalization as well as the areas with the greatest potential for improvement.&lt;ref name="struggle"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reclaiming American Cities: the Struggle for People, Place, and Nature since 1900|last=Platt|first=Rutherford H.|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-62534-050-4|location=USA|pages=79–171|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a city is facing [[urban decay]], and has to compromise in allocating its resources, the poorest communities are the least profitable and investing in them seems unwise from a long term perspective, and so these communities are neglected as a matter of choice.&lt;ref name="plague"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1859842534 A Plague on Your Houses: How New York Was Burned Down and National Public Health Crumbled] By Deborah Wallace, Rodrick Wallace. 2001.

== History ==

=== The New Deal and the postwar era ===
Out of the [[New Deal]] came the [[Public Works Administration]], funding the construction of thousands of low-rent homes and infrastructure development. Meanwhile the [[Homeowners Refinancing Act]], as well as the [[Wagner-Steagall Housing Act]] three years later, provided generous incentives and reimbursements aimed at Americans recovering from the [[Great Depression]] who could not yet afford to invest in equity. In the postwar era, returning veterans were seeking homes to start families.&lt;ref&gt;"The House We Live In." ''Race: The Power of an Illusion'', episode 3, written by Larry Adelman, edited by Llewellyn M. Smith, PBS, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a period of intense residential expansion surrounding major US cities, and banks were gratuitously providing loans in order for families to afford moving there. It is in this new economic landscape where [[redlining]], [[exclusionary zoning]], and [[predatory lending]] flourished.

The programs enacted during this time provided more displacement than they did replacement: the beginning years of housing and infrastructure development were defined by their clearance and destruction of communities.&lt;ref name="struggle" /&gt; The [[Housing Act of 1949]] increased the mandate for public housing, but in claiming to combat "slums" and "blight" the act was worded so vaguely that those terms could have been applied to most any post-Depression urban neighborhood. What was intended to rebuild in decayed communities was used against poor but otherwise flourishing neighborhoods by labeling them ghettos.&lt;ref name="struggle" /&gt;

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] extended demolition of neighborhoods, with new roads cutting through the most vulnerable neighborhoods in order to create more direct arteries between the metropolitan and the downtown areas. The highway's construction expanded upon the already widening schism of urban poor and the suburban by further enabling [[white flight]] and reducing a focus on [[public transport]].

=== Civil Rights and the Great Society ===
During the postwar era, municipalities sought to grow enriched and modernized communities from the slums they demolished. As the Civil Rights movement was in full display through [[Highway revolts in the United States|highway revolts]] and [[Mass racial violence in the United States|responses to racial violence]], there was a growing mindset among urban planners that a communal-focused, people-first approach should be taken, along the same lines as community development handled by the recently-enacted [[Peace Corps]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt13x0h4w|title=Thinking Small: The United States and the Lure of Community Development|last=Immerwahr|first=Daniel|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674289949|location=|pages=150–170|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] continued the policies of his predecessor John F. Kennedy, and in the first year in office he signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], and followed soon after with a series of bills that comprised the foundation of what was termed the "[[War on Poverty]]" and "[[Great Society]]", despite the protesting of a largely anti-integration Congress.&lt;ref name="struggle" /&gt; The new philosophy of the administration focused intently on [[Community Action Agencies]], fulfilling the demand from modernist social theorists and pouring funding and resources into volunteer forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The direction of policy was seen as some as a form of direct investment in impoverished and minority neighborhoods, in contrast to the previous focus on new construction.

[[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] served as Assistant [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] under the Johnson Administration, and was a primary influence on policy development. Stemming from his controversial [[Moynihan Report]], many of the programs enacted within the War on Poverty intended to educate black and poor families in order to modernize their "culture." Government assistance, in the hundreds of millions of dollars, was intended for organic community growth, nurturing local governance, and a gradual transition from developing to developed urban regions. However, when shirking programs that were directly-run by municipalities, the money was diverted to smaller, unorthodox community action associations with unions or "social protest agendas". For example, it was an [[Office of Economic Opportunity]]-funded community center where the [[Black Panther Party]] started its development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Change in urban development policy ===
Johnson responded to the radicalization of Black Americans [[Watts riots|Watts Riots]] by ceding control of local OEO's to municipal authorities such as the mayor (a reversal of the original strategy of community-lead development) while funding was reduced and the practices of the offices and local community projects were more closely supervised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moynihan was startled by what he perceived as the consequences of the War on Poverty and changed his philosophy and its practice under Johnson. He found the social policies of the past decades naive for trying to fix the "tangled pathology" he described in the white paper he authored for the US Department of Labor, ''The Negro Family: The Case for National Action''.&lt;ref name="struggle" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moynihan|first=Daniel Patrick|date=1965|title=The Negro Family: The Case for National Action|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/Moynihan's%20The%20Negro%20Family.pdf|journal=Republished by Stanford University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the administration transitioned over to [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], Moynihan remained as Counselor to the President, where he further pushed for dismantling the OEO.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though it continued to exist into the Reagan Administration, the OEO was put under the control of [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Dick Cheney]], who more tightly controlled its function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is during this time that Moynihan suggests to Nixon that Black communities be treated with a "benign neglect," a philosophy-of-action which would later be translated into the planned shrinkage policies of the 70s and 80s.

Benign neglect is a policy proposed in 1969 by [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], who was at the time on President [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] [[White House Staff|staff]] as an urban affairs adviser. While serving in this capacity, he sent the President a memo suggesting, "The time may have come when the issue of race could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect.' The subject has been too much talked about. The forum has been too much taken over to hysterics, paranoids, and boodlers on all sides. We need a period in which [[Negro]] progress continues and racial rhetoric fades."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aol.bartleby.com/73/1579.html #1579] ''Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was designed to ease tensions after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the late 1960s. Moynihan was particularly troubled by the speeches of Vice-President [[Spiro Agnew]]. However, the policy was widely seen as an [[Planned shrinkage|abandonment of urban neighborhoods]], particularly ones with a majority [[Black people|black]] population, as Moynihan's statements and writings appeared to encourage, for instance, [[fire department]]s engaging in [[triage]] to avoid a supposedly futile war against [[arson]].&lt;ref name="plague" /&gt;

=== Background ===
During the twentieth century, a boom in [[suburb]]an growth caused in part by increased automobile use led to urban decline, particularly in the poorer sections of many large cities in the [[United States]] and elsewhere. A dwindling tax base depleted many municipal resources. A common view was that it was part of a "downward spiral" caused first by an absence of jobs, the creation of a permanent underclass, and a declining tax base hurting many city services, including schools. It was this interplay of factors which made change difficult.&lt;ref name="twsZe352"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/behind-the-cover-article-jonathan-mahler-on-benton-harbor/|title=Behind the Cover Story: Jonathan Mahler on Benton Harbor|date=December 19, 2011|publisher=''The New York Times''|author=RACHEL NOLAN (interviewer), Jonathan Mahler (interviewee)|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City was described as "so broke" by the 1970s with neighborhoods which had become "so desperate and depleted" that municipal authorities wondered how to cope.&lt;ref name="twsZe37"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/realestate/keymagazine/15Key-lede-t.html?pagewanted=all|title=After the Bubble|date=March 12, 2009|publisher=''The New York Times''|author=JONATHAN MAHLER|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authorities felt the process of decline was inevitable, and instead of trying to fight it, searched for alternatives. According to one view, authorities searched for ways to have the greatest population loss in the areas with the poorest non-white populations.&lt;ref name="livingcity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plague" /&gt;

=== The RAND report ===
In the early 1970s, a [[RAND]] study examining the relation between city services and large city populations concluded that when services such as police and fire protection were withdrawn, the numbers of people in the neglected areas would decrease.&lt;ref name="plague" /&gt; There had been questions about many fires that had been happening in the South Bronx during the 1970s. One account (including the RAND report) suggested that neighborhood fires were predominantly caused by [[arson]], while a contrasting report suggested that arson was not a major cause.&lt;ref name="twsZe43" /&gt; If arson had been a primary cause, according to the RAND viewpoint, then it did not make sense financially for the city to try to invest further funds to improve fire protection, according to this view. The RAND report allegedly influenced then [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], who used the report's findings to make recommendations for urban policy.&lt;ref name="plague" /&gt; In Moynihan's view, arson was one of many social pathologies caused by large cities, and suggested that a policy of ''[[benign neglect]]'' would be appropriate as a response.&lt;ref name="plague" /&gt;

=== Case studies ===

==== New York City ====
{{see also|Crime in New York City|History of New York City (1978–present)}}
[[File:Grand_Conc_165_jeh.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] in the Bronx near 165th Street in 2008]]
Partly in response to the RAND report, and in an effort to address New York's declining population, New York's housing commissioner, Roger Starr, proposed a policy which he termed ''planned shrinkage'' to reduce the impoverished population and better preserve the tax base.&lt;ref name="twsZe33"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/podcast-baby-boom-revisited/#more-1823|title=Podcast: Baby Boom Revisited|date=March 30, 2007|publisher=''The New York Times''|author=SAM ROBERTS|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the "politically toxic"&lt;ref name="twsZe33" /&gt; proposal, the city would stop investing in troubled neighborhoods and divert funds to communities "that could still be saved."&lt;ref name="twsZe33" /&gt; He suggested that the city should "accelerate the drainage" in what he called the worst parts of the South Bronx through a policy of planned shrinkage by closing [[New York City Subway|subway]] stations, firehouses and schools. Starr felt these actions were the best way to save money.&lt;ref&gt;''Breathing Space: A Spiritual Journey in the South Bronx'' By Heidi B. Neumark&lt;/ref&gt; Starr's arguments soon became predominant in urban planning thinking nationwide.&lt;ref name="livingcity" /&gt; The people who lived in the communities where his policies were applied protested vigorously; without adequate fire service and police protection, the residents faced waves of crime and fires that left much of the South Bronx and Harlem devastated.&lt;ref name="plague" /&gt; A report in 2011 in the ''[[New York Times]]'' suggested that the planned shrinkage approach was "short-lived".&lt;ref name="twsZe42"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/nyregion/19population.html?pagewanted=print|title=By 2025, Planners See a Million New Stories in the Crowded City|date=February 19, 2006|publisher=''The New York Times''|author=SAM ROBERTS|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the planned shrinkage program, for example, an abandoned 100-unit development on one piece of land could be cleared by a real estate developer, and such an outcome would have been preferable to ten separate neighborhood-based efforts to produce 100 housing units each, according to advocates of planned shrinkage.&lt;ref name="livingcity" /&gt; According to this view, a planned shrinkage approach would encourage so-called "monolithic development", resulting in new urban growth but at much lower population densities than the neighborhoods which had existed previously.&lt;ref name="livingcity" /&gt; The remark by Starr caused a political firestorm: then mayor [[Abraham Beame]] disavowed the idea while City Council members called it "inhuman," "racist" and "genocidal."&lt;ref name="twsZe36" /&gt;

According to one report, the high inflation during the 1970s combined with the restrictive rent control policies in the city meant that buildings were worth more ''dead'' for the insurance money than ''alive'' as sources of rental income; as investments, they had limited ability to provide a solid stream of rental income. Accordingly, there was an economic incentive on the part of building owners, according to this view, to simply let the buildings burn. An alternative view was that the fires were a result of the city's municipal policies. While there are differing views about whether planned shrinkage caused fire outbreaks in the 1970s, or was a result of such fires, there is agreement that the fires in the [[South Bronx]] during these years were extensive.{{Quote|In the South Bronx, the average number of people per [fire] engine is over 44,000.

By the mid-1970s, [[The Bronx]] had 120,000 fires per year, for an average of 30 fires every 2 hours. 40 percent of the housing in the area was destroyed. The response time for fires also increased, as the firefighters did not have the resources to keep responding promptly to numerous service calls. A report in ''[[The New York Post]]'' suggested that the cause of the fires was not [[arson]]  but resulted from decisions by bureaucrats to abandon sections of the city.&lt;ref name="twsZe43"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/why_the_bronx_burned_hvgkCrLVekbXBGohd6GFUO|title=Why the Bronx burned Blame statisticians, not arson.

There have been claims that planned shrinkage impacted public health negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Rodrick.

Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine 66.5 (1990): 391.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, public shrinkage programs targeted to undermine populations of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in the South Bronx and Harlem had an effect on the geographic pattern of the [[AIDS]] outbreak. According to this view, municipal abandonment was interrelated with health issues and helped to cause a phenomenon termed "urban desertification".&lt;ref&gt;R. Wallace, "Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx." ''Social Science &amp; Medicine'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (1990) pp. 801-813 - abstract retrieved on July 5, 2008 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations in the South Bronx, [[Lower East Side]], and [[Harlem]] plummeted during the two decades after 1970. Only after two decades did the city begin to invest in these areas again.

==== New Orleans ====
[[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] differed from other cities in that the cause of decline was not based on economic or political shifts but rather a destructive flood caused by a hurricane. In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], ''planned shrinkage'' was proposed as a means to create a "more compact, more efficient and less flood-prone city".&lt;ref name="twsZe27"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nhi.org/online/issues/145/shiftinglandscape.html|title=The Shifting Landscape of New Orleans|date=Spring 2006|publisher=''National Housing Institute''|author=Kenneth M. Reardon|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of the city which were most damaged by the flooding - and thus, most likely to be flooded again - would not be rebuilt and would become green space.&lt;ref name="twsZe27" /&gt; These areas were frequently less desirable, lower-income areas which had lower property values precisely because of the risk of flooding.&lt;ref name="twsZe27" /&gt; Some residents rejected a "top-down" approach of ''planned shrinkage'' of municipal planners and attempted to rebuild in flood-prone areas.&lt;ref name="twsZe34" /&gt;

==== Detroit ====
{{Main|Decline of Detroit}}

==== Roxbury, Boston ====
{{See also|Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative}}Planned shrinkage in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] is not unique to the RAND policies enacted in the 70s and 80s. The area succumbed to numerous fires as out-of-town landlords sought out the only way to earn back some profit on homes that no longer sold. However, the neighborhood's response to planned shrinkage through community action has made it an example to other neighborhoods of the success of people-first organizing. The neighborhood had worked with the Boston's administration, but refused to give in to bureaucratic control by the city, protesting whenever the municipality neglected their redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;Mahan, L., Lipman, M., Neuburger, J., Ragazzi, C., &amp; Holding Ground Productions.

"Shrink to survive" is a contemporary form of planned shrinkage which emphasizes short-term razing of the city: Where a city enacting planned shrinkage policies takes a [[Laissez-faire]] approach to disinvesting in its communities, cities can take an active role in that reduction. This includes investing in more aggressive land buyback and enforcement of [[eminent domain]] in order to obtain ownership of a property, relocate its residents, and demolish it.&lt;ref name="twsZe32xxx"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/5516536/US-cities-may-have-to-be-bulldozed-in-order-to-survive.html|title=US cities may have to be bulldozed in order to survive: Dozens of US cities may have entire neighbourhoods bulldozed as part of drastic "shrink to survive" proposals...|date=12 Jun 2009|publisher=''The Telegraph''|author=Tom Leonard|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harvey and Jeannette Crewe.jpg|thumb|right|Harvey and Jeannette Crewe]]
[[File:Crewegraves2013.JPG|thumb|right|Photograph of the grave of Harvey and Jeannette Crewe, Tuakau Cemetery, Waikato, New Zealand. October 2013. Note Jeannette's name is misspelt as Jeanette.]]
'''David Harvey Crewe''' (20 October 1941 – {{circa}} 17 June 1970), known as Harvey, and '''Jeannette Lenore Crewe''' (6 February 1940 – {{circa}} 17 June 1970) were a New Zealand farming couple (married 18 June 1966 in Auckland) who were shot to death in their home around 17 June 1970. The murders led to the wrongful conviction and subsequent pardoning of another farmer who lived nearby, [[Arthur Allan Thomas]]. A Royal Commission set up to investigate the miscarriage of justice found that a detective had fabricated evidence and placed it at the scene of the crime. No person was ever charged with planting the evidence, and the murders remain unsolved.

==Background==
In 1970, the Crewes and their 18-month-old daughter lived on their farm at [[Pukekawa]], Lower Waikato. Jeannette was afraid to be in the house without her husband after arson attacks including one in which clothes were set on fire in a bedroom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beyond Reasonable doubt?, (2014) David Yallop&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her death, Jeannette was about to receive a half share in the neighbouring farm, on which her father, Lenard W. Demler lived alone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Justice Denied: Extraordinary miscarriages of justice, James Morton 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The bequest to Jeannette had come about after Jeannette's sister had been cut from the will of their wealthy mother, and Demler had removed Jeannette as a beneficiary of his own will in retaliation, though she had no role in the original matter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Jeannette's mother had then re-written her will to bequeath Jeannette a half share in the farm Demler lived on.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Crime==
Husband and wife Harvey (28) and Jeannette Crewe (30) were found to be missing from their bloodstained farmhouse at [[Pukekawa]], [[Waikato Plains|Lower Waikato]] on 22 June 1970 by Jeannette's father, Lenard W. Demler (died 4 November 1992) who had been asked to look in on them by an alarmed neighbour because they had not answered the telephone for days.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/r.christie/thomas_royal_commission_1980.pdf|accessdate=27 August 2017|title=Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire into the Circumstances of the Convictions of Arthur Allan Thomas for the Murders of David Harvey Crewe and Jeanette Lenore Crewe 1980|date= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} The Crewes' 18-month-old daughter Rochelle was distraught in her cot. Demler left her alone while he went on a farm errand.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|103}}

The Crewes had last been seen on the 17th,&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|94}} and milk, bread and newspaper deliveries on the morning of the 18th had not been collected from the letterbox.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|95}} No medical opinion that an infant could survive without fluids for five days is supported by any verified case of such an occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[Crewe Homicide review http://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/crewe-review-appendix-4.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although Rochelle had tissue loss, suggesting she had not eaten anything between 17 and 22 June, the degree to which she retained water during treatment indicated that she had not ingested fluids for at most 48 hours before she was found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|103}} A witness later reported that he had seen a woman unknown to him on the property on the 19th.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|92}}&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|14}} Len Demler was the leading suspect due to his propinquity, failure to raise the alarm until prompted, apparent guilty knowledge that Rochelle did not require immediate medical attention, blood of Jeannette's type on his car seat, and a scratch on his neck. His behaviour continued to raise suspicion; during police searches of the countryside for the Crewes, he shadowed on horseback without helping. However, the evidence against Demler was entirely circumstantial and he strongly denied any knowledge of what had happened to his daughter and her husband.&lt;ref name=" ReferenceA"/&gt;

Jeannette's body was found on 16 August, wrapped in a [[duvet]] bound with copper wire,&lt;ref&gt;"Forensic History: Crimes, Frauds, and Scandals" by Professor Elizabeth A Murray&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Waikato River]]&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|14}} and her husband's body was retrieved upriver on 16 September.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|14}} A car axle linked to a neighbouring farmer, [[Arthur Allan Thomas]], had apparently been used to weigh down Harvey's body and was central to police theories about the case, although it did not justify a prosecution.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

==Investigation and trials==
Both victims had been shot to death with a .22 calibre firearm; Jeannette had broken facial bones from being struck with a blunt instrument.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Demler had been considered the main suspect, but the brutality of the assault on her, and the lead investigator's belief that she had been raped, led to doubts that her father was involved.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On the basis that the murderer might have used a legitimately held gun, police collected and test-fired 64 registered .22 firearms, 3% of the total recorded as held in the Pukekawa area.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|96}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; A forensic report on 19 August 1970 stated that, of the 64, neither Thomas' [rifle] nor one owned by the Eyre family could be eliminated as the possible murder weapon, but there was insufficient evidence pointing to one or the other.&lt;ref&gt;nzherald.co.nz [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11302896 New evidence claims in Crewe case 2 Aug, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Although police suggested to Thomas during an interview that his rifle was used to kill the Crewes, the gun was returned to him on 8 September.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; On 27 October 1970, the garden at the Crewe house was searched for a third time and a spent cartridge case was found, apparently still lying where the murderer had left it.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|15}} The case carried marks which showed it had been ejected from Thomas' rifle.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|17}} In November, Thomas was arrested and charged.

Despite his wife and cousin giving him a strong alibi for 17 June, Thomas was sent for trial on a charge of murdering the Crewes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The prosecution suggested Thomas's wife, Vivien, had been the woman seen at the Crewes' house, although she was not charged. The witness was certain Vivien Thomas, who he knew, was not the woman he saw.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|92}} The prosecution said the motive for the murders was that Thomas had been obsessed with Jeannette, an accusation for which they provided very little evidence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; A witness who did give testimony supporting the prosecution's contention that Jeannette had been pestered by Thomas was Demler; he was cross examined about why he had not mentioned such obviously relevant information before the court had begun sitting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Thomas was found guilty of the murders in a 1971 trial, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. He was tried again in 1973 and convicted. Supporters of Thomas started a campaign to bring to public attention that the key evidence against him had serious anomalies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Campaign, pardon and Royal Commission==
A campaign, led in part by [[Pat Booth (journalist)|Pat Booth]] of the ''[[Auckland Star]]'', was largely responsible for getting Thomas released with a pardon. Campaigners said forensic work by Dr Jim Sprott had shown that the cartridge case had been planted at the scene and that its method of construction identified it as being from a batch that could not have contained the number 8 bullets recovered from the victims.&lt;ref name="ROYALCOMM"/&gt;{{rp|53}}&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/10327013/Crewe-murders-Police-admit-cartridge-planted|title=Crewe murders: Police admit cartridge planted|date=30 July 2014|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[David Yallop]]'s book  about the case, ''Beyond Reasonable Doubt'', Thomas was pardoned by the Governor-General in 1979, on the recommendation of [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] [[Robert Muldoon]], and released after serving nine years in prison. He was paid NZ$950,000 compensation for his time in jail and loss of the use of the farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/r.christie/thomas_royal_commission_1980.pdf |title=Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire into the Circumstances of the Convictions of Arthur Allan Thomas for the Murders of David Harvey Crewe and Jeanette Lenore Crewe, 1980 |page=120 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Royal Commission#New Zealand|Royal Commission of Inquiry]] was ordered to review the wrongful conviction of Thomas and reported to the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] in November 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/r.christie/thomas_royal_commission_1980.pdf |title=Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire into the Circumstances of the Convictions of Arthur Allan Thomas for the Murders of David Harvey Crewe and Jeanette Lenore Crewe, 1980 |accessdate=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commissioners found that the spent cartridge case from Thomas' gun, Exhibit 350, had not been left by the murderer, but had been created weeks later by police using his impounded gun and ammunition, then [[False evidence|planted]] at the Crewes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/r.christie/thomas_royal_commission_1980.pdf |title=Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire into the Circumstances of the Convictions of Arthur Allan Thomas for the Murders of David Harvey Crewe and Jeanette Lenore Crewe, 1980 |accessdate=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Commission's report said Detective Inspector Bruce Hutton and Detective Sergeant Lenrick Johnston were implicated in the  misconduct, and that the prosecution of Thomas for the murders had been unjustified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/r.christie/thomas_royal_commission_1980.pdf |title=Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire into the Circumstances of the Convictions of Arthur Allan Thomas for the Murders of David Harvey Crewe and Jeanette Lenore Crewe, 1980 |accessdate=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Royal Commission describing the conduct of Hutton and Johnston as an "unspeakable outrage", the New Zealand police never laid charges against any police officer involved in the investigation and prosecution of Thomas. Lenrick Johnston died in 1978. Bruce Hutton died in 2013. The case was made into the docu-drama feature film ''[[Beyond Reasonable Doubt (1982 film)|Beyond Reasonable Doubt]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Status of the case==
In 2014 an official police review of the investigation into the homicides, at a cost of $400,000 to New Zealand taxpayers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evidence Planted |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/10327013/Crewe-murders-Police-admit-cartridge-planted |website=www.stuff.co.nz |accessdate=15 August 2018 |language=en-NZ |date=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that evidence available in the murder of the Crewes was insufficient for any new prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crewe Review |url=http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/investigations-and-reviews/crewe-review |website=New Zealand Police |accessdate=10 July 2018 |language=en-NZ |date=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review acknowledged that a key prosecution exhibit in the trials had been fabricated by detectives, but did not appear to accept that they could have been on the wrong track; the review implied that the Crewes' daughter had not ingested any fluids between 17 and 22 June, and said a witness had been mistaken in thinking he had seen a woman on the farm during that period. The review did however rule out Demler having been the killer. Rochelle Crewe expressed satisfaction that a police review of evidence had cleared her deceased grandfather, Demler, of involvement in the murders.&lt;ref&gt;nzherald.co.nz 31 July 2014, Rochelle Crewe: [Report clears my family's name http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11301680]&lt;/ref&gt; The case remains unsolved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2427">The '''National Integrated Ballistic Information Network''' or '''NIBIN''' is a specialized computer network in the United States. It contains digital images of recovered pieces of ballistic evidence.

Running on the [[Integrated Ballistic Identification System]] or IBIS platform, NIBIN enables U.S. law enforcers to rapidly determine if a piece of recovered ballistic evidence came from a firearm that has been previously used in a crime.

There are certain criteria that must be met prior to entering information into the NIBIN database.  For instance, cartridge cases from a .22 caliber firearm or a revolver are normally not entered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/CAnibin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Using NIBIN, law enforcement staff can identify firearms in new cases that were used in prior incidents.  A series of seventeen different Washington state crime scenes involving seven firearms, and three different agencies in two counties, was identified using information provided by IBIS/NIBIN.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsp.wa.gov/forensics/docs/crimelab/nibin_brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational purpose==
In 1999, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) established and began administration of the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atf.gov/publications/factsheets/factsheet-nibin.html ATF Fact Sheet - National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, ATF administers automated ballistic imaging technology for [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], [[forensic science]], and attorney agencies in the United States that have entered into a formal agreement with ATF to enter ballistic information into NIBIN. Partners use Integrated Ballistic Identification Systems to acquire digital images of the markings made on spent ammunition recovered from a crime scene or a crime gun test fire and then compare those images against earlier entries via electronic image comparison. If a high-confidence candidate for a match emerges, firearms examiners compare the original evidence with a microscope to confirm the match.

{{Template: English language}}
'''Nepalese English''' is the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of [[English language]] characteristic of the Federal Democratic Republic of [[Nepal]]. Many Nepalis speak [[English as a second or foreign language]], with English use being most prevalent among city dwellers residing in [[Kathmandu]] (the capital of Nepal). Although [[Nepali language|Nepali]] is the native language, English is the primary language used for business in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://un.org.np/unmin-archive/downloads/keydocs/2007-08-30-Agreement.SPA.Govt.MJF.ENG.pdf|title= Government of Nepal reached an agreement on Madhesi demand to introduce English as language of education in Nepal : United Nations Charter}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, where modern English education began in the 1850s, there is little or no consensus among teachers and practitioners on whether to follow [[British English|British]], [[American English|American]] or [[Indian English|Indian]] variants of English, or allow the development of a Nepal-specific variety of English, known colloquially{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} as '''Nenglish'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NELTA/article/viewFile/4608/3820|title=Nenglish: An Inevitable Reality or Merely a Mirage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
This dialect is classified{{By whom|date=November 2018}} as a non-standard dialect and has no legal status.

==Phonology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018|small=y}}
Nepalese accents vary greatly. Some Nepalese speak English with an accent close to a Standard British ([[Received Pronunciation]]) accent; others lean toward a more 'vernacular', native-tinted, accent for their English speech.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Grammar==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018|small=y}}
The role of English within the complex multilingual society of [[Nepal]] is far from straightforward: it is used across the country, by speakers with various degrees of proficiency; the grammar and [[phraseology]] may mimic that of the speaker's first language. While Nepalese speakers of English use idioms peculiar to their homeland, often literal translations of words and phrases from their native languages, this is far less common in proficient speakers, and the grammar itself tends to be quite close to that of [[Standard English]].

==Numeral system==
The numeral system of Nepalese English is the [[Indian numbering system]] and is preferred for digit grouping. When written in words, or when spoken, numbers less than 100,000 are expressed just as they are in Standard English. Numbers including and beyond 100,000 are expressed in a subset of the Indian numbering system. Consequently, the following scale is used:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! In digits (Standard English) !! In digits (Nenglish) !! In words (Standard English) !! In words (Nenglish)
|-
| colspan="2" | 10 || colspan="2" | ten
|-
| colspan="2" | 100 ||  colspan="2" | one hundred
|-
| colspan="2" | 1,000 ||  colspan="2" | one thousand
|-
| colspan="2" | 10,000 ||  colspan="2" | ten thousand
|-
| 100,000 / 100 000 ||  1,00,000 || one hundred thousand || one [[lakh]]
|-
| 1,000,000 / 1 000 000 ||  10,00,000 || one million || ten [[lakh]]
|-
| 10,000,000 /10 000 000||  1,00,00,000 || ten million || one [[crore]]
|}

Larger numbers are generally expressed as multiples of the above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsl.co.in/india/news/investors-lose-rs-44-lakh-crore-in-four-days/416306/ "Investors lose Rs 4.4 lakh crore in four days"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316003619/http://bsl.co.in/india/news/investors-lose-rs-44-lakh-crore-in-four-days/416306/ |date=2012-03-16 }}, Business Standard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartinvestor.in/market/story-31563-storydet-Corporate_chiefs_getting_crores_in_salaries_100_and_counting.htm "Back Corporate chiefs getting crores in salaries: 100 and counting!"], SmartInvestor.in&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nouns==
There are a few distinct expressions relating to family members in Nepalese English.

===Brother/cousin===
In most of the [[Languages of Nepal|languages spoken in Nepal]], both brother and cousin are referred to as brother, as there is no specific word for cousin. People{{Who|date=November 2017}} therefore use the term "own brother" to refer to "brother" and "not own brother" to refer to "cousin".{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Aunt/uncle===
The Nepalese languages have specific words to refer to aunts and uncles. For example, in [[Nepali language|Nepali]], father's sister is {{lang|ne|फुपु}} (phupu) and mother's sister {{lang|ne|सानो आमा}} (sāno āmā). People would generally use their native language's terms to refer to those family members.

'''Operation Malaya''' ({{lang-es|Operación Malaya}}) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] anti-[[Political corruption|corruption]] campaign in the southern [[resort city]] of [[Marbella, Spain|Marbella]]. It began in 2006 and it is being carried out by the ''[[Policía Nacional (Spain)|Policía Nacional]]'' under the direction of Judge Miguel Ángel Torres. The operation, now in its third phase, has the objective of exposing a network involved in concealing numerous [[white collar crime|illicit activities]], (including [[bribery]], [[embezzlement]], and [[influence peddling]]) carried out by members of the Marbella City Council, businessmen, and prominent lawyers, among others. More than €2.4&amp;nbsp;billion has been seized so far.&lt;ref name=Catan&gt;{{cite news|last=Catán

On May 3, 2007, singer [[Isabel Pantoja]] was arrested for possible [[tax evasion]] and [[money laundering]], which she allegedly did on behalf of the former mayor of Marbella, Julián Muñoz. He has already been jailed as part of the investigation, along with more than 100 others.&lt;ref name=Catan/&gt; Pantoja was later released on €90,000 bail.&lt;ref name=Eatwell&gt;{{cite news|last=Eatwell|first=A|title=Diva Pantoja out on bail as Marbella graft probe reaches ex-mayor's lover|publisher=El Pais and [[International Herald Tribune|IHT]]|date=May 4, 2007|url=http://www.iht.com/pdfs/elpais/ep1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In March 2005, investigations of the White Whale Operation dismantled the largest network of money laundering in the country. The evidence collected included intercepts of telephone conversations relating to cases of urban corruption in the Costa del Sol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Operación blanqueo de capitales puede tener vínculos con Yukos|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/10661/0/ESPANA/OPERACION/BLANQUEO/|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=[[20minutos.es]]|date=12 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Marbella City Council was wound up, and was replaced by a management committee presided over by Don Diego Martín Reye, pending fresh elections.

Following the creation of this management committee for Marbella City Hall, and after the arrival of democratic normality, the [[Andalusian Autonomous Government]] withdrew the authority to give urban planning consent [from Marbella City Council] based on Article 31.4 of the Andalusian Law on Urban Planning. This was according to the wording of the Law of November 2005 which states, "due to its serious influence on the planning powers of the regional autonomous authority [the Junta de Andalucía], set out in the Urban Planning Law of Andalusia (LOUA)", as reported by the Minister of the Board of Public Works and Transport."

==Related investigations==
Operation Malaya opened the door to subsequent investigations into possible cases of urban corruption in Spain. While not all of Spain experienced such a high level of construction projects as the [[Costa del Sol]] prior to 2008, evidence of similar abuses has come to light in other parts of the country. There has already been consideration of what might be done to prevent similar webs of corruption in the future. It is widely acknowledged that the planning process in Spain could be improved to make the allocation of land for development more transparent.

'''Orang Ulu''' ("people of the interior" in [[Malay language|Malay]]) is an ethnic designation politically coined to group together roughly 27 very small but ethnically diverse tribal groups in northeastern [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/minorities/South-East-Asia/Orang-Ulu-of-Sarawak.html |title=Orang Ulu of Sarawak |publisher=Internet FAQ Archives |accessdate=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; with populations ranging from less than 300 persons to over 25,000 persons. ''Orang Ulu'' is not a legal term, and no such racial group exists or is listed in the [[Malaysia]]n Constitution. The term was popularised by the Orang Ulu National Association (OUNA), which was formed in 1969.

The Orang Ulu tribal groups are diverse, they typically live in [[longhouse]]s elaborately decorated with murals and woodcarvings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Jalong|title=Kalong: Seni Motif Tradisi Orang Ulu|year=2001|publisher=Kementerian Kebudayaan Kesenian dan Pelancongan Malaysia|isbn=967-903-035-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also well known for their intricate [[beadwork]] detailed [[tattoo]]s, rattan weaving, and other tribal crafts.&lt;ref name="patriciahului"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seeds.theborneopost.com/2016/05/25/dying-tradition-of-orangulu-rattan-weaving/ |title=Dying Tradition of Orang Ulu Rattan Weaving |publisher=The Borneo Post |author=Patricia Hului |date=2016-05-25 |accessdate=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orang Ulu tribes can also be identified by their unique music - distinctive sounds from their [[Sapeh|sapes]], a plucked boat-shaped lute, formerly with two strings, nowadays usually with four strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Jalong|title=Sape: Seni Muzik Terbilang Orang Ulu Sarawak|year=2007|publisher=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also practice ''Kanjet'', a form of traditional dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Jalong|title=Kanjet: Seni Tarian Tradisional Orang Ulu Sarawak|year=2012|publisher=Jabatan Kebudayaan dan Kesenian Negara|isbn=967-5552-22-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vast majority of the Orang Ulu tribes are [[Christian]]s, but old traditional religions are still practiced in some areas.

{{Paleolithic}}
The '''Paleolithic''' or '''Palaeolithic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|æ|l|i|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|θ|ᵻ|k}}) is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of [[stone tool]]s that covers c. 99% of human technological [[prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christian|first1=David|title=Big History: Between Nothing and Everything|date=2014|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|location=New York|page=93|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools by [[Hominini|hominins]] c. 3.3&amp;nbsp;million years ago, to the end of the [[Pleistocene]] c. 11,650&amp;nbsp;cal&amp;nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref name=Thoth&amp;Schick&gt;Toth, Nicholas; Schick, Kathy (2007). {{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u68378621542472j|title=Handbook of Paleoanthropology | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-33761-4_64 | journal=Handbook of Paleoanthropology|pages=1943–1963}} In Henke, H.C.

The Paleolithic is followed in Europe by the [[Mesolithic]], although the date of the transition varies geographically by several thousand years.

During the Paleolithic, hominins grouped together in small societies such as [[band society|bands]], and subsisted by gathering plants and fishing, hunting or scavenging wild animals.&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{cite book | author=McClellan

Other organic commodities were adapted for use as tools, including [[leather]] and vegetable [[fiber]]s; however, due to their nature, these have not been preserved to any great degree.

About 50,000 years ago, there was a marked increase in the diversity of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. In Africa, bone artifacts and the first [[art]] appear in the archaeological record. The first evidence of human [[fishing]] is also noted, from artifacts in places such as [[Blombos cave]] in [[South Africa]]. Archaeologists classify artifacts of the last 50,000 years into many different categories, such as projectile points, engraving tools, knife blades, and drilling and piercing tools.

Humankind gradually evolved from early members of the genus ''[[Homo]]—''such as ''Homo habilis'', who used simple stone tools—into [[anatomically modern humans|anatomically]] [[Homo sapiens|modern humans]] as well as [[Behaviourally modern humans|behaviorally]] [[Homo sapiens|modern humans]] by the [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566394/Human_Evolution.html "Human Evolution," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5lCsAZ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566394/Human_Evolution.html |date=2009-11-01 }} Contributed by Richard B.

==Etymology of paleolithic==
The term "[[wikt:Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]]" was coined by archaeologist John Lubbock in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lubbock |first=John |author-link=John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury |orig-year=1872 |year=2005 |title=Pre-Historic Times, as Illustrated by Ancient Remains, and the Manners and Customs of Modern Savages |publisher=Williams and Norgate |page=75 |via=Elibron Classics |chapter=4 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t7vm4dg4c;view=1up;seq=87 |isbn=978-1421270395}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from Greek: [[wikt:παλαιός|παλαιός]], ''palaios'', "old"; and [[wikt:λίθος|λίθος]], ''lithos'', "stone", meaning "old age of the stone" or "Old [[Stone Age]]".

==Paleogeography and climate==
{{Human timeline}}
{{Main article|Pleistocene#Paleogeography and climate|Pliocene climate|Pliocene#Paleogeography}}
[[File:Homo heildebergensis. Museo de Prehistoria de Valencia.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|This skull, of early ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'', [[Miguelón]] from the [[Lower Paleolithic]] dated to 430,000&amp;nbsp;bp.]]
&lt;!---[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|The Paleolithic climate consisted of a set of glacial and interglacial periods.]]---&gt;
The Paleolithic coincides almost exactly with the [[Pleistocene]] epoch of geologic time, which lasted from 2.6&amp;nbsp;million years ago to about 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/pleistocene.php|title=The Pleistocene Epoch|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This epoch experienced important geographic and climatic changes that affected human societies.

During the preceding [[Pliocene]], continents had continued to [[plate tectonics|drift]] from possibly as far as {{cvt|250|km|lk=on|abbr=off}} from their present locations to positions only {{cvt|70|km}} from their current location. South America became linked to North America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]], bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive [[marsupial]] fauna. The formation of the isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, because warm [[equator]]ial ocean currents were cut off, and the cold Arctic and Antarctic waters lowered temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean.

Most of [[Central America]] formed during the Pliocene to connect the continents of North and South America, allowing fauna from these continents to leave their native habitats and colonize new areas.&lt;ref name=UCMPPliocene&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/pli.html |title=University of California Museum of Paleontology website the Pliocene epoch(accessed March 25)|publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africa's collision with Asia created the Mediterranean, cutting off the remnants of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. During the [[Pleistocene]], the modern [[continent]]s were essentially at their present positions; the [[tectonic plate]]s on which they sit have probably moved at most {{cvt|100|km}} from each other since the beginning of the period.&lt;ref name=Scotese&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotese.com/lastice.htm|author=Christopher Scotese|title=Paleomap project |accessdate=2008-03-23|work=The Earth has been in an Ice House Climate for the last 30 million years|authorlink=Christopher Scotese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climates during the Pliocene became cooler and drier, and seasonal, similar to modern climates. [[Ice sheet]]s grew on [[Antarctica]]. The formation of an Arctic ice cap around 3&amp;nbsp;million years ago is signaled by an abrupt shift in [[oxygen]] [[isotope]] ratios and ice-rafted cobbles in the North Atlantic and North [[Pacific Ocean]] beds.&lt;ref name="Andel"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Van Andel|first=Tjeerd H.|title=New Views on an Old Planet: A History of Global Change.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|location=Cambridge|pages=454 pp.|isbn=0-521-44243-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-latitude [[glacier|glaciation]] probably began before the end of the epoch. The global cooling that occurred during the Pliocene may have spurred on the disappearance of forests and the spread of [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s.&lt;ref name=UCMPPliocene/&gt;
The [[Pleistocene]] climate was characterized by repeated glacial cycles during which [[continental glacier]]s pushed to the 40th [[parallel (latitude)|parallel]] in some places. Four major glacial events have been identified, as well as many minor intervening events. A major event is a general glacial excursion, termed a "glacial". Glacials are separated by "interglacials". During a glacial, the glacier experiences minor advances and retreats. The minor excursion is a "stadial"; times between stadials are "interstadials". Each glacial advance tied up huge volumes of water in continental ice sheets {{cvt|1500–3000|m|ft|lk=on|abbr=off}} deep, resulting in temporary sea level drops of {{cvt|100|m}} or more over the entire surface of the Earth. During interglacial times, such as at present, drowned coastlines were common, mitigated by isostatic or other emergent motion of some regions.
[[File:Ice age fauna of northern Spain - Mauricio Antón.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Many great mammals such as [[woolly mammoth]]s, [[woolly rhinoceros]]es, and [[Panthera leo fossilis|cave lions]] inhabited the [[mammoth steppe]] during the Pleistocene.]]
The effects of glaciation were global. [[Antarctica]] was ice-bound throughout the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene. The [[Andes]] were covered in the south by the [[Patagonia]]n ice cap. There were glaciers in New Zealand and [[Tasmania]]. The now decaying glaciers of [[Mount Kenya]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and the [[Ruwenzori Range]] in east and central Africa were larger. Glaciers existed in the mountains of [[Ethiopia]] and to the west in the [[Atlas mountains]]. In the northern hemisphere, many glaciers fused into one. The [[Cordilleran ice sheet]] covered the North American northwest; the [[Laurentide]] covered the east. The Fenno-Scandian ice sheet covered northern Europe, including Great Britain; the Alpine ice sheet covered the Alps. Scattered domes stretched across [[Siberia]] and the Arctic shelf. The northern seas were frozen. During the late Upper Paleolithic (Latest Pleistocene) {{c.|18,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP, the [[Beringia]] land bridge between Asia and North America was blocked by ice,&lt;ref name=Scotese/&gt; which [[Clovis culture#Evidence of human habitation before Clovis|may have prevented]] early [[Paleo-Indian]]s such as the [[Clovis culture]] from directly crossing [[Beringia]] to reach the Americas.

According to [[Mark Lynas]] (through collected data), the Pleistocene's overall climate could be characterized as a continuous [[El Niño]] with [[trade winds]] in the south [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] weakening or heading east, warm air rising near [[Peru]], warm water spreading from the west Pacific and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east Pacific, and other El Niño markers.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Geographic Channel]], ''Six Degrees Could Change The World'', Mark Lynas interview. Retrieved February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paleolithic is often held to finish at the end of the ice age (the end of the Pleistocene epoch), and Earth's climate became warmer. This may have caused or contributed to the extinction of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]], although it is also possible that the late [[Quaternary extinction event|Pleistocene extinctions]] were (at least in part) caused by other factors such as disease and overhunting by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/ple.html|title=University of California Museum of Paleontology website the Pleistocene epoch(accessed March 25)|publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080401-mammoth-extinction.html|author=Kimberly Johnson|title=National Geographic news|accessdate=2008-04-04|work=Climate Change, Then Humans, Drove Mammoths Extinct from National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; New research suggests that the extinction of the [[woolly mammoth]] may have been caused by the combined effect of climatic change and human hunting.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the Pleistocene caused the mammoths' habitat to shrink in size, resulting in a drop in population. The small populations were then hunted out by Paleolithic humans.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; The global warming that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the [[Holocene]] may have made it easier for humans to reach mammoth habitats that were previously frozen and inaccessible.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Small populations of woolly mammoths survived on isolated Arctic islands, [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]] and [[Wrangel Island]], until {{c.|3700}}&amp;nbsp;BCE and {{c.|1700|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BCE respectively. The Wrangel Island population became extinct around the same time the island was settled by prehistoric humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |last=Nowak |first=Ronald M. |year=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-5789-9 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence of prehistoric human presence on Saint Paul island (though early human settlements dating as far back as 6500 BCE were found on the nearby [[Aleutian Islands]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~wsoon/HoloceneClimate+Optimum10-d/Enketal09-midHoloceneMammothStPaulIslandAlaska.pdf|title=Phylogeographic Analysis of the mid-Holocene Mammoth from Qagnax Cave, St. Paul Island, Alaska}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human way of life==
[[File:Terra-Amata-Hut.gif|thumb|right|An artist's rendering of a temporary wood house, based on evidence found at [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]] (in [[Nice, France]]) and dated to the Lower Paleolithic ({{c.|400,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP)]]

Nearly all of our knowledge of Paleolithic human culture and way of life comes from [[archaeology]] and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] comparisons to modern hunter-gatherer cultures such as the [[!Kung people|!Kung San]] who live similarly to their Paleolithic predecessors.&lt;ref name="Leften Stavrianos"/&gt; The economy of a typical Paleolithic society was a [[hunter-gatherer]] economy.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"&gt;{{cite book | author=Leften Stavros Stavrianos|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MKhe6qNva10C&amp;q=paleolithic+society&amp;dq=paleolithic+society | title=A Global History from Prehistory to the Present| location=New Jersey, USA | publisher=Prentice Hall| year=1991 | isbn=0-13-357005-3}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MKhe6qNva10C&amp;q=paleolithic+society&amp;dq=paleolithic+society&amp;pgis=1 Pages 9–13]&lt;/ref&gt; Humans hunted wild animals for meat and gathered food, firewood, and materials for their tools, clothes, or shelters.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"/&gt;

===Distribution===
At the beginning of the Paleolithic, hominins were found primarily in eastern Africa, east of the [[Great Rift Valley]]. Most known hominin fossils dating earlier than one million years before present are found in this area, particularly in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Ethiopia]].

By {{c.|2,000,000|1,500,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP, groups of hominins began leaving Africa and settling southern Europe and Asia. Southern Caucasus was occupied by {{c.|1,700,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP, and northern China was reached by {{c.|1,660,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP. By the end of the Lower Paleolithic, members of the hominin family were living in what is now China, western Indonesia, and, in Europe, around the Mediterranean and as far north as England, southern Germany, and Bulgaria. Their further northward expansion may have been limited by the lack of control of fire: studies of cave settlements in Europe indicate no regular use of fire prior to {{c.|400,000|300,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP.&lt;ref&gt;"On the earliest evidence for habitual use of fire in Europe", Wil Roebroeks et al, PNAS, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

East Asian fossils from this period are typically placed in the genus ''[[Homo erectus]]''. Very little fossil evidence is available at known Lower Paleolithic sites in Europe, but it is believed that hominins who inhabited these sites were likewise ''Homo erectus''. There is no evidence of hominins in America, Australia, or almost anywhere in Oceania during this time period.

Fates of these early colonists, and their relationships to modern humans, are still subject to debate. According to current archaeological and genetic models, there were at least two notable expansion events subsequent to peopling of Eurasia {{c.|2,000,000|1,500,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP. Around 500,000&amp;nbsp;BP a group of early humans, frequently called ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', came to Europe from Africa and eventually evolved into ''Homo neanderthalensis'' ([[Neanderthal]]s). In the Middle Paleolithic, Neanderthals were present in the region now occupied by Poland.

Both ''Homo erectus'' and ''Homo neanderthalensis'' became extinct by the end of the Paleolithic. Descended from ''Homo Sapiens'', the anatomically modern ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' emerged in eastern Africa {{c.|200,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP, left Africa around 50,000&amp;nbsp;BP, and expanded throughout the planet. Multiple hominid groups coexisted for some time in certain locations. '' Homo neanderthalensis'' were still found in parts of Eurasia {{c.|30,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP years, and engaged in an unknown degree of interbreeding with ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. DNA studies also suggest an unknown degree of interbreeding between ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' and ''[[Homo sapiens denisova]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Callaway, Ewen (22 September 2011), "First Aboriginal genome sequenced", Nature, Nature News, doi:10.1038/news.2011.551&lt;/ref&gt;

Hominin fossils not belonging either to ''Homo neanderthalensis'' or to ''Homo sapiens'' species, found in the [[Altai Mountains]] and Indonesia, were radiocarbon dated to {{c.|30,000|40,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP and {{c.|17,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP respectively.

For the duration of the Paleolithic, human populations remained low, especially outside the equatorial region. The entire population of Europe between 16,000 and 11,000&amp;nbsp;BP likely averaged some 30,000 individuals, and between 40,000 and 16,000&amp;nbsp;BP, it was even lower at 4,000–6,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.evolhum.cnrs.fr/bocquet/jas2005.pdf|title=Estimates of Upper Palaeolithic meta-population size in Europe from archaeological data|author=Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel|year=2005|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2005.05.006|volume=32|pages=1656–1668|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tools====
Paleolithic humans made tools of stone, bone, and wood.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"/&gt; The early paleolithic hominins, ''[[Australopithecus]]'', were the first users of stone tools. Excavations in Gona, Ethiopia have produced thousands of artifacts, and through radioisotopic dating and [[magnetostratigraphy]], the sites can be firmly dated to 2.6&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Evidence shows these early hominins intentionally selected raw materials with good flaking qualities and chose appropriate sized stones for their needs to produce sharp-edged tools for cutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Semaw|first1=Sileshi|title=The World's Oldest Stone Artefacts from Gona, Ethiopia: Their Implications for Understanding Stone Technology and Patterns of Human Evolution Between 2.6–1.5 Million Years Ago|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2000|volume=27|issue=12|pages=1197–1214|doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0592|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440399905927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Paleolithic stone tool industry, the [[Oldowan]], began around 2.6&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite book |author=Klein, R. |year=1999 |title=The Human Career |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained tools such as choppers, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, and [[stitching awl]]s. It was completely replaced around 250,000 years ago by the more complex Acheulean industry, which was first conceived by ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' around 1.8–1.65&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Roche H et al., 2002, ''Les sites archaéologiques pio-pléistocènes de la formation de Nachuku 663–673, qtd in Scarre, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Acheulean implements completely vanish from the archaeological record around 100,000 years ago and were replaced by more complex Middle Paleolithic tool kits such as the [[Mousterian]] and the [[Aterian]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Desmond Clark|Clark, JD]], ''Variability in primary and secondary technologies of the Later Acheulian in Africa'' in Milliken, S and Cook, J (eds), 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower Paleolithic humans used a variety of stone tools, including [[hand axe]]s and [[Chopper (archaeology)|choppers]]. Although they appear to have used hand axes often, there is disagreement about their use. Interpretations range from cutting and chopping tools, to digging implements, to flaking cores, to the use in traps, and as a purely ritual significance, perhaps in [[courting behavior]]. [[William H. Calvin]] has suggested that some hand axes could have served as "killer [[Frisbees]]" meant to be thrown at a herd of animals at a waterhole so as to stun one of them. There are no indications of [[hafting]], and some artifacts are far too large for that. Thus, a thrown hand axe would not usually have penetrated deeply enough to cause very serious injuries. Nevertheless, it could have been an effective weapon for defense against predators. Choppers and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] were likely used for skinning and butchering scavenged animals and sharp-ended sticks were often obtained for digging up edible roots. Presumably, early humans used wooden spears as early as 5&amp;nbsp;million years ago to hunt small animals, much as their relatives, [[chimpanzee]]s, have been observed to do in [[Senegal]], Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Weiss, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/22/AR2007022201007.html "Chimps Observed Making Their Own Weapons"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Lower Paleolithic humans constructed shelters, such as the possible wood hut at [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]].

====Fire use====
Fire was used by the Lower Paleolithic hominins ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''Homo ergaster'' as early as 300,000 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago and possibly even earlier by the early Lower Paleolithic (Oldowan) hominin ''Homo habilis'' or by robust ''[[Australopithecine]]s'' such as ''[[Paranthropus]]''.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; However, the use of fire only became common in the societies of the following [[Middle Stone Age]] and [[Middle Paleolithic]].&lt;ref name=Thoth&amp;Schick/&gt; Use of fire reduced mortality rates and provided protection against predators.&lt;ref name=MarloweFW22&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marlowe FW |title=Hunter-gatherers and human evolution |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=15294 |year=2005 |format=PDF |url=http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/people/faculty/marlowe_pubs/hunter-gatherers%20and%20human%20evolution.pdf |doi=10.1002/evan.20046 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527230019/http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/people/faculty/marlowe_pubs/hunter-gatherers%20and%20human%20evolution.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early hominins may have begun to cook their food as early as the Lower Paleolithic ({{c.|1.9}}&amp;nbsp;million years ago) or at the latest in the early Middle Paleolithic ({{c.|250,000}} years ago).&lt;ref name=Wrangham&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wrangham R, Conklin-Brittain N |title=Cooking as a biological trait |journal=Comp Biochem Physiol a Mol Integr Physiol |volume=136 |issue=1 |pages=35–46 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14527628 |doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(03)00020-5 |url=http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/anth630/reading/Week%208%20Diet%20tubers/Wrangham%20and%20Conklin-Brittain%202003.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050519215539/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/anth630/reading/Week%208%20Diet%20tubers/Wrangham%20and%20Conklin-Brittain%202003.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists have hypothesized that hominins began cooking food to defrost frozen meat, which would help ensure their survival in cold regions.&lt;ref name=Wrangham/&gt;

====Rafts====
The Lower Paleolithic ''Homo erectus'' possibly invented [[raft]]s ({{c.|840,000|800,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP) to travel over large bodies of water, which may have allowed a group of ''Homo erectus'' to reach the island of [[Flores]] and evolve into the small hominin ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. However, this hypothesis is disputed within the anthropological community.&lt;ref name="vicnet1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/mariners/web/mariner1.html |title=First Mariners Project Photo Gallery 1 |publisher=Mc2.vicnet.net.au |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025085331/http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/mariners/web/mariner1.html |archivedate=2009-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/mariners/web/ng2004.html |title=First Mariners – National Geographic project 2004 |publisher=Mc2.vicnet.net.au |date=2004-10-02 |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026043820/http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/mariners/web/ng2004.html |archivedate=2009-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible use of rafts during the Lower Paleolithic may indicate that Lower Paleolithic hominins such as ''Homo erectus'' were more advanced than previously believed, and may have even spoken an early form of modern language.&lt;ref name="vicnet1"/&gt; Supplementary evidence from Neanderthal and modern human sites located around the Mediterranean Sea, such as Coa de sa Multa ({{c.|300,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP), has also indicated that both Middle and Upper Paleolithic humans used rafts to travel over large bodies of water (i.e. the Mediterranean Sea) for the purpose of colonizing other bodies of land.&lt;ref name="vicnet1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller2006"&gt;{{cite book |title= Anthropology|last=Miller |first=Barbra |author2=Bernard Wood |author3=Andrew Balansky |author4=Julio Mercader |author5=Melissa Panger  |year=2006 |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston Massachusetts |isbn= 0-205-32024-4 | page= 768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advanced tools====
By around 200,000&amp;nbsp;BP, [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[stone tool]] manufacturing spawned a tool making technique known as the [[prepared-core technique]], that was more elaborate than previous [[Acheulean]] techniques.&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"/&gt; This technique increased efficiency by allowing the creation of more controlled and consistent [[Lithic flake|flake]]s.&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"/&gt; It allowed Middle Paleolithic humans to create stone tipped [[spear]]s, which were the earliest composite tools, by hafting sharp, pointy stone flakes onto wooden shafts. In addition to improving tool making methods, the Middle Paleolithic also saw an improvement of the tools themselves that allowed access to a wider variety and amount of food sources. For example, [[microlith]]s or small stone tools or points were invented around 70,000–65,000&amp;nbsp;BP and were essential to the invention of bows and [[spear thrower]]s in the following Upper Paleolithic.&lt;ref name=MarloweFW22/&gt;

[[Harpoon]]s were invented and used for the first time during the late Middle Paleolithic ({{c.|90,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP); the invention of these devices brought fish into the human diets, which provided a hedge against starvation and a more abundant food supply.&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-1"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566394_12/human_evolution.html "Human Evolution," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408032236/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566394_12/human_evolution.html |date=2008-04-08 }} Contributed by Richard B.

====Other inventions====
During the [[Upper Paleolithic]], further inventions were made, such as the [[net (device)|net]] {{c.|22,000}} or {{c.|29,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP)&lt;ref name=MarloweFW22/&gt; [[bolas]],&lt;ref&gt;J. Chavaillon, D. Lavallée, « Bola », in ''Dictionnaire de la Préhistoire'', PUF, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[spear thrower]] ({{c.|30,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP), the bow and arrow ({{c.|25,000|lk=no}} or {{c.|30,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP)&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; and the oldest example of ceramic art, the [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]] ({{c.|29,000|25,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; Early dogs were domesticated, sometime between 30,000 and 14,000&amp;nbsp;BP, presumably to aid in hunting.&lt;ref name=TheBookofGeneralIgnorance&gt;[[John Lloyd (producer)|Lloyd, J]] &amp; [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, J]]: "[[The Book of General Ignorance]]". Faber &amp; Faber, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest instances of successful domestication of dogs may be much more ancient than this. Evidence from [[canidae|canine]] [[DNA]] collected by Robert K. Wayne suggests that dogs may have been first domesticated in the late Middle Paleolithic around 100,000&amp;nbsp;BP or perhaps even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/pdfs/data/1997/151-26/15126-11.pdf |title= stalking the ancient dog |work=Science news |author=Christine Mellot |accessdate=2008-01-03|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence from the [[Dordogne]] region of France demonstrates that members of the European early [[Upper Paleolithic]] culture known as the [[Aurignacian]] used calendars ({{c.|30,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP). This was a lunar calendar that was used to document the phases of the moon. Genuine solar calendars did not appear until the Neolithic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ideas that changed the world|author=Felipe Fernandez Armesto|publisher=Dorling Kindersley limited|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7566-3298-4|location=New York City|page=400|doi=|oclc=}}; [https://books.google.com/books?id=tFIAAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Ideas+that+changed+the+world+by+Felipe+Fernandez+Armesto]&lt;/ref&gt; Upper Paleolithic cultures were probably able to time the migration of game animals such as wild horses and deer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-2"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555928_4/Stone_Age.html "Stone Age," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx4KzGHP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555928_4/Stone_Age.html |date=2009-11-01 }} Contributed by Kathy Schick, B.A., M.A., Ph.D. and Nicholas Toth, B.A., M.A., Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; This ability allowed humans to become efficient hunters and to exploit a wide variety of game animals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-2"/&gt; Recent research indicates that the Neanderthals timed their hunts and the migrations of game animals long before the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic.&lt;ref name=Parson2006/&gt;

===Social organization===
{{Unreliable sources|date=February 2010}}

[[File:Arrowhead.jpg|thumb|Humans may have taken part in long-distance trade between [[band society|bands]] for rare commodities and raw materials (such as stone needed for making tools) as early as 120,000 years ago in Middle Paleolithic.]]
The social organization of the earliest Paleolithic ([[Lower Paleolithic]]) societies remains largely unknown to scientists, though Lower Paleolithic hominins such as ''Homo habilis'' and ''Homo erectus'' are likely to have had more complex social structures than chimpanzee societies.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~arch/saa/matrix/ia/ia03_mod_10.html |title=Intro to archeology The First People and Culture |accessdate=2008-03-20 |author=Nancy White |work=Introduction to archeology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Late Oldowan/Early Acheulean humans such as ''Homo ergaster''/''Homo erectus'' may have been the first people to invent central campsites or home bases and incorporate them into their foraging and hunting strategies like contemporary hunter-gatherers, possibly as early as 1.7 million years ago;&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"/&gt; however, the earliest solid evidence for the existence of home bases or central campsites (hearths and shelters) among humans only dates back to 500,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2014}}

Similarly, scientists disagree whether Lower Paleolithic humans were largely [[monogamous]] or [[polygynous]].&lt;ref name=White/&gt; In particular, the Provisional model suggests that [[bipedalism]] arose in pre-Paleolithic australopithecine societies as an adaptation to monogamous lifestyles; however, other researchers note that [[sexual dimorphism]] is more pronounced in Lower Paleolithic humans such as ''Homo erectus'' than in modern humans, who are less polygynous than other primates, which suggests that Lower Paleolithic humans had a largely polygynous lifestyle, because species that have the most pronounced sexual dimorphism tend more likely to be polygynous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6937476.stm |title=Finds test human origins theory |publisher=[[BBC News]] |author=James Urquhart|accessdate=2008-03-20 | date=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human societies from the Paleolithic to the early Neolithic farming tribes lived without states and organized governments. For most of the Lower Paleolithic, human societies were possibly more hierarchical than their Middle and Upper Paleolithic descendants, and probably were not grouped into [[band society|bands]],&lt;ref name=Bohem198-208&gt;Christopher Boehm (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ljxS8gUlgqgC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Paleolithic&amp;lr=&amp;sig=V-GOM-s3rCApE_baw2oRoaw24w8#PPA198,M1 "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior" page 198–208] Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; though during the end of the Lower Paleolithic, the latest populations of the hominin ''Homo erectus'' may have begun living in small-scale (possibly egalitarian) bands similar to both Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies and modern hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref name=Bohem198-208/&gt;

Middle Paleolithic societies, unlike Lower Paleolithic and early Neolithic ones, consisted of bands that ranged from 20–30 or 25–100 members and were usually nomadic.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bohem198-208/&gt; These bands were formed by several families. Bands sometimes joined together into larger "macrobands" for activities such as acquiring mates and celebrations or where resources were abundant.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; By the end of the Paleolithic era ({{c.|10,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP), people began to settle down into permanent locations, and began to rely on agriculture for sustenance in many locations.

Some Upper Paleolithic societies in resource-rich environments (such as societies in [[Sungir]], in what is now Russia) may have had more complex and hierarchical organization (such as [[tribe]]s with a pronounced hierarchy and a somewhat formal [[division of labor]]) and may have engaged in [[endemic warfare]].&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Raymond C. Warless societies and the origin of war. Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that there was no formal leadership during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. Like contemporary egalitarian hunter-gatherers such as the [[Mbuti#Political structure|Mbuti]] pygmies, societies may have made decisions by communal [[consensus decision making]] rather than by appointing permanent rulers such as chiefs and [[monarch]]s.&lt;ref name="Kusimba 2003 285"/&gt; Nor was there a formal [[division of labor]] during the Paleolithic. Each member of the group was skilled at all tasks essential to survival, regardless of individual abilities. Theories to explain the apparent egalitarianism have arisen, notably the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of [[primitive communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Communist Manifesto |first=Karl |last=Marx |url= https://books.google.com/?id=TiKKmyacAiAC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;vq=Primitive+communism|author2=Friedrich Engels |year=1848 |location=London |page=87 |isbn=978-1-59986-995-7 }} Page 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, Stephen Henry (1999).

Kelly speculates that the relative peacefulness of Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies resulted from a low population density, cooperative relationships between groups such as reciprocal exchange of commodities and collaboration on hunting expeditions, and because the invention of projectile weapons such as throwing spears provided less incentive for war, because they increased the damage done to the attacker and decreased the relative amount of territory attackers could gain.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; However, other sources claim that most Paleolithic groups may have been larger, more complex, sedentary and warlike than most contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, due to occupying more resource-abundant areas than most modern hunter-gatherers who have been pushed into more marginal habitats by agricultural societies.&lt;ref name=Kiefer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suluarchipelago.com/E20Website2002/default.htm|title=Anthropology E-20|accessdate=2008-03-11 |author=Thomas M.

Anthropologists have typically assumed that in Paleolithic societies, women were responsible for gathering wild plants and firewood, and men were responsible for hunting and scavenging dead animals.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt; However, analogies to existent hunter-gatherer societies such as the [[Hadza people]] and the [[Aboriginal Australians]] suggest that the sexual division of labor in the Paleolithic was relatively flexible.

Early examples of artistic expression, such as the [[Venus of Tan-Tan]] and the patterns found on [[elephant]] bones from [[Bilzingsleben (Paleolithic site)|Bilzingsleben]] in [[Thuringia]], may have been produced by Acheulean tool users such as ''[[Homo erectus]]'' prior to the start of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period.

Lower Paleolithic [[Acheulean]] tool users, according to Robert G. Bednarik, began to engage in symbolic behavior such as art around 850,000&amp;nbsp;BP. They decorated themselves with beads and collected exotic stones for aesthetic, rather than utilitarian qualities.&lt;ref name=Bednarik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semioticon.com/frontline/bednarik.htm |title=Beads and the origins of symbolism |author=Robert G. Bednarik |accessdate=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, traces of the pigment ochre from late Lower Paleolithic Acheulean archaeological sites suggests that Acheulean societies, like later Upper Paleolithic societies, collected and used ochre to create rock art.&lt;ref name=Bednarik/&gt; Nevertheless, it is also possible that the ochre traces found at Lower Paleolithic sites is naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G.

The earliest explanation, by the prehistorian [[Abbe Breuil]], interpreted the paintings as a form of magic designed to ensure a successful hunt.&lt;ref name=Clottes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/clottes/page7.php |title=Shamanism in Prehistory |author=Jean Clottes |accessdate=2008-03-11 |work=Bradshaw foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430093540/http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/clottes/page7.php |archivedate=2008-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis fails to explain the existence of animals such as [[saber-toothed cat]]s and [[lion]]s, which were not hunted for food, and the existence of half-human, half-animal beings in cave paintings. The anthropologist [[David Lewis-Williams]] has suggested that Paleolithic cave paintings were indications of [[shaman]]istic practices, because the paintings of half-human, half-animal paintings and the remoteness of the caves are reminiscent of modern hunter-gatherer shamanistic practices.&lt;ref name=Clottes/&gt; Symbol-like images are more common in Paleolithic cave paintings than are depictions of animals or humans, and unique symbolic patterns might have been trademarks that represent different [[Upper Paleolithic]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;"Paleolithic Art", Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007

The "Venus" figurines have been theorized, not universally, as representing a [[mother goddess]]; the abundance of such female imagery has inspired the theory that Paleolithic (and later Neolithic) societies centered their religion and societies around women. Adherents of the theory include archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] and [[feminist]] scholar [[Merlin Stone]], the author of the 1976 book ''[[When God Was a Woman]]''.&lt;ref name=Merlinstone&gt;{{cite book |title=When God Was a Woman |author=Merlin Stone.

===Music===
The origins of music during the Paleolithic are unknown. The earliest forms of music probably did not use musical instruments other than the human voice or natural objects such as rocks. This early music would not have left an archaeological footprint.  Music may have developed from rhythmic sounds produced by daily chores, for example, cracking open nuts with stones. Maintaining a rhythm while working may have helped people to become more efficient at daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bücher. '''Trabajo y ritmo'''. Biblioteca Científico-Filosófica, Madrid.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative theory originally proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] explains that music may have begun as a hominin mating strategy. Bird and other animal species produce music such as calls to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin. '''The origin of man'''. Edimat books, S. A. {{ISBN|84-8403-034-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is generally less accepted than the previous hypothesis, but nonetheless provides a possible alternative.

[[Upper Paleolithic]] (and possibly [[Middle Paleolithic]])&lt;ref name="BoneAge"&gt;Nelson, D.E., ''Radiocarbon dating of bone and charcoal from Divje babe I cave'', cited by Morley, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; humans used [[flute]]-like bone pipes as musical instruments,&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bahn, Paul 1996"&gt;Bahn, Paul (1996) "The atlas of world archeology" Copyright 2000 The Brown Reference Group PLC&lt;/ref&gt; and music may have played a large role in the religious lives of Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. As with modern hunter-gatherer societies, music may have been used in ritual or to help induce [[trance]]s. In particular, it appears that animal skin [[drum]]s may have been used in religious events by Upper Paleolithic shamans, as shown by the remains of drum-like instruments from some Upper Paleolithic graves of shamans and the [[ethnography|ethnographic]] record of contemporary hunter-gatherer shamanic and ritual practices.&lt;ref name=Tedlock/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-3"/&gt;

According to James B. Harrod humankind first developed [[religion|religious]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] beliefs during the [[Middle Paleolithic]] or [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsnet.org/aboutornet1.html |title=About OriginsNet by James Harrod |publisher=Originsnet.org |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial scholars of prehistoric religion and anthropology, James Harrod and Vincent W. Fallio, have recently proposed that religion and spirituality (and art) may have first arisen in Pre-Paleolithic chimpanzees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.originsnet.org/chimpspiritdatabase.pdf |title=Appendices for chimpanzee spirituality by James Harrod |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527230019/http://www.originsnet.org/chimpspiritdatabase.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Early [[Lower Paleolithic]] ([[Oldowan]]) societies.&lt;ref name="V.Fallio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsnet.org/mindold.html |title=Oldowan Art, Religion, Symbols, Mind by James Harrod |publisher=Originsnet.org |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fallio, the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans experienced altered states of consciousness and partook in ritual, and ritual was used in their societies to strengthen social bonding and group cohesion.&lt;ref name="V.Fallio"/&gt;

Middle Paleolithic humans' use of burials at sites such as [[Krapina]], Croatia ({{c.|130,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP) and [[Qafzeh]], Israel ({{c.|100,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP) have led some anthropologists and archaeologists, such as [[Philip Lieberman]], to believe that Middle Paleolithic humans may have possessed a belief in an [[afterlife]] and a "concern for the dead that transcends daily life".&lt;ref name=Lieberman/&gt; Cut marks on Neanderthal bones from various sites, such as Combe-Grenal and Abri Moula in France, suggest that the [[Neanderthal#Cannibalism or ritual defleshing.3F|Neanderthals]]—like some contemporary human cultures—may have practiced [[excarnation|ritual defleshing]] for (presumably) religious reasons. According to recent archaeological findings from ''Homo heidelbergensis'' sites in [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]], humans may have begun burying their dead much earlier, during the late [[Lower Paleolithic]]; but this theory is widely questioned in the scientific community.

Likewise, some scientists have proposed that Middle Paleolithic societies such as Neanderthal societies may also have practiced the earliest form of [[totemism]] or [[animal worship]], in addition to their (presumably religious) burial of the dead. In particular, Emil Bächler suggested (based on archaeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a [[bear]] [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] was widespread among Middle Paleolithic [[Neanderthal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wunn, Ina (2000).

The existence of anthropomorphic images and half-human, half-animal images in the Upper Paleolithic may further indicate that [[Upper Paleolithic]] humans were the first people to believe in a [[Polytheism|pantheon of gods or supernatural beings]],&lt;ref name="mithen"&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Steve Mithen|isbn=0-500-05081-3| title=The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science| year=1996| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| author=Steven Mithen}}&lt;/ref&gt; though such images may instead indicate shamanistic practices similar to those of contemporary tribal societies.&lt;ref name="Clottes"/&gt; The earliest known undisputed burial of a shaman (and by extension the earliest undisputed evidence of shamans and shamanic practices) dates back to the early [[Upper Paleolithic]] era ({{c.|30,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP) in what is now the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name=Tedlock/&gt; However, during the early Upper Paleolithic it was probably more common for all members of the band to participate equally and fully in religious ceremonies, in contrast to the religious traditions of later periods when religious authorities and part-time ritual specialists such as shamans, priests and medicine men were relatively common and integral to religious life.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"/&gt; Additionally, it is also possible that Upper Paleolithic religions, like contemporary and historical [[animism|animistic]] and [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, believed in the existence of a single creator deity in addition to other supernatural beings such as animistic spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From earth spirits to sky gods Socioecological Origins of Monotheism|last= Lerro |first=Bruce |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qs5RqLdx1HgC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;vq=Paleolithic |year=2000 |publisher=Lexington Press |location= Lanham MD |isbn=0-7391-0098-X |page=327 }} pages 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent W. Fallio writes that [[ancestor worship|ancestor cults]] first emerged in complex Upper Paleolithic societies. He argues that the elites of these societies (like the elites of many more contemporary complex hunter-gatherers such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]) may have used special rituals and ancestor worship to solidify control over their societies, by convincing their subjects that they possess a link to the spirit world that also gives them control over the earthly realm.&lt;ref name="V.Fallio"/&gt; [[Secret societies]] may have served a similar function in these complex quasi-[[theocratic]] societies, by dividing the religious practices of these cultures into the separate spheres of [[folk religion]] and [[elite religion]].&lt;ref name="V.Fallio"/&gt;

Religion was possibly [[wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]]; specifically, it may have involved [[sympathetic magic]].&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt; The [[Venus figurines]], which are abundant in the Upper Paleolithic archaeological record, provide an example of possible Paleolithic sympathetic magic, as they may have been used for ensuring success in hunting and to bring about fertility of the land and women.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; The Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines have sometimes been explained as depictions of an [[earth goddess]] similar to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], or as representations of a goddess who is the ruler or mother of the animals.&lt;ref name=Narr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L.

For example, humans probably did not possess the control of fire until the Middle Paleolithic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In addition, the Paleolithic involved a substantial geographical expansion of human populations. During the Lower Paleolithic, ancestors of modern humans are thought to have been constrained to Africa east of the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]]. During the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, humans greatly expanded their area of settlement, reaching ecosystems as diverse as [[New Guinea]] and [[Alaska]], and adapting their diets to whatever local resources were available.

Another view is that until the Upper Paleolithic, humans were [[frugivore]]s (fruit eaters) who supplemented their meals with carrion, eggs, and small prey such as baby birds and [[mussel]]s, and only on rare occasions managed to kill and consume big game such as [[antelope]]s.&lt;ref name=HartSussman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by studies of higher apes, particularly [[chimpanzee]]s. Chimpanzees are the closest to humans genetically, sharing more than 96% of their DNA code with humans, and their digestive tract is functionally very similar to that of humans.&lt;ref name=nationalgeographic_com&gt;{{cite news|last=Lovgren|first=Stefan|title=Chimps, Humans 96 Percent the Same, Gene Study Finds|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0831_050831_chimp_genes.html|accessdate=23 December 2013|date=31 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimpanzees are primarily [[frugivore]]s, but they could and would consume and digest animal flesh, given the opportunity. In general, their actual diet in the wild is about 95% [[Plant-based diet|plant-based]], with the remaining 5% filled with insects, eggs, and baby animals.&lt;ref&gt;

Anthropologists have diverse opinions about the proportions of plant and animal foods consumed. Just as with still existing hunters and gatherers, there were many varied "diets"—in different groups—and also varying through this vast amount of time. Some paleolithic hunter-gatherers consumed a significant amount of meat and possibly obtained most of their food from hunting,&lt;ref&gt;Cordain L.

Upper Paleolithic cultures appear to have had significant knowledge about plants and herbs and may have, albeit very rarely, practiced rudimentary forms of [[horticulture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Academic American Encyclopedia By Grolier Incorporated |title=Academic American Encyclopedia By Grolier Incorporated |publisher=Grolier Academic Reference| location=University of Michigan |year=1994 }}; [https://books.google.com/books?id=7eKy64bqc2AC&amp;q=paleolithic+horticulture&amp;dq=paleolithic+horticulture&amp;pgis=1 p 61]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[banana]]s and [[tuber]]s may have been cultivated as early as 25,000&amp;nbsp;BP in [[southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=Kiefer/&gt; Late Upper Paleolithic societies also appear to have occasionally practiced [[pastoralism]] and [[animal husbandry]], presumably for dietary reasons. For instance, some European late Upper Paleolithic cultures domesticated and raised [[reindeer]], presumably for their meat or milk, as early as 14,000&amp;nbsp;BP.&lt;ref name="TheBookofGeneralIgnorance"/&gt; Humans also probably consumed [[hallucinogenic]] plants during the Paleolithic.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; The [[Aboriginal Australians]] have been consuming a variety of native animal and plant foods, called [[bushfood]], for an estimated 60,000 years, since the [[Middle Paleolithic]].

[[File:Quivira-Whitetail-Buck.jpg|thumb|Large game animals such as deer were an important source of protein in Middle and Upper Paleolithic diets.]]
People during the Middle Paleolithic, such as the Neanderthals and Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in Africa, began to catch shellfish for food as revealed by shellfish cooking in Neanderthal sites in Italy about 110,000 years ago and in Middle Paleolithic ''Homo sapiens'' sites at [[Pinnacle Point]], Africa around 164,000&amp;nbsp;BP.&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTIMES/10/08/07"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/science/18beach.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science&amp;oref=slogin|title=Key Human Traits Tied to Shellfish Remains |work=New York Times|author=John Noble Wilford |accessdate=2008-03-11 | date=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fishing only became common during the [[Upper Paleolithic]],&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/11/1108_bonetool_2.html African Bone Tools Dispute Key Idea About Human Evolution] National Geographic News article.&lt;/ref&gt; [[fish]] have been part of human diets long before the dawn of the Upper Paleolithic and have certainly been consumed by humans since at least the Middle Paleolithic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-2"/&gt; For example, the Middle Paleolithic ''Homo sapiens'' in the region now occupied by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] hunted large {{cvt|6|ft|m|adj=on}}-long [[catfish]] with specialized barbed fishing points as early as 90,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-2"/&gt; The invention of fishing allowed some Upper Paleolithic and later hunter-gatherer societies to become sedentary or semi-nomadic, which altered their social structures.&lt;ref name="Bahn, Paul 1996"/&gt; Example societies are the [[Lepenski Vir]] as well as some contemporary hunter-gatherers, such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]. In some instances (at least the Tlingit), they developed [[social stratification]], [[slavery]], and complex social structures such as [[chiefdom]]s.&lt;ref name=MarloweFW22/&gt;

Anthropologists such as Tim White suggest that [[cannibalism]] was common in human societies prior to the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, based on the large amount of “butchered human" bones found in Neanderthal and other Lower/Middle Paleolithic sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-TVHr_XtDJcC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=paleolithic+cannibalism|title= Once were Cannibals |work=Evolution: A Scientific American Reader|author=Tim D. White |accessdate=2008-02-14 |isbn=978-0-226-74269-4 |date=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannibalism in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic may have occurred because of food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061205-cannibals.html|title=Neandertals Turned to Cannibalism, Bone Cave Suggests |work=National Geographic News |author=James Owen |accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may have been for religious reasons, and would coincide with the development of religious practices thought to have occurred during the Upper Paleolithic.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pathou-Mathis M | year = 2000 | title = Neanderthal subsistence behaviours in Europe | journal = International Journal of Osteoarchaeology | volume = 10 | pages = 379–395 | doi = 10.1002/1099-1212(200009/10)10:5&lt;379::AID-OA558&gt;3.0.CO;2-4 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it remains possible that Paleolithic societies never practiced cannibalism, and that the damage to recovered human bones was either the result of [[excarnation]] or predation by carnivores such as [[saber-toothed cat]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[hyena]]s.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt;

A modern-day diet  known as the [[Paleolithic diet]] exists, based on restricting consumption to the foods presumed to be available to anatomically modern humans prior to the advent of settled [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prehistoric Dining: The Real Paleo Diet|url=http://theplate.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/22/prehistoric-dining-the-real-paleo-diet/|website=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Dec. 26, 1971, Critton boarded Air Canada DC-9 Flight 932 in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]] bound for [[Toronto]]. Armed with a handgun and a grenade, he demanded the plane to fly to [[Havana, Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noahc.org/?pgid=6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E7DE1538F932A2575AC0A9679C8B63 Traced on Internet, Teacher Is Charged In '71 Jet Hijacking - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the incident, Critton mistakenly thought he was a fugitive in New York City for a series of crimes, including [[bank robbery]]. He had fled to [[Canada]], where he continued a life of crime.

He released all passengers in Toronto on his way to Havana and after he exited in Havana, the plane returned to Toronto safely with the board of crew members. No injuries or casualties were caused during the hijack.

Canada did not have an extradition agreement with Cuba regarding hijacking by then.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noahc.org/?pgid=6&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in Cuba, Critton served an 8-month prison sentence. Following his sentence, he first worked in the [[sugar cane]] industry in Cuba. Two years later, he moved to [[Tanzania]], where he became a teacher. He also married and had two children before returning to the United States in 1994, feeling safe from the time passed.

Critton remained a fugitive until 2001, when he was found by a detective through a [[Google]] search, which at that time produced a single hit with his name that revealed the location where he was teaching. The one hit was a March 2001 article describing his mentoring of black youth.

Critton was arrested on September 10, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E7DE1538F932A2575AC0A9679C8B63 Traced on Internet, Teacher Is Charged In '71 Jet Hijacking - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fingerprint]]s on a [[ginger ale]] bottle found on the plane linked Critton to the hijacking. Prosecutors, in order to avoid prejudicing the jury, based on the views of the recent [[September 11 attacks]], which had happened the day after Critton was arrested, portrayed Critton to jurors not as a terrorist, but as a [[kidnap]]per and [[robber]] whose motivation was to gain the flight to Cuba.

Critton received a five-year prison sentence for the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/06/12/critton020612.html Hijacker sentenced to three years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in June 2003 after 1 year and 10 months.

[[File:Qatar Red Crescent branch.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of the Qatar Red Crescent Society in [[Doha]].]]
The [[Qatari]] branch of the [[Red Crescent Society]], the '''Qatar Red Crescent''' (QRC), was established in 1978. In 1981, it gained international recognition from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] in [[Geneva]] and joined the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC). It is also a member of the Secretariat of Arab Red Crescent Societies in [[Jeddah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Pages - Foundation &amp; Specialty|url = http://www.qrcs.org.qa/English/WhoWeAre/Pages/FoundationAndSpecialty.aspx|website = www.qrcs.org.qa|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first philanthropic organization in Qatar to establish a women's branch in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.qa/en/Qatar/Pages/QatariWomen.aspx|title=Qatari Women|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QRC is headquartered in [[Doha]], but the organization works throughout the country. Their primary goal is to reduce detrimental effects of catastrophe and relieve suffering by contributing social and humanitarian services coinciding with the mission of its parent organization, the Red Crescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Qatar Red Crescent Society|url = http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/organizations/qatar-red-crescent-society|website = berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

=== Domestic activities ===
QRC was the first voluntary charity organization in [[Qatar]]. It is very active in aiding and developing relief programs for victims of disaster worldwide. Within Qatar, their programs include social development, training and qualification, awareness and education, programs and medical service, and advocacy community issues. Internationally QRC engages in relief and humanitarian activities, development and empowerment, and advocacy and humanitarian [[diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Pages - International Activities|url = http://www.qrcs.org.qa/English/WhatWeDo/Pages/InternationalActivities.aspx|website = www.qrcs.org.qa|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the conflict in the [[Gaza strip]] in fall 2014, the QRC helped, with Qatari government contributions, by providing medical supplies and fuel for hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qatar Red Crescent responds to immediate and long-term needs in Gaza|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/middle-east-and-north-africa/qatar/qatar-red-crescent-responds-to-immediate-and-long-terms-needs-in-gaza-67105/|website=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International activities ===

==== Mali ==== 
Qatar Red Crescent Society was the only humanitarian organization present in Northern [[Mali]] following the Islamist takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130121-qatar-mali-france-ansar-dine-mnla-al-qaeda-sunni-islam-doha |title=Africa - Is Qatar fuelling the crisis in north Mali? |publisher=France 24 |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This presence raised questions over whether QRC was supporting the Islamists or helping local population. QRC’s stated purpose of the mission was to “distribute food aid to 1,000 households and conduct an assessment of the population’s needs in water, sanitation, health and food security.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/middle-east-and-north-africa/qatar/putting-the-community-at-the-centre-of-disaster-response-and-risk-reduction-in-mali-58520/ |title=Putting the community at the centre of disaster response and risk reduction in Mali |publisher=IFRC |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gaza Strip ==== 
In the September 2014 Gaza conflict, QRC was on the ground providing medical and ambulance services. They also donated several million [[Qatari riyal|Qatari Riyals]] to provide relief for Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/middle-east-and-north-africa/qatar/qatar-red-crescent-responds-to-immediate-and-long-terms-needs-in-gaza-67105/ |title=Qatar Red Crescent responds to immediate and long-term needs in Gaza |publisher=IFRC |date=2014-09-25 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Syria ====
The QRC has also been active in [[Syria]] where it has engaged in ongoing humanitarian efforts to build roads in the [[Latakia]] Countryside and ensure secure transportation of those injured in the conflict to safer adjacent territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/qrc-helps-open-humanitarian-corridors-latakia-countryside |title=QRC Helps Open Humanitarian Corridors in Latakia Countryside |publisher=Reliefweb.int |date=2015-06-21 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also launched a psychological support center in 2013 for refugees of the Syrian crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/middle-east-and-north-africa/qatar/qatar-red-crescent-society-establishes-psychological-services-center-for-syrian-refugees-61258/ |title=Qatar Red Crescent Society establishes psychological services centre for Syrian refugees |publisher=IFRC |date=2013-04-17 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sudan ====
In [[West Darfur]], QRC has been instrumental in providing agricultural machinery to improve the livelihoods of local communities. QRC has had a representative office in West Darfur to oversee its projects there since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/development-projects-west-darfur |title=Development Projects in West Darfur |publisher=Reliefweb.int |date=2015-06-21 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

== Partnerships ==
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies partnered with Qatar-based [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] in May 2014. This agreement built on relations developed over several years between QRC and Al Jazeera.  The goal of the agreement was to give a voice to the voiceless by drawing attention and support to the victims of disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/middle-east-and-north-africa/qatar/aljazeera-media-network-and-the-ifrc-to-enhance-cooperation-for-giving-a-voice-to-the-voiceless-66016/ |title=Al Jazeera media network and the IFRC to enhance cooperation and ‘give a voice to the voiceless’ |publisher=IFRC |date=2014-05-26 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In coordination with QRC, the IFRC signed a partnership agreement in 2013 with Qatar’s Cultural Village Foundation (“Katara”) to help build more resilient and peaceful communities in the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/press-releases/middle-east-and-north-africa/qatar/katara-foundation-and-the-ifrc-sign-partnership-to-build-stronger-red-cross-red-crescent-societies/ |title=KATARA foundation and the IFRC sign partnership to build stronger Red Cross Red Crescent societies |publisher=IFRC |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, QRC signed a partnership agreement with the [[Mali Red Cross]] to “ensure strong coordination in planning and implementing projects in Northern Mali”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Accusations of Ties to Extremism ==
Operating in several areas of conflict, Qatar Red Crescent Society has been accused through blogs and think tank publications of supporting Islamist and terrorist groups. However it has always been cleared from these accusations of support to terrorism by the United Nations [https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/sanctions/1267/aq_sanctions_list%20UN%20terror%20list%20established%20and%20maintained%20pursuant%20to%20Security%20Council%20res.%201267/1989/2253 see e.g. the UN terror list established and maintained pursuant to Security Council resolution 1267/1989/2253].

In June 2012 when Northern Mali was taken over by Islamists, Qatar Red Crescent was the only humanitarian organization that was granted access to the territory by the Islamists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightsidenews.com/2014092334879/world/terrorism/qatar-s-support-of-hamas-and-jihadist-forces-in-the-middle-east.html |title=Qatar's Support of Hamas and Jihadist Forces in the Middle East |publisher=Rightside News |date=2013-09-23 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the QRC raised more than $10 million at an event where the primary speaker was [[Hussam Badran]], a Hamas leader who once supported bombing attacks in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Jerusalem Center |url=http://jcpa.org/article/qatars-support-of-hamas-jihadist-forces/ |title=Qatar's Support of Hamas and Jihadist Forces |publisher=Jcpa.org |date=2014-09-23 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar Red Crescent is not the only Qatari charitable organization accused of ties to extremism. Qatar Charity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gartenstein |first=Daveed |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/02/25/uncharitable-organizations/ |title=Uncharitable Organizations |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sheikh Eid Bin Mohammad Al Thani Charity Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/pressroom/2008/pages/defense%20minister%20signs%20order%20banning%20hamas-affiliated%20charitable%20organizations%207-jul-2008.aspx |title=Defense Minister signs order banning Hamas-affiliated charitable organizations |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also both been allegedly connected to terrorist groups, although [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/qatar-charities-sign-deals-worth-85m-syria-170708153415632.html the United Nations publicly rejected these assertions and subsequently co-organized in 2017 high-profile activities with these relief organizations]. None of the Qatari humanitarian organizations has ever been listed on the [https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/sanctions/1267/aq_sanctions_list UN terror list established and maintained pursuant to Security Council res. 1267/1989/2253].

'''Raees Ahmadzai''' (born 3 September 1984){{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} is a former [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[cricket]]er who represented the [[Afghanistan national cricket team]] until his retirement in May 2010. Ahmadzai is a right-handed [[Batsman (cricket)|batsman]] who bowls right-arm [[off break]]. He is also [[UNICEF National Goodwill Ambassador]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ahmadfaisalsidiqi.blogspot.com/2011/09/unicef-afghanistan-announces-first.html?spref=fb&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Ahmadzai was born in the village of [[Azra District|Azra]], [[Logar Province]], [[Afghanistan]]. He is from the [[Kuchi people|Kuchi tribe]], along with former teammates [[Mohammad Nabi]] and [[Dawlat Ahmadzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/GENERAL/BLOGS/raeesahmadzai.shtml |title=Raees Ahmadzai Blog, CricketEurope |publisher=Cricketeurope4.net |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is far from certain about his age. In an interview in [[Potchefstroom]] with Will Luke in April 2009, he said, "Talking to my mother, she works out my age by seeing who the [[President of Afghanistan|president]] was. Unofficially I'm nearly 25, give or take three years. Or four. I could be 21 or 28." Luke's own opinion, going by "Deep-set wrinkles and a calm demeanour", was twenty-eight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/398424.html?CMP=NLC-DLY [[Will Luke|Luke, Will]], Cloth for balls, shoes for stumps]." ''[[Cricinfo]]'', 6 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus from [[Cricinfo]] and CricketArchive is that he was born on 3 September 1984.

Ahmadzai spent much of his early years in [[refugee camp]]s with his family, fleeing from the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and the subsequent [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1992–1996)|Civil War]] that followed the Soviet withdrawal. Ahmadzai, like many of his teammates learnt the game in neighbouring Pakistan, in Ahmadzai's case in a [[Peshawar]] schoolyard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Afghan_Pride_Rises_With_Each_Stroke_Of_The_Cricket_Bat/1956679.html [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] article mentioning Ahmadzai]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ahmadzai made his debut for Afghanistan against [[Rahim Yar Khan]] in the 2002/3 Cornelius Trophy. Ahmadzai made his international debut for Afghanistan against [[Hong Kong national cricket team|Hong Kong]] in the [[2004 ACC Trophy]]. Ahmadzai represented Afghanistan in the following tournament in [[2006 ACC Trophy|2006]]. During the 2006 tournament, Ahmadzai [[captain (cricket)|captained]] the side.

In 2007, Ahmadzai played two [[List-A cricket|List-A]] matches for the [[Sebastianites Cricket and Athletic Club]] in [[Sri Lanka]], playing matches against [[Lankan Cricket Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/130/130800.html |title=Sebastianites Cricket and Athletic Club v Lankan Cricket Club (2007) |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sri Lanka Army Sports Club (cricket)|Sri Lanka Army Sports Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/130/130811.html |title=Sebastianites Cricket and Athletic Club v Sri Lanka Army Sports Club (2007) |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date=17 November 2007 |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadzai was part of the rapidly rising Afghan team that from 2008 to 2009 won the [[World Cricket League]] [[2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Five|Division Five]], [[2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Four|Division Four]] and [[2009 ICC World Cricket League Division Three|Division Three]], thus promoting them to Division Two and allowing them to partake in the [[2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier]].

During the qualifier, Ahmadzai made his List-A debut for Afghanistan against [[Denmark national cricket team|Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/211/211222.html |title=Afghanistan v Denmark (2009) |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same tournament Afghanistan gained ODI status, with Ahmadzai making his [[One Day International]] debut against [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]], where he scored 39 runs, helping Afghanistan to an 89 run victory.

Ahmadzai made his [[First-class cricket|first class]] debut in the [[2009-10 ICC Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] against a [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe XI]] in which Afghanistan drew the match.  Later, in November 2009 he was a member of Afghanistan's [[2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup]] winning squad.

Ahmadzai made his full [[Twenty20 International]] debut against [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]] in the [[2010 Quadrangular Twenty20 Series in Sri Lanka]].  Later on in February 2010, Ahmadzai was a key member of Afghanistan's victorious [[2010 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier]] winning squad and was later named in Afghanistan's squad for the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wt202010/content/squad/454415.html |title=ICC World Twenty20 Afghanistan squad |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Ahmadzai was a key member of Afghanistan's [[2010 ACC Trophy Elite]] winning squad which defeated [[Nepal national cricket team|Nepal]] in the final, with Ahmadzai scoring 52 runs in Afghanistan's innings; earning him the man of the match award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/288/288633.html |title=Afghanistan v Nepal (2010) |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date=9 April 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahmadzai played in both of Afghanistan's matches in Group C of the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. In their first match of the tournament he remained [[not out|unbeaten]] on 5 against [[India national cricket team|India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/250/250744.html |title=Afghanistan v India, ICC World Twenty20 2010 (Group C) |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date=1 May 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] he was caught behind by [[Mark Boucher]] off the bowling of [[Morné Morkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/250/250753.html |title=Afghanistan v South Africa, ICC World Twenty20 2010 (Group C) |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan lost both matches and were eliminated from the tournament.

==Retirement==
Shortly before Afghanistan's match against South Africa, Ahmadzai announced he would retire following the match.  He stated his reason for retiring being "in order to focus on developing the younger generation of Afghan cricketers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/afghanistan/content/story/458794.html |title=Raees Ahmadzai announces retirement |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahmadzai has now taken up a coaching role with the national squad as well a chief [[Selector (sport)|selector]] for the [[Afghanistan Cricket Board]].  He is also a representative of [[Afghanaid]].

'''Rodi''' or '''Rodiya''' are reported to be an untouchable [[social group]] or [[caste]] amongst the [[Sinhalese people]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. Their status was very similar to all the [[Dalit (outcaste)|Untouchable]] castes of India with segregated communities, ritualised begging, eating off the refuse of upper castes and refusal for the women and men to cover their upper bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Careem, Tuan M. Zameer.(2017). ''Persaudaraan (Brotherhood). Malay Life in Sri Lanka (2nd ed).'' Colombo: S Godage &amp; Brothers&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=September 2017}}

The stories on the origin of the Rodi caste contradicts from text to text and are therefore far from certain. However, stories about their origin have been passed down orally by their generations. These folklore suggest their origin begins from the Sinhalese royalty. They believe they descended from the daughter of King Parakramabahu named Ratnavalli (also known as Navaratna Valli). Some of these stories are found in published documents as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handsome Beggars: The Rodiyas of Ceylon|last=Raghavan|first=M.D|publisher=Colombo Book Center|year=1957|isbn=|location=Colombo|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Janawanshaya, a palm leaf record which was written in 15th century, that explains the caste hierarchy in Sri Lanka, Rodis were not considered to be purely a low caste group. According to Kandyan law, the worst punishment for high caste nobles was the exiling them to the Rodi caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Janawanshaya|last=Buddharakshitha|first=Rev. Sri|publisher=S. Godage &amp; Brothers|year=2003|isbn=|location=Colombo|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Knox (sailor)]] and [[Hugh Nevill]] are two of the prominent writers who have mentioned about the Rodi Caste in their writings. Although these folklore do not provide much facts about the origins of the Rodi, they trace a connection between the daughter of King Parakramabahu and a [[Vedda]] with hunting, human sacrifice and cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Historical Relation Of The Island Ceylon In The East Indies|last=Knox|first=Robert|publisher=Printed by Richard Chiswell, Printer to the Royal Society|year=1681|isbn=|location=London|pages=70-71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sanga people''' (also ''Luba-Garenganze'', ''Luba-Sanga'' or ''Southern Luba'') are an ethnic group that lives mostly in the [[Katanga Province]] of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The missionary [[Frederick Stanley Arnot]] relates that a copper trader named Kalasa became a close friend of the old chief of Sanga. At one point Kalasa's son Msidi ([[Msiri]]) visited the Sanga country instead of his father, where he found the people at war with the [[Baluba people]], who were invading from the north. Msiri's party had four guns, unknown weapons in the area at that time, and a few shots from the guns put the Baluba to flight. The old chief was grateful, gave Msiri increasing power, end eventually made him his successor.{{sfn|Arnot|1969|pp=231-232}}
Mziri founded the state of Geranganze with its capital at [[Bunkeya]] and took the title of king in 1870. Shortly after this the Sanga people revolted against Msiri's rule, led by their chief Mpande.{{sfn|Kisangani|Bobb|2010|p=lix}}

In the 1890s the Sanga put up a strong resistance to the colonial ''[[Force Publique]]'' of [[King Leopold II of Belgium]].
In one notorious incident, rebels led by a chief called Mulume Niama killed a Belgian officer.
The rebels were pursued by Congo Free State troops and trapped in a large chalk cave.
When they refused to surrender, despite attempts to smoke them out, the cave was blocked up.
Three months later, troops entered the cave and found 178 bodies.
The soldiers triggered landslides to cover the cave and destroy all evidence of what could come to be seen as a martyrdom.{{sfn|Ngondji|2011|p=147}}

In the 1950s many of the Sanga people obtained work in the mines of the Katanga copperbelt.{{sfn|Kisangani|Bobb|2010|p=32}}
[[Mwenda Jean Bosco]] was the leading guitarist in Congo in the 1950s.
His other name is Mwenda wa Bayeke, based on a claim of descent from the Sanga noble clan of Bayeke.
His music draws on various sources including the traditional music of his Luba/Sanga people.{{sfn|Kubik|2010|pp=96–97}}
In 1991 the estimated population of Sanga people was about 431,000, scattered through the [[Lubudi Territory|Lubudi]], [[Mitwaba Territory|Mitwaba]], and [[Pweto Territory|Pweto]] territories.{{sfn|Sanga - A language}}
The [[Tumbwe people]], a small group of about 100,000 people whose homeland is in the [[Kalemie Territory]] on the west shore of [[Lake Tanganyika]], take their name from a hereditary chief of the Sanga people.{{sfn|Vail|1989}}

'''Sbitenshchik''' (Russian: сбитенщик) was a [[sbiten]] vendor and was spread in Old Rus' regions of Novgorod, Kiev, Moscow and other Rus' cities and regions. The vendor was used for the preparation and serving of the traditional honey-based beverage sbiten in Rus' that has been around since the 12th century.

Sbitenshchik was used in Rus' principalities often on the streets to cook the drink and to sell it to the freezing people. The vendor is documented in the Russian [[Lubok]] prints.

The act of assignment carries the implicit expectation that future [[gender identity]] will develop in alignment with the physical anatomy, assignment, and rearing. In the majority of cases, sex assignment matches the child's gender identity. If sex assignment and gender identity do not align, the person may be [[transgender]] or [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming (GNC)]].&lt;ref name="shaw2005"&gt;Shaw, Alison; Ardener, Shirley (2005).

==History==

The discernment of an infant's sex was, until recently, almost universally considered an ''observation'' or ''recognition'' of an inherent aspect of a baby.&lt;ref name="reiner1997" /&gt; The rationales for sex assignment and consequential registration appear to have been little questioned. A Dutch report on gender registration states that sex registration was introduced in 1811 as an intrinsic component in population registration, due to gender-specific rights and responsibilities, such as military conscription.&lt;ref name="brink"&gt;{{Citation| publisher = Ministerie van Veiligheid &amp; Justitie| last1 = van den Brink| first1 = Marjolein| last2 = Tigchelaar| first2 = Jet| title = M/F and beyond, Gender registration by the state and the legal position of transgender persons.

==Assignment in cases of infants with intersex traits, or cases of trauma==
{{Intersex sidebar|rights}}
{{main|Intersex medical interventions|History of intersex surgery}}
Observation or recognition of an infant's sex may be complicated in the case of intersex infants and children, and in cases of early trauma. In such cases, sex assignment is generally taken to require [[Intersex surgery|medical treatment]] to confirm that assignment, but this is disputed in part due to the [[Intersex human rights|human rights]] implications of such treatment.&lt;ref name="un-fact" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| editor1-last = Cabral| editor1-first = Mauro| editor2-last = Carpenter| editor2-first = Morgan| editor1-link = Mauro Cabral| editor2-link = Morgan Carpenter| title = Intersex Issues in the International Classification of Diseases: a revision| date = 2014| url = http://transactivists.org/?attachment_id=652| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151029142803/http://transactivists.org/?attachment_id=652| archivedate = 2015-10-29| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Intersex'' broadly denotes the presence of atypical sex characteristics: at least some aspect of the genitalia, internal organs, secondary sex characteristics, [[gonad]]al tissue, or [[chromosome]]s is more typical of the other sex. When the external genitalia appear to be in between, they are described as [[ambiguous genitalia|ambiguous]].&lt;ref name="pescovitz2004"&gt;Ora Hirsch Pescovitz, Erica A. Eugster (2004). ''Pediatric endocrinology: mechanisms, manifestations, and management,'' p. 253. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, {{ISBN|978-0-7817-4059-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intersex population is one that is not necessarily large. In the U.S., about 1 in 2000 babies born are intersex. Due to nonconsensual reassignment surgery many intersex people go about their lives in the gender that was chosen for them in a lot of cases. Not having the choice to choose their own gender can lead to depression and anxiety due to confusion and possible isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intersexinitiative.org/articles/intersex-faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503194955/http://www.intersexinitiative.org/articles/intersex-faq.html |archivedate=2017-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cases of trauma include the famous [[John/Joan case]], where sexologist [[John Money]] claimed successful ''reassignment'' from male to female at age 17 months of a boy whose penis was destroyed during [[circumcision]]. However, this claim was later shown to be largely false. The subject, [[David Reimer]], later identified as a man.

In approximately 1 in 2,000 infants, there is enough variation in the appearance of the external genitalia to merit hesitation about appropriate assignment by the physician involved.&lt;ref name="Anne_Fausto-Sterling_2000"&gt;{{cite book| last =  Fausto-Sterling| first =  Anne| authorlink = Anne Fausto-Sterling| title = Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality| publisher = Basic Books| year = 2000| location = New York| pages = | url =  |doi =| id = |isbn = 0-465-07713-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples would be an unusually prominent [[clitoris]] in an otherwise apparently typical girl, or complete [[cryptorchidism]] in an otherwise apparently typical boy. In most of these cases, a sex is tentatively assigned and the parents told that tests will be performed to confirm the apparent sex. Typical tests in this situation might include a pelvic [[ultrasound]] to determine the presence of a [[uterus]], a [[testosterone]] or [[17α-hydroxyprogesterone]] level, and/or a [[karyotype]]. In some of these cases a [[pediatric endocrinologist]] is consulted to confirm the tentative sex assignment. The expected assignment is usually confirmed within hours to a few days in these cases.

In a much smaller proportion of cases, the process of assignment is more complex, and involves both ''determining'' what the biological aspects of sex may be and ''choosing'' the best sex assignment for the purposes of rearing the child. Approximately 1 in 20,000{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} infants is born with enough ambiguity that assignment becomes a more drawn-out process of multiple tests and intensive education of the parents about [[sexual differentiation]]. In some of these cases, it is clear that the child will face physical difficulties or social stigma as they grow up, and deciding upon the sex of assignment involves weighing the advantages and disadvantages of either assignment.

=== History ===

Nothing currently appears to be known about sex discernment [[Intersex in history|prior]] to the medicalization of intersex. However, in European societies, [[Roman law]], post-classical [[Canon law]], and later [[Common law]], referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. Under Roman law, a hermaphrodite had to be classed as either male or female.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn E. Roller, "The Ideology of the Eunuch Priest," ''Gender &amp; History'' 9.3 (1997), p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th-century ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', C. 4, q. 2 et 3, c. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://geschichte.digitale-sammlungen.de/decretum-gratiani/kapitel/dc_chapter_1_1585 | title = Decretum Gratiani (Kirchenrechtssammlung) | work = Bayerische StaatsBibliothek ([[Bavarian State Library]]) | date = February 5, 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220084841/http://geschichte.digitale-sammlungen.de/decretum-gratiani/kapitel/dc_chapter_1_1585 | archivedate = December 20, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raming"&gt;{{cite book | title = A History of Women and Ordination | last1 = Raming | first1 = Ida | last2 = Macy | first2 = Gary | last3 = Bernard J | first3 = Cook | publisher = [[Scarecrow Press]] | date = 2004 | page = 113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of common law, the 16th Century ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile."&lt;ref&gt;E Coke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England, Institutes 8.a. (1st Am. Ed. 1812) (16th European ed. 1812).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 41| last = Greenberg| first = Julie| title = Defining Male and Female: Intersexuality and the Collision Between Law and Biology| journal = Arizona Law Review| date = 1999| ssrn = 896307|pages =  277–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal cases where sex assignment was placed in doubt [[Intersex in history|have been described]] over the centuries.

With the medicalization of intersex, criteria for assignment have evolved over the decades, as clinical understanding of biological factors and diagnostic tests have improved, as [[intersex surgery|surgical]] techniques have changed and potential complications have become clearer, and in response to the outcomes and opinions of adults who have grown up with various intersex conditions.

Before the 1950s, assignment was based almost entirely on the appearance of the external genitalia. Although physicians recognized that there were conditions in which the apparent secondary sexual characteristics could develop contrary to the person's sex, and conditions in which the gonadal sex did not match that of the external genitalia, their ability to understand and diagnose such conditions in infancy was too poor to attempt to predict future development in most cases.

In the 1950s, [[endocrinologist]]s developed a basic understanding of the major intersex conditions such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH), [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], and [[mixed gonadal dysgenesis]]. The discovery of [[cortisone]] allowed survival of infants with severe CAH for the first time. New hormone tests and karyotypes allowed more confident diagnosis in infancy and prediction of future development.

Sex assignment became more than choosing a sex of rearing, but also began to include surgical treatment.  Undescended testes could be retrieved. A greatly enlarged clitoris could be amputated to the usual size, but attempts to create a [[human penis|penis]] were unsuccessful. [[John Money]] and others [[John/Joan case|controversially]] believed that children were more likely to develop a gender identity that matched sex of rearing than might be determined by chromosomes, gonads, or hormones. The resulting medical model was termed the "Optimal gender model."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Community Affairs References Committee| isbn = 9781742299174| last1 = [[Australian Senate]]| last2 = Community Affairs References Committee| title = Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia| location = Canberra| date = October 2013| url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Involuntary_Sterilisation/Sec_Report/index| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181927/http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Involuntary_Sterilisation/Sec_Report/index| archivedate = 2015-09-23| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of [[gender]] as a purely social construction, and gender identity as a result of nurture rather than nature reached near-universal acceptance, especially among liberal, progressive, and academic portions of Western society. The primary goal of assignment was to choose the sex that would lead to the least inconsistency between external anatomy and assigned psyche (gender identity). This led to the recommendation that any child without a penis or with a [[micropenis|penis too small to penetrate a vagina]] could be raised as a girl, taught to be a girl, and would develop a female gender identity, and that this would be the best way to minimize future discrepancy between psyche and external anatomy in those infants determined to be biologically male but without a penis that meets medical norms (e.g., [[cloacal exstrophy]]), and also in those like in the John/Joan case who lost it to accidental trauma in early infancy.

From the 1960s, pediatric surgeons attempted and claimed success with reconstruction of infant genitalia, especially enlargement or construction of [[vagina]]s. The recommended rules of assignment and surgery from the late 1960s until the 1990s were roughly:
*Any XX infant, no matter how virilized, should be raised as a girl to preserve the chance of future fertility. A large, protruding clitoris should be reduced in size with a nerve-sparing recession or reduction rather than simple amputation.
*Any undervirilized XY infant should be raised as a boy if the penis could be expected to be large enough to stand to [[urination|urinate]] and to insert into a vagina for coitus. If it was too small or atypically formed (e.g., [[cloacal exstrophy]]) for these functions, it was recommended that the baby be assigned as female, any gonads removed, a vaginal opening surgically constructed, and [[estrogen]] provided at [[puberty]].
*An infant with mixed chromosomes (e.g., mixed gonadal dysgenesis or [[true hermaphroditism]]) could be raised either way depending on appearance of genitalia and size of phallus.

Since the 1990s, a number of factors have led to changes in the recommended criteria for assignment and surgery. These factors have included:

*Public disclosure by intersex individuals and organizations about unsatisfactory sexual function or incongruent gender identity, and criticism of infant surgery for "psychosocial rationales".
*In 1997, the rest of [[David Reimer]]'s story, referred to above as John Money's John/Joan case, was made public. He was the boy who had lost his penis to a botched circumcision at 8 months in 1966, was reassigned from boy to girl at 18 months with further surgery to remove [[testes]] and estrogen treatment beginning at age 12. Although [[John Money]] had described the reassignment as a success in the 1970s, Reimer went public with his account of continuing to have a male gender identity despite the reassignment to a female sex of rearing. At age 15, Reimer reverted to living as a male. At age 38, he committed suicide.
*A large proportion of XY infants born with [[cloacal exstrophy]] and raised as female from early infancy have requested reassignment to male gender in late childhood and adolescence.

Clinical recommendations in the 2000s for assignment changed as a result:{{fact|date=November 2018}}

*Raise nearly all [[XY sex-determination system|XX]] infants with functional ovaries as female. The only rare exception would be completely and unambiguously virilized XX infants with [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia|CAH]], who might be raised as male with genital surgery deferred.
*Raise most ambiguous [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] infants with testes as male unless the external genitalia are more female than male, marked androgen insensitivity is present, and testes are absent or non-functional. Raise as male any XY infant with unambiguous micropenis. Raise as male any XY infant with functional testes and normal androgen sensitivity but atypically formed or absent penis.
*Raise infants with mixed gonadal tissue, true hermaphroditism, or other [[chromosome abnormality|chromosome anomalies]] as the sex most consistent with external genitalia, since gonads are usually nonfunctional.
*Gender identity is set by 1–2 years of age and reassignment after that age should not be attempted unless requested by the patient.

These recommendations do not ''explicitly'' necessitate surgical or hormonal interventions to reinforce sex assignments, but such medical management persists [[Human Rights between the Sexes|worldwide]], utilizing rationales such as the mitigation of parental distress and trauma, reducing the likelihood of stigma, making a child feel more "normal", and improving marriage prospects.&lt;ref name="oiiau"&gt;{{Cite web| publisher = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]| last1 = Carpenter| first1 = Morgan| last2 = Organisation Intersex International Australia| title = Submission to the Australian Human Rights Commission: Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Rights Snapshot Report| location = Sydney| date = February 6, 2015| url = https://oii.org.au/28347/human-rights-commission-submission-on-intersex-legal-reform-and-services/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150413004039/https://oii.org.au/28347/human-rights-commission-submission-on-intersex-legal-reform-and-services/| archivedate = April 13, 2015| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
{{further information|Intersex human rights}}
Controversies over surgical aspects of intersex management, have often focused on controversies regarding indications for surgery and optimal timing. However, intersex and human rights organizations have criticized medical models as they are not based on the consent of the individuals on whom such irreversible medical treatments are conducted, and outcomes may be inappropriate or poor.&lt;ref name="oiiau" /&gt;&lt;ref name="atm" /&gt; [[Anne Tamar-Mattis]], for example, states that, "The true choice is not between early and late [surgery], but early surgery versus patient autonomy.&lt;ref name="atm"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jpurol.2014.03.019| pmid = 24909610| issn = 1477-5131| volume = 10| issue = 4| pages = 788–789| last = Tamar-Mattis| first = A.| title = Patient advocate responds to DSD surgery debate| journal = Journal of Pediatric Urology| accessdate = 2015-07-25| date = August 2014| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1477513114001399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights institutions now refer to such practices as "harmful practices".&lt;ref name="un2016"&gt;{{Cite | last1 = UN Committee against Torture | author1-link = United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture | last2 = UN Committee on the Rights of the Child | author2-link = Committee on the Rights of the Child | last3 = UN Committee on the Rights of People with Disabilities | author3-link = Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities | last4 = UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment | last5 = Juan Méndez, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment | author5-link = Juan E.

==Reassignment of sex or gender==
{{Main article|Sex reassignment therapy|Sex reassignment surgery}}
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}

Sex reassignment is to a change in gender role or identity after an original and presumably incorrect sex assignment in infancy. This may occur in several types of circumstances.
*An early reassignment may be made to correct a clear error. The most common example of this is when a newborn is assumed to be a boy and assigned as such despite absent testes. If at 1–4 weeks of age it is discovered because of newborn screening, a salt-wasting crisis, or investigation of the cryptorchidism that he has ovaries, uterus, an XX [[karyotype]], and [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia|CAH]], the child is likely to be reassigned as female. When virilization is complete and unambiguous, reassignment may be declined or deferred. Any reassignment after the first month or two is no longer considered an "early reassignment".
*There have been cases where a male infant has been reassigned to female at several days, weeks, or months of age because of an irreparable birth defect of the genitalia or loss of the penis to trauma or other accident. This is no longer recommended by most experts in the field because of the publicity surrounding similar failed reassignments which became public in the 1990s, such as that of [[David Reimer]].
*There have been cases where a child with an intersex condition has rejected a sex of rearing, asserted an opposite gender identity, and requested reassignment. Examples of this have occurred in adolescents with several forms of CAH and [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]].
*The most common type of reassignment occurs when a child or adult with no detectable intersex condition assumes a different gender identity, and either requests or asserts the recognition of their new asserted gender. Such a person, and the general spectra of identities incongruous with gender assignment, is described as transgender. [[Sex reassignment therapy|Therapy]] and/or [[Sex reassignment surgery|surgery]] may be performed in adulthood and, since the 2000s, adolescence to align their body with their gender identity. People who seek these processes often form a subset identity among transgender people known as transsexual, albeit not all may identify as such.

==Challenges to requirements for sex assignment==
In recent years, the perceived need to legally assign sex is increasingly being challenged.&lt;ref name="brink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Chan| first = Emily| title = Get gender off birth certificates, B.C. activists argue| work = [[CTV News]]| url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/get-gender-off-birth-certificates-b-c-activists-argue-1.2391604| accessdate = 2016-01-01| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151118053446/http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/get-gender-off-birth-certificates-b-c-activists-argue-1.2391604| archivedate = 2015-11-18| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report for the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice states "Gender increasingly seems to be perceived as a ‘sensitive’ identity feature, but so far is not regarded, nor protected as such in privacy regulations".&lt;ref name="brink" /&gt; Australian government guidelines state that "departments and agencies that collect sex and/or gender information must not collect information unless it is necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of the agency's functions or activities"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Australia| last2 = Attorney General's Department| title = Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender| date = 2013| url = http://www.ag.gov.au/Publications/Pages/AustralianGovernmentGuidelinesontheRecognitionofSexandGender.aspx| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150701084543/http://www.ag.gov.au/Publications/Pages/AustralianGovernmentGuidelinesontheRecognitionofSexandGender.aspx| archivedate = 2015-07-01| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shower Posse''' is a [[Jamaican posse|Jamaican gang]] which is involved with [[drug smuggling|drug]] and [[arms smuggling]]. Its home is in [[Tivoli Gardens, Kingston|Tivoli Gardens]] in [[Jamaica]], but it primarily operates in the Canadian provinces of [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and the US states of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Florida]], and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;James R. Zazzali,[https://web.archive.org/web/20061116071036/http://www.nevadaobserver.com/Reading%20Room%20Documents/Organized%20Crime%20in%20New%20Jersey%20-%20Statement%20of%20James%20R.%20Zazzali%20(1988).htm Organized Crime: 25 Years After Valachi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mafianj.com/afro/afja.shtml|title=The Mafia in New Jersey - AFRICAN-AMERICANS - JAMAICANS - AFRO-LINEAL ORGANIZED CRIME|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gang has a strong international presence among expatriate Jamaican communities in North America. In the United States, a branch was founded by [[Vivian Blake]] and it has a prominent role in the New York City drug trade. The gang also has a large presence in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name=nationalpost/&gt;

"In 1989, former member Charles 'Little Nut' Miller was charged with drug trafficking but agreed to testify against other gang leaders in order to receive immunity. In his testimony – in which he implicated himself in nine murders - Miller revealed his connection to the JLP as a 'political enforcer,' as well as to the CIA, going as far to state that "the United States made me what I am." (''Newsweek'', July 13, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nacla.org/node/6661|title=The CIA, the Cold War, and Cocaine: The Connections of Christopher "Dudus" Coke|work=NACLA|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
There are differing reports on the origin of the name. One theory is that it comes from the promises of its associated politicians to shower supporters with gifts.&lt;ref&gt;"Police raise curtain on the 'Shower Posse'" Colin Freeze. ''The Globe and Mail.'' 5 May 2010. p. A11.&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that it is a reference to the gang showering opponents with bullets.&lt;ref name=nationalpost&gt;"No remedy for 'Posse'; International drug cartel calling the shots in Toronto's northwest end." Drew Halfnight. ''National Post.'' 8 May 2010. p. A14.&lt;/ref&gt; A third theory is that the gang got its name from the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) election slogan 'Shower', which was a response to the PNP's 'Power' that was coined from [[Michael Manley|Manley]]'s 'Power for the people' slogan in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/159042_The-Cokes-then-and-now|title=The Cokes then and now - News|work=Jamaica Observer|accessdate=23 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220043352/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/159042_The-Cokes-then-and-now|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|2010 Kingston conflict}}
In 2009 the [[United States]] began to demand that [[Christopher Coke]], then leader of the Shower Posse, with extensive and well-known links to the JLP, be extradited to New York, where he would face charges of smuggling drugs and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/158840_Tension-in-Tivoli-as-US-awaits-word-on-Dudus-s-extradition|title=Tension in Tivoli as US awaits word on Dudus's extradition - News|work=Jamaica Observer|accessdate=23 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220044151/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/158840_Tension-in-Tivoli-as-US-awaits-word-on-Dudus-s-extradition|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090906/cleisure/cleisure1.html ''"This is not Somalia, we hope"'', The Gleaner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909053744/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090906/cleisure/cleisure1.html |date=9 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prime minister of Jamaica, [[Bruce Golding]], who was also the Minister of Parliament for that district, initially questioned the legality of the request, claiming that [[warrantless wiretapping]] had been used to collect information on Coke. However, he eventually relented, after public indignation to what many Jamaicans viewed as a cover-up to protect a politically connected drug trafficker, and on 17 May 2010 an arrest warrant was issued for Coke, leading to a state of [[civil unrest]] within Kingston, and especially Tivoli Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jamaica Declares State of Emergency |url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/05/23/world/americas/international-us-jamaica-emergency.html?_r=1&amp;hp|agency=[[Reuters]] |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 May 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coke was eventually arrested outside of Kingston on 22 June 2010.  On Friday, 15 June 2012, a New York federal district court sentenced Coke to two consecutive sentences: 20 years for racketeering and conspiracy, and an additional three years for conspiracy to commit assault.

==In popular culture==
The 2014 novel ''[[A Brief History of Seven Killings]]'', by [[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]], features a gang called Storm Posse, who share many features with Shower Posse, based in a fictionalised version of Tivoli Gardens named "Copenhagen City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lazar|first1=Zachary|title='A Brief History of Seven Killings' - Marlon James|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/a-brief-history-of-seven-killings-by-marlon-james-review.html|accessdate=11 December 2016|work=New York Times|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6522">The '''Six Arts''' formed the basis of [[education]] in ancient [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]]. 

==History==
During the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1122–256 BCE), students were required to master the "liù yì" (六藝) (''Six Arts''):

# [[Confucianism#Rites|Rites]] (禮)
# [[Music of China|Music]] (樂)
# [[Archery]] (射)
# [[Chariot]]eering (御)
# [[Chinese calligraphy|Calligraphy]] (書)
# [[Chinese mathematics|Mathematics]] (數)

Men who excelled in these six arts were thought to have reached the state of perfection, a [[Junzi|perfect gentleman]].

The Six Arts were practiced by scholars and they already existed before Confucius, but became a part of [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]]. As such, [[Xu Gan]] (170–217 CE) discusses them in the ''Balanced Discourses''.

The Six Arts were practiced by the [[Disciples of Confucius|72 disciples of Confucius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Religion I (2 vol.set): Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA816&amp;lpg=PA816#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=8 December 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27164-7|pages=816–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Six Arts concept developed during the pre-imperial period. It incorporated both military and civil components. The civil side was later associated with the '''[[Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar|Four Arts]]''' (qin playing, chess, calligraphy and painting). However, the latter was more a [[leisure]] characteristic for the [[Late Imperial China|late imperial time]]. It evidently overlaps with the Six Arts, since the qin epitomized music, the chess ([[Go (game)|Go]], a board-game known by its Japanese name)  related to the military strategy, while calligraphy dealt with the aesthetics of writing and the character cultivation (the rites).

Math, calligraphy, literature, equestrianism, archery, music, and rites were the Six Arts.&lt;ref name="Hao2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zhidong Hao|title=Intellectuals at a Crossroads: The Changing Politics of China's Knowledge Workers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqVIRz_8U9EC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=yuanzhang+archery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI9c_n7b7MAhXkzoMKHcLRDCYQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=yuanzhang%20archery&amp;f=false|date=1 February 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8757-0|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
The requirement of students to master the six arts parallels the Western concept of the [[Renaissance man]]. The emphasis on the Six Arts bred Confucian gentlemen who knew more than just canonical scholarship. The classical interest practical scholarship invigorated Chinese mathematics, astronomy, and science (e.g. [[Liu Hui]], [[Zu Chongzhi]], [[Shen Kuo]], [[Yang Hui]], [[Zhu Shijie]]). This tradition receded after the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), when [[neo-Confucianism]] underscored the importance of the four books ''Analects'' over the other arts and technical fields.

At the [[Guozijian]], law, math, calligraphy, [[equestrianism]], and archery were emphasized by the Ming [[Hongwu Emperor]] in addition to Confucian classics and also required in the [[Imperial Examinations]].&lt;ref name="MoteTwitchett1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick W.

By the Qing dynasty, the Chinese specialists were not able to manage the lunar calendar accurately, and the calendar was going out of phase with nature.  This was a great embarrassment to the Chinese court, as the adherence to the lunar calendars by the vassal states was a recognition of the sovereignty of the Chinese court over them. Western astronomical expertise (see [[Jesuit China missions]]) was welcomed much as an aftermath of Chinese interest in astronomy and mathematics, partially formulated in the classical Six Arts agenda.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9935">'''The Freudian Cover-up''' is a theory first popularized by [[social worker]] [[Florence Rush]] in the 1970s, which asserts that [[Sigmund Freud]] intentionally ignored evidence that his patients were victims of [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;Rush, Florence, ''The Best Kept Secret: The Sexual Abuse of Children'', Prentice Hall, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The theory argues that in developing his theory of infant sexuality, he misinterpreted his patients' claim of sexual abuse as symptoms of repressed incestuous desire. Therefore, Freud claimed that children who reported sexual abuse by adults had either imagined or fantasized the experience.

==Background==
{{further|Freud's seduction theory}}
Early within Freud's career, he believed that little girls often experienced sexual abuse, since most of his patients were predominantly women and consistently reported childhood instances of sexual molestation. Many of Freud's patients suffered from a common Victorian diagnosis, [[hysteria]]. Since his hysterical patients repeatedly reported sexual abuse, most often naming their fathers as the abusers, Freud drew a causal connection between sexual abuse and neurosis. This became the frame for the seduction theory, in which he pointed to a direct connection between sexual abuse in childhood and adult hysteria. According to Florence Rush, author of ''The Freudian Cover-up'', this repeated and persistent incrimination of fathers by his patients made him uneasy, and led him to abandon the seduction theory. More at ease with the fantasy rather than reality of sexual abuse, Freud was even more comfortable when he could name the mother rather than the father as the seducer. Hence, the "[[Oedipal complex]]" came into fruition. Other feminists who supported Rush's claims are [[Susan Brownmiller]], [[Louise Armstrong]], and [[Diana E. H. Russell|Diana Russell]]. 

Before Freud could conclude that the seduction by fathers was a fantasy, he had to be rid of his earlier theory. Since men did not complain of maternal seduction Freud limited the imagined abuse to a specific female problem. To remove the responsibility from fathers, Freud found it necessary to undermine the perceptions of his female patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fap.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/6/2/260 "The Freudian Coverup"] article&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the period between the 1970s and 1980s, and 1990s  arguments were made that Freud abandoned his initial beliefs in women's accounts of abuse (the seduction theory), and replaced it with the Oedipal theory; this illustrates the ways in which he withheld or altered information from his patients, which is unacceptable in a professional context. ''The Freudian Cover-up'' exposed Freud’s theory, the refusal to name the offender, but furthermore, one man's attempt to hide illegal or immoral sex practices. It was within this time that Victorian men were permitted to indulge in forbidden sex, provided they managed to keep their indiscretions hidden. Freud, who regarded the incest taboo as vital to the advance of civilization, appeared to demand only that forbidden sex be practiced with tact and discretion so that the surface of Victorian respectability was in no way disturbed. Therefore, any attempt on the part of the child or her family to expose the violator exposes her own alleged innate sexual motives and shamed her more than the offender; concealment is her only recourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fap.sagepub.com/cgi/content/citation/6/2/251 "The Freudian Coverup: A Reappraisal"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The historian [[Peter Gay]], author of ''[[Freud: A Life for Our Time]]'' (1988), emphasizes that Freud continued to believe that some patients were sexually abused, but realized that there was a difficulty in determining between truth and fiction. Therefore, according to Gay there was no sinister motive in changing his theory; Freud was a scientist seeking the facts and was entitled to change his views if new evidence was presented to him.

A different criticism comes from Freud scholars who have examined the original documents and argue that the above account contains several misconceptions. Florence Rush based her account on Freud's later retrospective reports of the 1895-97 episode, which are seriously at variance with the original 1896 papers&lt;ref&gt;Schimek (1987); Israëls &amp; Schatzman (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and other documents which show that it is not the case that Freud's female patients at that time consistently reported childhood instances of sexual molestation. Prior to the 1896 papers he had not reported a single instance of ''early childhood'' sexual abuse (and very few cases of any kind of sexual abuse).&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Standard Edition'', vol. 2, 1895, ''Studies on Hysteria''; vol. 3, 1895, "Obsessions and phobias: Their psychical mechanism and their aetiology", pp. 71-82; Esterson (1998), (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The very essence of the seduction theory entailed that only ''unconscious'' memories of early childhood sexual abuse could result in hysterical or obsessional symptoms, which is inconsistent with the notion of patients coming to him with ''reports'' of childhood sexual abuse; on Freud's theory the putative memories were deeply repressed and not accessible to consciousness in normal circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''S.E.3'', 1896c, pp. 191-192, 204, 211; Paul, R. A. (1985). Freud and the Seduction Theory: A Critical Examination of Masson's "The Assault on Truth", ''Journal of Psychoanalytic Anthropology'', vol. 8, pp. 161-187; Schimek (1987); Toews, J. E. (1991). Historicizing Psychoanalysis: Freud in His Time and for Our Time, ''Journal of Modern History'', 63, pp. 504-545; McNally (2003), pp. 159-169.&lt;/ref&gt; (It is also the case that Freud's 1896 clinical claims were not restricted to women: in the 1896 "Aetiology" paper one third of the patients were men.)&lt;ref&gt;Freud, 1896c, pp. 207-208; Esterson (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud twice stated that he would be presenting the clinical evidence for his claims,&lt;ref&gt;Freud, 1896b, p. 162; 1896c, p. 203; Esterson (1998), (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; but he never did so, which critics have argued means that his clinical claims have had to be taken largely on trust.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. L. (1991). ''Hidden Conversations: An Introduction to Communicative Psychoanalysis'', Routledge, pp. 3-15; McCullough (2001); Triplett (2005). The Misnomer of Freud's "Seduction Theory", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Freud scholars and academics have voiced serious doubts about the validity of his claim in 1896 to have uncovered ''unconscious memories'' (later unconscious fantasies) of infantile sexual abuse, mostly below the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''S.E. 3'', 1896c, p. 212; Cioffi, F. (1998[1974]), pp. 199-204; Schimek (1987); Israëls &amp; Schatzman (1993); Hergenhahn (1997), pp. 484-485; Allen (1997), pp. 43-45; Eissler (2001), pp. 107-117; McCullough (2001); McNally (2003), pp. 159-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rush is often seen to be the founder of the [[Repressed memory|recovered memory movement]]. This has been criticised as characterised by both a completely uncritical acceptance of accusations of abuse and an active encouragement of the invention of memories of abuse. There are some who are very critical of Freud, such as Richard Webster, who are also critical of Rush.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richardwebster.net/freudsfalsememories.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:National Museum KL 2008 (36).JPG|thumb|[[Bunga mas]], a form of tribute sent to the King of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] from its vassal states in the [[Malay Peninsula]] ]]

A '''tributary state''' is a term for a pre-modern state in a particular type of subordinate relationship to a more powerful state which involved the sending of a regular token of submission, or [[tribute]], to the superior power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=20.] ''Asiatic, Tributary, or Absolutist'' International Socialism, Nov. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This token often took the form of a substantial transfer of wealth, such as the delivery of gold, produce or slaves, so that tribute might best be seen as the payment of [[protection money]]. Or it might be more symbolic: sometimes it amounted to no more than the delivery of a mark of submission such as the [[bunga mas]] (golden flower) that rulers in the [[Malay peninsula]] used to send to the kings of [[Siam]], or the [[Tribute of the Maltese Falcon]] that the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]] used to send annually to the [[List of viceroys of Sicily|Viceroy of Sicily]] in order to [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|rule Malta]]. It might also involve attendance by the subordinate ruler at the court of the hegemon in order to make a public show of submission.

The modern-day heirs of tribute hegemons tend to claim that the tributary relationship should be understood as an acknowledgement of the hegemon's sovereignty in the modern world, whereas former tributary states deny that there was any transfer of sovereignty. For instance, [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Tributaries of Imperial China]] implies Chinese sovereign claim over territories not now regarded as Chinese.

A [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|formalized tribute system]] developed in [[East Asia]] with many neighboring East, [[Central Asia|Central]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[South Asia]]n countries and regions becoming tributary states of various [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial Chinese dynasties]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/Research/GEHN/GEHNPDF/GEHNWP21-GA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TOVaMckcO0MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of [[China]] saw himself as the [[emperor]] of the [[all under heaven|entire civilized world]]. It was not possible for such an emperor to have equal diplomatic relations with any other power, and so all diplomatic relations in the region were construed by the Chinese as tributary. The disdain of the state ideology of [[Confucianism]] for trade, and the belief that Chinese civilization had no need of products or technology from outside meant that trade, when it was permitted, was also construed as tributary. Diplomatic missions and trading parties from non-Chinese regions were interpreted in Chinese records as being tributary, regardless of the intention of those regions. Under this construction, the goods received by China constituted a tributary offering, while those that the visitors received were interpreted as gifts that the emperor in his kindness had bestowed upon his distant tributaries.

In [[Al Andalus]], the last remaining [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Nasrid Dynasty]] in the [[Emirate of Granada]] paid tribute to the Christian Kingdom of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (present day [[Spain]]). Tributary states, usually on the periphery of the [[Ottoman Empire]], were under vassalage in different forms. Some were allowed to select their own leaders, while others paid tribute for their lands. In the Western colonial system, non-Western states were sometimes incorporated into a European empire as [[protectorate]]s.

In the [[Philippines]], the [[Datu]]s of the Barangays became vassals of the [[Spanish Empire]], from the late 16th century until the Archipelago fell under the power of the United States of America in 1898. Their right to rule was recognized by King Philip II of Spain, on 11 June 1594, under the condition of paying tributes due to the Spanish Crown.{{ref|note1|[a]}}

==Notes==
:a. {{note|note1}}The King further ordered that the natives should pay to these nobles the same respect that the inhabitants accorded to their local Lords before the conquest, without prejudice to the things that pertain to the king himself or to the [[encomenderos]] (trusteeship leaders). The original royal decree (''{{lang|es|Recapilación de leyes}}''; in Spanish) says:&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Ariztia, ed., ''Recapilación de leyes'', Madrid (1723), lib. vi, tit. VII, ley xvi.  This reference can be found at the library of the Estudio Teologico Agustiniano de Valladolid in Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;
::''{{lang|es|No es justo, que los Indios Principales de Filipinas sean de peor condición, después de haberse convertido, ántes de les debe hacer tratamiento, que los aficione, y mantenga en felicidad, para que con los bienes espirituales, que Dios les ha comunicado llamándolos a su verdadero conocimiento, se junten los temporales, y vivan con gusto y conveniencia. Por lo qua mandamos a los Gobernadores de aquellas Islas, que les hagan buen tratamiento, y encomienden en nuestro nombre el gobierno de los Indios, de que eran Señores, y en todo lo demás procuren, que justamente se aprovechen haciéndoles los Indios algún reconocimiento en la forma que corría el tiempo de su Gentilidad, con que esto sin perjuicio de los tributos, que á Nos han de pagar, ni de lo que á sus Encomenderos}}''.
:This translates into English as:&lt;ref&gt;Felipe II, ''Ley de Junio 11, 1594'' in ''Recapilación de leyes'', lib. vi, tit. VII, ley xvi. The English translation of the law by Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson can be found in ''The Philippine Islands (1493–1898)'', Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1903, Vol. XVI, pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;
::"It is not right that the Indian Principales of the Philippines be in a worse condition after conversion; rather they should have such treatment that would gain their affection and keep them loyal, so that with the spiritual blessings that God has communicated to them by calling them to his true knowledge, the temporal blessings may be added, and they may live contentedly and comfortably. Therefore, we order the governors of those islands to show them good treatment and entrust them, in our name, with the government of the Indians, of whom they were formerly Lords. In all else the governors shall see that the Principales are benefited justly, and the Indians shall pay them something as a recognition, as they did during the period of their paganism, provided it be without prejudice to the tributes that are to be paid us, or prejudicial to that which pertains to their Encomenderos."

The idea of '''want''' can be examined from many perspectives. In secular societies want might be considered similar to the emotion [[Desire (emotion)|desire]], which can be studied scientifically through the disciplines of [[psychology]] or [[sociology]]. Want might also be examined in [[economics]] as a necessary ingredient in sustaining and perpetuating [[capitalist]] societies that are organised around principles like [[consumerism]]. Alternatively want can be studied in a non-secular, spiritual, moralistic or religious way, particularly by Buddhism but also Christianity, Islam and Judaism.

In [[economics]], a want is something that is desired. It is said that every person has unlimited wants, but limited resources (economics is based on the assumption that only limited resources are available to us). Thus, people cannot have everything they want and must look for the most affordable alternatives.

Wants are often distinguished from [[need]]s. A need is something that is necessary for [[wiktionary:survival|survival]] (such as [[food]] and [[wikt:shelter|shelter]]), whereas a want is simply something that a person would like to have.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcwdn.org/ECONOMICS/NeedWant.html The Economics Website] Retrieved February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists have rejected this distinction and maintain that all of these are simply wants, with varying levels of importance. By this viewpoint, wants and needs can be understood as examples of the overall concept of [[demand (economics)|demand]].

==Non-secular perspectives==

While in modern [[secular]] societies "want" is considered a purely economic, social-scientific or objectively psychological reality of human existence, many religious or spiritual traditions prescribe or advise with lessons on want and wanting, which might alternatively be termed "[[Desire (philosophy)|desire]]". Buddhism is perhaps the most common example of a religious tradition that offers wisdom and advice about the concept of want and wanting or "desire". The second of the [[Four Noble Truths]] of Buddhism is that desire or wanting is a cause for most of the suffering experienced in life. When we want and desire, we create suffering that can never be alleviated, because as detailed in secular economics wants are "unlimited", and hence unfulfilled wants can cause suffering, in unlimited amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/edens/thailand/buddhism.htm|title=Basics of Buddhism|work=pbs.org|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges to this dilemma might include [[anti-consumerism]] or [[Buddhist economics]].

In Christianity, particularly [[Protestantism]], want should be kept to a minimum, and a simple life of hard and decent work should be maintained, as described in the [[Protestant work ethic]]. From an economic-sociological point of view this might be understood as more value and energy being placed upon [[Production (economics)|production]] instead of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].

The '''Xokleng''' or '''Aweikoma''' (sometimes called '''''[[botocudo]]s''''') are a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe of [[Brazil]]; their territory is located mainly in the state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. They were one of the original inhabitants of the province of Misiones in Argentina. They may also sometimes be found on the Ibirama, Posto Velho, and Rio dos Pardos reservations.
