The '''Doctors' riot''' was an incident that occurred in April 1788 in [[New York City]], where the [[body snatching|illegal procurement of corpses]] from the graves of slaves and poor whites resulted in a mass expression of discontent from poorer New Yorkers directed primarily at [[physician]]s and [[medicine|medical students]].

==Background==

By the end of the [[American Revolution]], roughly one fifth of New York City's population was [[Black Americans|black]], most of whom were [[slavery in the United States|slaves]]. The construction of New York City, under both the [[New Amsterdam|Dutch]] and the [[British colonization of the Americas|English]], was accomplished largely with slave labor. Due to their low social standing, the bodies of slaves could only be buried outside the city limits. Most often they were buried in a few plots north of [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]], across the street from the [[Pauper's Cemetery]], often with several bodies to a grave, in a site now marked by the [[African Burial Ground National Monument]], then known as the "Negroes Burying Ground".

Both cemeteries were close to [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]], which housed the city's only school of medicine. Due to taboos associated with the violation of corpses, procuring cadavers for study was difficult, and many students and doctors would exhume bodies from the nearby graveyards, due to the socially marginalized status of their occupants. “Resurrection”, as [[Body snatching|body-snatching]] or [[Grave robbery|grave-robbing]] was called, was the cheapest, surest way to obtain the remains of the newly deceased, especially in the winter when bodies decayed slower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=American resurrection and the 1788 New York doctors' riot|url=|journal=The Lancet|volume=377|issue=9762|pages=292–293|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60083-4|author1=Caroline de Costa|author2=Francesca Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The riot==
[[File:HEADLEY(1882) -p080 New York Hospital - scene of the Doctors' Riot.jpg|thumb|300px|[[New York Hospital]], scene of the riot.]]
Because there was, at the time, no known method of preserving an entire corpse, thefts were performed hastily, often in winter to slow the rate of decomposition. In the winter of 1788, the number of corpses being exhumed by students increased substantially. The activities of medical students and physicians, who were known colloquially as ''Resurrectionists'' in the Black cemetery, were noticed by a group of [[freedmen]] who, on February the 3rd, petitioned the [[New York City Council|Common Council]] to take action against it. The petition was largely ignored, and no effort was made to stop the unlicensed exhumations.

In April 1788, a group of children were playing outside the New York Hospital, next to a room where a student of the physician [[Richard Bayley]], who was known to exhume corpses from the two cemeteries, was dissecting an arm. Bayley, born and bred in Connecticut, had received his medical education in England, where body-snatching was more common. There were whispers about him “cutting up his patients and performing cruel experiments upon the sick”. 

The student, named John Hicks, waved the arm out at the children, telling a boy whose mother had recently died that it belonged to her. The boy ran home and told his father of this, who, after exhuming his wife's coffin and finding it empty, amassed a group of concerned citizens who marched to the hospital and began to mass around the building. 

The mob eventually broke into the hospital and, after becoming incensed upon finding several bodies in various stages of mutilation, pulled Richard Bayley's assistant [[Wright Post]] and a number of his students into the street, where the mayor of New York City, [[James Duane (Continental Congress)|James Duane]] intervened and ordered them escorted to the jailhouse for protection.

A crowd of 2,000 people had gathered, and news spread of the horrors seen in the hospital, leading to widespread rioting, with the few physicians remaining in New York City being forced into hiding. A large group of rioters descended upon [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], searching for John Hicks, who was felt by the crowd to be the main source of blame. As they assembled in front of the courthouse, throwing rocks, militia and cavalry were called in to repel them. The riot lasted a few days, ceasing when Governor Clinton sent the militia to patrol the streets until a calm environment was ensured.

At least three rioters and three militiamen died in the confrontation; some estimate up to 20 dead.&lt;ref&gt;Bess Lovejoy.[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gory-new-york-city-riot-shaped-american-medicine-180951766/ "The Gory New York City Riot that Shaped American Medicine"].2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters also destroyed all the available human specimens.

==Effects==

Public opinion of the physicians in New York stood very low for many years, and while some students were brought to trial, Hicks was not among them. Post-mortem dissection was considered an indignity to the dead and the city fathers even forbade using bodies abandoned in the rougher parts of the city. A year later, in January 1789, a statute was finally put into law in order to codify the proper treatment of corpses, with harsh punishments imposed for those who violated it. Anyone who broke the law would stand on the pillory or be publicly whipped, fined, or imprisoned. 

The statute also permitted the bodies of executed criminals to be used in dissection, “in order that science [might not] be injured by preventing the dissection of proper subjects”. “Resurrection men”, professionals who used stealth and discretion, were recruited to replace the students and went on to control the supply of cadavers for generations. Throughout the 1700s, British law considered dissection as a worse punishment than death. 

To discourage dueling, the Massachusetts General Court also imposed dissection as a threat by ruling that anyone who died as a result of a duel would be sentenced to post-mortem dissection and dismemberment. Dissection was seen as perhaps one of the worst things that could happen to a person after death.

The '''1989 attack on La Tablada barracks''' was an assault on the military [[barracks]] located in [[La Tablada, Buenos Aires|La Tablada]], in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], by 40 members of ''[[Movimiento Todos por la Patria]]'' (MTP), commanded by former [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]] leader [[Enrique Gorriarán Merlo]]. 39 people were killed and 60 injured by the time the Argentine army retook the barracks. The MTP carried out the assault under the false pretense of preventing a military coup, allegedly planned for the end of January 1989 by the ''[[Carapintadas]]'', a group of [[far-right]] military officers opposed to the investigations concerning the "[[Dirty War]]". The Argentine president of the time, [[Raúl Alfonsín]] declared that the attack, with the ultimate goal of sparking a massive popular uprising, could have led to civil war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E5arAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=alfonsin+declared+that+the+attack+could+have+led+to+civil+war The Politics of Human Rights in Argentina: Protest, Change, and Democratization, [[Alison Brysk]], p. 119, Stanford University Press, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; Given a [[life sentence]] and imprisoned, as his comrades, in [[Supermax|high security quarters]], Gorriarán Merlo was eventually freed in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[[Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos]]. [http://www.cidh.org/annualrep/97span/Argentina11.137.htm Informe Nº 55/97 - Caso 11.137]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]]. [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Argentin.htm 1989 Argentina report]&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 22 September 2006 while awaiting surgery for an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]].

== The assault on the barracks ==
On 23 January 1989, a group of approximatively 40 members of the ''[[Movimiento Todos por la Patria]]'' ("''All for the Motherland''" Movement, "MTP", founded in 1986 by former [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]] leader [[Enrique Gorriarán Merlo]]) attacked the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Regiment barracks in La Tablada (''Regimiento de Infantería Mecanizada Nº 3'', RIM3). They broke into the barracks by ramming a stolen truck into the main gate, followed by several other vehicles.

According to ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' newspaper, three different versions about the attack exist.&lt;ref name="Clarin"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Clarín |url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/01/23/p-01403.htm |title=El ataque a La Tablada, la última aventura de la guerrilla argentina |date=23 January 2004 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days before the assault, lawyer and MTP member Jorge Baños had declared in a conference that the ''[[Carapintadas]]'' were planning a [[coup]] for the end of January. The ''Carapintadas'' were members of the Armed Forces that had rebelled against the national government three times in 1987 and 1988, protesting the investigations on [[human rights]] abuses during the "[[National Reorganization Process]]" (1976–1983). This has remained to this day the MTP's version, held in particular by the late Gorriarán Merlo who claimed that the MTP was fulfilling the [[Constitution of Argentina|constitutional]] obligation of "''bear[ing] arms in defense of the fatherland and of [the] Constitution''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Taringa!. |url=http://www.taringa.net/posts/110886/Copamiento-al-cuartel-de-La-Tablada.html |title=Copamiento al cuartel de La Tablada |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Argentina|Constitution of the Argentine Nation]], Article 21. "''Every Argentine citizen is obliged to bear arms in defense of the fatherland and of this Constitution…''"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alfonsin la tablada.jpg|thumb|left|250px|President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] (in pale suit) visits the site, where an MTP member lies after being killed by the Army]]
The official report on the attack by head of the Army Francisco Gassino claimed in contrary that it was the MTP, formed of several former ERP members, that had planned a coup. A last version claims that the MTP was victim of a manipulation by [[Sistema de Inteligencia Nacional|intelligence services]]. A sociologist and professor who published an investigation into the attack believes the MTP had wider aims: ''"They weren’t planning to put down a coup. They were creating the false image of a coup, to set the scene, but were planning to take the barracks and from there start a revolution."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090814042252/http://www.theargentimes.com/feature/la-tablada-the-guerrillas-last-stand-/ La Tablada – the Guerrillas’ Last Stand]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Argentine Army]], assisted by the [[Policía Bonaerense|Buenos Aires Police]] (a total of 3,600 personnel) was called on to counterattack, and indiscriminately used [[White phosphorus (weapon)|white phosphorus]] (WP) in the zone, in violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]], which in civil wars are only binding with the consent of both parties, and not at all in police actions. The use of WP in combat is forbidden by [[international law]]. In this case, it had the effect of completely burning the barracks and of carbonizing corpses.&lt;ref name="Clarin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/298628a9022c5e06c12569fb00576635?|title=OpenDocument E/CN.4/2001/NGO/98 |publisher=United Nations |date=12 January 2001 |accessdate=9 February 2007 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] cable quoted by [[RAI|RaiNews]]24: [http://www.rainews24.rai.it/ran24/inchiesta/testimonianze.asp Alcune testimonianze sull'uso militare del fosforo bianco] {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 39 people were killed and 60 injured during the attack (the majority by conventional weapons). Nine were military personnel, two were police officers and the 28 remaining were members of the MTP. Lawyer Jorge Baños was among the dead.&lt;ref name="Pensada"&gt;''La Historia Pensada''. [http://www.lahistoriapensada.com.ar/index.php?id=61 ''Asalto al cuartel General Belgrano (La Tablada)'']{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. September 17, 2006 {{es icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 53 soldiers and police were wounded in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956889,00.html |title=Argentina The Battle of La Tablada |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=6 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] ([[Radical Civic Union|UCR]], 1983–89) visited the site, protected by Argentine Army commandos, along with federal the judge of [[Morón]], Gerardo Larrambebere, who is today member of the court presiding over the 1994 [[AMIA bombing]] case.

== Alleged human rights violations ==
Retired sergeant José Almada, who had participated in the capture of the MTP members, declared in 2004 that Iván Ruiz and José Díaz had been tortured. According to sergeant Almada, they referred to two persons who were not members of their brigade, and most probably [[SIDE]] agents. He identified one of them as Jorge Varando, chief of security of [[HSBC]] corporation in Buenos Aires during the [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|December 2001 events]]. Furthermore, sergeant Almada declared that he had clearly heard a radio conversation ordering to kill two of the captured prisoners. He also said that adjutant sergeant Esquivel, killed during the attack, had been in fact shot by the Army itself, after trying to get to his brother who had been taken prisoner. Sergeant Almada explicitly denounced the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] report written by Jorge Varando and General Arrillaga, the highest-ranking official in charge of the repression, which aimed at disguising adjutant sergeant Esquivel's suspicious death.&lt;ref name="Almada"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-31720-2004-02-20.html |title=Mi verdad sobre La Tablada es irrefutable |date=20 February 2004 |newspaper=Página/12 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

José Almada said that he had tried to inform his hierarchy about these [[human rights violations]], in accordance with article 194 of the Military Justice Code, but that they ignored him. He notably tried to inform General Martín Balza. He also informed head of Argentine Army, General [[Bonifacio Cáceres]], also telling him about his concerns that his neighbours were insulting him, saying that they were responsible of new cases of ''desaparecidos''. Moreover, in his complaint before justice, he also said he had informed former head of the Army [[Ricardo Brinzoni]]. After Cáceres's retirement in 1989, colonel Gasquet threatened José Almada of 40 days of arrest &amp;mdash; he was finally given two days of arrest on charges of wearing a beard, and then sent him to [[Paraná, Entre Ríos]]. Later, he was again sentenced to 30 days of arrest, confined to [[Crespo, Entre Ríos|Crespo]] near Paraná and finally forced to retire. He still claims to this day he is still being "persecuted."&lt;ref name="Almada"/&gt;

The MTP guerrillas were also accused of human right violations. As a conscript serving in the 3rd Infantry Regiment, Eduardo Navascues was taken prisoner early in the assault and suffered shrapnel wounds in the fighting that followed. Despite having been shot several years later in an attempt to silence him, he has given testimony in a recent court case alleging [[human rights abuses]] including physical and mental torture at the hand of the guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notife.com/noticia/articulo/975240/La_Tablada_niegan_que_una_atacante_haya_sido_fusilada.html ''Niegan que una atacante haya sido fusilada''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714203114/http://www.notife.com/noticia/articulo/975240/La_Tablada_niegan_que_una_atacante_haya_sido_fusilada.html |date=2011-07-14 }} ''Diario Digital de Santa Fe'', 11 de agosto de 2009 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another conscript, Private Víctor Eduardo Scarafiocco claimed that he and others were used as human shields by the guerrillas and that Private Héctor Cardozo was killed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derf.com.ar/despachos.asp?cod_des=300517&amp;ID_Seccion=53 ''Crónica de un olvido''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convictions ==

Twenty surviving members of the MTP were later convicted and given sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. They were judged under the ''[[Ley de Defensa de la Democracia (Argentina)]]'' (Defense of the Democracy Act) which deprive them of a right to [[Court of appeal|appeal]] and to a new trial.&lt;ref name="Pensada"/&gt;

Enrique Gorriarán Merlo was given a [[life sentence]], and his ex-wife, Ana María Sívori, was sentenced to 18 years of imprisonment.
During the oral and public trial, Gorriarán put into question the legitimacy of the process and objected to the circumstances of his capture in the suburbs of [[Mexico city|Mexico]] in October 1995, which he called a "[[kidnapping]]". He was charged with being co-author of qualified [[illicit association]], [[rebellion]], [[usurpation]], [[homicide]] with aggravated circumstances&lt;!-- "homicidio doblemente agravado" in Spanish--&gt;, aggravated illegal privation of freedom and reiterated injuries. His ex-wife Sívori was charged with being co-author of qualified illicit association, and secondary participant to offenses of rebellion, doubly aggravated homicide, tentative of homicide, aggravated theft, reiterated injuries and co-author of the use of [[false identity documents]].

On October 25, 1999, a chartered [[Learjet 35/36|Learjet 35]] was scheduled to fly from [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], [[Florida]], to [[Dallas Love Field|Dallas]], [[Texas]]. Early in the flight, the aircraft, which was climbing to its assigned altitude on [[autopilot]], quickly lost cabin pressure and all six on board were incapacitated due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] – a lack of oxygen. The aircraft continued climbing past its assigned altitude, then failed to make the westward turn toward Dallas over north Florida and continued on its northwestern course, flying over the southern and [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] [[United States]] for almost four hours and {{convert|1500|mi}}. The plane ran out of fuel over [[South Dakota]] and crashed into a field near [[Aberdeen, South Dakota|Aberdeen]] after an [[Spiral dive|uncontrolled descent]].&lt;ref name="ntsb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/Pages/Learjet_Model_35_N47BA_near_Aberdeen_South_Dakota_October_25_1999.aspx|title=Board Meeting : Learjet Model 35, N47BA, near Aberdeen, South Dakota, October 25, 1999.|date=|publisher=Ntsb.gov|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two pilots were Michael Kling and Stephanie Bellegarrigue. The four passengers on board were [[PGA Tour|PGA]] [[golf]]er [[Payne Stewart]]; his agents, Van Ardan and Robert Fraley; and [[Bruce Borland]], a golf architect with the [[Jack Nicklaus]] golf course design company.

==Flight chronology==

:''Note: all times are presented in 24-hour, military format. Because the flight took place in both the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] time zone'' – Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) – ''and the [[Central Time zone]]'' – Central Daylight Time (CDT) – ''all times are given in this article in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (which is indicated by the time followed by the letter Z)''

===Departure===
[[Image:NTSB-N47BA-slide0046 image002.jpg|thumb|260px|Projected (in green) and actual (in red) [[ground track]] of N47BA from departure in Orlando to Dallas and to crash site in South Dakota.]]
On October 25, 1999, Learjet 35, [[Aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|N|47BA|,}} operated by Sunjet Aviation of [[Sanford, Florida]], departed [[Orlando International Airport]] {{Airport codes|MCO|KMCO}} at 1319Z (0919 EDT) on a two-day, five-flight trip. Before departure, the aircraft had been fueled with {{convert|5300|lb|abbr=on}} of [[Jet fuel|Jet A]], enough for 4 hours and 45 minutes of flight. On board were two pilots and four passengers.&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;

At 1327:13Z, the [[Air traffic controller|controller]] from the [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] [[Area Control Center|ARTCC]] instructed the pilot to climb and maintain [[flight level]] (FL) 390 ({{convert|39000|ft|-2}} above sea level). At 1327:18Z (0927:18 EDT), the pilot acknowledged the clearance by stating, "three nine zero bravo alpha." This was the last known radio transmission from the airplane, and occurred while the aircraft was passing through {{convert|23000|ft|-2}}. The next attempt to contact the aircraft occurred six minutes, 20 seconds later (14 minutes after departure), with the aircraft at {{convert|36500|ft|-2}}, and the controller's message went unacknowledged. The controller attempted to contact N47BA five more times in the next {{Frac|4|1|2}} minutes, again with no answer.&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;

===First interception===
About 1454Z (now 0954 CDT due to the flight's crossing into the Central Time zone), a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] [[test pilot]] from the [[40th Flight Test Squadron]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin AFB]] in western Florida, who happened to be in the air nearby, was directed by controllers to intercept N47BA. When the fighter was about {{convert|2000|ft|-2}} from the Learjet, at an altitude of about {{convert|46400|ft}}, the test pilot made two radio calls to N47BA but did not receive a response. The F-16 pilot made a visual inspection of the Lear, finding no visible damage to the airplane. Both engines were running, and the plane's red rotating anti-collision beacon was on (standard operation for aircraft in flight). The fighter pilot could not see inside the passenger section of the airplane because the windows seemed to be dark. Further, he stated that the entire right cockpit windshield was [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], as if condensation or ice covered the inside. He also indicated that the left cockpit windshield was opaque, although several sections of the center of the windshield seemed to be only thinly covered by condensation or ice; a small rectangular section of the windshield was clear, with only a small section of the glare shield visible through this area. He did not see any flight control movement. At about 1512Z, the F-16 pilot concluded his inspection of N47BA and broke formation, proceeding to [[Scott Air Force Base|Scott AFB]] in southwestern [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;

===Second interception===
At 1613Z, almost three hours into the flight of the unresponsive Learjet, two F-16s from the [[138th Fighter Wing]] of the [[Oklahoma Air National Guard]] (ANG), flying under the call-sign "TULSA 13 flight", were directed by the [[Minneapolis]] [[Area Control Center|ARTCC]] to intercept. The TULSA 13 lead pilot reported that he could not see any movement in the cockpit, that the windshield was dark and that he could not tell if the windshield was iced. A few minutes later, a TULSA 13 pilot reported, "We're not seeing anything inside, could be just a dark cockpit though...he is not reacting, moving or anything like that he should be able to have seen us by now." At 1639Z, TULSA 13 left to rendezvous with a tanker for [[Aerial refueling|refueling]].&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;

The aircraft reached a maximum altitude of {{convert|48900|ft|mi km|1}}.&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/oct99/crash26.htm |title=Golfer Payne Stewart Dies in Jet Crash |author1=Edward Walsh |author2=William Claiborne |publisher=Washington Post |date=1999-10-26 |accessdate=2007-04-19}} Appeared on page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third interception and escort===
About 1650Z, two F-16s from the [[119th Wing]] of the [[North Dakota Air National Guard|North Dakota ANG]] with the identification "NODAK 32 flight" were directed to intercept N47BA. TULSA 13 flight also returned from refueling, and all four fighters maneuvered close to the Lear. The TULSA 13 lead pilot reported, "We've got two visuals on it. It's looking like the cockpit window is iced over and there's no displacement in any of the control surfaces as far as the [[aileron]]s or [[Trim tab|trims]]." About 1701Z, TULSA 13 flight returned to the tanker again, while NODAK 32 remained with N47BA.&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;

There was some speculation in the media that military jets were prepared to shoot down the Lear if it threatened to crash in a heavily populated area.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Officials at [[the Pentagon]] strongly denied that possibility. Shooting down the plane "was never an option," Air Force spokesman Captain Joe Della Vedova said, "I don't know where that came from."&lt;ref name="cnn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9910/25/wayward.jet.07/ |title=Investigators arrive at Payne Stewart crash site |accessdate=2007-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323141834/http://www.cnn.com/US/9910/25/wayward.jet.07/ |archivedate=2008-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crash===
[[Image:Ntsb-N47BA-scene-1.jpg|thumb|The crash's crater&lt;br&gt;(from [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] presentation)]]
[[Image:NTSB-N47BA-slide0026 background.jpg|thumb|Crash scene (from [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] presentation)]]

The Learjet's [[Cockpit voice recorder|cockpit voice recorder (CVR)]], which was recovered from the wreckage, contained an audio recording of the last 30 minutes of the flight (it was an older model which only recorded 30 minutes of audio; the aircraft was not equipped with a [[flight data recorder]]). At 1710:41Z, the Learjet's engines can be heard winding down, indicating that the plane's fuel had been exhausted. In addition, sounds of the [[stick shaker]] and [[autopilot]] disconnect can be heard. With the engines powered down, the autopilot would have attempted to maintain altitude, causing the plane's [[airspeed]] to drop until it approached [[Stall (flight)|stall]] speed, at which point the stick shaker would have automatically engaged to warn the pilot and the autopilot would have switched itself off.&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;

At 1711:01Z, the Lear began a right turn and descent. NODAK 32 remained to the west, while TULSA 13  broke away from the tanker and followed N47BA down. At 1711:26 CDT, the NODAK 32 lead pilot reported, "The target is descending and he is doing multiple [[aileron roll]]s, looks like he's out of control...in a severe descent, request an emergency descent to follow target." The TULSA 13 pilot reported, "It's soon to impact the ground; he is in a descending spiral."&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt; The fighter planes were forced to break off their pursuit at this point and had to land at local airports, having reached the limit of their endurance.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Impact occurred approximately 1713Z, or 1213 local, after a total flight time of 3 hours, 54 minutes, with the aircraft hitting the ground at a nearly supersonic speed and an extreme angle.&lt;ref name="ntsb3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Smith |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/Speeches/former/hall/jhc001128.htm |title=NTSB Board presentation |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162137/http://ntsb.gov/speeches/former/hall/jhc001128.htm| archivedate= 2 September 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Learjet crashed in South Dakota, just outside Mina in [[Edmunds County, South Dakota|Edmunds County]], on relatively flat ground and left a crater {{convert|42|ft}} long, {{convert|21|ft}} wide, and {{convert|8|ft}} deep. None of its components remained intact.&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;

== Passengers and crew ==
In addition to [[Payne Stewart]] and three others, there were two pilots on board:

The 42-year-old captain, Michael Kling, held an [[Pilot certification in the United States#Airline transport pilot|airline transport pilot certificate]] and [[Pilot certification in the United States|type ratings]] for the [[Boeing 707]], [[Boeing 737]], and [[Learjet 35]]. He also had Air Force experience flying the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] and [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]]. Kling was also an instructor pilot on the KC-135E in the [[Maine Air National Guard]]. According to Sunjet Aviation records, the captain had accumulated a total of 4,280 hours of flight time (military and commercial) and had flown a total of 60 hours with Sunjet, 38 as a Learjet pilot-in-command and 22 as a Learjet second-in-command.&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;

The first officer, 27-year-old Stephanie Bellegarrigue, held a [[Pilot certification in the United States#Commercial|commercial pilot certificate]] and type ratings for Learjet and Cessna Citation 500. She was also a certified flight instructor. She had accumulated a total of 1,751 hours of flight time, of which 251 hours were with Sunjet Aviation as a second-in-command and 99 as a Learjet second-in-command.&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;

== Investigation ==
The [[National Transportation Safety Board|National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)]] has several levels of investigation, of which the highest is a "major" investigation. Because of the extraordinary circumstances in this crash, a major investigation was performed.&lt;ref name="ntsb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/major.asp |title=NTSB Major Investigations summary web page |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090826051459/http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/major.asp| archivedate= 26 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NTSB determined that:
{{quote|The probable cause of this accident was incapacitation of the flight crew members as a result of their failure to receive supplemental oxygen following a loss of cabin pressurization, for undetermined reasons.}}

The Board added a commentary regarding the possible reasons why the crew did not obtain supplemental oxygen:

{{quote|Following the depressurization, the pilots did not receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and incapacitation. The wreckage indicated that the oxygen bottle pressure regulator/shutoff valve was open on the accident flight. Further, although one flight crew mask hose connector was found in the wreckage disconnected from its valve receptacle (the other connector was not recovered), damage to the recovered connector and both receptacles was consistent with both flight crew masks having been connected to the airplane's oxygen supply lines at the time of impact. In addition, both flight crew mask microphones were found plugged into their respective crew microphone jacks. Therefore, assuming the oxygen bottle contained an adequate supply of oxygen, supplemental oxygen should have been available to both pilots' [[oxygen mask]]s.

[A] possible explanation for the failure of the pilots to receive emergency oxygen is that their ability to think and act decisively was impaired because of hypoxia before they could don their oxygen masks. No definitive evidence exists that indicates the rate at which the accident flight lost its cabin pressure; therefore, the Safety Board evaluated conditions of both rapid and gradual depressurization.

If there had been a breach in the fuselage (even a small one that could not be visually detected by the in-flight observers) or a seal failure, the cabin could have depressurized gradually, rapidly, or even explosively. Research has shown that a period of as little as 8 seconds without supplemental oxygen following rapid depressurization to about {{convert|30000|ft|m}} may cause a drop in oxygen saturation that can significantly impair cognitive functioning and increase the amount of time required to complete complex tasks.

A more gradual decompression could have resulted from other possible causes, such as a smaller leak in the pressure vessel or a closed flow control valve. Safety Board testing determined that a closed flow control valve would cause complete depressurization to the airplane's flight altitude over a period of several minutes. However, without supplemental oxygen, substantial adverse effects on cognitive and motor skills would have been expected soon after the first clear indication of decompression (the cabin altitude warning), when the cabin altitude reached {{Convert|10000|ft|m}} (which could have occurred in about 30 seconds).

Investigations of other accidents in which flight crews attempted to diagnose a pressurization problem or initiate emergency pressurization instead of immediately donning oxygen masks following a cabin altitude alert have revealed that, even with a relatively gradual rate of depressurization, pilots have rapidly lost cognitive or motor abilities to effectively troubleshoot the problem or don their masks shortly thereafter. In this accident, the flight crew's failure to obtain supplemental oxygen in time to avoid incapacitation could be explained by a delay in donning oxygen masks; of only a few seconds in the case of an explosive or rapid decompression, or a slightly longer delay in the case of a gradual decompression.

In summary, the Safety Board was unable to determine why the flight crew could not, or did not, receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation.&lt;ref name="ntsb1"/&gt;
}}

The NTSB report showed that the plane had several instances of maintenance work related to cabin pressure in the months leading up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve, as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.

== Aftermath ==
Stewart was ultimately headed to [[Houston]] for the 1999 [[The Tour Championship|Tour Championship]], but planned a stop in Dallas for discussions with [[SMU Mustangs|the athletic department]] of his alma mater, [[Southern Methodist University]], about building a new home course for the school's golf program.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/usopen09/news/story?id=4260509 |title=In his father's footsteps |work=[[Outside the Lines]] |first=Elizabeth |last=Merrill |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2009-06-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090618050935/http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/usopen09/news/story?id=4260509| archivedate= 18 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart was memorialized at the Tour Championship with a lone [[bagpipe]] player playing at the first hole at [[Champions Golf Club]] prior to the beginning of the first day of play. The owner of the crash site, after consulting the wives of Stewart and several other victims, created a memorial on about {{convert|1|acre|m2}} of the site. At its center is a rock pulled from the site inscribed with the names of the victims and a Bible passage.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

The 2000 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], held at [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]], began with a golf version of a [[21-gun salute]] when 21 of Stewart's fellow players simultaneously hit balls into the Pacific Ocean.

In 2001, Stewart was posthumously inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]].

On June 8, 2005, a Florida state court jury in Orlando found that Learjet was not liable for the deaths of Stewart and his agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, who had also been aboard the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web02.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/06135p5.xml&amp;headline=Bombardier%20Not%20Negligent%20in%20Payne%20Stewart%20Crash |title=Bombardier Not Negligent in Payne Stewart Crash |publisher=''aviationweek.com'' |date=2005-06-13 |accessdate=2010-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707195702/http://web02.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news%2F06135p5.xml&amp;headline=Bombardier%20Not%20Negligent%20in%20Payne%20Stewart%20Crash |archive-date=2011-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2016 Bulgarian Supercup''' was meant to be the 14th [[Bulgarian Supercup]], an annual Bulgarian football match played between the winners of the previous season's [[Bulgarian A Football Group|A Football Group]] and [[Bulgarian Cup]]. The game was to be played between [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]], winners of the [[2016 Bulgarian Cup Final]], and [[PFC Ludogorets Razgrad|Ludogorets Razgrad]], champions of the [[2015–16 A Group]].

'''Beth Doe''' (known officially as '''Incident No. N3-27244''')&lt;ref name=seek&gt;{{cite news|via=Newspapers.com|title=Seek Help on Identities of Victims|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1365002|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=Lebanon Daily News|date=28 December 1976|page=2}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to an unidentified young European-American woman who was found murdered on December 20, 1976, in [[White Haven, Pennsylvania]]. The brutality of the crime, the fact that she was pregnant when she was killed and the length of time that she has remained unidentified created national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dudiak|first1=Zandy|title=Unsolved Cases: A New Weekend Patch Feature|url=http://patch.com/pennsylvania/northhills/unsolved-cases-a-new-weekend-patch-feature-5f25f7b9|website=North Hills Patch|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth Doe is believed to have been an immigrant from a Central European country.

==Death and discovery==
When discovered, Beth Doe, who was carrying a nine-month female [[fetus]], had been sexually assaulted, strangled and shot in the neck by an unknown person.&lt;ref name="cs"&gt;{{cite web|title=MEDIA RELEASE #1956, UNIDENTIFIED BETH DOE AND FEMALE FETUS, EAST SIDE BOROUGH, CARBON COUNTY, PA|url=https://www.crimewatchpa.com/crimestoppers/316/cases/media-release-1956-unidentified-beth-doe-and-female-fetus-east-side-borough-carbon-county|website=crimewatchpa.com|publisher=Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was then dismembered with a serrated blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beth Doe, Carbon County|url=http://thepennsylvaniarambler.blogspot.com/2011/07/beth-doe-carbon-county.html|publisher=Blogger|accessdate=1 December 2014|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her nose, breasts, and ears had been severed and have never been found.&lt;ref name=by/&gt;&lt;ref name="Case File 169UFPA"/&gt; The dismemberment was described to be unlike that of a surgeon, but not "haphazard."&lt;ref name="grizzly" /&gt;

Other evidence included straw, packaging foam, a bedspread, and waterlogged fragments of a newspaper later determined to have been ''The New York Sunday'' from September 26, 1976.&lt;ref name=seek/&gt;&lt;ref name=by/&gt;&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web| last=Warder| first=Robin| title=10 Mysterious Cases Involving Unidentified People| url=http://listverse.com/2013/06/14/10-mysterious-cases-involving-unidentified-people/| accessdate=8 April 2014| date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bedding and newspaper fragments had been wrapped over some of the body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|via=Newspapers.com|title=Dismembered Body and Fetus Found by Boy|page=14|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1364964|accessdate=19 July 2015|work=The Evening Times|date=21 December 1976}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper was linked to the northern part of New Jersey, where the perpetrator may have had ties.&lt;ref name=images/&gt; The bedspread in the suitcases had a reddish-orange color, was made of [[chenille fabric]], and was wrapped around some of the body.

==Investigation==
[[File:Beth Doe suitcases.jpg|thumb|300px|Reconstructions of the three suitcases in which Beth Doe was found.]]

After the body was found, the victim was fingerprinted. Her teeth were examined and recorded on a dental chart.&lt;ref name=summary/&gt;&lt;ref name=i80&gt;{{cite news|title=Dismembered Body Found Near I-80|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1364992|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=The Daily News|date=22 December 1976|page=3}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=close/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police Seek Identity for Dismembered Body|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1365014|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=York Daily Record|via=Newspapers.com|date=22 December 1976}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missing persons reports throughout the United States and Canada were compared at the time to the victim but were excluded.&lt;ref name="grizzly"&gt;{{cite news |title=Police Ponder Grizzly Puzzle |work=The Titusville Herald |date=7 January 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical examiner noted that a set of numbers had been written on the victim's body. The ink, believed to have been from a pen, was on the left hand of the victim, indicating that she was right-handed if she had indeed written it herself. The writing consisted of the letters '''WSR''' and the number '''4''' or '''5''', followed by '''4''' or '''7'''.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

Her fingerprints were submitted to the [[FBI]], but they did not match anyone in national databases.&lt;ref name=seek/&gt;&lt;ref name=ydr&gt;{{cite news|via=Newspapers.com|title=State Police try to Identify Dismembered Pregnant Woman|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1365009|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=York Daily Record|date=28 December 1976}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she remained unidentified, a sketch was made and the public was asked for assistance. This resulted in few solid leads.&lt;ref name=idunk/&gt;&lt;ref name=dis/&gt; Information about the case was subsequently published across the country to generate leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|via=Newspapers.com|title=PSP Seeking Identity of Murdered Woman|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1364973|accessdate=19 July 2015|work=The Daily Courier|date=28 December 1976}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a three-hour [[autopsy]] on December 23, 1976, it was determined that she was a white woman in her late teens or early twenties. However, her identity could not be established.&lt;ref name=dis&gt;{{cite news|via=Newspapers.com|title=Dismembered body was girl who died of strangulation|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1365013|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Evening Times|date=23 December 1976}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp/&gt;&lt;ref name=by&gt;{{cite news|title=Dismembered Body Found By Children in Carbon Co.|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1364994|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=The Gettysburg Times|date=21 December 1976|page=3}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bodies Found|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1365005|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=The Evenings Standard|date=21 December 1976}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of death was determined to be that of strangulation, although she had been shot in the neck as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Identified|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1365006|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=Pottstown Mercury|date=24 December 1976|pages=10}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beth Doe was between 4 feet 11 inches and 5 feet 4 inches tall. She weighed 140 to 150 pounds (due to her pregnancy).&lt;ref name="Case File 169UFPA"&gt;{{cite web| title=Case File 169UFPA| url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/169ufpa.html| work=[[The Doe Network]]| accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hair, which was shoulder-length, was an undyed dark brown. The medical examiner classified her blood as type O.&lt;ref name="Case File 169UFPA"/&gt;

She had some distinctive markings on her body. A 2- to 6-inch scar was visible above one of her heels.&lt;ref name=seek/&gt;&lt;ref name=vidimentary/&gt;&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite news|via=Newspapers.com|title=Autopsy Completed|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=1364982|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=The Pocono Record|date=24 December 1976|page=13}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Mole (skin marking)|moles]] on her face - one above her left eye and one on her left cheek - may have developed during her pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Case File 169UFPA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vidimentary/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5985">In catering, '''beverage functions''' are [[social event|function]]s where beverages are served.

== Who pays ==
One important issue of beverage functions is who pays for the drinks.&lt;ref name=Idiots&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Meeting and Event Planning|author=Robin E. Craven and Lynn Johnson Golabowski|pages=192|publisher=Alpha Books|date=2001|isbn13=9780028640044}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main scenarios:
*a cash bar (a.k.a. a no-host bar): Attendees pay for their own drinks.&lt;ref name=Idiots/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|article=cash bar|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Travel, Tourism and Hospitality|author=S. Medlik|pages=33|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|date=2003|isbn13=9780750656504}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a cash bar with tickets: The host issues vouchers to attendees for a limited number of free drinks, and attendees pay for any further drinks themselves.&lt;ref name=Idiots/&gt;
*a host bar (a.k.a. an open bar): The host pays for all drinks, either by the hour, by the bottle, by the drink, or per person.&lt;ref name=Idiots/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|article=host bar|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Travel, Tourism and Hospitality|author=S. Medlik|pages=86|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|date=2003|isbn13=9780750656504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackTie/&gt;

Choosing among the several options is influenced by several factors.  One such factor is etiquette. Providing a cash bar at a function such as a wedding reception is generally considered poor etiquette in the United States.&lt;ref name=Leigh&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Plan Your Own Wedding and Save Thousands|author=Tracy Leigh|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|date=2008|isbn13=9781601380074|pages=207&amp;ndash;208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another such factor is cost. A cash bar is the least expensive option for a host. However, there are alternatives between a cash bar and a fully open bar that can limit costs. The host can set a hard limit on cost, beyond which all beverages have to be paid for by attendees. The host can specify that specific beverages, such as a few selected types of wines and beers, are paid for by the host, and that attendees pay for all other types of drinks. The host can set a time limit for an open bar, beyond which it reverts to being a cash bar. Or more complex combinations of these can be employed.&lt;ref name=Leigh/&gt;

Some venues, such as hotels, subject to the terms of their [[liquor license]]s, may allow attendees to bring their own alcoholic drinks to beverage functions. However, they may also charge attendees a fee, usually charged per bottle (either at a flat rate or as a percentage of the bottle's price), for doing so, known as [[corkage]].&lt;ref name=BlackTie/&gt;

Cash bars have their problems for caterers and venue managers. One major problem is the possibility of theft. To prevent this, managers can set up cashiers, who take money and issue drinks tickets, separate from the serving staff who actually serve drinks. Brown and Godsmark recommend to managers that they place only their most trustworthy staff in charge of the cash bars at banquets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Food Service Manager's Guide to Creative Cost Cutting|author=Douglas Robert Brown|pages=460|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|date=2005|isbn13=9780910627610}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controlling Liquor, Wine &amp;amp; Beverage Costs|author=Douglas Robert Brown and Elizabeth Godsmark|pages=123|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|date=2002|isbn13=9780910627184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, open bars have problems for hosts, in that they can result in an increased number of intoxicated, and potentially obnoxious and aggressive, attendees, as compared to other options. With open bars, the level of waste also increases (which is reflected in increased costs to the host). Since attendees do not pay for their drinks, they often do not consider them to be as valuable as they would if they had paid for them themselves. This results in drinks being abandoned or forgotten, or simply discarded by guests who leave their drinks (as they go and do something else) after only partly consuming them and then replace them with fresh ones rather than finishing the drinks that they already had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Everything Wedding Organizer|author=Shelly Hagen|pages=135&amp;ndash;138|publisher=Everything Books|date=2006|isbn13=9781593376406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=E-Plan Your Wedding|author=Crystal Melendez and Jason Melendez|pages=218|publisher=Mediasoft Press|date=2007|isbn13=9781933457000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of drinks served ==
The types of drinks served at functions can vary, according to the type of the event, and the types and ages of the attendees.  In particular, at wedding receptions whether the bride and groom are themselves alcohol drinkers can affect whether attendees pay for their own alcoholic drinks, or indeed whether alcohol is offered at all. Similarly, alcohol is not served at beverage events for children.&lt;ref name=Leigh/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackTie/&gt;

Another factor that affects whether alcohol is served is liability, for subsequent intoxication and anything that results from it. Many U.S. jurisdictions allow the victims of accidents to sue not only the person who was intoxicated, but also the person who served the alcohol, the person or company employing the bartender, and the board of directors of the company.&lt;ref name=BlackTie&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Tie Optional|author=Harry A. Freedman and Karen Feldman|pages=122&amp;ndash;123|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|date=2007|isbn13=9780470116814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Film Centre]]'s '''Worldwide Short Film Festival''' ('''WSFF'''), founded by Brenda Sherwood in 1994, was an annual [[film festival]] held over several days in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] in June, at [[The Annex]]-[[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] area venues; including the [[Bloor Cinema]], the [[University of Toronto]], and the [[Isabel Bader Theatre]], among others.  As well as film screenings, the festival hosts parties and the CFC's annual picnic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://playbackonline.ca/2011/06/09/photo-gallery-its-been-a-short-2-weeks-at-the-cfc/ "Photo gallery: It’s been a ‘short’ 2 weeks for the CFC"]. ''Playback''. By Katie Bailey. June 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The WSFF holds accreditation, and is recognized as a qualifying event for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television]], and the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) short film awards. This means that certain award-winners at the WSFF are eligible to be nominated for the [[Oscars]], [[Genies]], and [[BAFTAs]] awards.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, Angela.

In 2012, the festival received 4,768 submissions from 113 countries, and it is currently the largest short film festival in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Droganes |first=Constance |title=Rachel Weisz makes directorial debut at T.O. festival |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20110530/short-film-festival-110531/ |work=ctv.ca |publisher=CTV News |accessdate=1 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102190540/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20110530/short-film-festival-110531/ |archivedate=2 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kinos-Goodin|first=Jesse|title=Worldwide Short Film Festival: Size doesn't matter with these films|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/05/16/worldwide-short-film-festival-size-doesnt-matter-with-these-films/|accessdate=14 June 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129203937/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/05/16/worldwide-short-film-festival-size-doesnt-matter-with-these-films/#|archive-date=2013-01-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival has been described in the ''[[Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' as "a popular and productive meeting place for audiences, filmmakers, buyers and sellers interested in the art and commerce of making movies in short form",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Handling|first=Piers|title=Canadian Film Centre|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadian-film-centre/|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is reflected in the Short Films Big Ideas Symposium, which features master classes and panel discussions focused on professional development for those involved in the industry.

Each year the festival offers a celebrity program which has, in the past, featured films with such notables as [[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]], [[Judi Dench]], [[David Duchovny]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Max von Sydow]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[John C.

==History==
The Worldwide Short Film Festival was founded in 1994, and operated independently under the direction of Brenda Sherwood until 2000, when the Festival was acquired by the [[Canadian Film Centre]] (CFC). The Centre brought some professional expertise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CANADIAN FILM CENTRE'S WORLDWIDE SHORT FILM FESTIVAL (6/6-10/01).|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+CANADIAN+FILM+CENTRE%27S+WORLDWIDE+SHORT+FILM+FESTIVAL+%286%2F6-10%2F01%29.-a077613572|work=The Free Library|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the venture: Wayne Clarkson, the CFC's executive director, who was the former head of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), from 1978 to 1985.

Brenda Sherwood was replaced as festival director by Shane Smith (2000-2006). Sherwood continued to serve on the festival advisory committee for 2001 festival season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CANADIAN FILM CENTRE'S WORLDWIDE SHORT FILM FESTIVAL (6/6-10/01).|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+CANADIAN+FILM+CENTRE%27S+WORLDWIDE+SHORT+FILM+FESTIVAL+%286%2F6-10%2F01%29.-a077613572|work=The Free Library|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001, under the direction of Shane Smith, the CFC-WSFF attendance doubled to over 15,000, and submissions increased to over 4,200. The CFC-WSFF also hosts the largest digital marketplace for short films in North America.

Several CFC-WSFF [[Juried (competition)|juried]] short films went on to be nominated for Academy Awards. A few, like [[Chris Landreth]]'s animated documentary ''[[Ryan (film)|Ryan]]'', won the 2004 Oscar for [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], and the [[25th Genie Awards|25th Genie Award]] for Best Animated Short.   Other Oscar winners include ''[[Harvie Krumpet]]'' by Adam Elliot (2003), ''[[Wasp (film)|Wasp]]'' by Andrea Arnold (2004) and ''[[The Danish Poet]]'' by Torill Kove (2006).

From 2004-to-2006, Festival Director Shane Smith, and festival researcher Peter Hasek pursued the idea of curating a 45-minute presentation of large format [[IMAX]] [[IMAX#Film|15/70mm short films]]. This presentation was to have been screened at one of the IMAX theaters in downtown Toronto, as part of the CFC-WSFF program. The effort had support from [[Kodak Canada]] and the [[National Film Board of Canada#Animation|English Animation Department]] of the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. The event was to be promoted with tongue-in-cheek, but in actual fact, as "the only presentation at the Worldwide Short Film Festival that actually uses film."

With only a dozen-or-so [[IMAX#Film|15/70mm short films]] in existence, the long-term plan was to create a boutique distribution service and "circuit" for large format short films; with each festival offering its own pro-rated "audience choice" cash award system. The goal was to create a reliable source of income for large format short film makers.

The "debut screening" of the 15/70mm large format short film platter was to have been held during the Worldwide Short Film Festival, at one of the IMAX theaters in downtown Toronto in June, 2006 followed by a screening for the [[Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival]], at the [[Science North]] IMAX Theater in [[Sudbury, Ontario]] in September, 2006.

]]

Following these two festival screenings, the 15/70mm platter was destined for on-going, for-profit screenings at the [[Western Fair]] IMAX Theater in [[London, Ontario]] in exchange for their help with the project. The [[Western Fair]] IMAX projection room and other facilities were to be used for ''print traffic'' co-ordination and ''revision work'' needed to assemble a 45-minute presentation of 15/70mm short films.

There were tentative plans for screening this ''ad hoc'' platter of 15/70mm short films at other IMAX theaters in Canada, and the United States, wherever the local IMAX theater had a strong partnership with their local, mainstream film festival that was similar to the working arrangement and relationship between the Cinéfest group and Science North, in [[Sudbury, Ontario]].

This plan fell-through over time when''': (1)''' the [[Western Fair]] IMAX Theater in [[London, Ontario]] ceased operations in September 2005, '''(2)''' the IMAX theaters in downtown Toronto wanted up-to $2000/hour in theater rental fees  to prepare and host a 15/70mm short film festival event, making the event unrealistic and unaffordable for CFC-WSFF organizers and patrons, respectively. And neither the Famous Players IMAX in downtown Toronto or the Cinesphere IMAX at Ontario Place was willing or able to provide print maintenance and on-site storage (Most entries to the '''Worldwide Short Film Festival''' (WSFF), or any film festival, are submitted on CD-ROM or DVD. A reel or platter of large format (IMAX) 70mm 15-perf short films featured at the '''WSFF''' can weigh 100 kilograms or more, and require the use of a forklift truck to move the 70mm film platter from the shipping dock, to the storage room, to the projection room.) for the duration of the project (April–June 2006)''', (3)''' IMAX corporate office in Santa Monica, California let it be known, throughout the "IMAX theater network", that the corporation did not support the idea of a large format, 15/70mm short film circuit for its theaters, and that the corporations current "priority (circa 2004-05) was the 're-purposing' of mainstream Hollywood feature films for use in IMAX theaters (''and that'') promoting short films in IMAX theaters would be a distraction" from that goal''',''' and that IMAX had its own vision of what constituted an "IMAX film festival" that involved its theaters,  (An IMAX-sanctioned "film festival" consists of several existing IMAX feature films being packaged and sold to patrons at a deep discount. The '''Worldwide Short Film Festival''' conventional film festival model ''might'' compete-with or distract-from IMAX Corporations marketing-oriented film festival model.) '''(4)''' the loss of WSFF Director Shane Smith, who was the principal supporter of the idea of screening large format, 15/70mm short films at mainstream film festivals and''', (5)''' festival researcher Peter Hasek was diagnosed with cancer.

In the end, it was determined that the scope and human resource requirements of '''The LF Project''' was so wide and deep, it would require the formation of a separate, [[double bottom line]] non-profit organization in order to fully develop, implement and maintain ''the goal'', set forth by Shane Smith and Peter Hasek, of curating a traveling presentation of [[IMAX]] short films that is both manageable and financially sustainable.

Shane Smith retired as festival director of the CFC-WSFF after the 2006 festival season, and was replaced by former print traffic coordinator, Eileen Arandiga, who is currently the Director of Partnerships and Events at the [[Canadian Film Centre]]. Shane Smith is currently the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto Film Festival's]] Director of Special Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin: Toronto Fest Offers Global Filmmakers Short Film Showcase|work=Hollywood Reporter - Short Cuts|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/berlin-toronto-fest-offers-global-678809|date=2 October 2014|author=Etan Vlessing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, the Canadian Film Centre began a re-evaluation of its public activities. As part of this re-evaluation process, the CFC Worldwide Short Film Festival was put on hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WSFF website announcing festival hiatus|url=http://worldwideshortfilmfest.com/|access-date=2014-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010506000542/http://www.worldwideshortfilmfest.com/#|archive-date=2001-05-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Casing of the Colors''' is a [[Military tradition|traditional]] ceremony held by [[United States Army]] [[Command (military formation)|command]]s, [[Brigade#United_States|brigade]]s and [[Regiment#United_States_Army|regiment]]s as well as [[United States Marine Corps]] units. Each of these units have unique flags referred to as "[[Military_colours,_standards_and_guidons#United_States_Army|colors]]" which are carried by the [[Colour_guard#United_States|color guard]]s to represent the unit at military ceremonies. 

If a unit is deactivated, the "Casing of the Colors" ceremony is held to commemorate the unit and its history which is read aloud to the [[Military_organization#Formation|formation]]. Afterwards, the command's [[Sergeant_major#United_States_Army|sergeant major]] then takes the colors from the [[Standard-bearer|color bearer]]'s sling, the deactivation order is read and the colors are presented to the unit commander. The unit commander and the sergeant major then proceed to lower and rotate the colors while furling them into a protective sheath thereby casing the colors. The cased colors are presented to the unit's color bearer who then carries them from the field officially ending the unit command. Cased colors for US Army units are then sent to the [[United States Army Center of Military History]] in Washington, DC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2318">The '''Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications''' ('''CSCC''') was an American government enterprise established in 2011 at the direction of the President and the Secretary of State to coordinate, orient, and inform government-wide foreign communications activities targeted against [[terrorism]] and [[violent extremism]].

The [[Global Engagement Center]], based at the [[State Department]], replaced the CSCC in 2016.&lt;ref name=politico-20170208&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/02/tillerson-isis-russia-propaganda-241218 |title=Tillerson spurns $80 million to counter ISIS, Russian propaganda |last=Toosi |first=Nahal |newspaper=Politico |date=8 February 2017 |accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Objective==
[[Executive Order 13584]], signed by President Obama on September 9, 2011, provides policy background and assigns interagency responsibilities to CSCC. In 2015, it was expanded to coordinate similar projects by other federal departments. It controls over 350 State Department Twitter accounts, as well as others from the Pentagon, the Homeland Security Department and foreign American allies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world/middleeast/us-intensifies-effort-to-blunt-isis-message.html U.S. Intensifies Effort to Blunt ISIS’ Message].

===Anti-ISIS campaign===
Its final mission was to counter online [[jihadi]]st messages and [[propaganda]] by rebutting them with "negative advertising" (or "[[Internet troll|trolling]]").

In 2011, Van den Hurk's stepbrother confessed to the killing,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; but was released a month later due to lack of evidence; he later said he had [[False confession|falsely confessed]] to get her body exhumed for [[DNA profiling|DNA tests]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; DNA collected from the girl's exhumed remains and from the crime scene led to the arrest of a man (who was referred to only as Jos de G.

== Investigation ==
On 24 October 1995, an anonymous caller told police he could identify the killer, but the call ended prematurely. The recording of the call was broadcast on national television in January 1996 in an attempt to trace the caller.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Later, the team of detectives was reduced to four.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In February, a friend of Van den Hurk's family arrested for drug trafficking told police that she had been forced to smuggle heroin by men involved in the killing.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Deadline'' (TROS), 8 February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The police said her story was flawed and was of no help. Meanwhile, ''Passie'' magazine offered a reward for details about the killer. Between May and June, Van den Hurk's stepbrother and stepfather were arrested in connection with the killing, and then cleared.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[File:The Denial of St. Peter - Gerard Seghers - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.7|[[Gerard Seghers]]: ''The Denial of Saint Peter'']]

The '''Denial of Peter''' (or '''Peter's Denial''') refers to three acts of denial of [[Jesus]] by the [[Apostle Peter]] as described in all four [[Gospel]]s of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'' by Gerhard Kittel, Geoffrey William Bromiley, Gerhard Friedrich 1980 {{ISBN|0-8028-2248-7}} page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

All four [[Canonical Gospels]] state that during Jesus' [[Last Supper]] with his disciples, he predicted that Peter would deny knowledge of him, stating that Peter would disown him before the rooster crowed the next morning. Following the [[arrest of Jesus]], Peter denied knowing him three times, but after the third denial, heard the rooster crow and recalled the prediction as Jesus turned to look at him. Peter then began to cry bitterly.&lt;ref&gt;''Peter: apostle for the whole church'' by Pheme Perkins 2000 {{ISBN|0-567-08743-3}} page 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Gospel of John, Peter does not react to the rooster's crowing; unlike the Synoptics, he is not said to recall Jesus' prediction nor to  express regret about his denials.&lt;/ref&gt; This final incident is known as the '''Repentance of Peter'''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel according to Matthew, Volume 1'' by Johann Peter Lange 1865 Published by Charles Scribner Co, NY page 499&lt;/ref&gt;

The turbulent emotions behind Peter's denial and later repentance have been the subject of major works of art for centuries. Examples include [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[The Denial of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|Denial of Saint Peter]]'', which is now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. The incidents have also inspired segments in various films related to the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life]] and [[death of Jesus Christ]] (for instance, when [[Francesco De Vito]] performed as Peter in ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'') as well as references in musical works, both religious and secular.

[[File:Gerard van Honthorst - The Denial of St Peter - WGA11661.jpg|thumbnail|''The Denial of St Peter'' by [[Gerard van Honthorst]] (1622-24)]]

The prediction, made by Jesus during the [[Last Supper]] that Peter would deny and disown him, appears in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|26:33-35|NIV}}, the [[Gospel of Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:29-31|NIV}}, the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:33-34|NIV}} and the [[Gospel of John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|13:36-38|NIV}}. The denial accounts in the Gospels differ from each other.

According to the Gospel of Matthew:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will." "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "This very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2026:33-26:35&amp;version=NIV |title=Bible gateway Matthew 26:33-35 NIV |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later that night, Jesus was arrested. The first denial to a servant girl in {{bibleverse||Luke|22:54-57|NIV}} is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house. Peter followed at a distance and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him." But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2022:55-22:57&amp;version=NIV |title=Biblegateway Luke 22:55-57 NIV |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second denial to the same girl in {{bibleverse||Mark|14:69-70|NIV}} is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them." Again he denied it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%2014:69-14:70&amp;version=NIV |title=Biblegateway Mark 14:69-70 NIV |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The third denial to a number of people, is emphatic as he curses according to {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:73-75|NIV}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away." Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2026:73-26:75&amp;version=NIV |title=Biblegateway Matthew 26:73-75 NIV |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:59-62|NIV}} describes the moment of the last denial as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean." Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2022:59-22:62&amp;version=NIV |title=Biblegateway Luke 22:59-62 NIV |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Gospel of John {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:13-27|NIV}} describes the account of the three denials as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard, but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in. "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, "I am not." ... As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not." One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?" Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2018:13-18:27&amp;version=NIV |title=Biblegateway John 18:13-27 NIV |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the [[resurrection of Jesus]], the Gospel of John {{bibleverse-nb||John|21:15-17|NIV}} narrates how Jesus asked Peter three times if Peter loved him, pointing to the [[Restoration of Peter|rehabilitation of Peter]] following his repentance.&lt;ref&gt;''Repentance in Christian theology'' by Mark J. Boda, Gordon T. Smith 2006 {{ISBN|0-8146-5175-5}} page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and traditions==
[[File:Karel Dujardin - Denial of Peter.jpg|thumb|[[Karel Dujardin]] - ''Denial of Peter'']]

===Context===
For much of the period of three years that Jesus spent in ministry, gathering and teaching disciples, he had been observed, criticised and harassed by scholars and priests. His teachings were sometimes seen as heretical and his actions in gathering a group of disciples as possibly having political motivation. Jesus' capture and trials were the culmination of this antipathy.

Peter was one of the twelve disciples most closely associated with Jesus. His denials are made in the face of accusation that he was "with Jesus", the term indicating the bond of discipleship. The [[Gospel of Matthew]] states that Peter denied Jesus "in front of everyone", thus making a public witness, affirming this with an oath ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:72|NKJV}}). Throughout his Gospel, Matthew stresses the importance of public witness as an essential element of discipleship, stating in {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:32-33|NIV}}: "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven." Peter's denial is in direct conflict with the nature of discipleship, as described by Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;''The Passion and Resurrection narratives of Jesus: a commentary'' by Stephen J. Binz 1989 {{ISBN|0-8146-1771-9}} page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew has also previously reported Jesus' teaching forbidding the use of an oath:
:“Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord’. But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one. ({{bibleverse||Matthew|5:33-37|NKJV}})

The New Testament descriptions of Peter's denial depict the drama of the incident. Peter's antagonists in the discussion of his discipleship progress from a maid, to a maid plus a bystander, to a whole crowd. His denial progresses from a plea of ignorance, to a denial plus an [[oath]] and then to cursing and swearing with a total denial that he ever knew Jesus. The sound of the rooster then brings a shock to Peter that Jesus had predicted the three denials.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament'' by Robert J. Karris 1992 {{ISBN|0-8146-2211-9}} page 900&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode has been seen as an incident that sheds light on the unique role of Peter and sets him apart from the other disciples, just as in the [[Gospel of Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|16:7|NIV}} in which the angel tells the women to "go and tell his disciples and Peter" about the [[resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Peter: apostle for the whole church'' by Pheme Perkins 2000 {{ISBN|0-567-08743-3}} page 65&lt;/ref&gt; In this episode, as often elsewhere in the Gospel of Mark, Peter acts as the focus of the apostles, and an essential Christological image is presented: the denials of Peter contrast with the frank confessions of Jesus in [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|his trial by the Sanhedrin]], portraying his faithfulness as prophet, Son and Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;''Prophet, Son, Messiah: narrative form and function in Mark 14-16'' by Edwin Keith Broadhead 1994 {{ISBN|1-85075-476-4}} page 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The triple denial of Peter is the impetus for the three repetitive questions made by Jesus to Peter at the [[Sea of Galilee]] after His resurrection, "Simon, son of John, Do you love me?"  Although originally interpreted by Peter as a rebuke for his three denials (also due to the use by Jesus of his old name "Simon"), this event became later viewed as a redemptive act by Jesus, allowing Peter to publicly declare in front of his fellow disciples that he truly did love his Lord and thus become fully restored to his faith community. ({{bibleverse||John|21:15-17|NIV}}).

The triple denial is also echoed in Peter's triple refusal to eat the animals when he has a [[Peter's vision of a sheet with animals|vision of a sheet with animals]] in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 10.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Witherington III|Ben Witherington]], ''The Acts of the Apostles: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2P7zSnM9BjMC&amp;pg=PA350 350].&lt;/ref&gt;

The three 'denials' are also present in a gnostic source, the Apocalypse of Peter from [[Nag Hammadi]], but the roles are reversed in the context of meditation and seeing inner vision of the Master. In the gnostic Apocalypse of Peter, Jesus denies Peter "three times in this night" as not ready for inner sight, 72,5. Both details of "three times" denied and "in this night" being present suggests a relationship to the canonical portrayal of The Denial of Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/apopet.html |title=The Apocalypse of Peter - The Nag Hammadi Library |publisher=Gnosis.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prayers and traditions===

Bishop [[Lancelot Andrewes]] composed the following prayer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
O Lord Jesus Christ, look upon us with those eyes of thine where-with thou dist look upon Peter in the hall; that with Peter we may repent and, by the same love be forgiven; for  thine
mercy's sake. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;''Prayers for People Under Pressure'' by Jonathan Aitken 2006 {{ISBN|0-8264-8275-9}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Referring to the tears shed by Peter during his repentance in the context of the [[Sacrament of Penance]], [[Saint Ambrose]] said "in the Church, there are water and tears: the water of Baptism and the tears of repentance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c2a4.htm |title=Vatican website, Catechism item 1429 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, "tears of repentance", as exemplified by Peter, have become a symbol both of mourning and comfort: a sign at once of sins repented and forgiveness sought.&lt;ref&gt;''Repentance in Christian theology'' by Mark J. Boda, Gordon T. Smith 2006 {{ISBN|0-8146-5175-5}} page 223&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Scriptural Way of the Cross]] introduced in 1991 by Pope [[John Paul II]] as a version of the [[Stations of the Cross]], and performed each [[Good Friday]] at the [[Colosseum]] in Rome, the fourth station is the ''Denial of Peter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2007/via_crucis/en/station_04.html |title=Vatican website Fourth Station: Jesus is denied by Peter |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Holy week]] in Jerusalem, vigils at times stop at a location traditionally considered the location for the ''Repentance of Peter'', not far from the house of the high priest [[Caiaphas]], involved in the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;''The week of salvation: history and traditions of Holy Week'' by James Monti {{ISBN|0-87973-532-5}} page 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art and music==
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 012.jpg|thumbnail|[[Rembrandt]]: ''Denial of Peter'']]
The episode has been the subject of works of art for centuries. It has also been dramatized in musical settings of the Passion story.  It has been depicted in a varieties of mediums and methods, ranging from 6th century [[mosaic]] at the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] to Russian icons and oil paintings by many [[old master]]s.  The subject was sometimes included in cycles of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' or the ''[[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]'', often as the only scene not to include the figure of Christ.

In [[Rembrandt]]'s depiction, now in the [[Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam]], he presents the servant girl who recognizes Peter with a candle, illuminating Peter's face. Two soldiers look with suspicion as Peter speaks, while Jesus is shown in the distance, his hands bound behind him, turning to look at Peter. Peter's faces away from Jesus, and he gestures with his left hand, although his expression is free of defiance.&lt;ref name=Durham163 &gt;''The Biblical Rembrandt'' by John I. Durham 2004 {{ISBN|0-86554-886-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[The Denial of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|Denial of Saint Peter]]'' is now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York. Author George Weatherhead admires Caravaggio's depiction, the way Peter exhibits a wavering trepidation in his unsteady features, conscious of the unworthy falsehood he was telling. His lips quiver and his eyes seek, yet can not find the firmness of truth.&lt;ref&gt;''A pedestrian tour through France and Italy'' by George Hume Weatherhead 2009 {{ISBN|1-150-13941-2}} page 232&lt;/ref&gt; In this painting, Caravaggio portrayed the servant girl using the same head of the woman that he used in his depiction of ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Caravaggio: the art of realism'' by John L. Varriano 2006 {{ISBN|0-271-02717-7}} page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

A related subject, the Repentance of Peter, showing the end of the episode, was not often seen before [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation art]], where it became popular as an assertion of the [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] against Protestant attacks.  This  followed an influential book by the [[Jesuit]] Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine]] (1542–1621). The image typically shows Peter in tears, as a half-length portrait with no other figures, often with hands clasped as at right, and sometimes the cock in the background; it was often coupled with a repentant [[Mary Magdalen]], another exemplar from Bellarmine's book.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, pp. 10 and 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The Passion story has been set in music by numerous composers.  The episode of Peter's denial is conveyed with great poignancy by [[J.S.Bach]] in both the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' and the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1D3CM2vmeA ''St John Passion'']. John Eliot Gardiner (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;365) says "Inevitably we suffer with Peter; but the uncomfortable question Bach asks us to consider is, would any of us have emerged from his ordeal with greater credit?.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, J. E. (2013) ''Music in the Castle of Heaven: a Portrait of Joann Sebastian Bach''. London, Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the band [[Thrice]] wrote a cinematic piece called Like Moth to Flames, with the lyrics written from the point of view of Peter.

=== ''Song of Remorse – St. Peter's Denial of Jesus Three Times'' ===

[https://vimeo.com/jamesralphboyd James Ralph Boyd] of Los Angeles, California, in 2016 composed [https://vimeo.com/255134731 "A Song of Remorse - St. Peter's Denial of Jesus Three Times,"] which is depicted in HD video.  Mr. Boyd's vocal rendition is syncopated with piano arpeggios that gradually ascend various octaves, juxtaposed with cellos and a solo violin.  The lyrics are based on the [http://www.usccb.org/bible/luke/22 Gospel of St. Luke 22:31-34], "Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat. . ."&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/255134731&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSrPB39VPHQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FIRST LEGO League Jr.''' ('''FLL Jr.''') is a non-competitive [[robotics]] program designed for children ages six to ten. It is one of the programs established by [[FIRST]].

FIRST LEGO League Jr. follows the same theme given to [[FIRST LEGO League]]. While FIRST LEGO League Jr. teams conduct research projects and design autonomous robots specifically to carry out missions relating to the topic, FIRST LEGO League Jr. teams conduct much smaller projects and makes models out of [[LEGO]] elements to illustrate one part of the theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/jfll The Junior FIRST LEGO League], FIRST - accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They may also use LEGO WeDo, a programmable robotics kit, as part of their models.

Currently, the program is available in 33 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juniorfirstlegoleague.org/countries FIRST LEGO League Jr. Country List] - accessed January 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
FIRST LEGO League Jr. League started out as a pilot program in 2004 to encourage young children to have interest in science and engineering. In the first pilot year, the teams were provided with some specific LEGO parts by FIRST, but that idea was dropped in later years. Teams now use any LEGO elements that they have to build the models. The pilot years were done in three phases from 2004 to 2006. The program was officially launched in 2007 during the Power Puzzle season.

During the first five years, the program was not referred as a robotic program. The only requirements to build models out of LEGO elements were to have some moving parts and include at least one [[simple machine]] based on a given topic of that year. FIRST has provided an option to purchase a FIRST LEGO League Jr. Base Kit that contains many LEGO elements including [[gear]]s, [[Electric motor|motor]], and other [[Lego Technic|TECHNIC elements]]. In 2009, with the new robotics kit by [[LEGO Group]], the program included LEGO WeDo as an optional kit&lt;ref name="eventguide"&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/Jr.FLL_2009_Event_Guide.pdf Junior FIRST LEGO League Event Guide], FIRST - accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which allows children to connect a motor and/or a [[sensor]] to other LEGO bricks, gears and other TECHNIC elements. It also has [[drag-and-drop]] programming interface for children to write robotics programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lego.com/education/school/default.asp?locale=2057&amp;pagename=WD_Con WeDo Concept], LEGO Education - accessed December 23, 3009&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of participants has been increasing each year.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/jfll/content.aspx?id=14112 Impact], FIRST - accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the program was limited to the United States and Canada until 2009.

==Program details==
FIRST LEGO League Jr. is designed to be a non-competitive and community-based program. The teams are formed within local community and participate in local events. FIRST provides guidelines to help coaches to run their teams and local organizers to run FIRST LEGO League Jr. events. However, FIRST does not organize any FIRST LEGO League Jr. event, unlike other FIRST programs.

The program is designed to be flexible; there are no specific dates for the program. Each team may decide when to start the activities and for how long as long as the registration is done within the season calendar which is from August to June each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/jfll/content.aspx?id=12964 2009 Jr.FLL Smart Move Season Schedule], FIRST - accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A team consists of 2-6 team members. There is an age limit that team members must not be older than 9 as of January 1 of the year the Challenge is released. Although there is no lower bound on age, FIRST suggests that the program is intended for children 6 or older.

After registering a team, the coach guides students to do research by following the Challenge guideline. The team may have a [[field trip]] or visit experts to help children to learn more about the topic. Children will then work on their "Show Me" [[poster]] and LEGO models to demonstrate their findings according to the instructions in the Challenge. The team may choose to use any LEGO parts that they have at home to construct their models. Optionally, the team may purchase FIRST LEGO League Jr. Base Kit or LEGO WeDo Kit to use.&lt;ref name ="coachguide"&gt;[https://wiki.ornl.gov/events/tennfll/jrfll/Shared%20Documents/JrFLL_Coach_Man.pdf Junior FIRST LEGO League (Jr.FLL) Coaches’ Guide] - accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kits"&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/jfll/content.aspx?id=13142 Products and Pricing], FIRST - accessed December 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
The FIRST LEGO League Jr. challenges align with the research project portion of FIRST LEGO League .&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="challengehist"&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/content.aspx?id=880 Junior FIRST LEGO League - Challenge History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606161827/http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/content.aspx?id=880 |date=2011-06-06 }}, FIRST - accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

===Concept===
The program encourages teams to go out and tell their story to others after they have completed the poster and the models. They may participate in one of the well-established FIRST LEGO League Jr. events, which are typically part of FIRST LEGO League tournaments run by independent FIRST LEGO League partners. Most of these events are called '''''''FIRST LEGO League Jr.''' Expos''''.&lt;ref name="teamsandevents"&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/whatsgoingon.aspx What Events And Teams Are In My Area?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606155324/http://www.usfirst.org/whatsgoingon.aspx |date=2011-06-06 }}, FIRST - accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, they may host their own event in the neighborhood or at school to showcase their accomplishment.

At the FIRST LEGO League Jr. event, there will be "Reviewers" (the judges) to ask children some questions about what they have learned. They may be asked details about the project and the models that they built. The FIRST LEGO League Jr.concept is that everyone is a winner, therefore, the event organizers are recommended to give an award to each team that participates in the event.

===Awards===
The organizers can create any list of awards. Below is the list of awards suggested by FIRST:&lt;ref name="eventguide"/&gt;
:* Amazing Movement Award
:* Gracious Professionalism Award
:* Against All Odds Award
:* Effort and Learning Award
:* Complexity and Decoration Award
:* Most Explosive Award
:* Robust Design Award
:* Construction Innovation Award
:* Team Spirit Award
:* Teamwork Award
:* Inquiring Minds

===Notable events===
{{update|section|reason=First State FLL is no longer at the BCC|date=January 2015}}
Since the inception of the program, FIRST LEGO League Jr. events have been held by local organizers or official FIRST LEGO League partners in the participating countries, but not by FIRST organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/JrFLL/Events/Jr%20FLL%20Event%20Guide%202011.pdf Event Guide], ''FIRST'' - accessed March 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Recently,{{when|date=January 2015}} FIRST has held an annual event called ''''FIRST LEGO League Jr. World Festival Expo'''' each year in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] as part of the [[FIRST Championship]], but the program is still relies on almost one hundred events of local organizers throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/whatsgoingon What Events And Teams Are In My Area?], ''FIRST'' - accessed March 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Floyd Collins''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Adam Guettel]], and book by [[Tina Landau]]. The story is based on the death of [[Floyd Collins]] near [[Cave City, Kentucky]] in the winter of 1925. The musical opened [[Off-Broadway]] on February 9, 1996, where it ran for 25 performances. There have been subsequent London productions as well as regional U.S. productions.

==Productions==
''Floyd Collins'' premiered at the [[American Music Theater Festival]], in [[Philadelphia]], in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Pareles, Jon.[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?pagewanted=print&amp;res=9804E2D61731F93BA25757C0A962958260 "Review:Dreamers and Exploiters in a Slice of Americana",]''The New York Times'', April 18, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The show opened [[Off-Broadway]] at [[Playwrights Horizons]], New York City, on February 9, 1996 and closed on March 24, 1996 after 25 performances.

==Plot summary==
As originally written, the character list included Floyd Collins, Homer Collins, Nellie Collins, and Johnnie Gerald; as rewritten the role of Johnnie Gerald was merged with that of Homer Collins.  As currently performed, the roles include Bee Doyle, Dr Hazlett, three reporters, a Con Man, Lee Collins, Homer Collins, Floyd Collins, Clif Rony, Jewlle Estes, Nellie Collins, Skeets Miller, Miss Jane, H. T. Carmichael and Ed Bishop.

Floyd Collins, exploring [[Sand Cave]], uses the echoes of his voice to sound out the region, and falls through a tight passageway when his foot became trapped, wedged in position by a small rock. His family and his fellow cavers try to free him; when it becomes clear that his rescue will not be easy, his brother Homer spends the night in the cave with him. William Burke "Skeets" Miller, a small man, is able to squeeze through and visit with Floyd, relaying stories which were printed in the news.
Despite efforts by miners, the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] and the [[Red Cross]], attempts at rescue fail, and the crowd grows outside the cave as a media circus ensues.

Seventeen days after Floyd had entered the cave, a shaft finally reaches him. He had died three days earlier.

The play's musical style is drawn from [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[Americana (music)|Americana]], and "more complex musical forms that have their antecedents in the likes of Bartok, Janacek and Stravinsky".&lt;ref name=aisle&gt;Spencer, David.[http://www.aislesay.com/NY-FLOYD-COLLINS.html "Floyd Collins review"], aislesay.com, accessed February 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
Despite having a run of only 25 performances, the show left a strong impression on contemporary theatre. [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]], writing for ''New York Magazine'', proclaimed that Floyd Collins was "''the'' original and daring musical of our day." He also wrote that "Floyd Collins reestablishes America's sovereignty in a genre it created, but has since lost hold of: it is the modern musical's true and exhilarating ace in the hole."&lt;ref&gt;Original review republished in ''John Simon on Theater: Criticism, 1974-2003'', 641-43 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' wrote that "Mr. Guettel establishes himself as a young composer of strength and sophistication."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&amp;tols_title=FLOYD%20COLLINS%20(PLAY)&amp;byline=By%20BEN%20BRANTLEY&amp;pdate=19960304&amp;id=1077011429982 "Theater Review:Carnival Above Ground, Tragedy Below",]''The New York Times'', March 4, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
The original cast recording was released on [[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]] on March 18, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Floyd-Collins-1996-Original-Off-Broadway/dp/B000005J4F "Floyd Collins" listing] amazon.com, accessed February 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Soviet Union}}

The '''Great Purge''' or the '''Great Terror''' was a campaign of [[political repression in the Soviet Union]] which occurred from 1936 to 1938.{{sfn|Gellately|2007}} It involved a large-scale [[purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|purge of the Communist Party and government officials]], repression of [[kulak|wealthy landlords]] and the [[Red Army]] leadership, widespread police surveillance, suspicion of saboteurs, counter-revolutionaries, imprisonment, and arbitrary executions.{{sfn|Figes|2007|pp=227–315}} In Russian historiography, the period of the most intense purge, 1937–1938, is called '''''Yezhovshchina''''' (literally, "Yezhov phenomenon",&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to the dictionary (Т.Ф. Ефремова Новый словарь русского языка. Толково- словообразовательный), the suffix ''-shchina'' in this case produces a word which refers to some kind of phenomenon associated with the word to which the suffix is attached. Quote: "'''1.''' Словообразовательная единица, образующая имена существительные женского рода, которые обозначают бытовое или общественное явление, идейное или политическое течение, характеризующееся признаком, названным &lt;...&gt;"

Etnopsyholingvisticke predpoklady slovensko-ruskych a rusko-slovenskych porovnavani, Presov, 2003) comparing Russian and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] languages, points out that in Russian the suffix ''-shchina'' (in meaning 1 given by Efremova) most commonly bears openly negative or derisive connotations.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly translated as "times of Yezhov" or "doings of Yezhov"), after [[Nikolai Yezhov]], the head of the [[Soviet secret police]], the [[NKVD]], who was executed a year after the purge.

In the Western world, [[Robert Conquest]]'s 1968 book ''[[The Great Terror]]'' popularized that phrase.

==Introduction==
[[File:NKVD Order No. 00447.jpg|thumb|Excerpt of [[NKVD Order No. 00447]]]]
[[File:Great Purge Resolution of Central Committee.jpg|thumb|A list from the Great Purge signed by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]], [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], [[Anastas Mikoyan|Mikoyan]], and [[Vlas Chubar|Chubar]].]]

The term "repression" was officially used to describe the prosecution of people considered [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]] and [[enemies of the people]] by the leadership of the [[Soviet Union]] at the time, [[Joseph Stalin]]. The purge was motivated by the desire to remove dissenters from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and to consolidate the authority of Stalin. Most public attention was focused on the [[purge (communist)|purge]] of certain parts of the leadership of the Communist Party, as well as of government bureaucrats and leaders of the armed forces, most of whom were Party members. The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as "too rich for a peasant" ([[kulak]]s), and professionals.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|pp=250,&amp;nbsp;257–8}} A series of NKVD operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being "[[fifth column]]" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, by the [[Polish Military Organisation]] and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary [[Poles in the former Soviet Union|Soviet citizens of Polish origin]].

According to [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 speech, "[[On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences]]," and Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow show trial]]s, were based on [[forced confession]]s, often obtained through [[torture]],{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=121 which cites his secret speech}} and on loose interpretations of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by [[NKVD troika]]s.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=286}}

Hundreds of thousands of victims were accused of various political crimes (espionage, [[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]], [[sabotage]], [[anti-Soviet agitation]], conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups); they were quickly executed by shooting, or sent to the [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s. Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. Some secret policemen, for example, gassed people to death in batches in the back of a [[Gas van|specially adapted airtight van]].{{sfn|Merridale|2002|p=200}}{{sfn|Colton|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lXM2H6tWHskC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=gas+chamber+butovo 286]}}

The Great Purge began under NKVD chief [[Genrikh Yagoda]], but reached its peak between September 1936 and August 1938 under the leadership of [[Nikolai Yezhov]], hence the name ''Yezhovshchina''. The campaigns were carried out according to the [[general line (party)|general line]], often by direct orders of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Politburo]] headed by Stalin.

==Background==
{{see also|Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
From 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the "social disorder" caused by the upheavals of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization of peasants]] and the resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933|famine of 1932–1933]], as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin's perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical "fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies." (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003).&lt;ref name=werth/&gt;

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leon Trotsky]], in 1929, shortly before being driven out of the Soviet Union.]]
The term "[[purge]]" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression ''purge of the Party ranks''. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.

The political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], respectively. Following the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the "temporary" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The [[Ryutin Affair]] seemed to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending [[democratic centralism]].

In the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious "old guard" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and [[Béla Kun]], as well as the majority of Lenin's Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these "heretical" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky's family before [[Leon Trotsky#Assassination|killing]] him in Mexico; the NKVD agent [[Ramón Mercader]] was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], under the personal orders of Stalin.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|2000|pp=86–7}}

[[Image:Sergei Kirov and Joseph Stalin, 1934.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] party leader [[Sergey Kirov|Sergei Kirov]] with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] (and his daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]) in 1934.]]
In 1934, Stalin used the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]] as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see {{section link||Number of people executed}}). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122–38}} Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|1934 Party Congress]] elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov's assassination, the NKVD charged the former oppositionists, an ever-growing group according to their determination, with Kirov's murder as well as a growing list of other offences, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.

Another justification for the purge was to remove any possible "fifth column" in case of a war. [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Lazar Kaganovich]], participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=239}} Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan. The Soviet press portrayed the country as threatened from within by fascist spies.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122–38}}
From the [[October Revolution]]{{sfn|Gellately|2007}} onward,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gellately, ''Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'', 2007, Knopf, 720 pages. {{ISBN|1-4000-4005-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin had used repression against perceived enemies of the Bolsheviks as a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating social control, especially during the campaign commonly referred to as the [[Red Terror]]. This policy continued and intensified under Stalin, periods of heightened repression including the [[Dekulakization|deportation of kulaks]] who opposed collectivization, and a severe famine in Ukraine. A distinctive feature of the Great Purge was that, for the first time, members of the ruling party were included on a massive scale as victims of the repression. Due to the scale of the terror, the substantial victims of the purges were Communist Party members and office-holders.{{sfn|McLoughlin|McDermott|2002|p=6}} The purge of the Party was accompanied by the purge of the whole society. The following events are used for the demarcation of the period.

*The first Moscow Trial, 1936.
*1937, introduction of NKVD troikas for implementation of "revolutionary justice".
*1937, passage of Article 58-14 about "counter-revolutionary sabotage".

==Moscow Trials==
{{Main|Moscow Trials}}

===First and Second Moscow Trials===
[[File:Л. Д. Троцкий, Л. Б. Каменев и Г. Е. Зиновьев. Середина 1920-х годов.jpg|thumb|right|Bolshevik revolutionaries [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]]]]

Between 1936 and 1938, three very large Moscow Trials of former senior Communist Party leaders were held, in which they were accused of conspiring with fascist and capitalist powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.

*The first trial was of 16 members of the so-called "Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary Bloc",{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} held in August 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin (1998), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; at which the chief defendants were [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], two of the most prominent former party leaders. Among other accusations, they were incriminated with the assassination of Kirov and plotting to kill Stalin.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} After confessing to the charges, all were sentenced to death and executed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rogovin (1998), pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt;
*The second trial in January 1937 involved 17 lesser figures known as the "anti-Soviet Trotskyite-centre" which included [[Karl Radek]], [[Yuri Piatakov]] and [[Grigory Sokolnikov]], and were accused of plotting with Trotsky, who was said to be conspiring with Germany. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died.
*There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in June 1937.

[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|Prosecutor General [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against [[Karl Radek]] during the 2nd [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]]]]
Some Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament [[D.N. Pritt]], for example, wrote: "Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties", but "once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted".

It is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former [[OGPU]] officer [[Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]] and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.

Zinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for "confessing", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the "commission" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=87}}

====Dewey Commission====
[[File:Vassily Blokhin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The chief executioner of the NKVD, [[Vasili Blokhin]], carried out some of the high-profile executions during the purges.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]]. ''Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin.'' [[Basic Books]], 2010. {{ISBN|0-465-00239-0}} p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In May 1937, the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials, commonly known as the [[Dewey Commission]], was set up in the United States by supporters of Trotsky, to establish the truth about the trials. The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]]. Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=137}}

For example, [[Georgy Pyatakov]] testified that he had flown to [[Oslo]] in December 1935 to "receive terrorist instructions" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Not guilty : report of the Commission of Inquiry Into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials|last=Dewey|first=John|date=|publisher=Sam Sloan and Ishi Press International|others=1859-1952|year=2008|isbn=0923891315|location=New York|pages=154–155|oclc=843206645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another defendant, [[Ivan N. Smirnov|Ivan Smirnov]], confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.

The Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled ''Not Guilty''. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote: "Independent of extrinsic evidence, the Commission finds:
*That the conduct of the Moscow Trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no attempt was made to ascertain the truth.
*That while confessions are necessarily entitled to the most serious consideration, the confessions themselves contain such inherent improbabilities as to convince the Commission that they do not represent the truth, irrespective of any means used to obtain them.
*That Trotsky never instructed any of the accused or witnesses in the Moscow trials to enter into agreements with foreign powers against the Soviet Union [and] that Trotsky never recommended, plotted, or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.

The commission concluded: "We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups."

====Implication of the Rightists====
In the second trial, Karl Radek provided (or more accurately was forced to provide){{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} the pretext for greater purge to come on a massive scale with his testimony that there was a "third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, 6 February 1937&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help."{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=164}}

By the "third organization", he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the [[Right Opposition|Rightists]], led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:

{{quote|I feel guilty of one thing more: even after admitting my guilt and exposing the organisation, I stubbornly refused to give evidence about Bukharin. I knew that Bukharin's situation was just as hopeless as my own, because our guilt, if not juridically, then in essence, was the same. But we are close friends, and intellectual friendship is stronger than other friendships. I knew that Bukharin was in the same state of upheaval as myself. That is why I did not want to deliver him bound hand and foot to the People's Commissariat of Home Affairs. Just as in relation to our other cadres, I wanted Bukharin himself to lay down his arms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

===Third Moscow Trial===
[[File:1934 agranov yagoda unknown redens.jpg|thumb|NKVD chiefs responsible for conducting mass repressions: [[Yakov Agranov]], [[Genrikh Yagoda]], [[Stanislav Redens]]. All three were themselves eventually arrested and executed]]
The third and final trial, in March 1938, known as [[The Trial of the Twenty-One]], is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called "Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites", led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the [[Communist International]], former premier [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] and [[Genrikh Yagoda]], recently disgraced head of the NKVD.

The fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder [[Maxim Gorky]] by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges.

Even previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it harder to swallow these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing.&lt;ref name="Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96"&gt;Corey Robin, "Fear", Page 96&lt;/ref&gt; For some prominent communists such as [[Bertram Wolfe]], [[Jay Lovestone]], [[Arthur Koestler]], and [[Heinrich Brandler]], the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-Communists eventually.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram David Wolfe, "Breaking with communism", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Koestler|1940|p=258}} To them, Bukharin's confession symbolized the
depredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.&lt;ref name="Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96"/&gt;

The preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov.

====Bukharin's confession====
[[File:Bucharin.bra.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Nikolai Bukharin]], Russian [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] executed in 1938]]
On the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after "special measures", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=352}}

[[Anastas Mikoyan]] and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order, "beating permitted," and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the "star" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with "methods of physical influence" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=364–5}}

Bukharin's confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and philosophical essay by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in ''Humanism and Terror''. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to "sum total of crimes", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.

The result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a "degenerate fascist" working for "restoration of capitalism") and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him, one observer noted that Bukharin "proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case."&lt;ref&gt;Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No.141, Moscow, 21 March 1938&lt;/ref&gt; He continued by saying that "the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence" in a trial that was solely based on confessions, he finished his last plea with the words: "the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tucker, "Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet "Block of Rights and Trotskyites", Pg.667–68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Romain Rolland]] and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in [[Medvedev Forest massacre|NKVD prisoner massacres]] in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, [[Anna Larina]], was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.

==Purge of the army==
{{Further|Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization}}
[[File:5marshals 01.jpg|thumb|left|The first five [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshals of the Soviet Union]] in November 1935. (l-r): [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Semyon Budyonny]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Vasily Blyukher]], [[Alexander Ilyich Yegorov|Aleksandr Yegorov]]. Only Voroshilov and Budyonny survived the Great Purge.]]
The purge of the [[Red Army]] and [[Soviet Navy|Military Maritime Fleet]] removed three of five [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|marshals]] (then equivalent to five-star generals), 13 of 15 army commanders (then equivalent to three- and four-star generals), eight of nine admirals (the purge fell heavily on the Navy, who were suspected of exploiting their opportunities for foreign contacts),{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=211}} 50 of 57 army [[corps]] commanders, 154 out of 186 division commanders, 16 of 16 army [[commissar]]s, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.{{sfn|Courtois|1999|p=198}}

At first it was thought 25–50% of Red Army officers had been purged; the true figure is now known to be in the area of 3.7–7.7%. This discrepancy was the result of a systematic underestimation of the true size of the Red Army officer corps, and it was overlooked that most of those purged were merely expelled from the Party. Thirty percent of officers purged in 1937–39 were allowed to return to service.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lee, ''European Dictatorships 1918–1945,'' page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purge of the army was claimed to be supported by German-forged documents (said to have been correspondence between Marshal Tukhachevsky and members of the German high command).{{sfn|Conquest|2008|pp=198–9 (a Soviet book, ''Marshal Tukhachevskiy'' by Nikulin, pp.&amp;nbsp;189–94 is cited)}} The claim is unsupported by facts, as by the time the documents were supposedly created, two people from the eight in the Tukhachevsky group were already imprisoned, and by the time the document was said to reach Stalin the purging process was already underway. &lt;!--Cleansing (Очищение) Victor Suvorov''--&gt; However the actual evidence introduced at trial was obtained from forced confessions.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=200–2}}

==The wider purge==
Eventually almost all of the Bolsheviks who had played prominent roles during the Russian Revolution of 1917, or in Lenin's Soviet government, were executed. Out of six members of the original Politburo during the 1917 October Revolution who lived until the Great Purge, Stalin himself was the only one who remained in the Soviet Union, alive.{{sfn|Gellately|2007}} Four of the other five were executed. The fifth, Leon Trotsky, had been forced into exile outside the Soviet Union in 1929, but was assassinated in Mexico by Soviet agent [[Ramón Mercader]] in 1940. Of the seven members elected to the Politburo between the October Revolution and Lenin's death in 1924, four were executed, one ([[Mikhail Tomsky|Tomsky]]) committed suicide and two (Molotov and [[Mikhail Kalinin|Kalinin]]) lived.

However, the trials and executions of the former Bolshevik leaders, while being the most visible part, were only a minor part of the purges. A series of documents discovered in the Central Committee archives in 1992 by [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] demonstrate that there were quotas for arrests and executions as for all other activities in the planned economy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/an-execution-quota/ The Bukovsky Archives, "A Quota for Killings".]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Poet [[Osip Mandelstam]] was arrested for reciting his famous anti-Stalin poem [[Stalin Epigram]] to his circle of friends in 1934. After intervention by Nikolai Bukharin and [[Boris Pasternak]] (Stalin jotted down in Bukharin's letter with feigned indignation: "Who gave them the right to arrest Mandelstam?"), Stalin instructed NKVD to "isolate but preserve" him, and Mandelstam was "merely" exiled to [[Cherdyn, Perm Krai|Cherdyn]] for three years, but this proved to be a temporary reprieve. In May 1938, he was promptly arrested again for "counter-revolutionary activities".&lt;ref name="poemhunter"&gt;N.N.: '' [http://www.poemhunter.com/osip-emilevich-mandelstam/biography/ Osip Emilevich Mandelstam]'', PoemHunter.com.

* Writer [[Isaac Babel]] was arrested in May 1939, and according to his confession paper (which contained a blood stain) he "confessed" to being a member of Trotskyist organization and being recruited by French writer [[André Malraux]] to spy for France. In the final interrogation, he retracted his confession and wrote letters to the prosecutor's office stating that he had implicated innocent people, but to no avail. Babel was tried before an NKVD troika and convicted of simultaneously spying for the French, Austrians and Trotsky, as well as "membership in a terrorist organization." On 27 January 1940, he was shot in [[Butyrka prison]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;The Independent, "The History of Hell", 8 January 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next few days, when those parts of my legs were covered with extensive internal hemorrhaging, they again beat the red-blue-and-yellow bruises with the strap and the pain was so intense that it felt as if boiling water was being poured on these sensitive areas. I howled and wept from the pain. I incriminated myself in the hope that by telling them lies I could end the ordeal. When I lay down on the cot and fell asleep, after 18 hours of interrogation, in order to go back in an hour's time for more, I was woken up by my own groaning and because I was jerking about like a patient in the last stages of typhoid fever.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Georgian poet [[Titsian Tabidze]] was arrested on 10 October 1937 on a charge of treason and was tortured in prison.

* In early 1937, poet [[Pavel Nikolayevich Vasiliev]] is said to have defended Nikolai Bukharin as "a man of the highest nobility and the conscience of peasant Russia" at the time of his denunciation at the Pyatakov Trial (Second Moscow Trial) and damned other writers then signing the routine condemnations as "pornographic scrawls on the margins of Russian literature". He was promptly shot on 16 July 1937.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=301}}
* [[Jan Sten]], philosopher and deputy head of the Marx-Engels Institute, was Stalin's private tutor when Stalin was trying hard to study Hegel's [[dialectic]]. (Stalin received lessons twice a week from 1925 to 1928, but he found it difficult to master even some of the basic ideas. Stalin developed enduring hostility toward German idealistic philosophy, which he called "the aristocratic reaction to the French Revolution".) In 1937, Sten was seized on the direct order of Stalin, who declared him one of the chiefs of "[[Mensheviks|Menshevi]]zing idealists". On 19 June 1937, Sten was put to death in [[Lefortovo prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy Medvedev, "Let history judge", p. 438&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ukrainian drama writer [[Mykola Kulish]] was executed on 3 November 1937. He is considered to be one of the lead figures of [[Executed Renaissance]].

===Ex-kulaks and other "anti-Soviet elements"===
On 2 July 1937, Stalin sent a top-secret letter to all regional Party chiefs (with a copy to NKVD regional chiefs) ordering them to present, within five days, estimates of the number of kulaks and "criminals" that should be arrested, executed, or sent to camps. Produced in a matter of days, these figures roughly matched those of "suspect" individuals already under police surveillance, although the criteria used to distribute the "kulak and criminal elements" among the two categories are not clear.

On 30 July 1937 the [[NKVD Order no. 00447]] was issued, directed against "ex-kulaks" and other "anti-Soviet elements" (such as former officials of the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist regime]], former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.

The following categories were systematically tracked down: "ex-kulaks" previously deported to "[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]" in inhospitable parts of the country ([[Siberia]], [[Urals]], Kazakhstan, [[Extreme North (Russia)|Far North]]), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the [[White Army]], participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other "socially harmful elements". However, many were also arrested at random in police sweeps, or as a result of denunciations or simply because they happened to be relatives, friends or just acquaintances of people already arrested. Many railwaymen, workers, kolkhoz peasants, and engineers were arrested in the course of the Kulak Operation just because they had the misfortune of working in, or near, important strategic factories, railway or building sites, where, as a result of frantic rhythms and plans, many work accidents had occurred in previous years. In 1937–1938, the NKVD reopened these cases and systematically ascribed them to "sabotage" or "wrecking" (Werth, 2009).
[[File:Evgeny Miller1.png|170px|thumb|[[Yevgeny Miller|Yevgeny-Ludvig Karlovich Miller]], one of the remaining leaders of the White movement, was kidnapped by the NKVD in 1937 and executed 19 months later.]]
The [[Russian Orthodox Church|orthodox clergy]], including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called "special settlers" (spetzpereselentsy) who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential "enemies" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.

One "sub-operation" targeted "the most vicious and stubborn anti-Soviet elements" in Gulag prison camps; they were all "to be put into the first category" – that is shot. Order no. 00447 decreed 10,000 executions for this contingent, but at least three times more were shot in the course of the secret mass operation, the majority in March–April 1938 (Junge and Binner, 2003).

As soon as the Kulak Operation was launched (5 August 1937), regional party and NKVD bosses, eager to show their zeal, demanded an increase in the quotas. Accordingly, the quotas were increased. But this was not only the result of demands from below. The largest new allowances were distributed by Stalin and Yezhov on their own initiative: on 15 October 1937, for example, the Politburo passed a secret resolution increasing the number of people "to be repressed" by 120,000 (63,000 "in the first category" and 57,000 "in the second category"); on 31 January 1938, Stalin ordered a further increase of 57,200, 48,000 of whom were to be executed.

[[File:RIAN archive 910794 Memorial events in Bykovnya Graves reserve.jpg|thumb|Memorial events in Bykovnya Graves reserve.]]
The police organized sweeps and round-ups of markets or railway stations where marginals and other social outcasts were likely to be found. To carry out a growing number of arrests, the State Security personnel of NKVD – approximately 25,000 officers – were supplemented by ordinary policemen, sometimes by civilian Party or [[Komsomol]] ([[Young Communist League]]) members.

Every NKVD local unit had a "casework minimum" of arrests to perform, and also of confessions to extract to "unmask conspiracies." The NKVD used uninterrupted interrogation for days on end and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged "counter-revolutionary" crimes. To speed up the procedure, prisoners were often even forced to sign blank pages of the pre-printed interrogation folios on which the interrogator later typed up the confession.

After the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused. During a half-day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in a secluded area run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=2-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n° 00447 (August 1937 – November 1938)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=3-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n° 00447 (August 1937 – November 1938)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kulak Operation was largest single campaign of repression in 1937–38, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed, more than half the total of known executions.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sge44FaZDREC&amp;pg=PA240 240]}}

===Campaigns targeting nationalities===
[[File:Kosior S..jpg|thumb|170px|[[Poland|Polish]]-born Soviet politician [[Stanislav Kosior]], a contributor to the [[Holodomor|1932-33 famine in Ukraine]], was executed in 1939.]]
A series of [[mass operations of the NKVD]] was carried out from 1937 through 1938 until the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939 targeting specific nationalities within the Soviet Union, based on NKVD directives against the so-called diversionist element, according to the notion of the "hostile capitalist surrounding" as defined by Nikolai Yezhov. The [[Polish operation of the NKVD]] was the largest of this kind.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=103–4}} Over 111,000 of arrested Poles were executed. Their wives and children were dealt with by the [[NKVD Order № 00486]]. The women were sentenced to forced labour for 5 or 10 years.&lt;ref name="fronda"/&gt; Their minor children were put in orphanages. All possessions were confiscated. Extended families were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well, affecting up to 200,000–250,000 people of Polish background depending on size of their families.&lt;ref name="fronda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fronda.gliwice.pl/czytelnia.php5?id=84 |title=Zapomniane ludobójstwo stalinowskie (The forgotten Stalinist genocide) |publisher=Gliwicki klub Fondy.

The NKVD national operations were conducted on a quota system using [[album procedure]].

===Western émigré victims===
Victims of the terror included American immigrants to the Soviet Union who had emigrated at the height of the [[Great Depression]] to find work. At the height of the Terror, American immigrants besieged the US embassy, begging for passports so they could leave the Soviet Union. They were turned away by embassy officials, only to be arrested on the pavement outside by lurking NKVD agents.

The pro-Soviet leader [[Sheng Shicai]] of [[Xinjiang]] province in China launched his own purge in 1937 to coincide with Stalin's Great Purge.

===Timeline of the Great Purge===
{{Main|Timeline of the Great Purge}}
The Great Purge of 1936–1938 can be roughly divided into four periods:&lt;ref name=OR&gt;[http://www.memo.ru/history/y1937/hronika1936_1939/xronika.html N.G. Okhotin, A.B. Roginsky ''"Great Terror": Brief Chronology] [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
; October 1936 – February 1937: Reforming the security organizations, adopting official plans on purging the elites.
; March 1937 – June 1937: Purging the elites; adopting plans for the mass repressions against the "social base" of the potential aggressors, starting of purging the "elites" from opposition.
; July 1937 – October 1938: Mass repressions against "kulaks", "dangerous" ethnic minorities, family members of oppositionists, military officers, saboteurs in agriculture and industry.
; November 1938 – 1939: Stopping of mass operations, abolishing of many organs of extrajudicial executions, repressions against some organizers of mass repressions.

In the summer of 1938 Yezhov was relieved from his post as head of the NKVD and was eventually tried and executed. Lavrentiy Beria, a fellow Georgian and Stalin confidant, succeeded him as head of NKVD. On 17 November 1938 a joint decree of [[Sovnarkom]] USSR and [[Central Committee]] of VKP(b) ([[Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation]]) and the subsequent order of NKVD undersigned by Beria, cancelled most of the [[Mass operations of the NKVD|NKVD orders of systematic repression]] and suspended implementation of death sentences. The decree signaled the end of massive Soviet purges.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Nevertheless, the practice of mass arrest and exile continued until Stalin's death in 1953. Political executions also continued, but, with the exception of [[Katyn Massacre|Katyn]] and other [[NKVD prisoner massacres|NKVD massacres]] during [[World War II]], on a vastly smaller scale. One notorious example is the "[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]", in which at least thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed on 12 August 1952. Historians such as [[Michael Parrish]] have argued that while the Great Terror ended in 1938, a lesser terror continued in the 1940s.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=32}} [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (a Soviet Army officer who became a prisoner for a decade in the Gulag system) presents in ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' the most holistic view of the timeline of ''all'' the Leninist and Stalinist purges (1918–1956), in which the 1936–38 purge may have been simply the one that got the most attention from people in a position to record its magnitude for posterity—the intelligentsia—by directly targeting them, whereas several other waves of the ongoing flow of purges, such as the [[first five-year plan|1928–33 collectivization and dekulakization]], were just as huge and just as devoid of justice but were more successfully swallowed into oblivion in the popular memory of the (surviving) Soviet public.{{sfn|Solzhenitsyn|1973}} For example, in one such passage Solzhenitsyn mentions 1938 and says that 1948 was in some ways hardly better.

In some cases, high military command arrested under Yezhov were later executed under Beria. Some examples include Marshal of the Soviet Union [[Alexander Yegorov (military)|Alexander Yegorov]], arrested in April 1938 and shot (or died from torture) in February 1939 (his wife, G. A. Yegorova, was shot in August 1938); Army Commander [[Ivan Fedko]], arrested July 1938 and shot February 1939; Flagman {{Interlanguage link multi|Konstantin Dushenov|ru|3=Душенов, Константин Иванович}}, arrested May 1938 and shot February 1940; Komkor [[Georgy Bondar|G. I. Bondar]], arrested August 1938 and shot March 1939. All the aforementioned have been posthumously [[rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]].{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=33}}

When the relatives of those who had been executed in 1937–38 inquired about their fate, they were told by NKVD that their arrested relatives had been sentenced to "ten years [[without the right of correspondence]]" (десять лет без права переписки). When these ten-year periods elapsed in 1947–48 but the arrested did not appear, the relatives asked [[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]] about their fate again and this time were told that the arrested died in imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memo.ru/memory/preface/preface.htm|title=Московский мартиролог|work=memo.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western reactions==
Although the trials of former Soviet leaders were widely publicized, the hundreds of thousands of other arrests and executions were not. These became known in the West only as a few former gulag inmates reached the West with their stories.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|pp=472–3}} Not only did foreign correspondents from the West fail to report on the purges, but in many Western nations (especially France), attempts were made to silence or discredit these witnesses; according to Robert Conquest, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] took the position that evidence of the camps should be ignored so the French proletariat would not be discouraged.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=472}} A series of legal actions ensued at which definitive evidence was presented that established the validity of the former labor camp inmates' testimony.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=472–4}}

According to [[Robert Conquest]] in his 1968 book ''The Great Terror: Stalin's Purge of the Thirties'', with respect to the trials of former leaders, some Western observers were unable to see through the fraudulent nature of the charges and evidence, notably [[Walter Duranty]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', a Russian speaker; the American Ambassador, [[Joseph E. Davies]], who reported, "proof...beyond reasonable doubt to justify the verdict of treason"{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=468}} and [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]], authors of ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilization''.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=469}} While "Communist Parties everywhere simply transmitted the Soviet line", some of the most critical reporting also came from the left, notably ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]''.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=465,&amp;nbsp;467}} The American journalist [[H. R. Knickerbocker]] also reported on the executions. He called them in 1941 "the great purges", and described how over four years they affected "the top fourth or fifth, to estimate it conservatively, of the Party itself, of the Army, Navy, and Air Force leaders and then of the new Bolshevik intelligentsia, the foremost technicians, managers, supervisors, scientists". Knickerbocker also wrote about dekulakization: "It is a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 [kulaks] ... died at once, or within a few years."&lt;ref name="knickerbocker1941"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions on the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal &amp; Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=133–134| isbn=9781417992775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence and the results of research began to appear after Stalin's death. This revealed the full enormity of the Purges. The first of these sources were the revelations of Nikita Khrushchev, which particularly affected the American editors of the [[Communist Party USA]] newspaper, the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', who, following the lead of ''The New York Times'', published the [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]] in full.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trussel.com/hf/onleave.htm On Leaving the Communist Party] by Howard Fast, 16 November 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation==
{{Main|Rehabilitation (Soviet)}}
[[Image:USSR stamp M.Tukhachevsky 1963 4k.jpg|thumb|right|Posthumously rehabilitated, Tukhachevsky on a 1963 postage stamp of the Soviet Union]]
The Great Purge was denounced by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev following Stalin's death. In his secret speech to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an "abuse of power" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the Purge, the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]]. The new line on the Great Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent ("[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]") in 1957. The former Politburo members [[Yan Rudzutak]] and [[Stanislav Kosior]] and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to [[Marxist Theory]] was never rehabilitated by the USSR. The book ''Rehabilitation: The Political Processes of the 1930s–50s'' (Реабилитация. Политические процессы 30-50-х годов) (1991) contains a large amount of newly presented original archive material: transcripts of interrogations, letters of convicts, and photos. The material demonstrates in detail how numerous show trials were fabricated.

==Number of people executed==
Official figures put the total number of documentable executions during the years 1937 and 1938 at 681,692,&lt;ref name="Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia, 1934-1941"&gt;{{cite book |last= Thurston|first=Robert W.|date=1998 |title=Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia, 1934-1941|url= |location= |publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|page=139 |isbn=978-0300074420|author-link=Robert W.

The lower figure did roughly confirm Conquest's original 1968 estimate of 700,000 "legal" executions and in the preface to the 40th anniversary edition of ''The Great Terror'', Conquest claimed that he had been "correct on the vital matter—the numbers put to death: about one million."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, Preface, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment: 40th Anniversary Edition'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2007. p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stalin's role==
[[File:Great_Purge_Stalin_Voroshilov_Kaganovich_Zhdanov_Molotov.jpg|thumb|upright|A list from the Great Purge signed by [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]], and [[Andrei Zhdanov|Zhdanov]]]]
Historians with archival access have confirmed that Stalin was intimately involved in the terror. Russian historian Oleg V. Khlevniuk states "…theories about the elemental, spontaneous nature of the terror, about a loss of central control over the course of mass repression, and about the role of regional leaders in initiating the terror are simply not supported by the historical record."&lt;ref&gt;Oleg V. Khlevniuk. ''Master of the House: Stalin and His Inner Circle.'' [[Yale University Press]], 2008. {{ISBN|0-300-11066-9}} p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin personally directed Yezhov to torture those who were not making proper confessions. In one instance, he told Yezhov "Isn't it time to squeeze this gentleman and force him to report on his dirty little business? Where is he: in a prison or a hotel?" In another, while reviewing one of Yezhov's lists, he added to M. I. Baranov's name, "beat, beat!"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Marc Jansen, Nikita Vasilʹevich Petrov. ''Stalin's Loyal Executioner: People's Commissar Nikolai Ezhov, 1895–1940.'' [[Hoover Institution Press]], 2002. {{ISBN|0-8179-2902-9}} p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stalin biographer [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], he never attended torture sessions or executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Montefiore |first=Simon Sebag |year=2003 |title=Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |isbn=978-1-842-12726-1|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to authorizing enhanced interrogation techniques, Stalin also signed 357 lists in 1937 and 1938 authorizing executions of some 40,000 people, and about 90% of these are confirmed to have been shot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071014232729/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/mjellman/ Michael Ellman], [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/famine/ellman1933.pdf Stalin and the Soviet Famine of 1932–33 Revisited] ''Europe-Asia Studies'', [[Routledge]]. Vol. 59, No. 4, June 2007, 663–693. [[PDF]] file&lt;/ref&gt; While reviewing one such list, Stalin reportedly muttered to no one in particular: "Who's going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years time? No one. Who remembers the names now of the [[boyars]] [[Ivan the Terrible]] got rid of? No one."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Dmitri Volkogonov]], ''Stalin: Triumph and Tragedy'' (New York, 1991), pg 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's alleged remark may be compared with Hitler's famous admonition to his generals in 1939: "Who, after all, speaks today of [[Armenian Genocide|the annihilation of the Armenians]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n21/richard-j-evans/who-remembers-the-poles |title=Who remembers the Poles? |author=Richard J. Evans |authorlink=Richard J. Evans |date=4 November 2010 |journal=London Review of Books |volume=32 |issue=21 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen G. Wheatcroft]] posits that while the 'purposive deaths' caused by Hitler constitute 'murder', those caused by Stalin fall into the category of 'execution'. He elaborates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stalin undoubtedly caused many innocent people to be executed, but it seems likely that he thought many of them guilty of crimes against the state and felt that the execution of others would act as a deterent to the guilty. He signed the papers and insisted on documentation. Hitler, by contrast, wanted to be rid of the Jews and communists simply because they were Jews and communists. He was not concerned about making any pretence at legality. He was careful not to sign anything on this matter and was equally insistent on no documentation.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|1996|p=1348}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Soviet investigation commissions==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
[[File:RIAN archive 749019 Opening of monument to victims of political repressions.jpg|thumb|upright|Opening of monument to victims of political repressions, Moscow, 1990]]

At least two Soviet commissions investigated the show-trials after Stalin's death.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The first was headed by Molotov and included Voroshilov, Kaganovich, [[Mikhail Suslov|Suslov]], [[Furtseva]], [[Nikolay Shvernik|Shvernik]], [[Averky Aristov|Aristov]], [[Pospelov]], and [[Roman Rudenko|Rudenko]]. They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956–1957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky ''et al.'' should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and "evidence" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and "use of physical influence". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because "for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR".

The second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik ("[[Shvernik Commission]]"). It included [[Alexander Shelepin|Shelepin]], Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a "spy", etc.). The commission stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement... Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov....{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mass graves and memorials==
{{Main|Mass graves in the Soviet Union}}

In the late 1980s, with the formation of the [[Memorial Society]] and similar organisations across the Soviet Union it became possible not only to speak about the Great Terror, but also to begin locating the killing grounds of 1937-1938 and identifying those who lay buried there.

In 1988, for instance, the mass graves at [[Kurapaty]] in Belarus were the site of a clash between demonstrators and the police. In 1990, a boulder stone was brought from the former [[Solovki prison camp]] in the White Sea, and erected next to KGB headquarters in Moscow as a memorial to all "the victims of political repression" since 1917.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, many more mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered and turned into memorial sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9707/17/russia.gulag.grave/index.html "Pictorial essay: Death trenches bear witness to Stalin's purges"] [[CNN]], 17 July 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2131954.stm "Mass grave found at Ukrainian monastery"], [[BBC]], 12 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1010/p01s02-woeu.html "Wary of its past, Russia ignores mass grave site"], by [[Fred Weir]], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 10 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6584HJ20100609 Stalin-era mass grave yields tons of bones] [[Reuters]]. 9 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as the killing fields [[Bykivnia]] near [[Kiev]], are said to contain up to 200,000 corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/battles.htm#Bykivnia|title=WAR STATS REDIRECT|publisher=erols.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2012}}

In 2007, one such site, the Butovo firing range near Moscow, was turned into a shrine to the victims of Stalinism. Between August 1937 and October 1938, more than 20,000 people were shot and buried there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/08/world/europe/08butovo.html?ex=1338955200&amp;en=00d28b9b0511bf99&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "Former Killing Ground Becomes Shrine to Stalin’s Victims"] by Sophia Kishkovsky, [[The New York Times]], 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2017, President Vladimir Putin opened the [[Wall of Sorrow]], an official but controversial recognition of the crimes of the Soviet regime.

&lt;/center&gt;

==Historical interpretations==
The Great Purge has provoked numerous debates about its purpose, scale and mechanisms. According to one interpretation, Stalin's regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of "Old Bolsheviks", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment – or rather the culmination – of a vast [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).&lt;ref name=werth&gt;{{cite web|first=Nicolas|last=Werth |authorlink=Nicolas Werth|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/nkvd-mass-secret-national-operations-august-1937-november-1938|title=Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n° 00447 (August 1937 – November 1938)|publisher=Mass Violence and Resistance – Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes "rather large holes in the traditional story" weaved by Conquest and others. His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an over-exaggerated fear of counterrevolution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/163498|title=Historian James Harris says Russian archives show we’ve misunderstood Stalin|last=Harris |first=James |date=July 26, 2016 |website=[[History News Network]]|publisher= |access-date=December 1, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''KZ1''' is a [[kart racing]] class using 125 cc water-cooled [[two-stroke engine]]s yielding approximately 46-48hp, equipped with a 6-speed gearbox. Technical regulations are similar to [[KZ2]] except for the gearbox which can be either manual or electro-mechanical and the use of soft tires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cikfia.com/web/karting/webkarting.nsf/C54F7EAD9380CB63C125707500537686/$FILE/WEB_RT%202010_full_version.pdf?Openelement 2010 CIK-FIA Technical regulations] – Article 12, Specific Regulations for KZ2 &amp; KZ1, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; Both engines and chassis must be approved by the [[Commission Internationale de Karting|CIK]]-[[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] racing governing commission. It is open to top drivers aged 15 and over. Minimum weight is 175&amp;nbsp;kg with driver.

This class used to be called '''Formula C'''. It was discontinued in favor of '''Super ICC''' and renamed '''KZ1''' by the CIK-FIA in January 2007.

There is a European KZ1 Championship and a World Cup, both organized under CIK-FIA.

'''Ludwig the Bloodsucker''' was an American mythical figure and possible [[urban legend]] in [[New York City]] during the mid-to late 19th century. A longtime [[Bowery]] character, he was described as having [[vampire]]-like qualities. He was a "squat, swarthy German, with an enormous head crowned with a shock of bristly black hair. Huge bunches of hair grew out of his ears, and his unusual appearance was accentuated by another tuft which sprouted by the end of his nose" and supposedly had "hair growing out of every orifice".&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre, Ben. ''Napoleon of Crime: The Life and Times of Adam Worth, Master Thief''. New York: Dell Publishing, 1997. (pg. 18) {{ISBN|0-385-31993-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig was said to have preyed upon drunken customers of barroom brawls near Bismark Hall and the House of Commons and is claimed to have "quaffed human blood as if it were wine".&lt;ref&gt;Petronius. ''New York Unexpurgated: An Amoral Guide for the Jaded, Tired, Evil, Non-conforming, Corrupt, Condemned, and the Curious, Humans and Otherwise, to Under Underground Manhattan''. New York: Matrix House, 1966. (pg. 201)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harlow, Alvin F. ''Old Bowery Days: The Chronicles of a Famous Street''. New York and London: D. Appleton &amp; Company, 1931. (pg. 401)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Asbury|Asbury, Herbert]]. ''The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 175-176) {{ISBN|1-56025-275-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luis Moreno''' (born 19 March 1981) is a Panamanian [[Association football|football]] defender who plays for [[Tauro F.C.|Tauro]].

He gained notoriety after violently kicking an injured [[barn owl]] that had landed on the pitch during a league match between [[Junior de Barranquilla]] and [[Deportivo Pereira]]. The barn owl died due to the kick.

==Club career==
Born in [[Panama City]], "Lucho" Moreno began playing football with Venezuelan side Deportivo Italia. He was signed by first division club [[Tauro F.C.|Tauro]] in 2001. He had a brief spell with Colombian side [[Envigado Fútbol Club|Envigado]] during 2005 and 2006, before returning to Tauro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.critica.com.pa/archivo/07282006/dep22_pix.html Luis "Lucho" Moreno retorna al Tauro F.C.] - Crítica {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peruvian side [[Universitario de Deportes]] attempted to sign him in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Peru.com|title=Un panameño a la "U"|url=http://www.peru.com/futbol/AutoNoticias/FutbolPortada/2006/08/19/DetalleNoticia78457.asp|language=Spanish|date=19 August 2006}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he stayed with Tauro.

In January 2007, Moreno returned to the Colombian league, joining [[Independiente Santa Fe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Prensa.com|title=Moreno es uno de los cinco refuerzos|url=http://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2006/12/15/hoy/deportes/830187.html|language=Spanish|date=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club terminated his contract in May 2007, after a disciplinary incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Prensa.com|title=Luis Moreno separado del equipo Santa Fe|url=http://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2007/05/09/hoy/deportes/976788.html|language=Spanish|date=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Tauro, but shortly after joined Mexican [[Liga de Ascenso|Primera División A]] side [[Tiburones Rojos de Coatzacoalcos|Tiburones Rojos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Panamá America|author=Figueroa, Carlos|title=Luis Moreno y Edwin fueron presentados|url=http://www.pa-digital.com.pa/periodico/buscador/resultado.php?story_id=617201&amp;texto=uat|language=Spanish|date=18 August 2007}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreno was loaned to [[Deportivo Pereira]] in January 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ligapostobon.com.co/noticia/llegan-primeros-refuerzos-para-el-pereira-05777 Llegan primeros refuerzos para el Pereira] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050614/http://www.ligapostobon.com.co/noticia/llegan-primeros-refuerzos-para-el-pereira-05777 |date=2016-03-04 }} - Liga Postobon {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but returned to Tauro later that year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/content/luis-%E2%80%9Clucho%E2%80%9D-moreno-regresa-al-tauro-fc Luis “Lucho” Moreno regresa al Tauro FC] - Panamá América {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he would help the club win its tenth league title in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CONCACAF.com|title=Luis 'Lucho' Moreno cree en Tauro|url=http://www.fepafut.com/noticias_detail.asp?id=3775|language=Spanish|date=13 February 2014|access-date=2014-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426234455/http://www.fepafut.com/noticias_detail.asp?id=3775|archive-date=2014-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Moreno made his debut for [[Panama national football team|Panama]] in a June 2000 [[friendly match]] against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]] and has earned a total of 76 caps, scoring no goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/panama-recintlp.html Appearances for Panama National Team] - RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt; He represented his country in 17 [[FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches&lt;ref&gt;{{FIFA player|202040}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a key member of the side, participating in the 2005, 2007 and 2009 [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]] |author1=Courtney, Barrie |author2=Saaid, Hamdan |lastauthoramp=yes |title=CONCACAF Championship, Gold Cup 2005 - Full Details |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/05gc-full.html |date=30 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024022300/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/05gc-full.html |archivedate=24 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]] |author=Saaid, Hamdan |title=CONCACAF Championship, Gold Cup 2007 - Full Details |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/07gc-full.html |date=19 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024002319/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/07gc-full.html |archivedate=24 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]] |author=Lugo, Erik Francisco |title=CONCACAF Championship, Gold Cup 2009 - Full Details |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/09gc-full.html |date=12 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726152032/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/09gc-full.html |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His final international was a September 2011 friendly match against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]].

==Owl kicking incident==
During a February 2011 league match between [[Junior de Barranquilla]] and [[Deportivo Pereira]], Junior's unofficial mascot owl landed on the field during play and was struck by a pass. As the owl lay stunned on the field, Moreno, from the opposing team, kicked it approximately 3 meters (~10 feet) to the touchline.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/football/owl-kicked-by-player-dies-from-shock-20110302-1bdnt.html |title=Owl kicked by player dies from shock |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, he claimed he was prompting it to fly away&lt;ref name=kick&gt;"[https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5i4xVl4_p5NJgzl65Ir5RumMpG3_w?docId=6097476 Football player faces sanctions for kicking injured owl in Colombia]", The Canadian Press, February 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southamerican-futbol.blogspot.com/2011/02/luis-moreno-owl-abuse.html |title=Luis Moreno Owl Abuse |publisher=Southamerican-futbol.blogspot.com |date=2011-02-27 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in a later interview he admitted "The kick was a product of tension on the field at the time."&lt;ref name=smh /&gt; The owl was treated for its injuries at a local veterinary clinic, but later died of stress related to the incident. Moreno received a two-match ban, a $560 fine from Colombian football's governing body in addition to veterinary costs for the owl's treatment and was ordered to do community service at a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reuters |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/28/owl-killing-footballer-community-zoo |title=Owl-killing footballer ordered to do community service at a zoo &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 28 April 2011|accessdate=2012-06-12 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2289">The '''Lyme Regis Fossil Festival''' is an annual festival held at [[Lyme Regis]] on the [[Jurassic Coast]] of East Devon and Dorset. It exists to celebrate the unique geological heritage of Lyme Regis and the Jurassic Coast and to educate the public on advances in natural environment research, and especially palaeontology.  It is organised by the Lyme Regis Development Trust with major support from the [[Natural History Museum]] in London and the Jurassic Coast team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossilfestival.com/programme/home|title=Lyme Regis Fossil Festival website|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the idea of Dr Paul Davis of the Natural History Museum who worked with Marcus Dixon of the Lyme Regis Development Trust and Jo Draper of the Lyme Regis Museum to establish the first one in 2005 and since then it has regularly occurred over the early May Bank Holiday Weekend.

The festival includes a wide range of activities run primarily by scientists from the Natural History Museum, various universities, and scientific societies. There are also guided fossil collecting walks, scientific talks, a wide range of stalls run by fossil preparators and collectors, and related art events such as a replica of a Victorian iguanodon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridport News 26-4-2016 Enjoy the Lyme Regis Fossil Festival... inside a 35ft dinosaur|url=http://www.bridportnews.co.uk/news/lymenews/14448437.Enjoy_the_Lyme_Regis_Fossil_Festival____inside_a_35ft_dinosaur/|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the festival hosted a UNESCO Youth Climate Change Summit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO 'Rising Seas'  Youth Climate Change Summit|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/events/411/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 the festival formed part of the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]] linked to the London Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News - Jurassic Coast Cultural Olympiad festival in Lyme Regis|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-17951553|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MiB.svg|thumb|right|Stylized depiction of a Man in Black]]

In popular culture and [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy theories]], '''men in black''' ('''MIB''') are supposed men dressed in [[Suit (clothing)|black suits]] who claim to be quasi-[[Special agent|government agents]] who harass or threaten [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] witnesses to keep them quiet about what they have seen. It is sometimes implied that they may be [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]] themselves. The term is also frequently used to describe mysterious men working for unknown organizations, as well as various branches of government allegedly designed to protect secrets or perform other strange activities. The term is generic, used for any unusual, threatening or strangely behaved individual whose appearance on the scene can be linked in some fashion with a [[UFO]] sighting.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Jerome (1996). The UFO Encyclopedia, volume 3: High Strangeness, UFO's from 1960 through 1979. Omnigraphis. 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Several alleged encounters with the men in black have been reported by UFO researchers and enthusiasts.

Stories about allegedly real-life men in black inspired the semi-comic science fiction [[Men in Black (franchise)|''Men in Black'']] franchise of comic books, films, and other media.

==Folklore==
Folklorist [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] compares accounts of men in black with  tales of people encountering [[Lucifer]] and speculates that they can be considered a kind of "psychological drama".&lt;ref name="Lewis1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=James R. Lewis|title=The Gods Have Landed: New Religions from Other Worlds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCEtC3xnzuAC&amp;pg=PA218|date=9 March 1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2330-1|pages=218–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ufologists==
Men in black figure prominently in [[ufology]] and UFO folklore. In the 1950s and 1960s, UFOlogists adopted a conspiratorial mindset and began to fear they would be subject to organized intimidation in retaliation for discovering "the truth of the UFOs".&lt;ref name="Gulyas2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aaron John Gulyas|title=Conspiracy Theories: The Roots, Themes and Propagation of Paranoid Political and Cultural Narratives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3etCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT86|date=25 January 2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-2349-8|pages=86–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Harold Dahl claimed to have been warned not to talk about his alleged [[Maury Island incident|UFO sighting on Maury Island]] by a man in a dark suit. In the mid-1950s, the ufologist [[Albert K. Bender]] claimed he was visited by men in dark suits who threatened and warned him not to continue investigating UFOs. Bender maintained that the men in black were secret government agents who had been given the task of suppressing evidence of UFOs. The ufologist [[John Keel]] claimed to have had encounters with men in black and referred to them as "[[demon]]ic supernaturals" with "dark skin and/or ‘exotic’ facial features". According to the ufologist [[Jerome Clark]], reports of men in black represent "experiences" that "don't seem to have occurred in the world of consensus reality".&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Aisha|title=Do UFO Hunters Still Report "Men in Black" Sightings?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/05/23/men_in_black_sightings_do_they_still_happen_.html|website=Slate|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Aaron Gulyas wrote, "during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, UFO conspiracy theorists would incorporate the Men in Black into their increasingly complex and paranoid visions".&lt;ref name="Gulyas2016" /&gt;

In his article, "[[Gray Barker]]: My Friend, the Myth-Maker," John C. Sherwood claims that, in the late 1960s, at the age of 18, he cooperated when Gray Barker urged him to develop a hoax—which Barker subsequently published—about what Barker called "blackmen", three mysterious UFO inhabitants who silenced Sherwood's pseudonymous identity, "Dr. Richard H. Pratt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sherwood, John C.|title=Gray Barker: My Friend, the Myth-Maker|work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/gray_barker_my_friend_the_myth-maker/|accessdate=2006-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North and Central American (NACAM) Formula 4 Championship''' is a [[formula racing]] series run to [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Formula 4]] regulations. The inaugural season was held over [[2015-16 NACAM Formula 4 Championship|2015 and 2016]].

==History==
[[Gerhard Berger]] and the FIA Singleseater Commission launched Formula 4 in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIA reveals Formula 4 plan|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/106219|work=[[Autosport]]|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the Formula 4 was to make the ladder to [[Formula 1]] more transparent.

The '''Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou''' ('''Festival panafricain du cinéma et de la télévision de Ouagadougou''' or '''FESPACO''') is a film festival in [[Burkina Faso]], held biennially in [[Ouagadougou]], where the organization is based. It accepts for competition only films by African filmmakers and chiefly produced in Africa. FESPACO is scheduled in March of each year, two weeks after the last Saturday of February. Its opening night is held in the [[Stade du 4-Août]], the national stadium.

The festival offers African film professionals the chance to establish working relationships, exchange ideas, and to promote their work. FESPACO's stated aim is to "contribute to the expansion and development of African [[Film|cinema]] as means of expression, education and awareness-raising". It has also worked to establish a market for African films and industry professionals. Since FESPACO's founding, the festival has attracted attendees from across the continent and beyond.&lt;ref name="razac"&gt;Fiche Technique du FESPACO (2003). FESPACO: Fiche Technique.

==Founding==
[[File:Siege FESPACO Ouaga.jpg|thumb|FESPACO Headquarters at Ouagadougou]]
Created in 1969, it was first called the Pan-African film and television festival of [[Ouagadougou]]. It has evolved into an internationally recognized and respected event.&lt;ref name="razac" /&gt; [[Alimata Salambere]], the cultural minister of [[Burkina Faso]] from 1987 to 1991, was one of the founders of the festival. At its third edition in 1972, the festival was named FESPACO for short, keeping its full title as ''Festival pan-Africain du cinema et de la television de Ouagadougou.'' FESPACO was recognized formally as an institution by governmental decree on January 7, 1972. Its award ceremony and base of operations is Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, where the annual awards ceremony is also held.

In 1972 the first winner of the best film award was ''[[Le Wazzou Polygame]]'' by [[Oumarou Ganda]] of [[Niger]].  Since then, the best film award has been won by directors from [[Cameroon]], [[Morocco]], Mali, [[Ivory Coast]], [[Algeria]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

===Evolution from 1969 to 2017===
{{Pan-African}}
At the festival's founding in 1969, five African nations: [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] (Burkina Faso), [[Cameroon]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Niger]] and [[Senegal]], were represented, as well as [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]]. A total of 23 films were shown. At its second edition, the participant African countries rose to nine, including for the first time [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Guinea]], Mali, and [[Ghana]], and a total of 40 films were shown. In 1983, the festival included MICA (''le Marche International du Cinema et de la television Africaine''), a market for African film stock and video footage.

From 1985 onward, the festival adopted different themes for the annual event, starting with "the cinema, people, and liberation". The theme for the 2007 festival was "the actor in the creation and promotion of African films".&lt;ref name="abdoul"&gt;Arte &gt; FESPACO &gt; Bala Hama. Festival de FESPACO. Interview Baba Hama. Retrieved 03/24/2006 from {{cite web |url=http://archives.arte-tv.com/fr/archive_221960.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130117110434/http://archives.arte-tv.com/fr/archive_221960.html |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the festival became more prominent, its budget and sponsors increased; the donor countries include Burkina Faso, [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], [[Republic of China]]. Donor organizations include AIF (ACCT), [[PNUD]], [[UNESCO]], [[Unicef|UNICEF]], [[European Union]] and [[Africalia]]. Due to its international recognition, FESPACO has enabled African filmmakers to show their talents and sell their products in the international market, as well as to promote development of African products and technicians in the industry.&lt;ref name="komdole"&gt;Arte &gt; FESPACO &gt; Introduction.

The general secretaries of FESPACO since 1972 have been [[Louis Tombiano]], from 1972 to 1982; [[Alimata Salembere]], from 1982 to 1984; [[Filippe Savadogo]], from 1984 to 1996, [[Baba Hama]], from 1996 to 2008, [[Michel Ouedraogo]], from 2008 to 2014, and [[Ardiouma Soma]], from 2014 to present.

==Main initiatives==
* African international film and television market: FESPACO is a festival which promotes African filmmakers and facilitates the screening of all African films. This unique festival in Africa enables contacts and exchange between film and audiovisual professionals of Africa and also contributes to the expansion and development of African cinema as a means of expression, education and awareness rising.&lt;ref name="razac" /&gt;
* Promotion of African cinema and culture: African cinema is promoted through publication of catalogues, FESPACO news, FESPACO newsletter, and maintenance of an African film library, which has film archives and a data bank. In addition, it supports a traveling cinema.

[[File:PhishingTrustedBank.png|right|300px|thumb|An example of a phishing email, disguised as an official [[email]] from a (fictional) bank. The sender is attempting to trick the recipient into revealing confidential information by "confirming" it at the phisher's website. Note the misspelling of the words ''received'' and ''discrepancy'' as {{not a typo|''recieved'' and ''discrepency''}} respectively. Also note that although the [[URL]] of the bank's [[webpage]] appears to be legitimate, the hyperlink would actually be pointed at the phisher's webpage.]]

'''Phishing''' is the fraudulent attempt to obtain [[Information sensitivity|sensitive information]] such as usernames, passwords and [[credit card]] details by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an [[electronic communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Ramzan, Zulfikar |chapter=Phishing attacks and countermeasures |editors=Stamp, Mark &amp; Stavroulakis, Peter |title=Handbook of Information and Communication Security |publisher=Springer |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-642-04117-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-9P1EkTkigC&amp;pg=PA433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Merwe, A J, Loock, M, Dabrowski, M.

Phishing is an example of [[social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]] techniques being used to deceive users. Users are often lured by communications purporting to be from trusted parties such as [[Social networking service|social web site]]s, [[Online auction|auction sites]], banks, [[E-commerce payment system|online payment processors]] or IT administrators.&lt;ref name="Google"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.jp/2012/06/safe-browsing-protecting-web-users-for.html|title=Safe Browsing (Google Online Security Blog)|accessdate=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual worldwide impact of phishing could be as high as US$5 billion.&lt;ref name="news.biharprabha.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=20% Indians are victims of Online phishing attacks: Microsoft |url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/02/20-indians-are-victims-of-online-phishing-attacks-microsoft/ |work=IANS |publisher=news.biharprabha.com |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Study should be cited directly, not media coverage of it. See talk page for more issues.|date=May 2017}} Attempts to deal with phishing incidents include [[legislation]], user training, public awareness, and technical security measures - because phishing attacks also often exploit weaknesses in current web security.&lt;ref name="Jos2007"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jøsang|first= Audun |title=Security Usability Principles for Vulnerability Analysis and Risk Assessment. |work=Proceedings of the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference 2007 (ACSAC'07) |year=2007 |url=http://www.unik.no/people/josang/papers/JAGAM2007-ACSAC.pdf |format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word itself is a [[neologism]] created as a [[homophone]] of ''[[fishing]]'', due to the similarity of using a [[Bait (luring substance)|bait]] in an attempt to catch a victim.

==Techniques==

===Phishing types===

====Spear phishing====
Phishing attempts directed at specific individuals or companies have been termed '''spear phishing'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is spear phishing? |work=Microsoft Security At Home |url=http://www.microsoft.com/canada/athome/security/email/spear_phishing.mspx |accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to bulk phishing, spear phishing attackers often gather and use personal information about their target to increase their probability of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stephenson |first1=Debbie |title=Spear Phishing: Who’s Getting Caught? |url=http://www.firmex.com/blog/spear-phishing-whos-getting-caught/ |publisher=Firmex |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA/GCHQ Hacking Gets Personal: Belgian Cryptographer Targeted |url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/nsagchq-hacking-gets-personal-belgian/ |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=Info Security magazine |date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leyden |first1=John |title=RSA explains how attackers breached its systems |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/04/rsa_hack_howdunnit/ |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=The Register |date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Winterford |first1=Brett |title=Epsilon breach used four-month-old attack |url=https://www.itnews.com.au/news/epsilon-breach-used-four-month-old-attack-253712 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=itnews.com.au |publisher=itnews.com.au |date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fancy Bear|Threat Group-4127 (Fancy Bear)]] used spear phishing tactics to target email accounts linked to [[Hillary Clinton]]'s 2016 presidential campaign. They attacked more than 1,800 [[Google]] accounts and implemented the accounts-google.com domain to threaten targeted users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-google-accounts|title=Threat Group-4127 Targets Google Accounts|website=www.secureworks.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party inline|date=October 2017}}

====Clone phishing====
Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email. The attachment or link within the email is replaced with a malicious version and then sent from an email address spoofed to appear to come from the original sender. It may claim to be a resend of the original or an updated version to the original. This technique could be used to pivot (indirectly) from a previously infected machine and gain a foothold on another machine, by exploiting the social trust associated with the inferred connection due to both parties receiving the original email.

====Whaling====
The term '''whaling''' has been coined for spear phishing attacks directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/16/whaling_expedition_continues/. |title=Fake subpoenas harpoon 2,100 corporate fat cats |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |publisher=The Register |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9YcgvUb?url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/16/whaling_expedition_continues/ |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the content will be crafted to target an upper manager and the person's role in the company. The content of a whaling attack email may be an executive issue such as a subpoena or customer complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/scamsandidentitytheft/f/What-Is-Whaling-Spear-Phishing.htm |title=What Is 'Whaling'? Is Whaling Like 'Spear Phishing'? |accessdate=March 28, 2015 |publisher=About Tech |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018140959/http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/scamsandidentitytheft/f/What-Is-Whaling-Spear-Phishing.htm |archivedate=October 18, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Link manipulation===
Most methods of phishing use some form of technical deception designed to make a [[Uniform Resource Locator|link]] in an email (and the [[website spoofing|spoofed website]] it leads to) appear to belong to the spoofed organization.&lt;ref name="BustSpammers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bustspammers.com/phishing_links.html |title=Get smart on Phishing! Learn to read links! |accessdate=December 11, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mfqUkatY?url=http://www.bustspammers.com/phishing_links.html |archivedate=December 11, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Typosquatting|Misspelled]] URLs or the use of subdomains are common tricks used by phishers. In the following example URL, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.yourbank.example.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, it appears as though the URL will take you to the ''example'' section of the ''yourbank'' website; actually this URL points to the "''yourbank''" (i.e. phishing) section of the ''example'' website. Another common trick is to make the displayed text for a link (the text between the [[Anchor tag|&lt;A&gt; tags]]) suggest a reliable destination, when the link actually goes to the phishers' site. Many desktop email clients and web browsers will show a link's target URL in the status bar while hovering the [[Pointer (user interface)|mouse]] over it. This behavior, however, may in some circumstances be overridden by the phisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/hidden-javascript-redirect-makes-phishing-pages-harder-to-detect-505295.shtml |title=Hidden JavaScript Redirect Makes Phishing Pages Harder to Detect |last=Cimpanu |first=Catalin |date=June 15, 2016 |website=Softpedia News Center |publisher=Softpedia |access-date=May 21, 2017 |quote=Hovering links to see their true location may be a useless security tip in the near future if phishers get smart about their mode of operation and follow the example of a crook who recently managed to bypass this browser built-in security feature.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent [[mobile apps]] generally do not have this preview feature.

[[Internationalized domain name]]s (IDN) can be exploited via [[Internationalized domain names#ASCII spoofing concerns|IDN spoofing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Johanson, Eric |title=The State of Homograph Attacks Rev1.1 |work=The Shmoo Group |url=http://www.shmoo.com/idn/homograph.txt |accessdate=August 11, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050823111335/http://www.shmoo.com/idn/homograph.txt |archivedate=August 23, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[IDN homograph attack|homograph attacks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Evgeniy Gabrilovich |author2=Alex Gontmakher |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Homograph Attack |journal=Communications of the ACM |date=February 2002 |volume=45 |page=128 |url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/papers/homograph_full.pdf |format=PDF |issue=2 |doi=10.1145/503124.503156}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create web addresses visually identical to a legitimate site, that lead instead to malicious version.  Phishers have taken advantage of a similar risk, using open [[URL redirector]]s on the websites of trusted organizations to disguise malicious URLs with a trusted domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/15/barclays_phish_scam/ |last=Leyden |first=John |title=Barclays scripting SNAFU exploited by phishers |date=August 15, 2006 |publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Levine, Jason |title=Goin' phishing with eBay |work=Q Daily News |url=http://q.queso.com/archives/001617 |accessdate=December 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/12/phishing_redirection/ |last=Leyden |first=John |title=Cybercrooks lurk in shadows of big-name websites |date=December 12, 2007 |publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even digital certificates do not solve this problem because it is quite possible for a phisher to purchase a valid certificate and subsequently change content to spoof a genuine website, or, to host the phish site without [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] at all.&lt;ref name="Black Hat DC 2009"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/. |title=Black Hat DC 2009 |date=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filter evasion===
Phishers have sometimes used images instead of text to make it harder for anti-phishing filters to detect the text commonly used in phishing emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mutton, Paul |title=Fraudsters seek to make phishing sites undetectable by content filters |work=Netcraft |url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/05/12/fraudsters_seek_to_make_phishing_sites_undetectable_by_content_filters.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9YzPsN0?url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/05/12/fraudsters_seek_to_make_phishing_sites_undetectable_by_content_filters.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, more sophisticated anti-phishing filters are able to recover hidden text in images using OCR ([[optical character recognition]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powershow.com/view1/1f004e-NzY0N/The_use_of_Optical_Character_Recognition_OCR_software_in_spam_filtering_powerpoint_ppt_presentation|title=The use of Optical Character Recognition OCR software in spam filtering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website forgery===
Some phishing scams use [[JavaScript]] commands in order to alter the [[URL bar|address bar]] of the website they lead to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mutton, Paul |title=Phishing Web Site Methods |work=FraudWatch International |url=http://www.fraudwatchinternational.com/phishing-fraud/phishing-web-site-methods/ |accessdate=December 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9Z2iACi?url=http://www.fraudwatchinternational.com/phishing-fraud/phishing-web-site-methods/ |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done either by placing a picture of a legitimate URL over the address bar, or by closing the original bar and opening up a new one with the legitimate URL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3608943.stm |title=Phishing con hijacks browser bar |date=April 8, 2004 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attacker can also potentially use flaws in a trusted website's own scripts against the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Krebs, Brian |title=Flaws in Financial Sites Aid Scammers |work=Security Fix |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/06/flaws_in_financial_sites_aid_s.html |accessdate=June 28, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9Z4mv7k?url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/06/flaws_in_financial_sites_aid_s.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of attacks (known as [[cross-site scripting]]) are particularly problematic, because they direct the user to sign in at their bank or service's own web page, where everything from the [[URL|web address]] to the [[Transport Layer Security|security certificates]] appears correct. In reality, the link to the website is crafted to carry out the attack, making it very difficult to spot without specialist knowledge. Such a flaw was used in 2006 against [[PayPal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mutton, Paul |title=PayPal Security Flaw allows Identity Theft |work=Netcraft |url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2006/06/16/paypal_security_flaw_allows_identity_theft.html |accessdate=June 19, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9Z5zOVh?url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2006/06/16/paypal_security_flaw_allows_identity_theft.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid anti-phishing techniques that scan websites for phishing-related text, phishers sometimes use [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based websites (a technique known as phlashing). These look much like the real website, but hide the text in a multimedia object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miller, Rich |title=Phishing Attacks Continue to Grow in Sophistication |work=Netcraft |url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/01/15/phishing_attacks_continue_to_grow_in_sophistication.html |accessdate=December 19, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9Z7NfVB?url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/01/15/phishing_attacks_continue_to_grow_in_sophistication.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covert redirect===
Covert redirect is a subtle method to perform phishing attacks that makes links appear legitimate, but actually redirect a victim to an attacker's website. The flaw is usually masqueraded under a log-in popup based on an affected site's domain.&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/serious-security-flaw-in-oauth-and-openid-discovered/ |title=Serious security flaw in OAuth, OpenID discovered |publisher=CNET |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can affect [[OAuth]] 2.0 and [[OpenID]] based on well-known exploit parameters as well. This often makes use of open redirect and [[Cross-site scripting|XSS]] vulnerabilities in the third-party application websites.&lt;ref name="Covert_Redirect_OAuth_OpenID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tetraph.com/covert_redirect/oauth2_openid_covert_redirect.html |title=Covert Redirect Vulnerability Related to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID |publisher=Tetraph |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browshing is another way of redirecting users to phishing websites covertly through malicious browser extensions.&lt;ref name="Browshing"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Browshing a new way to phishing using malicious browser extension |pages=1–5|publisher=IEEE|date=Jan 4, 2018 |doi=10.1109/IPACT.2017.8245147 |chapter = Browshing a new way of phishing using a malicious browser extension|last1 = Varshney|first1 = Gaurav|last2=Misra|first2=Manoj|last3=Atrey|first3=Pradeep|isbn=978-1-5090-5682-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normal phishing attempts can be easy to spot because the malicious page's [[URL]] will usually be different from the real site link. For covert redirect, an attacker could use a real website instead by corrupting the site with a malicious login popup dialogue box. This makes covert redirect different from others.&lt;ref name="TomsGuid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/facebook-google-covert-redirect-flaw,news-18726.html |title=Facebook, Google Users Threatened by New Security Flaw |publisher=Tom's Guid |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FoxNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2014/05/05/facebook-google-users-threatened-by-new-security-flaw/ |title=Facebook, Google users threatened by new security flaw |publisher=FOX NEWS |date=May 5, 2014 |accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose a victim clicks a malicious phishing link beginning with [[Facebook]]. A popup window from Facebook will ask whether the victim would like to authorize the app. If the victim chooses to authorize the app, a "token" will be sent to the attacker and the victim's personal sensitive information could be exposed. These information may include the email address, birth date, contacts, and work history.&lt;ref name="Covert_Redirect_OAuth_OpenID"/&gt; In case the "token” has greater privilege, the attacker could obtain more sensitive information including the mailbox, online presence, and friends list. Worse still, the attacker may possibly control and operate the user’s [[User (computing)|account]].&lt;ref name="TheHackerNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehackernews.com/2014/05/nasty-covert-redirect-vulnerability.html |title=Nasty Covert Redirect Vulnerability found in OAuth and OpenID |publisher=The Hacker News |date=May 3, 2014 |accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the victim does not choose to authorize the app, he or she will still get redirected to a website controlled by the attacker. This could potentially further compromise the victim.&lt;ref name="Yahoo_Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/facebook-google-users-threatened-security-192547549.html |title=Facebook, Google Users Threatened by New Security Flaw |publisher=Yahoo |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vulnerability was discovered by Wang Jing, a Mathematics Ph.D. student at School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in [[Nanyang Technological University]] in Singapore.&lt;ref name="ScMagazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmagazine.com/covert-redirect-vulnerability-impacts-oauth-20-openid/article/345407/ |title='Covert Redirect' vulnerability impacts OAuth 2.0, OpenID |publisher=SC Magazine |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covert redirect is a notable security flaw, though it is not a threat to the Internet worth significant attention.&lt;ref name="Symantec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/covert-redirect-flaw-oauth-not-next-heartbleed |title=Covert Redirect Flaw in OAuth is Not the Next Heartbleed |publisher=Symantec |date=May 3, 2014 |accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social engineering===
Users can be encouraged to click on various kinds of unexpected content for a variety of technical and social reasons. For example, a malicious attachment might masquerade as a benign linked [[Google doc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=Meg|title=This Gmail phishing attack is tricking experts. Here’s how to avoid it.|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-gmail-phishing-attack-uiuc-bsi-20170119-story.html|accessdate=28 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively users might be outraged by a [[fake news]] story, click a link and become infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Kerry|title=Fake news can poison your computer as well as your mind|url=http://www.archersecuritygroup.com/fake-news-can-poison-computer-well-mind/|publisher=archersecuritygroup.com|accessdate=28 January 2017|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice phishing===
Not all phishing attacks require a fake website. Messages that claimed to be from a bank told users to dial a phone number regarding problems with their bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.techweb.com/wire/security/186701001 |last=Gonsalves |first=Antone |title=Phishers Snare Victims With VoIP |date=April 25, 2006 |publisher=Techweb |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328150301/http://www.techweb.com/wire/security/186701001 |archivedate=March 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the phone number (owned by the phisher, and provided by a [[voice over IP]] service) was dialled, prompts told users to enter their account numbers and PIN. [[Vishing]] (voice phishing) sometimes uses fake caller-ID data to give the appearance that calls come from a trusted organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.silicon.com/research/specialreports/voip/0,3800004463,39128854,00.htm |title=Identity thieves take advantage of VoIP |date=March 21, 2005 |publisher=Silicon.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324073507/http://www.silicon.com/research/specialreports/voip/0%2C3800004463%2C39128854%2C00.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other techniques===
* Another attack used successfully is to forward the client to a bank's legitimate website, then to place a popup window requesting credentials on top of the page in a way that makes many users think the bank is requesting this sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/fraudalert/docs/internet_bank_fraud.pdf |title=Internet Banking Targeted Phishing Attack |publisher=[[Metropolitan Police Service]] |date=June 3, 2005 |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ndG8erWg?url=http://www.met.police.uk/fraudalert/docs/internet_bank_fraud.pdf |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tabnabbing]] takes advantage of tabbed browsing, with multiple open tabs. This method silently redirects the user to the affected site. This technique operates in reverse to most phishing techniques in that it does not directly take the user to the fraudulent site, but instead loads the fake page in one of the browser's open tabs.
* [[Evil twin (wireless networks)|Evil twins]] is a phishing technique that is hard to detect. A phisher creates a fake wireless network that looks similar to a legitimate public network that may be found in public places such as airports, hotels or coffee shops. Whenever someone logs on to the bogus network, fraudsters try to capture their passwords and/or credit card information.

A phishing technique was described in detail in a paper and presentation delivered to the 1987 International [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] Users Group, Interex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Felix, Jerry |author2=Hauck, Chris |lastauthoramp=yes |title=System Security: A Hacker's Perspective |journal=1987 Interex Proceedings |date=September 1987 |volume=8 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
The term 'phishing' is said to have been coined by the well known spammer and hacker in the mid-90s, Khan C Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2002/07/22/story4.html?page=all |title=EarthLink wins $25 million lawsuit against junk e-mailer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded mention of the term is found in the hacking tool [[AOHell]] (according to its creator), which included a function for attempting to steal the passwords or financial details of America Online users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Langberg |title=AOL Acts to Thwart Hackers |date=September 8, 1995 |work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |url=http://simson.net/clips/1995/95.SJMN.AOL_Hackers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Rekouche |first=Koceilah |eprint=1106.4692 |title=Early Phishing |year=2011 |class=cs.CR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early AOL phishing====
Phishing on [[AOL]] was closely associated with the [[warez]] community that exchanged [[copyright infringement of software|unlicensed software]] and the [[black hat]] hacking scene that perpetrated credit card fraud and other online crimes. AOL enforcement would detect words used in AOL chat rooms to suspend the accounts individuals involved in counterfeiting software and trading stolen accounts. The term was used because '&lt;&gt;&lt;' is the single most common tag of HTML that was found in all chat transcripts naturally, and as such could not be detected or filtered by AOL staff. The symbol &lt;&gt;&lt; was replaced for any wording that referred to stolen credit cards, accounts, or illegal activity. Since the symbol looked like a fish, and due to the popularity of [[phreaking]] it was adapted as 'Phishing'. [[AOHell]], released in early 1995, was a program designed to hack AOL users by allowing the attacker to pose as an AOL staff member, and send an [[instant message]] to a potential victim, asking him to reveal his password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,9932,00.html |last=Stutz |first=Michael |title=AOL: A Cracker's Momma! |date=January 29, 1998 |publisher=Wired News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214053144/http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/technology/0%2C1282%2C9932%2C00.html |archivedate=December 14, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to lure the victim into giving up sensitive information, the message might include imperatives such as "verify your account" or "confirm billing information".

Once the victim had revealed the password, the attacker could access and use the victim's account for fraudulent purposes. Both phishing and warezing on AOL generally required custom-written programs, such as [[AOHell]]. Phishing became so prevalent on AOL that they added a line on all instant messages stating: "no one working at AOL will ask for your password or billing information". A user using both an AIM account and an AOL account from an [[ISP]] simultaneously could phish AOL members with relative impunity as internet AIM accounts could be used by non-AOL internet members and could not be actioned (i.e., reported to AOL TOS department for disciplinary action).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phishing.org/history-of-phishing/|title=History of Phishing - Phishing.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{tone inline|date=November 2014}}. In late 1995, AOL crackers resorted to phishing for legitimate accounts after AOL brought in measures in late 1995 to prevent using fake, algorithmically generated [[credit card numbers]] to open accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phishing |work=Word Spy |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/phishing.asp |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, AOL's policy enforcement forced copyright infringement off AOL servers, and AOL promptly deactivate accounts involved in phishing, often before the victims could respond. The shutting down of the [[warez scene]] on AOL caused most phishers to leave the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of AOL Warez |url=http://www.rajuabju.com/warezirc/historyofaolwarez.htm |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9YV2fuL?url=http://www.rajuabju.com/warezirc/historyofaolwarez.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-phishing==
There are anti-phishing websites which publish exact messages that have been recently circulating the internet, such as [[FraudWatch International]] and [[Millersmiles]]. Such sites often provide specific details about the particular messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millersmiles.co.uk |title=Millersmiles Home Page |accessdate=January 3, 2010 |publisher=Oxford Information Services |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QVOm5OO1?url=http://www.millersmiles.co.uk/ |archivedate=July 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fraudwatchinternational.com |title=FraudWatch International Home Page |accessdate=January 3, 2010 |publisher=FraudWatch International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As recently as 2007, the adoption of anti-phishing strategies by businesses needing to protect personal and financial information was low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=Emiley |author2=Wade Baker |author3=John Tedesco |title=Organizations Respond to Phishing: Exploring the Public Relations Tackle Box |journal=Communication Research Reports |year=2007 |volume=24 |issue=4 |page=327 |doi=10.1080/08824090701624239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now there are several different techniques to combat phishing, including legislation and technology created specifically to protect against phishing. These techniques include steps that can be taken by individuals, as well as by organizations. Phone, web site, and email phishing can now be reported to authorities, as described [[Phishing#Monitoring and takedown|below]].

===User training===
[[File:Phish.jpg|thumb|Frame of an animation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission intended to educate citizens about phishing tactics.]]
People can be trained to recognize phishing attempts, and to deal with them through a variety of approaches. Such education can be effective, especially where training emphasises conceptual knowledge&lt;ref name=ALS14&gt;{{cite journal |first3=Michael |last3=Scott |first2=Steve |last2=Love |first1=Nalin |last1=Arachchilage |date=June 1, 2012 |title=Designing a Mobile Game to Teach Conceptual Knowledge of Avoiding 'Phishing Attacks' |url=https://www.academia.edu/2390447/Designing_a_Mobile_Game_to_Teach_Conceptual_Knowledge_of_Avoiding_Phishing_Attacks |journal=International Journal for e-Learning Security |publisher=Infonomics Society |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=127–132 |access-date=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides direct feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protecting People from Phishing: The Design and Evaluation of an Embedded Training Email System |work=Technical Report CMU-CyLab-06-017, CyLab, Carnegie Mellon University. |date=November 2006 |author1=Ponnurangam Kumaraguru |author2=Yong Woo Rhee |author3=Alessandro Acquisti |author4=Lorrie Cranor |author5=Jason Hong |author6=Elizabeth Nunge |url=http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/files/cmucylab06017.pdf |accessdate=November 14, 2006 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070130211610/http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/files/cmucylab06017.pdf |archivedate=January 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|date=2017-03-23|title=Using an Interactive Online Quiz to Recalibrate College Students’ Attitudes and Behavioral Intentions About Phishing|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0735633117699232|journal=Journal of Educational Computing Research|language=en|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1154–1167|doi=10.1177/0735633117699232}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many organisations run regular [[simulated phishing]] campaigns targeting their staff to measure the effectiveness of their training.

People can take steps to avoid phishing attempts by slightly modifying their browsing habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.comodo.com/resources/home/phishing-scams.php |title=Steps to avoid phishing |last1=Hendric |first1=William |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When contacted about an account needing to be "verified" (or any other topic used by phishers), it is a sensible precaution to contact the company from which the email apparently originates to check that the email is legitimate. Alternatively, the address that the individual knows is the company's genuine website can be typed into the address bar of the browser, rather than trusting any [[hyperlink]]s in the suspected phishing message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anti-Phishing Tips You Should Not Follow |work=HexView |url=http://www.hexview.com/sdp/node/24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320035409/http://www.hexview.com/sdp/node/24 |archivedate=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=June 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all legitimate e-mail messages from companies to their customers contain an item of information that is not readily available to phishers. Some companies, for example [[PayPal]], always address their customers by their username in emails, so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion ("''Dear PayPal customer''") it is likely to be an attempt at phishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protect Yourself from Fraudulent Emails |work=PayPal |url=https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_vdc-security-spoof-outside |accessdate=July 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406114742/https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_vdc-security-spoof-outside |archivedate=April 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, PayPal offers various methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their spoof@PayPal.com domain to investigate and warn other customers. However it is it unsafe to assume that the presence of personal information alone guarantees that a message is legitimate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://isc.incidents.org/diary.php?storyid=1194 |last=Zeltser |first=Lenny |title=Phishing Messages May Include Highly-Personalized Information |date=March 17, 2006 |publisher=The SANS Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some studies have shown that the presence of personal information does not significantly affect the success rate of phishing attacks;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2006.org/programme/item.php?id=3533 |title=Designing Ethical Phishing Experiments |author1=Markus Jakobsson |author2=Jacob Ratkiewicz |lastauthoramp=yes |work=WWW '06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9ZCK7Pk?url=http://www2006.org/programme/item.php?id=3533 |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that most people do not pay attention to such details.

Emails from banks and credit card companies often include partial account numbers. However, recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Instills Trust? A Qualitative Study of Phishing |author1=Markus Jakobsson |author2=Alex Tsow |author3=Ankur Shah |author4=Eli Blevis |author5=Youn-kyung Lim |website=informatics.indiana.edu |url=http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/markus/papers/trust_USEC.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306171850/http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/markus/papers/trust_USEC.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the public do not typically distinguish between the first few digits and the last few digits of an account number—a significant problem since the first few digits are often the same for all clients of a financial institution.

The [[Anti-Phishing Working Group]] produces regular report on trends in phishing attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=APWG Phishing Attack Trends Reports |url=https://www.antiphishing.org/resources/apwg-reports/ |website=APWG |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical approaches===
A wide range of technical approaches are available to prevent phishing attacks reaching users or to prevent them from successfully capturing sensitive information.

====Browsers alerting users to fraudulent websites====
[[File:Firefox 2.0.0.1 Phising Alert.png|thumb|Screenshot of Firefox 2.0.0.1 Phishing suspicious site warning]]
Another popular approach to fighting phishing is to maintain a list of known phishing sites and to check websites against the list. One such service  is the [[Google Safe Browsing|Safe Browsing]] service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/static/faq.html Google Safe Browsing FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Web browsers such as [[Google Chrome]], [[Internet Explorer]] 7, [[Mozilla Firefox]] 2.0, [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] 3.2, and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] all contain this type of anti-phishing measure.&lt;ref name=Google /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Franco, Rob |title=Better Website Identification and Extended Validation Certificates in IE7 and Other Browsers |work=IEBlog |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/11/21/495507.aspx |accessdate=May 20, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mq3wifwd?url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/11/21/495507.aspx |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bon Echo Anti-Phishing |work=Mozilla |url=https://www.mozilla.org/projects/bonecho/anti-phishing/ |accessdate=June 2, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/619zgMPR6?url=http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bonecho/anti-phishing/ |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safari 3.2 finally gains phishing protection |date=November 13, 2008 |accessdate=November 15, 2008 |work=Ars Technica |url=https://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/11/13/safari-3-2-finally-gains-phishing-protection |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/619zh5NCV?url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/11/13/safari-3-2-finally-gains-phishing-protection |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.3sharp.com/projects/antiphish/index.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080114211315/http://www.3sharp.com/projects/antiphish/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 14, 2008 |title=Gone Phishing: Evaluating Anti-Phishing Tools for Windows |date=September 27, 2006 |accessdate=October 20, 2006 |publisher=3Sharp}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Firefox 2]] used [[Google]] anti-phishing software. Opera 9.1 uses live [[Blacklist (computing)|blacklists]] from [[Phishtank]], [[cyscon]] and [[GeoTrust]], as well as live [[whitelist]]s from GeoTrust. Some implementations of this approach send the visited URLs to a central service to be checked, which has raised concerns about privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Two Things That Bother Me About Google's New Firefox Extension |work=Nitesh Dhanjani on O'Reilly ONLamp |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2005/12/two_things_that_bother_me_abou.html |accessdate=July 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by Mozilla in late 2006, Firefox 2 was found to be more effective than [[Internet Explorer 7]] at detecting fraudulent sites in a study by an independent software testing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firefox 2 Phishing Protection Effectiveness Testing |url=https://www.mozilla.org/security/phishing-test.html |accessdate=January 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9ZE56Uy?url=http://www.mozilla.org/security/phishing-test.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An approach introduced in mid-2006 involves switching to a special DNS service that filters out known phishing domains: this will work with any browser,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|author=Higgins, Kelly Jackson |title=DNS Gets Anti-Phishing Hook |work=Dark Reading |url=http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=99089&amp;WT.svl=news1_1 |accessdate=October 8, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/612DwHoBd?url=http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=99089&amp;WT.svl=news1_1 |archivedate=August 18, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is similar in principle to using a [[hosts file]] to block web adverts.

To mitigate the problem of phishing sites impersonating a victim site by embedding its images (such as logos), several site owners have altered the images to send a message to the visitor that a site may be fraudulent. The image may be moved to a new filename and the original permanently replaced, or a server can detect that the image was not requested as part of normal browsing, and instead send a warning image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krebs |first=Brian |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/08/using_images_to_fight_phishing.html |title=Using Images to Fight Phishing |date=August 31, 2006 |publisher=Security Fix |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116184842/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/08/using_images_to_fight_phishing.html |archivedate=November 16, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Seltzer |first=Larry |url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1630161,00.asp |title=Spotting Phish and Phighting Back |date=August 2, 2004 |publisher=eWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Augmenting password logins====
The [[Bank of America]] website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bank of America |title=How Bank of America SiteKey Works For Online Banking Security |url=http://www.bankofamerica.com/ |accessdate=January 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/619zhkpkk?url=http://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/sitekey/ |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302181.html |last=Brubaker |first=Bill |title=Bank of America Personalizes Cyber-Security |date=July 14, 2005 |publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of several that asks users to select a personal image (marketed as [[SiteKey]]) and displays this user-selected image with any forms that request a password. Users of the bank's online services are instructed to enter a password only when they see the image they selected. However, several studies suggest that few users refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent.&lt;ref&gt;

A similar system, in which an automatically generated "Identity Cue" consisting of a colored word within a colored box is displayed to each website user, is in use at other financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;

Unlike the website-based image schemes, however, the image itself is shared only between the user and the browser, and not between the user and the website. The scheme also relies on a [[mutual authentication]] protocol, which makes it less vulnerable to attacks that affect user-only authentication schemes.

Still another technique relies on a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and is very difficult for a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.confidenttechnologies.com/products/anti-phishing |title=Dynamic, Mutual Authentication Technology for Anti-Phishing |publisher=Confidenttechnologies.com |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Filtering out phishing mail====
Specialized [[spam filter]]s can reduce the number of phishing emails that reach their addressees' inboxes, or provide post-delivery remediation, analyzing and removing spear phishing attacks upon delivery through email provider-level integration. These approaches rely on [[machine learning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Applied Soft Computing |title=Obtaining the Threat Model for E-mail Phishing |author=Cleber K., Olivo, Altair O., Santin, Luiz S., Oliveira |date=July 2011 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494611002547|doi=10.1016/j.asoc.2011.06.016 |volume=13 |pages=4841–4848}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[natural language processing]] approaches to classify phishing emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=NYS Cyber Security Symposium |title=Phishing E-mail Detection Based on Structural Properties |author1=Madhusudhanan Chandrasekaran |author2=Krishnan Narayanan |author3=Shambhu Upadhyaya |date=March 2006 |url=http://www.albany.edu/iasymposium/2006/chandrasekaran.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216101637/http://www.albany.edu/iasymposium/2006/chandrasekaran.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Carnegie Mellon University Technical Report CMU-ISRI-06-112 |title=Learning to Detect Phishing Emails |author1=Ian Fette |author2=Norman Sadeh |author3=Anthony Tomasic |date=June 2006 |url=http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/isri2006/CMU-ISRI-06-112.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Email address authentication is another new approach.&lt;ref name=DMARC /&gt;

Solutions have also emerged using the mobile phone&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safesigner.com Using the smartphone to verify and sign online banking transactions], SafeSigner.&lt;/ref&gt; (smartphone) as a second channel for verification and authorization of banking transactions.

====Limitations of technical responses====
An article in ''[[Forbes]]'' in August 2014 argues that the reason phishing problems persist even after a decade of anti-phishing technologies being sold is that phishing is "a technological medium to exploit human weaknesses" and that technology cannot fully compensate for human weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Joseph Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg |title=Why You Are at Risk of Phishing Attacks |date=August 25, 2014 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/08/25/why-you-are-at-risk-of-phishing-attacks-and-why-jp-morgan-chase-customers-were-targeted-this-week/ |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2004, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed the first lawsuit against a suspected phisher. The defendant, a [[California]]n teenager, allegedly created a webpage designed to look like the [[America Online]] website, and used it to steal credit card information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/07/21/phishing.scam/index.html |last=Legon |first=Jeordan |title=Phishing scams reel in your identity |date=January 26, 2004 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries have followed this lead by tracing and arresting phishers.

In the [[United States]], [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Patrick Leahy]] introduced the ''[[Anti-Phishing Act of 2005]]'' in [[United States Congress|Congress]] on March 1, 2005. This [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], if it had been enacted into law, would have subjected criminals who created fake web sites and sent bogus emails in order to defraud consumers to fines of up to {{US$|250,000}} and prison terms of up to five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=60404811 |title=Phishers Would Face 5 Years Under New Bill |date=March 2, 2005 |publisher=Information Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies have also joined the effort to crack down on phishing. On March 31, 2005, [[Microsoft]] filed 117 federal lawsuits in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington|U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington]]. The lawsuits accuse "[[John Doe]]" defendants of obtaining passwords and confidential information.

In January 2007, Jeffrey Brett Goodin of California became the first defendant convicted by a jury under the provisions of the [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]].

'''Plumpy'Nut''' is a [[peanut]]-based paste in a plastic wrapper for treatment of [[malnutrition|severe acute malnutrition]] manufactured by [[Nutriset]], a French company.&lt;ref name=off&gt;{{Cite web |title=Plumpy’Nut®: Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) |publisher=Nutriset |url=http://www.nutriset.fr/en/product-range/produit-par-produit/plumpynut-ready-to-use-therapeutic-food-rutf.html |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Rice |title=The Peanut Solution |work=[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05Plumpy-t.html |date=2 September 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing the need for hospitalization, the 92-gram (3¼ oz) packets of this paste can be administered at home and allow larger numbers to be treated.&lt;ref name=off/&gt;

Plumpy'Nut may be referred to in scientific literature as a  [[Therapeutic food#Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food|Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food]] (RUTF) alongside other RUTFs such as BP100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=BP-100™ RUTF Therapeutic food |publisher=Compact for Life |url=http://www.compactforlife.com/bp-100-rutf/ |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutriset has been criticized by [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] for enforcing its Plumpy'nut patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSF: Nutriset patent impeding access to treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition|url=http://www.msfaccess.org/content/msf-nutriset-patent-impeding-access-treatment-severe-acute-malnutrition|accessdate=8 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Plumpy’Nut is used as a treatment for emergency malnutrition cases. It supports rapid weight gain derived from broad nutrient intake which can alleviate a starving child from impending illness or death.&lt;ref name=AJCN/&gt; The product is easy for children to eat because it dispenses readily from a durable, tear-open package. The fortified peanut butter-like paste contains [[vegetable oil|fats]], [[dietary fiber]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s (as essential [[nutrient#Types of nutrient|macronutrients]]), vitamins and minerals (as essential [[micronutrient]]s). Peanut butter itself is a rich source of [[vitamin E]] (45% of the [[Daily Value]], DV, in a 100 gram amount) and [[B vitamins]] (particularly [[niacin]] at 67% DV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition facts for peanut butter, smooth style, without salt, USDA Nutrient Database SR-21 |publisher = Conde Nast|website=nutritiondata.com| url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4453/2|date=2014|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumpy'Nut has a two-year shelf-life and requires no water, preparation, or refrigeration.&lt;ref name=off/&gt; Its ease of use has made mass treatment of malnutrition in [[famine]] situations more efficient than in the past.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike milk, Plumpy'Nut can be administered at home and without medical supervision.&lt;ref name=off/&gt; It also provides [[calories]] and [[essential nutrients]] that restore and maintain body weight and health in severely malnourished children more effectively than [[F-100 and F-75 (foods)|F100]].&lt;ref name="AJCN"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12885713|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/2/302.long|vauthors=Diop el HI, Dossou NI, Ndour MM, Briend A, Wade S |title=Comparison of the efficacy of a solid ready-to-use food and a liquid, milk-based diet for the rehabilitation of severely malnourished children: a randomized trial|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=78|issue=2|pages=302–7|date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has recognized this utility, stating in 2007 that "new evidence suggests... that large numbers of children with severe acute malnutrition can be treated in their communities without being admitted to a health facility or a therapeutic feeding centre,"&lt;ref name=un/&gt; as was implemented in 2007 by [[UNICEF]] and the [[ECHO (European Commission)|European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid Department]] in [[Niger]] to address a malnutrition emergency.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/niger_39675.html | title=ECHO and UNICEF promote Plumpy’nut production to improve child nutrition in Niger | publisher=United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund | date=18 May 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plumpy'nut conforms to the UN definition of a [[Therapeutic food#Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food|Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food]] (RUTF).&lt;ref name=off/&gt;&lt;ref name=un&gt;

Plumpy'nut is not intended for routine nutrition, or for malnutrition in non-famine situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/saying-nuts-to-hunger_b_706798.html | title=Saying “Nuts” to Hunger | publisher=The Huffington Post, Washington, DC | date=6 September 2010 | accessdate=3 July 2016 |vauthors=Sachs J, Fanzo J, Sachs S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peanut allergy|Peanut allergies]] have not been found to be a problem in usage due to a lack of allergic reactions in the target populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2497593|author=Klonick K|title=Peanut Paste Saves Starving African Children|publisher=ABC News|date=1 October 2006|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The ingredients in Plumpy'Nut include "peanut-based paste, with sugar, [[vegetable oil]] and skimmed [[powdered milk|milk powder]], enriched with [[vitamin]]s and [[dietary minerals|minerals]]".&lt;ref name=off/&gt; Plumpy'Nut is said to be "surprisingly tasty".&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Production==
While the majority of Plumpy'Nut was made in France as of 2010, this therapeutic food is easily produced&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; and can be made locally in peanut-growing areas by mixing peanut paste with a slurry of other ingredients provisioned by Nutriset.&lt;ref name="network"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The PlumpyField network : how it works |publisher=Nutriset |url=http://www.nutriset.fr/en/international-networks/plumpyfield-network/plumpyfield-how-it-works.html?searched=plumpyfield&amp;advsearch=oneword&amp;highlight=ajaxSearch_highlight+ajaxSearch_highlight1 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of partner companies and one non-profit organization in the U.S state of [[Rhode Island]] make Plumpy'Nut; six of the factories are in African countries (Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Sudan, Madagascar, Kenya), one is in Haiti and another one in India.&lt;ref name=network/&gt;

Plumpy'Nut is distributed from the manufacturer to geographic areas of need through a complex [[supply chain]]. Forward information flows, such as projections of need, order processes, and payment information, and
backward information flows, including stock monitoring, [[quality assurance]], and performance data
occur through information exchange vulnerable to errors or tardiness associated with supply chain [[fragmentation (economics)|fragmentation]].&lt;ref name="unc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/~/media/Files/documents/cse/unicef-plumpy-nut-supply-chain.pdf|title=UNICEF’s Plumpy'Nut supply chain|author=Swaminathan JK|publisher=University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler Business School, Center for Sustainable Enterprise|date=2009|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/edb873a2-d6ef-11df-aaab-00144feabdc0.html#axzz33bYXDfd6|title=Case study: Getting food to disaster victims|publisher=Financial Times|author=Swaminathan J|date=13 October 2010|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Factors affecting potential for loss of efficiencies in the supply chain are information flow on orders, basis of need, forecasts, flow upstream from field officers and country offices to parties controlling regional distribution and manufacturing by Nutriset, downstream flow of information on delivery times and order status.&lt;ref name=unc/&gt;&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;

A complete two-month regimen for a child costs US$60 [[circa|c.]] 2010.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Tackling malnutrition in Kenya with UNICEF and plumpy nut (6219652473).jpg|thumb|right|Woman giving Plumpy'Nut nutritional aid to her children in [[Kenya]].]]
Inspired by the popular [[Nutella]] spread,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Plumpy'Nut was invented in 1996 by [[André Briend]], a [[France|French]] paediatric nutritionist, and [[Michel Lescanne]], a food-processing engineer.&lt;ref name=off/&gt; Nutella is a spread composed of sugar, modified [[palm oil]], [[hazelnuts]], cocoa, skimmed milk powder, [[whey powder]], [[lecithin]], and [[vanillin]]. In contrast, Plumpy'Nut is a combination of [[peanut paste]], vegetable oil and milk powder, without including chocolate, but containing sugar, vitamins and dietary minerals.

[[Skippy (peanut butter)|Skippy]] may have developed a similar product in the early 1960s, according to a former employee, although it was never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIp45leiLXEC&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;ots=8MRLb3S1zp&amp;dq=in%20the%20late%201950s%20and%20early%201960s%20Skippy%20worked%20on%20and%20formulated%20a%20product%20that%20was%20essentially%20the%20same%20as%20this%20Plumpy'nut&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Creamy &amp; Crunchy: An Informal History of Peanut Butter, the All-American Food | publisher=Columbia University Press | author=Krampner, Jon | year=2013 | pages=218 | isbn=9780231162326 | quote=According to former plant manager and engineer Frank Delfino... In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Skippy worked on and formulated a product that was essentially the same as... Plumpy'nut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent issues===
Nutriset holds patents in many countries (including {{cite patent|US|6346284|patent}}, published in 2002) for the production of nut-based, nutritional foods as pastes, which they have defended to prevent non-licensees in the United States from producing similar products.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; In places where Nutriset does not hold a patent, manufacturers of similar pastes have been stopped from exporting their products to places where Plumpy'Nut is patented.&lt;ref name=irin&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irinnews.org/printreport.aspx?reportid=86979 | title=FOOD: Making peanut butter gets stickier | publisher=UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs | work=IRIN: humanitarian news and analysis | date=11 November 2009 | accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In at least 27 African nations, any non-profit (including [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]]) can make the paste and not pay a license fee.&lt;ref name=twentyseven/&gt;

In 2010, two US non-profit organizations unsuccessfully sued the French company in an attempt to legally produce Plumpy'Nut in the US without paying the royalty fee.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; Mike Mellace, president of one of the organizations claimed that “some children are dying because Nutriset prevents other companies from producing a food which could save their lives.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff |title=Plumpy'Nut goes to court |url=http://www.vita.it/ultimenotizie/plumpy-nut-goes-to-court.html |publisher=vita.it |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505193540/http://www.vita.it/ultimenotizie/plumpy-nut-goes-to-court.html |archivedate=May 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Invalidation of the Nutriset patent may have a positive impact on populations affected by famine, and studies by humanitarian organizations support the idea that having a single, dominant supplier in Nutriset is undesirable.&lt;ref name=sandiego&gt;{{cite web|last=Lavelle|first=Janet|title=Child malnutrition center of legal battle|date=January 16, 2010|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2010/jan/16/child-malnutrition-center-legal-battle/all/?print |publisher= The San Diego Union-Tribune|work=utsandiego.com|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Nutriset argue the US patent is “obvious in light of prior recipes” and “that the patent has essentially conferred monopoly power on Nutriset and thus violated the [[Sherman Act]]".&lt;ref name=internatllaw/&gt; By definition, a [[patent]] grants a temporary monopoly, and Nutriset won the case. Some have suggested a similarity between pharmaceutical company compulsory licensing agreements, in place under the [[WTO]] [[TRIPS Agreement]], and Plumpy'Nut.&lt;ref name=internatllaw&gt;{{cite web|last=Bakhsh|first=Umar R.|title=The Plumpy’Nut predicament: is compulsory licensing a solution?|url=http://studentorgs.kentlaw.iit.edu/ckjip/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/06/07_12JIntellProp2382012.pdf|publisher=Chicago Kent Journal of Intellectual Property|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a threat of legal action against a Norwegian company that was exporting a similar product to Kenya, Nutriset was criticized by [[Médecins Sans Frontières]],&lt;ref name=sandiego/&gt; which stated in an open letter that "Nutriset has been asked repeatedly by us and others for simple, reasonable licensing terms... Instead it appears that [Nutriset has] decided to adopt a policy of aggressive protection of [its] patents that could be considered an abuse in relation to humanitarian products."&lt;ref name=MSF&gt;{{cite web|last=von Schoen-Angerer|first=Tido|title=MSF: Nutriset patent impeding access to treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition|url=http://www.msfaccess.org/sites/default/files/MSF_assets/MalNut/Docs/NUT_letter_NutrisetPatent_ENG_2009.pdf|publisher=Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UNICEF study, commissioned at Duke University and the University of North Carolina, recommended a diversified supplier base of RUTF products to better serve global needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Team Praescient|title=UNICEF’S Mission to End Hunger: Leveraging Analytic Methodologies to Advance Development Goals|url=http://praescientanalytics.com/unicefs-mission-to-end-hunger-leveraging-analytic-methodologies-to-advance-development-goals/|publisher=praescientanalytics.com/|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticism, Nutriset has allowed companies and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] in some African countries to make the paste and not pay license fees.&lt;ref name=twentyseven&gt;{{Cite web |title=Nutriset/IRD’s Patents Usage Agreement |publisher=Nutriset |url=http://www.nutriset.fr/en/access/patents-for-development/online-patent-usage-agreement.html |accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5114">'''Revolutionary tax''' is a major form of funding for [[violent non-state actor]]s such as [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[Terrorism|terrorist]] organizations.  Those outside the organization may consider it to be a euphemism for "[[protection money]]."&lt;ref name=ncua&gt;[http://www.ncua.gov/letters/2002/02-CU-14.pdf Detection of Terrorist Financing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814082429/http://ncua.gov/letters/2002/02-CU-14.pdf |date=2009-08-14 }}, U.S. National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of such groups maintain however that there is no difference between the revolutionary taxes "extorted" by given groups and corporate taxes raised by governments.

Revolutionary taxes are typically extorted from businesses, and they also "play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population."&lt;ref name=ncua/&gt;

==Examples==

The Irish Provisional [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and Corsican [[National Liberation Front of Corsica|FLNC]] have extorted revolutionary taxes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/leg/sem/2002/cdmfl/eng/thony.pdf MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORISM FINANCING: AN OVERVIEW], Jean-François Thony, IMF.org, Seminar on Current Developments in Monetary and Financial Law
Washington, D.C., May 7–17, 2002. "Money laundering and the financing of terrorism may be seen as distinct activities. ... sometimes discreetly called a “revolutionary tax” (ETA, FLNC, IRA)"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the following organizations.

===ETA===
The [[Basque nationalist]] organization [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] depended on revolutionary taxes.&lt;ref name=Tvd&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d4hrXMzAgJYC&amp;pg=PA70 Terrorism versus democracy: the liberal state response], Paul Wilkinson, Frank Cass Publishers, 2001, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2006/06/20/suspected-eta-supporters-arrested-in-cross-border-swoop/ Suspected ETA supporters arrested in cross-border swoop]

At present the amounts required are between 35,000 and 400,000 euros. The annual budget the terrorist organisation needs for the maintenance of its structures is estimated at around 10 million euros. Beyond the Spanish borders, ETA seeks links with similar groups and causes. Hence, it intends to gain the support of ideologically akin groups. It has or has had contacts with the Breton Revolutionary Army, with Corsican and Irish terrorist groups, with revolutionary groups from Latin America, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]] most local and foreign companies pay revolutionary taxes to the [[Maoist]] ''[[New People's Army]]''. According to the army, the tax is a major obstacle for the country's development while the [[New People's Army]] justified it as a tax to be paid upon entering territories controlled by the rebels being a belligerent force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/19/business/worldbusiness/19iht-rebel.html?_r=1 Rebels' 'revolutionary tax' adds to cost of business in Philippines], N.Y.Times, October 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2007/103714.htm Chapter 6 -- Terrorist Organizations], Country Reports on Terrorism 2007, U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
The revolutionary taxes of Colombian guerrilla movements have become more common in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/sjir/3.2.09_urrutia.html Negotiating with Terrorists - A Reassessment of Colombia's Peace Policy], NICOLAS URRUTIA, Stanford Journal of International Relations, vol. 3, issue 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nepal===
The maoist guerillas of [[Nepal]] have also widely extorted revolutionary taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/243/Travel/115 Trekking in the time of terrorism - The east is red with rhododendron and revolution], DAMBAR KRISHNA SHRESTHA, GUPHA POKHARI #243, 15.4.2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
The [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[neo-Nazi]] organisation [[Movimiento Nacionalista Tacuara]] (MNT) demanded a "revolutionary tax" from [[Jewish]] shops in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="Perdue 2012 p. 79"&gt;{{cite book | last=Perdue | first=J.B. | title=The War of All the People: The Nexus of Latin American Radicalism and Middle Eastern Terrorism | publisher=Potomac Books | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-59797-704-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcNy985Q-LQC&amp;pg=PA79 | access-date=1 May 2018 | page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rock for Choice''' (or '''Rock 4 Choice''') was a series of [[benefit concert]]s held over the ten-year period between [[1991 in music|1991]] to [[2001 in music|2001]]. The concerts were designed to allow musicians to show their support for the [[pro-choice|pro-choice movement]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

==Background==
The first Rock for Choice concert was organized by [[L7 (band)|L7]] and music editor Sue Cummings of the ''[[LA Weekly]]'', who brought their idea for a pro-choice benefit concert modeled on [[Bob Geldof]]'s Live Aid.

Rock for Choice's first concert was held at the [[Hollywood Palace]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] on October 25, 1991, and featured [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Hole (band)|Hole]], L7, and Sister Double Happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feminist.org/rock4c/index.html http://feminist.org/rock4c/index.html] ''Feminist Majority Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt;  Concert attendees were encouraged to speak out about women's issues from a politically progressive angle, especially [[abortion rights]], and voter registration. Rock for Choice L7/[[Joan Jett]] concert footage and politics are featured on the rockumentary ''[[Not Bad for a Girl]]''. An after-party that followed the initial concert led Nirvana drummer [[Dave Grohl]] and members of L7 to encourage artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] to do a poster for a future Rock For Choice show, leading to the creation of the poster group [[Jim Evans (artist)|TAZ]]. The TAZ collective went on to do posters for some of the biggest Rock For Choice shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/Static.aspx?Type=News/Placements/2006-01-01-LAAlternative-simple.htm&amp;LeftNav=none&amp;ContentBorderClass=mainBodyContentTabs |title=High Art |accessdate=2010-02-17 |last=Lipton |first=Shana |date=2006-01-01 |work=LA Alternative }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis for Rock for Choice came from an interview that Sue Cummings did with L7 for the ''LA Weekly'', in which the band said they were planning to advertise one of their upcoming local shows as "Rock for Coat Hangers" and donate the proceeds to a pro-choice group. Sue encouraged the band to consider expanding their gig to a larger scale, contending that since there had been many benefit concerts performed in the past in the United States to help resolve famine abroad, it would be appropriate to have similar concerts raising funds for abortion access (which she saw as a more pressing and relevant issue to Americans). Cummings asked the band if they would be willing to invite other artists to play the show, contacted several feminist organizations to find a sponsor, and arranged a meeting with the Feminist Majority when they agreed to participate.

The Rock for Choice concert series originated at about the same time as the [[Riot Grrrl]] movement, made up of a new generation of feminists and rock bands originating in Olympia, Washington. Both Rock for Choice and Riot Grrrl were reacting to the early 1990s bombing of abortion clinics by certain fringe elements of the pro-life movement, and were often associated in the public's mind as a single movement, although few Riot Grrrl bands, with the exception of [[Bikini Kill]], ever played Rock for Choice shows. But Rock for Choice formed an important cultural bridge between the baby boomer feminists of the 1970s, who had organized the Feminist Majority, and the generation X feminists of the 1990s music scene.

The concert series evolved into an organization managed by the Feminist Majority, which released a number of compilation albums featuring artists that supported Rock for Choice. The album ''[[Spirit of '73: Rock for Choice]]'' was named based on the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' Supreme Court decision in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002AYM https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002AYM] ''Amazon.com: Spirit of '73''&lt;/ref&gt;

The final Rock for Choice concert was held in 2001 and was emceed by actress [[Gillian Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://feminist.org/news/newsbyte/uswirestory.asp?id=5426 |title= Sold Out Rock for Choice Concert Sends a Powerful Message: We Won't Go Back!|date=April 9, 2001|publisher=feminist.org |accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sarbadaliya Chhatra Sangram Parishad was formed on 5 January 1969. It was formed through the joining of East Pakistan Student Union (Matia), East Pakistan Chhatra League, East Pakistan Student Union (Menon), and student leaders of Dhaka University Student Union. The Parishad created an Eleven Points Programme that was based on the 1965 Six Point program of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Awami League. The Parishad was based in the University of Dhaka and it became the principal political entity of East Pakistan. The Parishad spread to different universities in East Pakistan.  The Parishad called a meeting on 17 January despite the Police placing [[section 144]]. The police and students clashed in the streets which injured many students and an EPR bus was burned down.&lt;ref name="scsp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rahman|first1=Gazi Md. Mizanur|title=Sarbadaliya Chhatra Sangram Parishad|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sarbadaliya_Chhatra_Sangram_Parishad|website=en.banglapedia.org|publisher=Banglapedia|accessdate=16 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parishad called a strike on 20 January throughout the province. [[Amanullah Asaduzzaman]], a student, was killed by police firing in the strike. The Parishad in response called strikes and processions from 21 to 24 January. On 24 January clashes took places throughout the province between strikers and police personal. Two protesters were killed in Mymensingh due to police action. Many were injured throughout the province. [[Matiur Rahman Mallik]], a class nine student of [[Nabakumar Institution]], and Rustam Ali were killed in Dhaka. 61 activists were killed in the protests.The student league formed Kendriya Chhatra Sangram Parishad on 12 January 1970 thus ending Sarbadaliya Chhatra Sangram Parishad.&lt;ref name="scsp" /&gt; Its protest stopped the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case|Agartala conspiracy]] trial and forced the Pakistan government to release [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=fXjdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Sarbadaliya+Chhatra+Sangram+Parishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjowZ3loN3YAhWEmZQKHUnGAFYQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sarbadaliya%20Chhatra%20Sangram%20Parishad&amp;f=false|title=Subalterns and Raj: South Asia Since 1600|last=Bates|first=Crispin|last2=Bates|first2=Senior Lecturer Modern South Asian History Centre for South Asian Studies Crispin|date=2013-09-16|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781134513758|location=|pages=189|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2011}}
'''Sonfest''' was an annual 3–4 day [[Christian music festival]] held in [[Boonah, Queensland]], [[Queensland]], Australia from 2000 to 2005.

The event was created by record executive Dale Bray and creative director Steven Dix. Sonfest is also the name of an annual music festival held on the campus of [[Mount Vernon Nazarene University]] in Mount Vernon, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sonfest.mvnu.edu/ Sonfest Ohio website]&lt;/ref&gt;

It featured artists and speakers from Australia and around the world. Thousands came from all over Australia for the festival, some people coming from as far as [[New Zealand]]. Some big Christian names that have been at Sonfest include [[Relient K]], [[Pillar (band)|Pillar]], [[Third Day]], [[Audio Adrenaline]], [[Fido (band)|Fido]], [[The Supertones]], [[Wishful Thinking (Australian band)|Wishful Thinking]], [[Newsboys]], [[Jars of Clay]] and many more. It was said that during Sonfest the population of Boonah tripled.

In 2006 the annual Sonfest Festival was canceled with the following message on the Sonfest website:
:''Thank you to everyone who has been enquiring about Sonfest 2006.  Unfortunately Sonfest Music Festival will not be on in 2006.  We thank everyone for their support of Sonfest for the past 5 years and understand that there will be a lot of speculation regarding why this has happened.  Please know that this decision was not made lightly and did not come about due to one overwhelming reason, rather there were several factors that have led to this.  Sonfest is still very dedicated to touring the top Christian bands from around the world and we still hope to be able to restart Sonfest in the future.''

==2009 Event==
In early November, [[Easterfest]] (formerly the [[Australian Gospel Music Festival]]) announced on their website that Sonfest would return in January 2009. On 26 January 2009, Sonfest was revived as a one-day festival held at Citipointe Church at Mansfield, Brisbane. It was claimed by organisers that they would gauge interest in the one-day event to determine the resurrection of a longer event, however the lack of headline artists (the only international artist being [[Family Force Five]]) and the short time period resulted in reduced attendance. Sonfest did not return in 2010.

'''SpaceX CRS-18''', also known as '''SpX-18''', is a [[Commercial Resupply Services|Commercial Resupply Service mission]] to the [[International Space Station]] currently manifested to be launched in May 2019 aboard a [[Falcon 9]] rocket.&lt;ref name="spxnow" /&gt; The mission was contracted by [[NASA]] and is flown by [[SpaceX]].

==Launch schedule history==
On February 2016, it was announced that NASA had awarded a contract extension to SpaceX for five CRS additional missions ([[SpaceX CRS-16|CRS-16]] to [[SpaceX CRS-20|CRS-20]]).&lt;ref name=sn-20160224spxwinsaddlcrs1 /&gt; {{asof|2016|06}}, a NASA Inspector General report had this mission manifested for December 2018,&lt;ref name=nasaaig-2016025 /&gt; but this was pushed back to no earlier than May 2019.&lt;ref name="spxnow" /&gt;

==Primary payload==
NASA has contracted for the CRS-18 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date/time of launch, and [[orbital elements|orbital parameters]] for the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] [[space capsule]]. It will carry the third [[International Docking Adapter]] (IDA-3).&lt;ref name=pietrobon&gt;{{cite web |title=United States Commercial ELV Launch Manifest |url=http://www.sworld.com.au/steven/space/uscom-man.txt |first=Steven |last=Pietrobon |date=August 20, 2018 |access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Telescope trailer 22.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A trailer-mounted [[Newtonian telescope]] on daytime display at the [[Stellafane]] star party in Vermont.]]

A '''star party''' is a gathering of amateur [[astronomer]]s for the purpose of observing [[astronomical object|objects]] and [[celestial event|events]] in the [[sky]]. Local star parties may be one-night affairs, but larger events can last up to a week or longer and attract hundreds or even thousands of participants. Many clubs have monthly star parties during the warmer months. Large regional star parties are held annually and are an important part of the [[hobby]] of [[amateur astronomy]].  A naturally dark site away from [[light pollution]] is typical. 

Participants bring [[telescope]]s and [[binoculars]] of all [[List of telescope types|types]] and sizes and spend the nights observing [[astronomical object]]s such as [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[star]]s, and [[deep-sky object]]s together. [[Astrophotography]] and [[CCD imaging]] are also very popular. At larger star parties, lectures, swap meets, exhibitions of [[amateur telescope making|home-built telescopes]], contests, tours, raffles, and other similar activities are common. Commercial vendors selling a variety of astronomical equipment may also be present. As with other hobbyist gatherings, much camaraderie and discussion of various aspects of the hobby occurs at any star party.

==History==
The idea of a star party is not new and allegedly goes back at least as far as [[George III of the United Kingdom]], who was passionately interested in [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sloughmuseum.co.uk/the_kings_astronomer.htm The King's Astronomer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116065146/http://www.sloughmuseum.co.uk/the_kings_astronomer.htm |date=2007-11-16 }} Retrieved 2007-12-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/george3.html George III biography page] Retrieved 2007-12-12&lt;/ref&gt; On nights when poor weather blocked the view of the real stars and planets, attendants are said to have hung paper lanterns marked with drawings in the trees around the royal palace to provide something else for the King and his guests to spot through their telescopes.

==Public star parties==
Star parties whose focus is on bringing the stars to the people are often staged in urban areas where people congregate in large numbers. This is in contrast to star parties typically held in remote dark-sky areas more conducive to stargazing.

In the US, notable star parties include the annual [[Winter Star Party]], held in the Florida Keys; the [[Mid Atlantic Star Party]], held on the east coast of the United States; the [[Oregon Star Party]]; the [[Stellafane|Stellafane Convention]], held in Vermont; the [[Texas Star Party]], held in west Texas; and the Okie-Tex Star Party, held near Kenton, Oklahoma. In the United Kingdom, notable annual star parties include the Spring[http://www.starparty.org/] and Autumn[http://starparty.las-astro.org.uk/index.php] Equinox star parties held at Kelling Heath Holiday Park[http://www.kellingheath.co.uk/] and Kielder[http://kielderforeststarcamp.org/] in Northumbria. In Australia, the [[Astronomical Society of New South Wales#South Pacific Star Party|South Pacific Star Party]] is held each year.

"'''The Blood Line'''" is the tenth and final episode of ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'', the fourth series of the British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Torchwood]]''. It was first broadcast in the United States on [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] on 9 September 2011.

''Torchwood: Miracle Day'' follows the aftermath of a day where humanity has stopped being able to die. In the episode, a team called [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood]] seek to stop the "Miracle" affecting humanity's ability to die, which is engineered by a group of human families seeking to control the world.

In 2012, creator [[Russell T Davies]] announced that the show will be on indefinite hiatus, citing personal reasons, making "The Blood Line" the default [[series finale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Brew |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/torchwood/23238/russell-t-davies-on-the-future-of-torchwood |title=Russell T Davies on the future of Torchwood |publisher=Den of Geek |date=30 October 2012 |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/torchwood-season-5-delay-scott-163133/ |title='Torchwood' Season 5 Won't Air For 'A While' |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Now aware that [[Jack Harkness|Jack]]'s blood is drawn towards the Blessing, the [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood]] team uses small amounts of the blood to determine headings towards the two sites. [[Rex Matheson|Rex]] and [[Esther Drummond|Esther]] contact the CIA for assistance in infiltrating the Buenos Aires site of the Blessing, at the same time keeping Jack, [[Gwen Cooper|Gwen]], and [[Oswald Danes|Oswald]]'s presence in Shanghai a secret. Director Shapiro agrees to the request and puts his team on the task, including Charlotte, who surreptitiously reports the mission to the Three Families. A detachment of the Argentinian Army under the command of Captain Federico Santos soon arrives to assist Rex and Esther, but while the group is loading up, a Three Families double agent detonates a suicide bomb, making the other soldiers Category 1 and destroying Rex and Esther's supply of Jack's blood. Rex, Esther, and Captain Santos survive unharmed, and Rex tells Santos to report that he and Esther were killed in the blast in order to better allow them to infiltrate the Blessing site.

At the CIA, Director Shapiro realizes the Three Families mole must be inside his team, and has Noah run a newly developed trace program to track any recent phone calls made using the Three Families' method of avoiding traces. Realizing she is moments from being discovered, Charlotte calmly retrieves a hidden explosive device from a side office, leaves it inside her purse in the main meeting room, and leaves. The resulting explosion 'category 1s' Shapiro and the rest of his team and lightly injures Charlotte, shielding her from any suspicion.

Jack, Gwen, and Oswald successfully infiltrate the Shanghai Blessing site and make their way to its exposed face, where they meet the Mother, [[Jilly Kitzinger]], and several armed guards. The guards quickly stand down when Oswald reveals he is wearing an explosive vest (at Jack's suggestion). This advantage seems short-lived when a radio transmission from the Cousin at the Buenos Aires site reveals that Three Families operatives there have captured Esther and Rex, but when Oswald expresses that he didn't expect to leave Shanghai alive, the operatives temporarily stand down.  After spending some time examining the face of the Blessing, deducing that it generates a morphic field linking the human race, Jack and Gwen question the Mother about the Miracle; she reveals that the Miracle was produced by introducing Jack's immortal blood to the Blessing- causing it to disperse immortality to the whole human race as a 'defence' to a perceived 'attack'-, and furthermore is simply the first part in a larger plan to assert control of the world. By stopping death and destabilizing the economy, the Families are now poised to take control of the banks, thereby influencing the world governments, eventually leading to a fascist oligarchy which can "decide who lives, how long, where, and why."

When Jack moves to open his veins and release his blood into the Blessing (reasoning that his now-mortal blood would 'prompt' the Blessing to restore humanity's ability to die), the Mother stops him, explaining that this will not undo the Miracle, because the original effect required Jack's blood to be introduced at both Blessing sites simultaneously. Since Rex and Esther's supply of Jack's blood was destroyed, there is no way to do this, and the Mother orders all of Torchwood killed. Before this can happen, Rex manages to interrupt and claims that he still has some of Jack's blood with him—or rather in him. Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, Esther helped Rex transfuse almost all of Jack's blood into his body, which he notes only did not kill him because of the Miracle. The Mother counters that reversing the Miracle would require almost all of the blood in both Rex and Jack's bodies, which would likely kill at least one of them once the Miracle reverted, but Rex and Jack do not back down. The Cousin then shoots Esther, telling Rex that by undoing the Miracle he will now be killing Esther forever.  Rex falters, torn by his feelings for Esther, but after reassurances from Jack and Gwen he rises and opens the wound over his heart, releasing Jack's blood into the Blessing. Simultaneously Gwen shoots Jack through the heart, releasing his blood as well.

The Miracle reverts almost immediately, accompanied by an effect which Gwen calls "a breath": all of the world's Category 1 patients regain consciousness for a few seconds, then pass away in the next breath. This includes Gwen's father, who awakes in time to hear his wife wishing him goodbye over the phone. At the same time both of the Blessing sites begin to shake, making the structure around them unstable. Oswald grabs the Mother and urges Gwen to leave; she does, but as the exit elevator rises, Jack comes back to life. A brief struggle ensues between Jilly and Gwen before Gwen incapacitates Jilly, returns in the elevator and rescues Jack. The Mother begs Oswald to let her go, but Oswald proclaims he is happy to die and go to hell; as that is where "all the bad little girls" go. Jack and Gwen escape of the facility just seconds before Oswald detonates his explosives, destroying the Shanghai facility. Jilly follows close behind but falls to the ground, Jack and Gwen are unable to go back for her and she is engulfed in the explosion. The Buenos Aires team moves to leave as well, but before the Cousin can make it out, Rex regains consciousness long enough to grab him and throw him over the edge of the chasm around the Blessing. Rex falls to the ground next to Esther, the two watching each other die, but are rescued by Captain Santos and members of the Argentinian Army. Paramedics immediately start working to revive both Rex and Esther.

Several months later, Jilly Kitzinger, having survived the destruction of the Shanghai facility, meets the Blue-Eyed Man at a familiar park bench. When she pleads that she has no place to go and no life to live, he offers her a chance to participate in the Three Families' "Plan B", then departs; after some delay, Jilly follows. Elsewhere, Gwen, [[Rhys Williams (Torchwood)|Rhys]], Jack, Charlotte and Rex attend a funeral for Esther. Afterward, as Charlotte is leaving, Rex receives recovered data from Noah's computer, and discovers the phone trace indicating that Charlotte is the mole. When Rex tries to stop her from leaving, Charlotte shoots him and is almost immediately gunned down by other agents. Jack and Gwen rush to Rex's side only to find him without a pulse, dead, but seconds later Rex gasps and regains consciousness. As he opens his shirt a stunned Jack, Gwen, and Rhys watch in shock as Rex's wounds heal completely.

==Broadcast and reception==
When "The Blood Line" premiered in the U.S on 9 September 2011, it received an audience of 0.95 million. In the UK, it fared relatively well against the viewing figure drop after [[Children of Earth|Torchwood: Children of Earth]] with a consolidated figure of 5.13 million. 

Very much like the rest of the 10-part series, "The Blood Line" garnered a mixed response from television critics and the Torchwood fan base. The ''Guardian's'' Dan Martin noted that Torchwood finally showed its best in the series finale "with explosions, bloodshed and forced philosophical standoffs at every turn." Martin also comments that the story of Gwen's dad was closed with "class."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/sep/10/torchwood-miracle-day-episode-10 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Dan | last=Martin | title=Torchwood: Miracle Day – episode 10 | date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, [[Den of Geek]]'s Simon Brew was more hesitant, claiming it was 'an otherwise busy, but rarely brilliant finale. To be clear, I didn't hate it, nor do I have an urge to pour buckets of scorn on it. But I think it was one of the least interesting episodes in the series, for the most part. And as someone's who's enjoyed Miracle Day, that was a disappointment.' On a positive note, he did also say in regards to the open-ended [[cliffhanger]], ' Torchwood has been very good at burning bridges at the end of its series, with finales that force the show to move to a new place for the following run.' 

In a negative review for [[Uproxx]], Alan Sepinwall said 'the season was too far gone for the finale to do much in the way of redeeming it, but we at least could have gone out on an interesting note. Instead, there were lots of explosions, lots of yelling, and very little that held my attention or made me feel anything in the way that, say, some of the sacrifices in "Children of Earth" did.' He also criticised the effect of the cliffhanger, saying 'so it turns out that this huge world-changing event was just a "trial run" for an even bigger plan on the part of the bad guys? Does anyone (other than Davies) think that what the series needs is to get even bigger?'

While researching the book, Vaillant learned that the oral tradition surrounding The Golden Spruce is considered the property of various clans throughout the Pacific Northwest and requires permission to retell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeanine-barone/a-land-where-writers-are-_b_7308120.html | title = A Land Where Writers Are Revered | date = 6 December 2017 | accessdate = 4 May 2018 | publisher = ''HuffPost'' | author = Jeanie Barone }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about the challenge of writing a book where principal characters are absent or dead, Vaillant said, "Virtually everyone leaves a trail behind them in the form of tracks, objects, relationships, official documents, and the memories of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-exchange-john-vaillant-on-the-siberian-tiger | title = The Exchange: John Vaillant on the Siberian Tiger | date = 2 September 2010 | accessdate = 4 May 2018 | publisher = ''The New Yorker'' | author = Ian Crouch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The book tells the story of [[Kiidk'yaas]], or The Golden Spruce, which was a [[Sitka Spruce]] [[tree]] venerated by the [[Haida people]]. The tree itself contained a genetic mutation causing it to appear golden in color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/05/when-i-was-a-child-i-read-books-by-marilynne-robin.html | title = When I Was A Child I Read Books by Marilynne Robinson | date = 1 May 2012 | accessdate = 4 May 2018 | publisher = ''Paste Magazine'' | author = Kurt Armstrong }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was felled in [[Haida Gwaii]] by environmentalist [[Grant Hadwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679760 | title = Killing the Golden Spruce | date = 3 June 2005 | accessdate = 4 May 2018 | publisher = ''NPR'' | author = Michelle Norris }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prpeak.com/culture/career-change-births-award-winning-author-john-vaillant-1.2185418 | title = Career change births award-winning author John Vaillant | date = 26 February 2016 | accessdate = 4 May 2018 | publisher = ''Powel River Peak'' | author = Jason Schreurs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'':

:"The felling of a celebrated giant golden spruce tree in British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islands takes on a potent symbolism in this probing study of an unprecedented act of eco-vandalism...It is also, in his telling, a land of virtually infinite natural resources overmatched by an even greater human rapaciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-393-05887-1 | title = THE GOLDEN SPRUCE: A True Story of Myth, Madness and Greed | accessdate = 4 May 2018 | publisher = ''Publishers Weekly'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

''The Golden Spruce'' won the 2005 [[Governor General's Awards]] for non-fiction.&lt;ref name="montrealgazette.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movies/movie-review-one-mans-desperate-act-revisited-in-hadwins-judgement | title = Movie review: One man's desperate act revisited in Hadwin's Judgement | date = 24 November 2015 | accessdate = 4 May 2018 | publisher = ''The Montreal Gazette'' | author = T'Cha Dunlevy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru''''' (''{{lang-en|Braveman - Chapter One}}'') or simply '''''Theeran''''' is a 2017 Indian [[action thriller]]&lt;ref name="OB"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/operation-bawariaon-silver-screen-now/article20493784.ece|title='Operation Bawaria' that inspired Karthi's Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=16 July 2018|journal=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/theeran-adhigaaram-ondru-is-a-commercial-action-thriller-with-realistic-treatment-says-karthi-4189325.html|title=Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru is a commercial action thriller with realistic treatment, says Karthi|website=Firstpost.com|accessdate=16 July 2018|date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; film written and directed by [[H. Vinoth]] and produced by S. R. Prakashbabu and [[S. R. Prabhu]] of [[Dream Warrior Pictures]]. The story is based on true events from the [[Operation Bawaria]] case, which involved the nefarious activity of dacoits and its eventual containment by Tamil Nadu police. [[Karthi]] and [[Rakul Preet Singh]] play the lead roles in this movie, while [[Abhimanyu Singh]] played the prime antagonist. Along with the Telugu dubbed version titled ''Khakee - The Power of Police'', the film was released on 17 November 2017. A Hindi dubbed version titled ''Theeran'' was released on [[YouTube]] by Goldmines Telefilms on 24 June 2018.

== Plot ==
The film begins with a scene from a police station where Sasi, the police officer in charge, orders that the documented criminal cases in the form of manuscripts be converted into digital format. During this process he comes across a really spine chilling [[dacoity]] murder case from several years ago. After reading the case history, he calls up the police officer who had taken charge of the case, Theeran Thirumaran ([[Karthi]]).

The story shifts to the year 1995, where Theeran is in his police training college undergoing training to be posted as DSP from TNPSC ([[Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission]]) exams. He tops the training period. Simultaneously, in a house along the highway of [[Tamil Nadu]], a group of dacoits wreck the house by barging in killing all the people inside gruesomely and taking the belongings.

Meanwhile, Theeran returns to his hometown of [[Tanjavur]], falls in love with his new neighbor Priya ([[Rakul Preet Singh]]), and marries her. Later, Theeran becomes known in the police department for his ways of handling various cases and he is later moved to [[Ponneri]] after a dacoital attack. Police Inspector Satya ([[Bose Venkat]]) and Theeran both handle the case, but lead nowhere with the case. Therefore, in 2003, Theeran, Sathya, and a group of other police officers go around India to see if they are able to identify the fingerprints of the dacoits. During this process Theeran learns that these dacoits are actually tribe members of the left over cultural groups after the Indian Independence. They are eventually stopped by the carelessness of their superior officers and the case is put on hold.

Later in 2003 the dacoits raid the house of the ruling party's MLA and kill him. The government is under heavy pressure from the public, and the [[Home Minister]] gives Theeran all powers and a full team to nab the dacoits. A year later, they find one fingerprint match in [[Uttar Pradesh]] prison and go to a lorry station to capture the dacoit. Learning that the lorry has left and it is heading to Ponneri, Theeran and the other officers rush to stop them. The dacoits raid Sathya's house and kill his wife ([[Sonia (actress)|Sonia]]), and also injure Priya and put her in a coma.

Angered by this incident, Theeran, with the help of higher officials, puts together a team to capture the gang of dacoits lead by Oma ([[Abhimanyu Singh]]). They camp in [[Rajasthan]] with the help of a local police officer. They come to know that the gang members except Oma are in their village so they visit the village only to be sent out by the villagers. While the case is going on, Theeran learns that Priya died. This fuels his anger, which makes him even more motivated to find Oma. The team learns that there is a way to bring Oma out from his village. So he captures the organizer of the gang and one of the gang members and puts them in police custody. Infuriated Oma vows to kill Theeran and his team. Theeran gets information that Oma will be on a train which is infiltrated by the team, but Oma escapes to a nearby village. Theeran and his team walk to the village and reside there for the night. Oma's gang infiltrates the village, destroying it and killing Theeran's teammates. Finally, Theeran captures Oma, brings him to Tamil Nadu, and gets him a death sentence.

Now in 2017, it is revealed that Theeran has a boring useless post in the Traffic Vigilance Department because he is straightforward and lives alone. Theeran is visited by Sathya, Sathya's daughter, and Sasi. Sasi salutes him. The movie ends with a note conveying "The film is dedicated to all the people in the police department who fought and arrested those dacoits, and we thank them for their bravery and courage. The officers involved in this case were not recognized by the government by providing any honorary awards, neither were they promoted to higher posts".

== Production ==
Following the success of his first film ''[[Sathuranga Vettai]]'' (2014), director [[H. Vinoth]] was keen to make a sequel to the film starring either [[Suriya]] or [[Ajith Kumar]], but their reluctance meant that he moved on to work on a different project based on the [[Operation Bawaria]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-vinoth-on-karthi-starrer-khakee/article19949339.ece|title=Delving into cop's psyche|first=Y.

==Historical events==
The film depicts [[Operation Bawaria]], the investigation of a series of [[dacoity]] cases by the [[Tamil Nadu Police|Tamil Nadu Police Department]]. The operation led to the gunning down of two members of a criminal gang belonging to the [[Bawariya]] tribe from [[Uttar Pradesh]] as well as further arrests in the 2000s. Armed dacoits had struck affluent houses along National Highways in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The operation against the criminals was officially launched in January 2005 soon after the murder of [[AIADMK]] MLA Sudarsanam from [[Gummidipoondi]].&lt;ref name="OB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/2005/01/10/stories/2005011005940100.htm|title=The Hindu : Tamil Nadu News : Gummidipoondi MLA shot dead|website=www.thehindu.com|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special team led by the then [[Director general of police|Director General of Police]] [[S. R. Jangid|S.R.Jangid]], worked in coordination with the [[Uttar Pradesh Police]] and intelligence agencies to track down the wanted criminals — Oma Bawaria, Bsura Bawaria, and Vijay Bawaria among others. The teams worked for several weeks to put together information and camped in remote locations in [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab]] before gunning down Bsura Bawaria and Vijay Bawaria. The other prime suspects, Oma Bawaria, and K. Lakshman alias Ashok Bawaria, were then arrested and brought to Tamil Nadu where they were convicted and awarded the death penalty by a special court.&lt;ref name="OB"/&gt;

The movie was made in close consultation with Jangid and the other officers involved in the operation.&lt;ref name="OB"/&gt; Post-release of the film, Jangid appreciated the team for their realistic portrayal of events and praised the director's research for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/181117/real-life-theeran-talks-about-the-film.html|title=Real life 'Theeran' talks about the film|date=19 November 2017|website=Deccanchronicle.com|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-16/ips-sr-jangid-the-real-theeran-reveals-about-the-hardcore-real-action.html|title=IPS SR Jangid the real Theeran reveals about the hardcore real action|date=20 November 2017|website=Behindwoods.com|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Théâtre Graslin - Place Graslin, Nantes.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Facade of the Théâtre Graslin]]
The '''Théâtre Graslin''' is a theatre and [[opera house]] in the city of [[Nantes]] in [[France]].  Created in a new district of the city in the late 18th Century by the local architect [[Mathurin Crucy]] and named after the owner of the land, Jean-Louis Graslin. Built in the Italian style, the auditorium holds 823 people.

Inaugurated on 23 March 1788 it quickly became a major opera house for the city which nowadays, along with the "Grand Théâtre d'Angers", combines with Angers to form a joint Angers-Nantes opera.

Unfortunately, it was destroyed by fire 1796, but it was reconstructed to coincide with the 1811 visit by Emperor Napoléon 1st. It was restored again in 2003 and continues to be used for opera and other performances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20770">There have been various accounts of persons who allegedly [[time travel|travelled through time]] reported by the press or circulated on the Internet. These reports have generally turned out either to be [[hoax]]es or to be based on incorrect assumptions, incomplete information, or interpretation of [[fiction]] as [[fact]], many being now recognized as [[urban legend]]s.

==Travellers==

=== Charlotte Anne Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain===
[[File:PTV024.jpg|thumb|The Petit Trianon in 2005, where the incident purportedly took place.ì]]

{{main article|Moberly–Jourdain incident}}
The Moberly–Jourdain incident, or the Ghosts of [[Petit Trianon]] or [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] ({{lang-fr|les fantômes du Trianon}} / ''les fantômes de Versailles'') refers to claims of [[time travel]] and [[list of reportedly haunted locations|haunting]]s made by [[Charlotte Anne Moberly]] (1846–1937) and [[Eleanor Jourdain]] (1863–1924). In 1911, Moberly and Jourdain published a book entitled ''An Adventure'', under the names of "Elizabeth Morison" and "Frances Lamont". Their book describes a visit they made to the ''Petit Trianon'', a small ''château'' in the grounds of the [[Palace of Versailles]] where they claimed they saw [[ghosts]] including [[Marie Antoinette]] and others. Their story caused a sensation, and was subject to much ridicule.

==="Chaplin's Time Traveller"===
[[File:1928-cell-phone-cropped.jpg|thumb|A still from ''The Circus'' appearing to show a passer-by talking on a cellphone]]
In October 2010, Northern Irish filmmaker [[George Clarke (filmmaker)|George Clarke]] uploaded a [[video clip]] entitled "Chaplin's Time Traveller" to [[YouTube]]. The clip analyzes bonus material in a DVD of the [[Charlie Chaplin]] film ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]''. Included in the DVD is footage from the film's Los Angeles premiere at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in 1928. At one point, a woman is seen walking by, holding up an object to her ear. Clarke said that, on closer examination, she was talking into a thin, black device that had appeared to be a "[[Mobile phone|phone]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/time-traveler-1928-charlie-chaplin-film/story?id=11992878 'Time Traveller' in 1928 Charlie Chaplin Film? - ABC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke concluded that the woman was possibly a time traveller.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/10/28/2010-10-28_time_traveler_caught_on_film_in_1928_filmmaker_claims_find_in_charlie_chaplins_t.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Time traveller caught on film in 1928? Filmmaker claims find in Charlie Chaplin's 'The Circus' DVD | first=Michael | last=Sheridan | date=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clip received millions of hits and was the subject of televised news stories.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/11/debunking-the-charlie-chaplin-time-travel-video/65486/|title=Debunking the Charlie Chaplin Time Travel Video|last=Jackson|first=Nicholas|date=November 1, 2010|work=The Atlantic Monthly|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Jackson, associate editor for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', says the most likely answer is that she was using a portable hearing aid, a technology that was just being developed at the time.&lt;ref name="nydailynews" /&gt; Philip Skroska, an archivist at the Bernard Becker Medical Library of [[Washington University]] in St. Louis, thought that the woman might have been holding a rectangular [[ear trumpet]].&lt;ref name="LSci"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|title=Time Traveler' May Just Be Hard of Hearing|url=http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/time-traveler-chaplin-film-101028.html|work=Strange News|publisher=LiveScience|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Daily News]]'' writer Michael Sheridan said the device was probably an early hearing aid, perhaps manufactured by [[Acousticon]].&lt;ref name="nydailynews" /&gt;

===Present day hipster at 1941 bridge opening===
[[File:Time travelling cool dude.png|thumb|left|"The Time Travelling [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipster]]"]]
A photograph from 1941 of genuine authenticity of the re-opening of the South Fork Bridge in [[Gold Bridge]], [[British Columbia]], was alleged to show a time traveler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2010/1028/Time-traveler-caught-on-film.-Hey-why-not|title=Time traveler caught on film. Hey, why not?|author=Eoin O'Carroll|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that his clothing and sunglasses were of the present day and not of the styles worn in the 40s.

Further research suggested that the present day appearance of the man may not have been so new. The style of [[sunglasses]] first appeared in the 1920s. On first glance the man is taken by many to be wearing a printed T-shirt, but on closer inspection it seems to be a sweater with a sewn-on emblem, the kind of clothing often worn by sports teams of the period. The shirt is very similar to the one that was used by the [[Montreal Maroons]], an ice hockey team from that era. The remainder of his clothing would appear to have been available at the time, though his clothes are far more [[casual attire|casual]] than those worn by the other individuals in the photograph.&lt;ref name="forgetomori"&gt;{{citation|url=http://forgetomori.com/2010/fortean/time-traveler-caught-in-museum-photo/|date=April 15, 2010|title=Time Traveler Caught in Museum Photo?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate centres on whether the image genuinely shows a time traveller, has been [[Photoshopped]] or is simply being mistaken as [[anachronistic]].&lt;ref name="forgetomori" /&gt; The "Time Traveling Hipster" became a case study in viral Internet phenomena in museums which was presented at the [[Museums and the Web]] 2011 conference in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://conference.archimuse.com/mw2011/papers/mystery_1940s_time_traveller Harkness, D., ''et al.'', The Mystery of the "1940s Time Traveller": The Changing Face of Online Brand Monitoring.] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707055814/http://conference.archimuse.com/mw2011/papers/mystery_1940s_time_traveller |date=2012-07-07 }} In J.

===Rudolph Fentz===

{{main article|Rudolph Fentz}}

The story of Rudolph Fentz is an urban legend from the early 1950s and has been repeated since as a reproduction of facts and presented as evidence for the existence of [[time travel]]. The essence of the legend is that in New York City in 1951 a man wearing 19th-century clothes was hit by a car. The subsequent investigation revealed that the man had disappeared without trace in 1876. The items in his possession suggested that the man had traveled through time from 1876 to 1950 directly.

The [[folklorist]] Chris Aubeck investigated the story and found it originated in a science fiction book of the 1950s, ''A Voice from the Gallery'' by  Ralph M. Holland, which had copied the tale from "I'm Scared", a short story by [[Jack Finney]] (1911–1995), from which the Fentz tale originated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://postcardfrommagonia.blogspot.com/2005/08/note-versions-of-following-article.html Full story in Chris Aubeck Blog] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708060849/http://postcardfrommagonia.blogspot.com/2005/08/note-versions-of-following-article.html |date=2011-07-08 }}this blog has since been removed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Titor===
{{main article|John Titor}}

Between 2000 and 2001, an [[bulletin board system|online bulletin board]] user self-identified as John Titor became popular as he claimed to be a time traveler from 2036 on a military mission. Holding the [[many-worlds interpretation]] as correct and consequently every time travel paradox as impossible, he stated that many events which occurred up to his time would indeed occur in this timeline. These included a devastating civil war in the US in 2008 followed by a short nuclear [[World War III]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karl Simanonok |url=http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com/CopyrightProof.cfm |title=JOHN TITOR VALIDITY TEST BASED ON PREDICTION OF CIVIL WAR BY 2004-2005 |publisher=Johntitor.strategicbrains.com |date=2003-05-19|accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following his last posts and disappearance in 2001, the non-fulfilment of his specific predictions made his popularity decrease. Criticism has pointed out flaws in Titor's stories and investigations suggested his character may be a hoax and a creation of two siblings from Florida.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;Who was John Titor, the time traveller who came from 2036 to warn us of a nuclear war? [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11945420/Who-was-John-Titor-the-time-traveller-who-came-from-2036-to-warn-us-of-a-nuclear-war.html Telegraph.co], retrieved April 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, the story has been retold on numerous web sites, in a book, in the Japanese [[visual novel]]/[[anime]] ''[[Steins;Gate]]'', and in a play. He may also have been discussed occasionally on the radio show ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2004/08/06.html |title=John Titor, Recap |publisher=Coasttocoastam.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, the Titor story may be unique in terms of broad appeal from an originally limited medium, an Internet discussion board.

===Bob White/Tim Jones===
Similar to John Titor, Bob White or Tim Jones sent an unknown number of [[email spam|spam]] emails onto the internet between 2001 and 2003. The subject of the emails was always the same, that the individual was seeking to find someone who could supply a "Dimensional Warp Generator." In some instances, he claimed to be a time traveler stuck in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/timetravelspam.html|title=Museum of Hoaxes - Time Traveller Spam|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in others he claimed to be seeking the parts only from other time travelers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grapefruitopia.com/benjymous/timetravel.shtml Grapefruit Utopia -Time Traveller Spam] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204043629/http://grapefruitopia.com/benjymous/timetravel.shtml |date=2011-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several recipients began to respond in kind, claiming to have equipment such as the requested dimensional warp generator. One recipient, Dave Hill, set up an online shop from which the time traveler purchased the warp generator (formerly a Hard Drive Motor), while another Dave charged thousands of dollars for time-travel "courses" before he would sell the requested hardware.  

The name "Bob White" was taken from an alias that the second Dave used when responding (a reference to the "Bobwhites" of Trixie Belden-fame).&lt;ref name="wired1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2003/08/60141|work=Wired|title=Turn Back the Spam of Time|date=2003-08-29|author=Brian McWilliams|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219070638/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2003/08/60141|archivedate=December 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon afterward, the time traveler was identified as professional spammer Robert J. Todino (known as "Robby"). Todino's attempts to travel in time were a serious belief, and while he believed he was "perfectly mentally stable," his father was concerned that those replying to his mails had been preying on Todino's psychological problems. 

In his book ''Spam Kings'', journalist Brian&amp;nbsp;S. McWilliams, who had originally uncovered Todino's identity for [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]], revealed that Todino had been previously diagnosed with [[dissociative disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]], explaining the psychological problems his father had spoken of.&lt;ref name="wired1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SpamKings"&gt;Brian S. McWilliams, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h1K1bIcfhjcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Spam+Kings:+The+Real+Story+behind+the+High-Rolling+Hucksters+Pushing+Porn,+Pills,&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=utWcTfzjGtS38QOyp_HdBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Spam Kings: The Real Story behind the High-Rolling Hucksters Pushing Porn, Pills, and %*@)# Enlargements''], (O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2004) page 247&lt;/ref&gt; Todino's time traveller was referenced in the song "Rewind" by jazz trio [[Groovelily]] on their 2003 album ''Are we there yet?'' The song used phrases taken from Todino's emails within its lyrics.&lt;ref name="SpamKings"/&gt;

===Andrew Carlssin===
Andrew Carlssin was reportedly arrested in March 2003 for [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] violations for making 126 high-risk stock trades and being successful on every one. As reported, Carlssin started with an initial investment of $800 and ended with over $350,000,000 which drew the attention of the SEC. Later reports suggest that after his arrest, he submitted a four-hour confession wherein he claimed to be a time traveller from 200 years in the future. He offered to tell investigators such things as the whereabouts of [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[HIV/AIDS|cure for AIDS]] in return for a lesser punishment and to be allowed to return to his time craft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/30/1048962644057.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Easts makes a packet as James stays away | date=2003-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he refused to tell investigators the location or workings of his craft.&lt;ref name="Davies2005"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Huw Davies|title=Pedestrian Safety Expert Gets Hit by Bus: Another Weird Year of Bizarre News Stories from Around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66pV8HlKzGgC&amp;pg=PA201|date=1 August 2005|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0-7407-5464-7|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carlssin story allegedly originated as a fictional piece in ''[[Weekly World News]]'', a satirical newspaper, and was later repeated by [[Yahoo! News]], where its fictitious nature became less apparent. It was soon reported by other newspapers and magazines as fact. This in turn drove word-of-mouth spread through email inboxes and internet forums, leading to far more detailed descriptions of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insider Trading|url=http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/insider.asp|work=Articles|publisher=Snopes|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Håkan Nordkvist===
A video uploaded in 2006 shows a Swedish man named Håkan Nordkvist claiming that he had been accidentally transported to 2046 when attempting to fix the sink in his kitchen. There in the future, he immediately met someone who revealed and proved to be himself about 70 years old, and with whom he "had a great time". He filmed a short footage of the two smiling and hugging each other and showing the tattoo they had in their right arm. The story was reportedly a marketing campaign promoting the pension plans of the insurance company [[Autorité des marchés financiers (France)|AMF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31453/11-time-traveler-urban-legends-pretty-much-debunk-themselves|title=11 Time Traveler Urban Legends That Pretty Much Debunk Themselves|author=Bill DeMain|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paul Dienach===
In 1921, Paul Amadeus Dienach, a Swiss-Austrian teacher fell into coma for a year. When he woke up, he began writing a diary that he kept secret until he contacted one of his students, [[Georgios Papachatzis]], to translate it and keep it secret. In his writings, he claims to have awakened in the body of a man, Andrew Northman, in the year [[3906 AD]]. According to the author, when awakened in the future, people realized that it was not Northman, and told him the events during the future period.

==Technology==

===The Chronovisor===
{{main article|Chronovisor}}
Chronovisor was the name given to a machine that was said to be capable of viewing past and future events. Its existence was alleged by [[Father François Brune]], author of several books on paranormal phenomena and religion. In his 2002 book ''The Vatican’s New Mystery'' he claimed that the device had been built by the Italian priest and scientist Father Pellegrino Maria Ernetti. While Father Ernetti was a real person, the existence (much less the functionality) of the chronovisor has never been confirmed.

===Iranian time machine===
In April 2013, the Iranian news agency [[Fars News Agency|Fars]] carried a story claiming a 27-year-old Iranian scientist had invented a [[Time travel|time machine]] that allowed people to see into the future. A few days later, the story was removed, and replaced with a story quoting an Iranian government official that no such device had been registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Iran-denies-having-time-machine/tabid/417/articleID/294743/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Iran denies having time machine| date=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9985757/Iranian-scientist-claims-to-have-invented-time-machine.html |work=The Telegraph | title=Iranian scientist claims to have invented 'time machine'| date=April 10, 2013| location=London| first=Ahmed| last=Vahdat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130412-iranian-time-machine-time-travel-grandfather-paradox/|first=Ker|last=Than|magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=April 12, 2013|title=Iranian Scientist Claims to Have Built "Time Machine"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philadelphia Experiment and Montauk Project===
[[File:USS Eldridge DE-173 (1944).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[USS Eldridge (DE-173)|USS ''Eldridge'' (DE-173)]], c. 1944]]

{{main article|Philadelphia Experiment|Montauk Project}}
The Philadelphia Experiment is the name given to a naval military experiment which was supposedly carried out at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], USA, sometime around October 28, 1943. It is alleged that the [[U.S. Navy]] [[destroyer escort]] [[USS Eldridge (DE-173)|USS ''Eldridge'']] was to be rendered [[invisibility|invisible]] (or "[[cloaking device|cloaked]]") to enemy devices.

'''Triplemanía XI''' was the eleventh [[Triplemanía]] [[professional wrestling]] show promoted by [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. The show took place on June 5, 2003 in Naucalpan, Mexico. The Main event featured an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Eight-man "Atómicos" tag team match]] where the team of [[Lizmark]], [[La Parka II|La Parka]], [[Octagón]] and [[Super Caló]] faced the team of [[Abismo Negro]], [[Cibernético]] and [[the Headhunters (professional wrestling)|The Headhunters]].

==Production==
===Background===
In early 1992 [[Antonio Peña]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them the recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] later simply known as "AAA" or Triple A. After making a deal with the ''Televisa'' television network AAA held their first show in April 1992.&lt;ref name=SLOrbit&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/| title= El fin de una era| date= October 7, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2009 | author= Ocampo, Ernesto | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Peña and AAA held their first [[Triplemanía]] event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's [[Super Bowl]] event, similar to the [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] being the biggest show of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 Triplemanía was the 11th year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the 16th overall show under the Triplemanía banner.

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía XI show featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

'''UnCommonCon''' was a short-lived [[comics]] and [[science fiction convention]] held in the [[Dallas, Texas]], area on [[Thanksgiving]] weekend. James Echols was the show chairman and president of event sponsor Uncommon Solutions. This combination of media, comics, and literary guests with gaming, art, anime, and film was an ambitious attempt to create a large convention with regional and national appeal. UnCommonCon suffered financial collapse just before the 2001 event.

== History ==

=== Dates and guests ===
The first UnCommonCon, '''UnCommonCon 2000''', was held November 24–26, 2000, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel-DFW Airport located by Terminal C at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2000/Future/Cons2000d.html#novcons |work=Locus |title=Convention Listings - November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guests included author [[Aaron Allston]], author [[Tracy Hickman]], author [[P.N. Elrod]], actor [[Ted Raimi]], [[Melissa Benson]], ''[[Babylon 5]]'' actor [[Jason Carter (actor)|Jason Carter]], "Hulk" actor [[Lou Ferrigno]], actor [[Victor Lundin]], artist [[Bryan Talbot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Bryan |last=Talbot |title=The Naked Artist: Comic Book Legends |publisher=Moonstone |location=Calumet, Illinois |url=http://www.wowio.com/users/product.asp?BookId=4528 |year=2007 |isbn=1-933076-25-9 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many more. Screenings included ''Babylon Park'' and ''Laughing Boy''. Organizers were reported to have expected attendance of around 4000 but only 1200 people actually attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UncommonCon Convention in Irving TX |last=Grisaffi |first=Joe |url=http://www.epinions.com/trvl-review-3643-5C1CFCA-3A29D134-prod1 |date=2000-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328124025/http://www.epinions.com/trvl-review-3643-5C1CFCA-3A29D134-prod1 |archivedate=2008-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second UnCommonCon, '''UnCommonCon 2001''', was scheduled to be held November 23–25, 2001, at the Wyndham Anatole Hotel in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Locus |title=Convention Listings - November 2001 |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2001/Future/Cons2001.html#novcons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheduled guests included author [[Aaron Allston]], artist [[Sergio Aragones]], author [[Lee Martindale]], and author [[Michael Stackpole]]. The first major auction by [[Heritage Auction Galleries|Heritage Auctions]] was scheduled to be held in conjunction with the convention.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} There were several factors, including a sharp drop in domestic travel after [[9/11]], that led to cancellation of the event roughly two weeks before the second convention was to occur but organizers publicly blamed slow dealer tables sales and their failure to meet room block commitments resulting in a $60,000 invoice from the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Comicon.com |title=Uncommoncon Cancelled! discussion |url=http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/ubb/get_topic/f/43/t/001906.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220032/http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/ubb/get_topic/f/43/t/001906.html |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demise/aftermath ===
When UnCommonCon failed unexpectedly due to financial difficulties, [[A-Kon]] sponsors Phoenix Entertainment stepped in with [[Itzacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Blum |first=Dawn |url=http://boards.theforce.net/lubbock_tx/b10148/4741029/p1/?0 |title=ItzaCon3 - With Peter Mayhew |work=Jedi Council Forums |date=2001-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was hurriedly put together and "inherited" a number of guests from the UnCommonCon roster who had already completed travel plans for this Thanksgiving weekend. Con organizer Meri Hazlewood later claimed a paid attendance of "about 540 people (not counting dealers and staff)."

Heritage Comic Auctions held its "million dollar" comics and movie poster auction, as scheduled, at the Wyndham Anatole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UncommonCon Cancels Festival -- Heritage Auction to Proceed on Schedule |url=http://comics.ha.com/common/info/press/default.php?ReleaseID=178 |date=2001-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provided free vendor space to vintage comics and art dealers to advertise the now-smaller event and encourage more people to attend the auction in person. 703 of the 845 lots sold at auction bringing in a total of $960,649.05&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2001-11-27 |url=http://comics.ha.com/common/info/press/default.php?ReleaseID=181 |title=Heritage Comics Signature Auction Brings $960,000; Prices Soar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Irving portrait.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Henry Irving]]
The '''Vaudeville Theatre''' is a [[West End theatre]] on the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in the [[City of Westminster]]. As the name suggests, the theatre held mostly [[vaudeville]] shows and [[musical revue]]s in its early days. It opened in 1870 and was rebuilt twice, although each new building retained elements of the previous structure. The current building opened in 1926, and the capacity is now 690 seats. Rare ''thunder drum'' and ''lightning sheets'', together with other early stage mechanisms, survive in the theatre.

==History==
===Origins===
The theatre was designed by prolific architect [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]], and decorated in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style by George Gordon. It opened on 16 April 1870 with [[Andrew Halliday (journalist)|Andrew Halliday]]'s comedy, ''For Love Or Money'' and a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], ''Don Carlos or the Infante in Arms''. A notable innovation was the concealed footlights, which would shut off if the glass in front of them was broken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=46127 From: ''Henrietta Street and Maiden Lane Area: Maiden Lane''], Survey of London: volume 36: Covent Garden (1970), pp. 239–52. Date accessed, 28 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The owner, William Wybrow Robertson, had run a failing [[billiard hall]] on the site but saw more opportunity in theatre. He leased the new theatre to three actors, [[Thomas Thorne]], [[David James (actor, born 1839)|David James]], and H.J. Montague.&lt;ref name=Vaud&gt;[http://www.vaudevilletheatre.org.uk/ Vaudeville Theatre] accessed 28 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The original theatre stood behind two houses on the Strand, and the entrance was through a labyrinth of small corridors. It had a [[seating capacity]] of 1,046, rising in a horseshoe over a pit and three galleries. The cramped site meant that facilities front and backstage were limited.

The great [[Shakespeare]]an actor, [[Henry Irving]], had his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in [[James Albery]]'s ''Two Roses'' at the Vaudeville in 1870. It held the theatre for what was at the time an extraordinarily successful run of 300 nights. The first theatre piece in the world to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the comedy ''[[Our Boys]]'' by [[H. J. Byron]], which started its run at the Vaudeville in 1875. The production went on to surpass the 1,000 performance mark. This was such a rare event that London [[bus conductor]]s approaching the Vaudeville Theatre stop shouted "Our Boys!" instead of the name of the theatre.

[[File:Jerome K. Jerome.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Jerome K. Jerome]]
In 1882, Thomas Thorne became the sole lessee, and in 1889 he demolished the houses to create a foyer block in the Adamesque style, behind a Portland stone facade on the Strand. He again used architect C.J. Phipps. The theatre was refurbished to have more spacious seating and an ornate ceiling. It reopened on 13 January 1891 with a performance of [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s comedy, ''Woodbarrow Farm'', preceded by Herbert Keith's one-act play ''The Note of Hand''. This foyer is preserved today, as is the four-storey frontage.&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt;  Dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] presented one of his later plays here, ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern'' (1891), a burlesque "in Three Short 'Tableaux'". (He had published it in 1874 in ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun magazine]]''). Also in 1891, [[Elizabeth Robins]] and Marion Lea directed and starred in [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' at the theatre, and his ''[[Rosmersholm]]'' had its London premiere here.

===Gatti family===
In 1892, Thorne passed the lease to restaurateurs Agostino and Stefano Gatti, who since 1878 had held the lease of the nearby [[Adelphi Theatre]]. The first production at the new theatre was a revival of ''Our Boys''. The lease briefly passed into the hands of [[Weedon Grossmith]] in 1894, but was back with the Gattis in 1896. The theatre became known for a series of successful [[musical theatre|musical comedies]]. ''[[The French Maid]]'', by [[Basil Hood]], with music by [[Walter Slaughter]], first played in London at [[Terry's Theatre]] under the management of W.H. Griffiths beginning in 1897 but transferred to the Vaudeville in early 1898, running for a very successful total of 480 London performances. The piece starred [[Louie Pounds]]. [[Seymour Hicks]] and his wife [[Ellaline Terriss]] starred in a series of Christmas entertainments here, including their popular ''[[Bluebell in Fairyland]]'' (1901).  The foyer of the theatre had become infamous as the site of an argument in 1897 between [[Richard Archer Prince]] and Terriss's father, actor [[William Terriss]]. Soon after that argument, the deranged Prince stabbed William Terriss to death at the stage door of the [[Adelphi Theatre]]. Prince was a struggling young actor whom Terriss had tried to help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zip.com.au/~lnbdds/home/prince.htm Article about Terriss, Prince and the murder]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:hicks.title.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Seymour Hicks]]]]
Hicks and Terriss also starred here in ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'', a comedy by [[J. M. Barrie]], which opened at the Vaudeville in 1902 and ran for 459 performances. It had first played in New York in 1901 but ran there for only 64 performances. This was one of the first American productions to score a bigger triumph in London. This was followed by the 1903 musical ''[[The Cherry Girl]]'' by Hicks, with music by [[Ivan Caryll]], starring Hicks, Terriss and [[Courtice Pounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.halhkmusic.com/cherrygirl.html |title=Midi files and cast list for ''The Cherry Girl'' |access-date=2007-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319204153/http://www.halhkmusic.com/cherrygirl.html |archive-date=2007-03-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1904, Hicks scored an even bigger hit with the musical, ''[[The Catch of the Season]]'', written by Hicks and [[Cosmo Hamilton]], based on the fairy tale ''[[Cinderella]]''.  It had a very long run of 621 performances, starring Hicks, [[Zena Dare]] (who created the role of Angela when Ellaline Terriss's pregnancy forced her to withdraw. Dare was later replaced by Terriss and then by Dare's sister, [[Phyllis Dare]]) and Louie Pounds.

[[John Maria Gatti|John Maria]] and Rocco Gatti took over management of the Vaudeville in 1905.  In 1906, the theatre hosted the very successful ''[[The Belle of Mayfair]]'', a musical composed by [[Leslie Stuart]] with a book by Basil Hood, [[Charles Brookfield]] and Cosmo Hamilton, produced by Hicks' partner, [[Charles Frohman]]. It ran for 431 performances and starred [[Edna May]], Louie and her brother Courtice Pounds, and [[Camille Clifford]]. In 1910, an English adaptation of ''[[The Girl in the Train]]'' (''Die geschiedene Frau'' – literally, "The Divorcee"), a 1908 Viennese [[operetta]] by [[Leo Fall]], opened at the Vaudeville. It was produced by [[George Edwardes]], with lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]] and starred [[Robert Evett]], Phyllis Dare and [[Rutland Barrington]]. In 1911, [[William Greet]] produced ''Baby Mine'' at the theatre. [[Betty Bolton]] made her debut in 1916, at the age of 10, in a revue called ''Some'', at the theatre. During and after [[World War I]], audiences sought light entertainment, and [[Revue|musical revues]] held the Vaudeville stage, including ''Cheep'' (1917), the long-running ''Just Fancy'' (1920) and ''Rats'' (1923), another popular revue. [[Albert Ketèlbey]] was one of the theatre's music directors.

The theatre closed on 7 November 1925, when the interior was completely reconstructed to designs by [[Robert Atkinson (architect)|Robert Atkinson]]. The auditorium was changed from a horseshoe shape to the current rectangle shape, and the [[seating capacity]] reduced to just over 700. A new dressing room block with an ornate boardroom extended the site to Maiden Lane. The theatre reopened on 23 February 1926, with a popular revue by Archie de Bear called ''R.S.V.P.'', notable because its final rehearsal was broadcast by the [[BBC]]. The theatre then hosted [[William Somerset Maugham]]'s comedy, ''[[The Bread-Winner (play)|The Bread-Winner]]'' in 1930. After World War II, the theatre presented William Douglas Home's play, ''The Chiltern Hundreds'', which ran for 651 performances. The record-setting musical ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]'', composed by [[Julian Slade]] with lyrics by Dorothy Reynolds and Slade, premiered at the [[Bristol Old Vic]] in 1954 but soon transferred to the Vaudeville, enjoying the longest run of any theatrical work up to that point in history.  Another notable production at the theatre was [[Arnold Wesker]]'s  1959 play, ''Chips with Everything''.

===Modern era===
A proposed redevelopment of [[Covent Garden]] by the [[Greater London Council|GLC]] in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby Adelphi, [[Garrick Theatre|Garrick]], [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]] and [[Duchess Theatre|Duchess]] theatres. An active campaign by [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]], the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] and theatre owners under the auspices of the ''Save London Theatres Campaign'' led to the abandonment of the scheme.&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt;

[[Cicely Courtneidge]] played at the theatre in ''The Bride Comes Back'' (1960) and [[Ray Cooney]]'s ''Move Over Mrs. Markham'' (1971). [[Bill Treacher]] made his West End debut in 1963 in the comedy ''Shout for Life'' at the Vaudeville. In 1966, the theatre hosted ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'', starring [[Sybil Thorndike]] and her husband [[Lewis Casson]]. [[Brigid Brophy]]'s ''The Burglar'' premiered at the theatre in 1967, and Joyce Rayburn's comedy, ''The Man Most Likely To...'', starring [[Leslie Phillips]], opened initially at the Vaudeville in 1968 and went on to run for over 1,000 performances in London.

In 1969, the Gatti family sold their interest in the theatre to Sir [[Peter Saunders (impresario)|Peter Saunders]], and in 1970 he commissioned [[Peter Rice]] to redesign the interior. Among other changes were a deep red wallpaper in the auditorium and more comfortable seats. Also, the loggia above the street was glazed to make the balcony an extension of the bar. The backstage lighting was rerigged, and a forestage lift and counterweight flying system were installed. The theatre achieved some protection in 1972 when it was [[listed building|Grade II listed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=427800 English Heritage Listing details for Theatre] accessed 27 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=416678 English Heritage Listing details for Maiden Lane entrance and dressing room block] accessed 27 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, ownership passed to [[Michael Codron]] and [[David Sutton (producer)|David Sutton]]. [[Stephen Waley-Cohen]] took ownership in 1996, passing it to Max Weitzenhofer in 2002.&lt;ref name=Vaud/&gt;

Meanwhile, drama was added to the standard bill of fare at the theatre. [[Hugh Paddick]] starred in the Joyce Rayburn farce ''Out on a Limb'' at the theatre in 1976, [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Present Laughter]]'' with [[Donald Sinden]] in the lead was revived in 1981 and [[Patrick Cargill]] and [[Moira Lister]] co-starred in the farce ''Key for Two'' in 1982. [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' was revived at the theatre in 1986, and [[Willy Russell]]'s play ''[[Shirley Valentine]]'' played in 1988, starring [[Pauline Collins]]. In 1990, [[Simon Gray]]'s play ''Hidden Laughter'' was produced at the theatre, followed by [[Kander and Ebb]]'s 1991 musical, ''[[70, Girls, 70]]'', starring [[Dora Bryan]].

A 1996 revival of ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]'', starring the duo [[Kit and The Widow]], was not successful, but [[Jean Fergusson]]'s show ''She Knows You Know!'', in which she portrayed the [[Lancashire]] comedian [[Hylda Baker]], played at the theatre in 1997 and was nominated for a 1998 [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for Best Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0272647/ Information about ''She Knows You Know!''] at the IMDB database&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Showtune (musical)|Showtune]]'', a musical revue celebrating the words and music of composer [[Jerry Herman]] and conceived by [[Paul Gilger]] was given a London production at the Vaudeville in 1998 under its previous title ''The Best of Times''. That same year the theatre housed ''[[Kat and the Kings]]'', which won the Olivier for Best New Musical and, in an unusual move, Best Actor in a Musical for its entire cast. ''[[Madame Melville]]'', a play by [[Richard Nelson (playwright)|Richard Nelson]] was presented in 2000. It marked the return of [[Macaulay Culkin]] to acting after a six-year hiatus and also starred [[Irène Jacob]] and [[Madeleine Potter]]. In 2001 [[Ray Cooney]]'s farce ''Caught in the Net'', starring [[Russ Abbot]] and [[Eric Sykes]], had a ten-month run.

The dance/[[performance art]] troupe ''[[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]]'' was in residence at the theatre from 2002 to 2007. Since 2003, the theatre has been owned by Max Weitzenhoffer, and in 2005, the venue was brought under the management of Nimax Theatres Limited.

=== Female Impersonation ===
As minstrel shows shifted towards the development of vaudeville theatre, the comedic and misogynistic “wench” also experienced a shift into more of a serious and creative character, the “prima donna.” By the end of the Prohibition Era, vaudeville shows featured female impersonators as a regular part of their performance, in which further became a new popular trend of public entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Nan Alamilla.

The '''Victoria Theatre, Salford''', is a theatre in the [[Broughton, Salford|Lower Broughton]] area of [[Salford, Greater Manchester]], England. It is situated on Great Clowes Street, on the corner of the Elton Street. The theatre officially opened 10 December 1900 and was last in use as a bingo hall in 2008. The original capacity was 2,000 seated, this was increased to 3,000 in 1910. Palatial Leisure Limited sold the building in September 2018.

== Background ==
The Victoria Theatre, designed by [[Bertie Crewe]], was built by The Broughton Theatres Syndicate Ltd,&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Victoria Theatre (Salford) | url =http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/1829-victoria-theatre-salford | website = theatrestrust.org.uk | publisher = [[Theatres Trust]] | date = 2015 |accessdate= 3 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the same syndicate which controlled the [[Frank Matcham#Career|Regent Theatre]], Cross Lane, Salford (destroyed by fire in 1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Regent Theatre of Varieties, and Assembly Rooms, Cross Lane, Salford | url = http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SalfordTheatres.htm#regent | website = arthurlloyd.co.uk | publisher = Arthur Lloyd |accessdate= 3 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's foundation stone was laid on 4 October 1899 by the actor [[Henry Irving|Sir Henry Irving]]. Accompanying Irving was [[Bram Stoker]], also in attendance were Bertie Crewe, the Civic Mayor of Salford [[Civic mayor of Salford#Mayors of Salford|Samuel Rudman]], [[Frederick Platt-Higgins]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Salford North (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford North]]), C. V. Haworth (chairman of the syndicate), a large number of the members from the Salford Corporation, and former Civic Mayors of Salford [[Civic mayor of Salford#Mayors of Salford|Sir W. H. Bailey]] and [[Civic mayor of Salford#Mayors of Salford|Sir Richard Mottram]]. Crewe presented Irving with a mallet and a silver trowel. In a short speech Irving remarked, "I have always contended that a well-conducted playhouse is a centre of rational recreation, and without rational recreation no community can pretend to have its facultics in proper order."&lt;ref name="MG_1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = New theatre for Broughton: speech by Sir Henry Irving | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 5 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/473575385 | date = 5 October 1899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the application for the theatre's licence was heard by the town council, Mr. J. Broxap put forward an amendment, "That the resolution of the Watch Committee be approved subject to no application being made to the Excise for the licence to sell intoxicating drink." The amendment was seconded by Mr. Haworth who added, "Persons who went in and out to get drink interrupted the performance, to the annoyance of those who desired to see the piece." The council voted 25 for the amendment to alter the theatre's licence so that alcohol could not be sold, 32 against and 1 abstention. The Mayor declared the amendment lost.&lt;ref name="Amend"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Salford Town Council: The licence of the Broughton Theatre - confirmation by the council | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 3 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/473680545 | date = 31 October 1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2,000 seater theatre opened on 10 December 1900 with the play "''[[The Sign of the Cross (play)|Sign of the Cross]]''," performed by [[William Greet]]'s company, with Edward Vincent as the Prefect and Virginia Buckle as the Christian girl Mercia. The front of the theatre was described as "red terra-cotta, divided by [[Pilaster|Ionic pilasters]] into five bays" and the foyer was described as "a hall 34 feet long and 18 feet wide, with marble mosaic floor, walls panelled in fibrous plaster, and hand-painted ceiling". The dimensions of the stage were also recorded as "Its width is 74 feet, the distance from the curtain line to the back wall is 40 feet, the distance from stage to grid is 50 feet, and the proscenium opening is 30 feet in width.&lt;ref name="MG_2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Opening of the Victoria Theatre, Broughton | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] |page = 4 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/473713520 | date = 11 December 1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use as a cinema ==
In November 1901, less than a year after opening, the theatre began showing films and in 1913 it was granted a cinema licence.&lt;ref name=Cinema_Treasures&gt;{{cite web | title = Victoria Theatre | url = http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2056 | website = cinematreasures.org | publisher = Cinema Treasures | access-date = 6 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner/managers, Messrs J. P. Moore &amp; Montague Beadyn, also increased the capacity in 1910 from 2,000 to 3,000. However, from 1917 to 1919 the venue became a theatre once more.&lt;ref name="TT" /&gt;

In 1919 the theatre consultant Mr. Watson redesigned the auditorium with interior paintings and a Tudor Café and the theatre became predominantly a cinema again under H. D. Moorhouse,&lt;ref name=TM_2&gt;{{cite news | last = Parkinson | first = J. A. | title = Letter to the editor: Victoria Theatre, Salford | work = [[Theatres Trust#Publications|Theatres Magazine]] | issue = 34 | page = 28 | publisher = The Theatres Trust Charitable Fund | format = pdf | url = http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/store/assets/0000/3482/Theatres_Magazine_No.34.pdf | date = Winter 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained a cinema until its closure in July 1958.&lt;ref name="AL"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Victoria Theatre, 14-18 Great Clowes Street, Salford | url = http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SalfordTheatres.htm#victoria | website = arthurlloyd.co.uk | publisher = Arthur Lloyd |accessdate= 3 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner/managers from 1945 were Broughton Cinemas Ltd.&lt;ref name="TT" /&gt;

== 1958–1971 ==
Following the cinema's closure in July 1958 the theatre was used as a clothing / furniture store with some performances by repertory groups, including Venture Productions, and pantomimes being staged during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="TT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TM_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AL" /&gt;

From the mid 1960s until the summer of 1971, the theatre was owned by a Salford businessman, Councillor Sam Goldberg.&lt;ref name="AL" /&gt; Goldberg allowed repertory groups such as Venture Productions to put on productions rent free.&lt;ref name="Guardian_rep"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Warehouse may be theatre again: company accepts offer | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 10 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/184767720 | date = 19 August 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used the theatre as winter headquarters for his own Southport Repertory Company.&lt;ref name="Guardian_Southport"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Salford loses last theatre | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 6 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/185463291 | date = 30 December 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg tried unsuccessfully to sell the freehold to Salford City Council, in the hope that they might operate the building as a civic theatre and arts centre. Talks stalled after it was estimated that the cost of modernising the building could be about £80,000, the theatre was running at a loss at the time of Goldberg's death.&lt;ref name="Guardian_Southport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughing"&gt;{{cite web | title = Victoria Theatre Salford (blog) | url = http://www.laughingaudience.co.uk/victoria-theatre-salford.html | website = laughingaudience.co.uk | publisher = Laughing Audience |accessdate= 3 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Councillor Cecil Franks, the chairman, said it was hopeless to try to maintain a "Victorian relic" of this size in its present form.&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Salford may lose theatre | work = [[The Observer]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 5 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/185581918 | date = 27 October 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg died prior to the North Manchester Amateur Operatic Society's production of "''[[The Quaker Girl]]''", May–June 1971, (music by [[Lionel Monckton]], lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]] and [[Percy Greenbank]]), the theatre then lay dark.&lt;ref name="AL" /&gt;

However, the visit showed no evidence of water penetration so the council is considering other options and actions. These have yet to be determined and in the meantime the building is subject to continued deterioration.&lt;ref name="TT2" /&gt; Ferrer resigned from the trust in January 2014 and Lucas resigned in January 2015.
