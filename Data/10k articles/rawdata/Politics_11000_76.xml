[[File:Protest against Faure Gnassingbe in Belgium.jpg|thumb|Protest against [[Faure Gnassingbé]] in [[Belgium]] in October 2017]]
The '''2017–18 Togolese protests''' are a significant representation of civil unrest in [[Togo]] and [[Protests against Faure Gnassingbé|against the 50 year rule]] of the father-son combination of [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]] and [[Faure Gnassingbé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/togo-protests_us_59b05298e4b0354e440f0686 |title=Massive Protests Call For An End To Togo's 50-Year Political Dynasty |last=Reuters |date=6 September 2017 |work=Huffington Post |access-date=4 January 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters demanded that the president honour the [[Togolese constitutional referendum, 1992|1992 constitution]], and demanding that he step down immediately. Gnassingbé offered the protesters the option of enacting the two-term limit set in the constitution effective from 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/more-protests-planned-for-togo_us_5a307e5ce4b06a512dd69bae |title=More Protests Planned for Togo |last=Wong (Omowale) |first=Dwayne |date=13 December 2017 |work=HuffPost |language=en-US |access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nobelwomensinitiative.org/meet-farida-nabourema-togo/ |title=Meet Farida Nabourema, Togo |date=25 November 2017 |publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative |access-date=4 January 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus ensuring that he could stay in power until 2030.

==History==
===August 2017===
On 19 August, thousands of protesters took to the streets, mostly in the city of [[Sokodé]]. Some protesters chanted "50 years is too long".&lt;ref name="Nabourema"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nabourema |first=Farida |url=http://africanarguments.org/2017/08/25/50-years-of-hurt-togo-protesters-vow-to-continue/ |title=50 years of hurt: Togo protesters vow to continue |work=African Arguments |date=25 August 2017 |accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests also occurred in [[Lomé]], [[Bafilo]], [[Anié]], and [[Kara, Togo|Kara]].&lt;ref name="Vox Daily"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailyvox.co.za/togo-protests-broken/ |title=Togo protests: Why have they erupted? |work=The Daily Vox |date=21 August 2017 |accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security forces shot and killed two civilians while dispersing protesters.

Opposition parties called for a general strike to take place on 25 August, which slowed business and caused Lomé to enter a security lockdown. Togolese minister Gilbert Bawara criticized the strike, calling it "the campaign of terror, intimidation and threats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4824044/Togos-capital-tense-opposition-call-stay-home.html |title=Togo's capital tense after opposition call to stay home |work=Daily Mail |agency=AFP |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Togolese Prime Minister [[Komi Sélom Klassou]] led a pro-government counter-protest in [[Lomé]] on 29 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/08/30/pro-govt-counter-protest-staged-in-togo-the-morning-call/ |title=Pro-govt counter-protest staged in Togo [The Morning Call] |work=[[Africanews]] |date=30 August 2017 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ghana Immigration Service|Ghanaian immigration officers]] increased security of the Ghana–Togo border for Togolese fleeing to Ghana because of the unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Mildred Europa |url=http://www.pulse.com.gh/news/local/togo-unrest-ghana-tightens-security-at-its-border-as-tension-in-togo-rises-id7207560.html |title=Ghana tightens security at its border as tension in Togo rises |work=Pulse |date=25 August 2017 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2017===
On 5 September, in an effort to disrupt planned protests, the Toglose government cut off the internet, blocked the use of [[WhatsApp]], and filtered international calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mtshali |first=Khanya |url=https://qz.com/1070753/togo-shuts-down-internet-to-counter-anti-faure-gnassingbe-protests/ |title=Togo has shut down the internet to counter anti-government protests |work=[[Quartz Africa]] |date=7 September 2017 |accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koutonin |first=Mawuna |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/21/no-business-no-boozing-no-casual-sex-when-togo-turned-off-the-internet |title=No business, no boozing, no casual sex: when Togo turned off the internet |date=21 September 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the opposition parties CAP 2015 and the Pan-African National Party started a large three-day protest in Lomé.&lt;ref name="80 arrested"/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] estimated that about 100,000 people participated in a protest on 6 September.&lt;ref name="internet restored"/&gt;  At least 80 protesters were arrested on 7 September for "preparing to commit violent acts, vandalise shops."&lt;ref name="80 arrested"&gt;{{cite news |last=Akwei |first=Ismali |url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/09/09/at-least-80-arrested-after-togo-s-latest-anti-government-protests/ |title=At least 80 arrested after Togo's latest anti-government protests |date=9 September 2017 |work=Africanews |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security forces in Lomé fired [[tear gas]] to disperse the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zodzi |first=John |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-togo-protests/togo-blocks-internet-as-protesters-march-for-second-day-idUSKCN1BI1UT |title=Togo forces fire tear gas to disperse Gnassingbe opponents |date=7 September 2017 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal access to the internet was restored on 11 September.&lt;ref name="internet restored"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://read.unitednews.international/2017/09/12/internet-restored-togo-protests/ |title=Internet Restored After Togo Protests |date=12 September 2017 |work=United News International |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Togo's [[National Assembly (Togo)|National Assembly]] introduced a bill meant to reform the country's electoral system and introduce presidential term limits of two five-year terms. The opposition objected to the bill's wording, saying that the term limits would not be retroactive. The opposition boycotted the National Assembly's vote on the bill on 18 September, making it subject to a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/togos-opposition-boycotts-constitutional-reform-vote-20170919 |title=Togo's opposition boycotts constitutional reform vote |work=[[News24]] |date=19 September 2017 |accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Togolese government slowed down the country's internet as the opposition prepared for more protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Akwei |first=Ismail |url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/09/20/internet-slowdown-in-togo-ahead-of-another-presidential-limits-protest/ |title=Internet slowdown in Togo ahead of another presidential limits protest |work=Africanews |date=9 September 2017 |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amnesty International]], security forces used batons, bullets, and tear gas against protesters in [[Mango, Togo|Mango]], killing a 9-year-old boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zodzi |first1=John |last2=Wilkins |first2=Henry |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-togo-protests/togo-security-forces-clash-with-protesters-in-north-killing-boy-idUSKCN1BV31E |title=Togo security forces clash with protesters in north, boy killed |date=20 September 2017 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Security minister Damehane Yark blamed the opposition for the boy's death, saying the protesters were using weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Akwei |first=Ismail |url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/09/21/10-year-old-boy-killed-in-renewed-togo-protest-govt-blames-opposition |title=10-year-old boy killed in renewed Togo protest, govt blames opposition |work=Africanews |date=21 September 2017 |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A picture of a cow killed by the military in the village [[Kparatao]] spread online and became a symbol of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1169701/world |title=Togo: Protests, a dead cow and a political message |work=Arab News |date=29 September 2017 |agency=AFP |accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, opposition leaders blamed the government for repressing protests in Northern Togo, and thousands of Togolese participated in anti-government demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.ug/thousands-join-fresh-protests-togo-amid-crackdown/ |title=Thousands join fresh protests in Togo amid 'crackdown' |date=23 September 2017 |publisher=The Independent Uganda |agency=AFP |accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpha Alassane, an imam affiliated with the opposition movement, was arrested in [[Sokodé]] on 16 October for allegedly inciting violence with his followers.

Opposition parties saw this as an attempt to appease their demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Akwei |first=Ismail |url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/11/07/togo-releases-42-detained-protesters-drops-2013-case-against-opposition-leader/ |title=Togo releases 42 detained protesters, drops 2013 case against opposition leader |work=Africanews |date=7 November 2017 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of protesters participated in three protests during this week, with the last one on 10 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.enca.com/africa/opposition-march-again-in-togo-over-political-reform |title=Opposition march again in Togo over political reform |publisher=eNCA |agency=AFP |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20171110-togo-protests-continue-amid-stalemate-concerns |title=Togo anti-government protesters vow to continue push for term limits |work=France 24 |date=10 November 2017 |agency=AFP |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 2017===
The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) held its 2017 summit on 16 December in [[Abuja]], [[Nigeria]] instead of in Togo, likely because of political tension between the government and opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://en.yabiladi.com/articles/details/59628/togo-gives-hosting-ecowas-summit.html |title=Togo gives up hosting the ECOWAS summit set to announce Morocco's accession |date=24 November 2017 |work=Yabiladi |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of this summit, thousands of protesters held anti-government marches.&lt;ref name=Vanguard&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/12/protests-togo-president-chairs-ecowas-summit/ |title=More protests in Togo as president chairs ECOWAS summit |date=16 December 2017 |work=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]] |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Accra]], Ghana, police arrested twelve members of the Ghana–Togo Solidarity movement, including Bernard Mornah, the chairman of the [[People's National Convention (Ghana)|People's National Convention]], for protesting the situation in Togo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nyabor |first=Jonas |url=https://citifmonline.com/2017/12/16/pncs-bernard-mornah-12-others-arrested-for-illegal-march/ |title=PNC's Bernard Mornah, 12 others arrested for ‘illegal march’ |publisher=Citi FM |date=16 December 2017 |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposition held demonstrations on 28 December, and the police arrest of a young man was filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amouzou |first=Georges |url=http://observers.france24.com/fr/20171229-togo-lome-manifestations-jeune-police |title=Manifestations au Togo : un jeune frappé et arrêté après avoir filmé les forces de l'ordre |work=Les Observateurs |publisher=France 24 |date=29 December 2017 |accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands of opposition supporters protested peacefully in Lomé on 31 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/31/12/2017/Thousands-gather-in-Togo-to-protest-president |title=Thousands gather in Togo to protest president |newspaper=[[The Peninsula (newspaper)|The Peninsula]] |date=31 December 2017 |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===January 2018===
On 3 January 2018, Gnassingbé called for the opposition to participate in government talks to resolve their differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaban |first=Abdur Rahman Alfa |url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/01/04/togo-president-reiterates-political-dialogue-call-in-new-year-message/ |title=Togo president reiterates political dialogue call in New Year message |work=Africanews |date=4 January 2018 |accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of people in Togo participated in an anti-government protest on 13 January 2018, the 55th anniversary of the [[Sylvanus Olympio]]'s assassination. Counter-protesters held demonstrations in support of the government. Supporters of the Togolese opposition also protested in [[Berlin]] and [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.enca.com/africa/opposition-and-ruling-party-supporters-march-in-togo |title=Anti government protest hits Togo |work=ENCA |agency=AFP |date=14 January 2018 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wong |first=Dwayne |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-togolese-people-protest-on-the-anniversary-of-sylvanus_us_5a5a67b7e4b003efadb6ae5e |title=The Togolese People Protest on the Anniversary of Sylvanus Olympio's Assassination |work=HuffPost |date=13 January 2018 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2018, the same day as the [[2018 Women's March]], the opposition held an anti-government demonstration focused on female involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Akwei |first=Ismail |url=https://face2faceafrica.com/article/womens-march-also-held-togo-different-dictator |title=Women's March was also held in Togo - but against a different dictator |work=[[Face2Face Africa]] |date=January 21, 2018 |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the protest, thousands of Togolese women mostly dressed in black marched through Lomé, accompanied by male opposition supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/thousands-of-women-in-anti-president-protest-in-togo-20180121 |title=Thousands of women in anti-president protest in Togo |work=News24 |agency=AFP |date=21 January 2018 |accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting on 31 January 2018, Togolese healthcare workers went on a two-day strike to demand that the government provide better health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/togo-healthcare-workers-join-strike-as-protests-mount-20180131 |title=Togo healthcare workers join strike as protests mount |work=News24 |agency=AFP |date=31 January 2018 |accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 2018===
On 15 February, [[Amnesty International]], [[Front Line Defenders]] and [[Africans Rising]] issued a joint statement criticising Togo's treatment of activists involved in the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://citizen.co.za/news/news-africa/1821493/togo-politique-diplomatie/ |title=Rights groups warn Togo over campaign against protest leaders |work=The Citizen |agency=AFP |date=15 February 2018 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February 2018, the opposition agreed to stop holding protests while mediators from [[Guinea]] and [[Ghana]] visited Togo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woussou |first=Kossi |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-02/togo-opposition-to-halt-protests-as-regional-mediators-arrive |title=Togo Opposition to Halt Protests as Regional Mediators Arrive |date=2 February 2018 |work=Bloomberg |accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 4 February 2018, the day after these mediators suggested that Togo hold talks on constitutional reform, thousands of protesters marched through Lomé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/02/04/togo-capital-hit-by-anti-govt-protest-despite-dialogue-deal |title=Togo capital hit by anti-govt protest despite dialogue deal |work=Africanews |agency=AFP |date=4 February 2018 |accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanaian President [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] and Guinean President [[Alpha Condé]] started mediating talks between the Togolese government and opposition on 19 February in Lomé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/feb/19/talks-open-in-togo-between-government-and-opposition-1775854.html |title=Talks open in Togo between government and opposition |work=The New Indian Express |agency=AFP |date=19 February 2018 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Ghanaian mediators announced that the Togolese government would released 45 of the 92 people imprisoned for participating in the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.republicoftogo.com/Toutes-les-rubriques/In-English/Demonstrations-suspended-45-detainees-released |title=Demonstrations suspended, 45 detainees released |work=République Togolaise |date=20 February 2018 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March 2018===
On 6 March, Togo's opposition coalition announced it would resume protests, despite the previous agreement to suspend protests while government talks were underway. Eric Dupuy, the coalition spokesman, said this was because the Togolese government failed to prepare for upcoming parliamentary elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/togo-opposition-announces-resumption-of-protest-demos-20180306 |title=Togo opposition announces resumption of protest demos |work=News24 |agency=AFP |date=6 March 2018 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanaian President Akufo-Addo met with 14 Togolese opposition leaders on the next day at [[The Flagstaff House]] in [[Accra]], Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Afful |first=Maame Aba |url=https://www.primenewsghana.com/general-news/akufo-addo-meets-14-togolese-opposition-parties-today.html |title=Akufo-Addo meets 14 Togolese opposition parties today |work=Prime News Ghana |date=7 March 2018 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, this opposition coalition accepted the Akufo-Addo's request to continue suspending protests for the next week while the talks continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Togo opposition suspends protests at Ghana request |url=https://www.independent.co.ug/togo-opposition-suspends-protests-at-ghana-request/ |work=The Independent Uganda |agency=AFP |date=10 March 2018 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These talks resumed on 23 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://guardian.ng/news/talks-resume-between-togo-government-and-opposition/ |title=Talks resume between Togo government and opposition |agency=AFP |work=The Guardian |date=23 March 2018 |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 2018===
The opposition coalition planned protests in Lomé and other towns on 11–12 April, and the Togolese government said this would violate their agreement with Akufo-Addo. On the first day of this demonstration, the police fired tear gas on the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaban |first=Abdur Rahman Alfa |url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/11/togo-police-crack-down-on-anti-government-protesters/ |title=Togo police crack down on anti-government protesters |work=Africanews |date=11 April 2018 |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2018, security forces in Lomé fired tear gas near the headquarters of the [[Democratic Convention of African Peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kriesch |first=Adrian |url=https://www.dw.com/en/togo-protests-break-out-despite-ban/a-43404037 |publisher=Deutsche Welle |title=Togo: Protests break out despite ban |date=16 April 2018 |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leaders meet GNA"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://gulfnews.com/news/africa/west-african-leaders-meet-in-bid-to-defuse-togo-crisis-1.2205687 |title=West African leaders meet in bid to defuse Togo crisis |date=15 April 2018 |work=[[Gulf News]] |agency=AFP |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 25 people were injured during these three days of protest, and one person died from his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfwa.org/country-highlights/one-person-killed-as-togolese-opposition-resume-protests-amidst-another-crackdown/ |title=One Person Killed as Togolese Opposition Resume Protests Amidst Another Crackdown |publisher=[[Media Foundation for West Africa]] |date=19 April 2018 |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security forces also prevented people from protesting in [[Kpalimé]]. Heads of state in ECOWAS held talks in Lomé on this day, and they called on Akufo-Addo and Condé to step up their reform efforts and end political violence.&lt;ref name="Leaders meet GNA"/&gt;

===May 2018–present===
The opposition coalition parties announced on 8 May that they were calling off protests planned in the coming days, citing the lack of security and progress with their objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Muisyo |first=Victor |url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/05/09/togo-opposition-coalition-calls-off-planned-protest/ |title=Togo: opposition coalition calls off planned protest |work=Africanews |date=9 May 2018 |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June, the coalition called for its supporters to participate in a sit-at-home general strike the next day, and the government urged people to boycott this protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mbah |first=Fidelis |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/togo-opposition-calls-stay-home-protests-180616202606895.html |title=Togo opposition calls for stay-at-home protests |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Togolese government and opposition coalition held talks on 27 June, and Akufo-Addo and Condé, the co-facilitators of these talks, called for continued dialogue and suspended street protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/politics/2018/June-28th/akufo-addo-conde-urge-togo-politicians-to-suspend-street-protests.php |title=Akufo-Addo, Conde urge Togo politicians to suspend street protests |website=MyJoyOnline.com |date=28 June 2018 |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government banned street protests from 23 July to 1 August while Togo hosted an ECOWAS summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kaledzi |first1=Isaac |title=Togo bans street protests amid political tension |url=https://africafeeds.com/2018/07/22/togo-bans-street-protests-amid-political-tension/ |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work=Africa Feeds |date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, 2018, over a thousand people protested in Lomé to demand the release of imprisoned protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/895136/hundreds-march-in-togo-for-release-of-protesters.html |title=Hundreds march in Togo for release of protesters |work=Modern Ghana |agency=AFP |date=3 November 2018 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''African Well Fund''' is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to raising funds for the construction and maintenance of freshwater wells throughout impoverished sections of [[Africa]]. It was founded in October 2002 by a group of [[U2]] fans who were inspired by frontman [[Bono|Bono's]] May 2002 visit to poor sections of [[Africa]] along with former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Paul O'Neill (businessman)|Paul O'Neill]]. The organization was inspired by [[Bono|Bono's]] charitable work throughout Africa, but is not directly connected to the band.

The organization is partnered with [[Africare]], and is staffed entirely by volunteers to minimize overhead.

Although most of the donations come from North Americans and Western Europeans that are not actually there to observe the people benefiting from their help, leaps towards progress occurred in African communities due to global concern and global participation, as well as cooperation and understanding amongst the people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Steve Buckwalter|title=African Well Fund|date=2007-03-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-5U3JWVvdw|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Take one of the first well projects that cost a mere one thousand dollars. Access to water in southern Uganda in 2002 was limited due to the [[Second Congo War|Great African War.]] It must have been a terrifying place to go out to get water for your mother, and your siblings. Children or their mothers in the village of Ntungamo had to travel long distances through the district to collect water for bathing and cooking. But, the water sources were stagnant, just holes in the ground. People often bathed in them, and children just cleaned the algae off of the surface of the water when collecting it. This spread disease in an area of the world where HIV/AIDS is often a taboo topic of discussion, and people are not always properly educated about the severity of the issue because of this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The construction of a well with running water actually helped bring people together, and Africare water experts were able to educate people about the issue of HIV/AIDS, as well as how important it is to do their part in maintaining the well.

== Celebrity involvement ==
By donating money and spreading awareness about issues that people may be struggling with far away, people often feel more connected with the people they're trying to help. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Katharyne|date=2016-07-01|title=Celebrity humanitarianism, transnational emotion and the rise of neoliberal citizenship|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/glob.12114/abstract|journal=Global Networks|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=288–306|doi=10.1111/glob.12114|issn=1471-0374}}&lt;/ref&gt;For Bono's 50th birthday, U2 fans attempted to raise 50,000 dollars for the Buhara District in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.u2.com/news/title/walk-to-the-water/news/|title=U2 &gt; News &gt; Walk To The Water|website=www.u2.com|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Agricultural Labour Action Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Acción Laborista Agrícola}}) is a [[political party]] in [[Costa Rica]]. 

The party was founded after the end of the [[Agrarian Politics Union Party]]. The first general elections contested by the party were in [[Costa Rican general election, 1990|1990]], in which it received only 0.4% of the vote, and failed to win a seat. In [[Costa Rican general election, 1994|1994]] its vote share dropped to 0.3%, again failing to win a seat. In [[Costa Rican general election, 1998|1998]] its electoral performance improved, as it received 1.2% of the national vote and winning its first seat. However, in [[Costa Rican general election, 2002|2002]] its vote share dropped to 0.7% and it lost its parliamentary representation.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p175 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was quoted as saying at the time that "It’s not enough to repeat the march and the assembly every year. We have to upgrade it to a civil disobedience movement." He later wrote that "In the past 30 years, the democracy movement has been too slow and too painstaking.

==Umbrella Movement==
[[File:Alex Chow Yong Kang 2014.jpg|thumb|Alex Chow addresses protesters]]
In the early stages of the [[Umbrella Movement]], he was an influential organiser and speaker. He was reported as announcing to protesters, "This is not a student movement; this is a Hong Kongers' movement"; he warned the ''[[New York Times]]'' that "residents may occupy various government departments".&lt;ref name = guard/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; On 5 October, when the Federation of Students agreed to enter into dialogue with the government, Chow announced that the talks would be called off if attempts were made to forcefully remove protesters. In a speech at the main protest camp, he explained, "A dialogue is not a compromise. We will start arranging talks with the government, because we understand that there are people in both the government and here who want to solve society’s problems. We will not back down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html|title=Protesters in Hong Kong Ease Sit-In Near Government Headquarters|work= [[New York Times]] |author=Keith Bradshaw and Chris Buckley|date=5 October 2014|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3122">The '''Aufbau Vereinigung''' (Reconstruction Organisation) was a [[Munich]]-based counterrevolutionary conspiratorial group formed in the aftermath of the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|German occupation of the Ukraine in 1918]] and of the [[West Russian Volunteer Army|Latvian Intervention of 1919]]. It brought together [[White movement|White Russian]] émigrés and early German [[National Socialists]] who aimed to overthrow the governments of Germany and the Soviet Union, replacing them with authoritarian régimes of the far right. The group was originally known as Die Bruecke (The Bridge). ''Aufbau'' was also the name of a periodical it brought out.&lt;ref&gt;Russia and Germany, A Century of Conflict by [[Walter Laqueur]] London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1965. p76&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Michael Kellogg,&lt;ref&gt;The Russian Roots of Nazism White Émigrés and the Making of National Socialism, 1917–1945 by Michael Kellogg, Cambridge 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the Aufbau Vereinigung was a vital influence on the development of Nazi ideology in the years before the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of 1923 as well as financing NSDAP with, for example, funds from [[Henry Ford]]. It gave [[Hitler]] the idea of a vast Jewish conspiracy, involving a close alliance between international finance and [[Bolshevism]] and threatening disaster for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg p278&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on Hitler's early years in [[Vienna]] (1905-1913) appears to have shown that his [[antisemitism]] was at that time far less developed than it became under the new influences.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship by Brigitte Hamann New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 347-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aufbau members became involved in terrorist activities, including the assassination of [[Walther Rathenau]] and that of [[Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov]] (both in 1922).&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Scheubner-Richter]] in the putsch, Aufbau rapidly declined, and notions of [[Lebensraum]] and [[Untermensch|Slavic inferiority]], naturally unpopular with the Russians, gained a stronger hold on the Nazi movement.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur pp79 &amp; 89&lt;/ref&gt; 

The long-term influence of Aufbau has been traced{{by whom?|date=December 2015}} in the implementation of the [[final solution]]&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg P 241&lt;/ref&gt; and in Hitler's disastrous decision to divert troops away from Moscow towards the Ukraine in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg p279&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent members of Aufbau included:
*[[Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter]] (a Baltic German from the Russian Empire)
*[[Alfred Rosenberg]] (a Baltic German from the Russian Empire)
*[[Fyodor Viktorovich Vinberg|Fyodor Vinberg]] (Russian officer)
*[[Piotr Shabelsky-Bork]] (Russian officer)
*General [[Vasily Biskupsky]] (Russian officer)
*[[Erich Ludendorff]]
*[[Max Amann]]
*[[Boris Brasol]] (Russian émigré)

Their best Senate result was in Western Australia, where they polled 1.11%. Their best result in the House of  Representatives was the seat of Farrer, where they polled 6.08%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseStateFirstPrefsByParty-20499-NAT.htm |title=Australian Electoral Commission Tally Room, retrieved 27 July 2016 |access-date=27 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704145222/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseStateFirstPrefsByParty-20499-NAT.htm |archive-date=4 July 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALA president Debbie Robinson stated that the party views by-elections as worthwhile to gain experience. &lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/297512990&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Victorian state election, 2018|Victorian election, 2018]] the party has recruited former Australian Conservatives member Avi Yemini as candidate for the Southern Metro region. Yemini is a controversial figure in the Jewish community because of his support for the far right causes. In August 2018, Facebook deleted Avi Yemini's page for hate speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsmaker.com.au/news/373336/facebook-ban-attacks-free-speech-in-australia#.W8Krntl1PIX|title=Facebook Ban 'Attacks Free Speech in Australia'|website=www.newsmaker.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) and Jewish Community Council of Victoria (JCCV) have publicly shunned Yemini.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jewishnews.net.au/yemini-not-represent-us/70749|title='Yemini does not represent us' - The Australian Jewish News|date=2017-11-02|work=The Australian Jewish News|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party polled 0.03% in the lower house and 0.58% in the upper house. In the Southern Metropolitan region, where Avi Yemini was the lead candidate, they polled 0.46%.

==Platform and ideology==
The party has released a manifesto listing twenty key policy areas, including "smaller smarter government, integration over separation, real reconciliation: no place for [[apartheid]] in Australia". However, the party has focused most of its efforts on its [[criticism of Islam]].

The party is focused on stopping Muslim immigration to Australia, and its policy calls for only non-Muslims to be allowed in to the country.

The party has also had to fend off accusations of being climate skeptics, and while they claim they believe that humans have had an effect on the environment, they also raise doubts about the competency of the scientists and that their studies "are not based on scientific fact, but on computerised speculations and consent amongst special interest groups", and about climate change in general with their claim that "extreme natural events were described in Australian poetry a century before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change created hysteria about rising sea levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australianlibertyalliance.org.au/values-and-policies/natural-resources-and-environment.html|title=Natural Resources and Environment|last=proitservice|date=2015-09-29|website=www.australianlibertyalliance.org.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''benefactor''' ({{Etymology|la|bene|good||factor|maker}}) is a person who gives some form of help to benefit a person, group or organization (the [[beneficiary]]), often gifting a monetary contribution in the form of an endowment to help a cause. Benefactors are humanitarian leaders and charitable patrons providing assistance in many forms, such as an [[alumnus]] from a university giving back to a college or an individual providing assistance to others.

'''''Best of Enemies''''' is a 2015 American [[documentary film]] co-directed by [[Robert Gordon (writer and filmmaker)|Robert Gordon]] and [[Morgan Neville]] about the televised debates between intellectuals [[Gore Vidal]] and [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 United States presidential election]]. The film premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]]. It was acquired by Magnolia and [[Participant Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ge |first1=Linda |title=Gore Vidal Doc ''Best of Enemies'' Acquired by Magnolia, Participant Media |url=http://www.thewrap.com/gore-vidal-doc-best-of-enemies-acquired-by-magnolia-participant-media/ |accessdate=February 3, 2015 |work=[[TheWrap]] |date=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film took five years to make because of struggles to secure funding, get interviews, and uncover archival footage.&lt;ref name="MemphisFlyer" /&gt;

== Content ==
The film examines the ten televised debates between Buckley and Vidal in August 1968 that were moderated by anchorman [[Howard K. Smith]] during [[ABC News]] coverage of the [[Republican National Convention]] in [[Miami Beach]] and the [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Best of Enemies  |url=http://www.sundance.org/projects/best-of-enemies |website=[[Sundance Film Festival]] |publisher=[[The Sundance Institute]] |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It especially focuses on a specific incident of on-air insults exchanged by Vidal and Buckley during the Democratic convention, and follows their subsequent thoughts and actions, including articles each wrote for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine and the years-long litigation that resulted.&lt;ref name="Wills, 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wills|first1=Garry|title=The Buckley Myth|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2015/08/11/william-buckley-myth/|accessdate=June 22, 2016|magazine=[[New York Review of Books]]|date=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also expands on the impact of these debates on the beginning of modern American punditry.

{{Holodomor}}

'''Black boards''' — synonymous with "boards of infamy", were an element of agitation-propaganda in the [[Soviet Union]], and especially [[Ukraine]] in the 1930s, coinciding with the [[Holodomor]], the artificial famine imposed by the Soviet regime as part of a policy of repression.

The policy was part of the [[collectivization]] process and the fight with [[kulaks]] (kurkuls). The "black boards" were installed at entrances to a settlement and identified the residents that were accused of counter-revolutionary activity and who were the enemies of the people, allegedly trying to undermine the process of collectivization. The fact of nominating of such settlements was published in the [[oblast]] newspapers listing the names of [[kolkhoz|collective farms]] that resisted collectivization and the Soviet regime.

However some of the archives reflect that "black boards" were used precisely as a repressive element in the fight not only against the collectivization resistance, but also against the nationality factor of the local population. For example, in 1932 the [[Vinnytsia Oblast]] Communist Party Committee suggested the local village of Mazurivka to be nominated to "black boards", because there was born one of the [[Symon Petlyura|Petlyura's]] generals Khmara, while the village of Karpivtsi (Chudniv Raion) in Volyn was known as one of the Petlyura's.  The village of Turbiv (Lypovets Raion), for example, deserved such a penalty for its "high infestation of the Petlyura element and participation in the Plyskiv affair in spring". Each settlement or an administrative unit with black boards was encircled by armed squads and was subjected to complete food requisitioning.

Such repressions were conducted towards the half of all [[raion]]s and municipalities of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] except for the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] where such regime occupied territories of all administrative units without exception. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is situated right in the middle of traditional lands of the [[Zaporizhian Cossacks]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Chartist''''' is a bi-monthly [[democratic socialist]] magazine which has been published in Britain since the 1970s. The magazine is based in [[London]].

==History and profile==
The magazine's editorial policy is firmly aligned with the "democratic socialist left" within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Related Sites|url=http://www.labour-party.org.uk/websites/Related_sites/|work=An Unofficial Web Directory of Labour Party Sites|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting such causes as the [[Grassroots Alliance]] slate in Labour [[National Executive Committee]] elections and the [[Save The Labour Party]] initiative. Its readership and editorial board are not confined, however, to the Labour Party or any one of its factions. This is because it seeks to invite debate with the broader left including greens and various independence movements. It has offered support to [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as leader of the Labour party. ''Chartist'' defines its policy as being "to promote debate amongst people active in radical politics about the contemporary relevance of democratic socialism across the spectrum of politics, economics, science, philosophy, art, interpersonal relations – in short, the whole realm of social life". 

The current editor is Mike Davis. The magazine's production editor and treasurer is Peter Kenyon, and its web editor is Andy Morton.  Other members of the Editorial Board include Duncan Bowie, Peter Chalk, David Floyd, Don Flynn, Roger Gillham, Frank Lee, Dave Lister,  Mary Southcott, James Grayson, Patricia d’Ardenne and Sheila Osmanovic, Robbie Scott, Patrick Mulcahy and Tehmina Kazi.&lt;ref name=chartist-about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chartist.org.uk/about-chartist/ |title=About &amp; Contact |publisher=''Chartist'' |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of them work by absorbing or binding to oxygen before it can damage food ([[antioxidants]]).

This became the British Section of the [[International Left Opposition]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/balham/bg02.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted the name Communist League in June 1933.&lt;ref name=EPO1&gt;Barberis, Peter; McHugh, John; Tyldesley, Mike.

In 1933, [[Leon Trotsky]] suggested the group should enter the [[Independent Labour Party]], but the leadership decided against, leading to a split that December.&lt;ref name=EPO1/&gt; In 1934, a small group led by [[Denzil Dean Harber]] did enter the ILP, as the Bolshevik-Leninist Fraction, and formed the core of the [[Marxist Group (UK)|Marxist Group]] which [[C. L. R. James]] joined. Slow progress led to more splits, with the formation of the [[entrist]] Bolshevik-Leninist Group in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/revhist/upham/05upham.html&lt;/ref&gt; the core of the later [[Militant Group]].

The Communist League dissolved in 1936 and its members entered the Labour Party as the '''Marxist League''', led by Harry Wicks. Wicks began working closely with James, by then leader of the Marxist Group, and in 1938 the two merged to form the [[Revolutionary Socialist League (UK, 1938)|Revolutionary Socialist League]], into which the Militant Group (now Militant Labour League) merged the same year.

The '''crisis of the [[Late Middle Ages]]''' was a series of events in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that brought centuries of [[Europe]]an prosperity and growth to a halt.&lt;ref name=Goldsmith-1995&gt;{{citation |title=The Crises of the Late Middle Ages: The Case of France|author=James L.

A series of [[List of famines|famines]] and plagues, beginning with the [[Great Famine of 1315–17]] and especially the [[Black Death]] of 1347-1351, reduced the population perhaps by half or more as the [[Medieval Warm Period]] came to a close and the first century of the [[Little Ice Age]] began. It took 150 years for the European population to regain the levels of 1300.&lt;ref name="ic.galegroup.com"/&gt;

[[Popular revolts in late-medieval Europe]] and civil wars between nobles within countries such as the [[Wars of the Roses]] were common—with France fighting internally nine times—and there were international conflicts between kings such as [[France]] and [[England]] in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. The unity of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was shattered by the [[Western Schism]]. The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was also in decline; in the aftermath of the [[Great Interregnum]] (1247–1273), the Empire lost cohesion and politically the separate dynasties of the various German states became more important than their common empire.

== Historiography ==

The expression "Crisis of the Late Middle Ages" is used commonly in western historiography,&lt;ref name="Fernández-2004"/&gt; especially in English and German, and somewhat less among other western European scholarship to refer individually or collectively to different crises besetting Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries.  The expression often carries a modifier to refer more specifically to one or another aspect of Late Middle Age crisis, such as the ''Urban''{{thin space}}{{sfn|Phythian-Adams|2002}} Crisis of the Late Middle Ages, or the ''Cultural'',{{sfn|Merrill|1987}} ''Monastic'',{{sfn|Merton|1999|p=188}} ''Religious'',&lt;ref name="Borst-1992"/&gt; ''Social'',&lt;ref name="Borst-1992"/&gt; ''Economic'',&lt;ref name="Borst-1992"/&gt; ''Intellectual'',&lt;ref name="Borst-1992"/&gt; or ''Agrarian''&lt;ref name=Kriedte-1981/&gt; crisis of the Late Middle Ages, or a national or regional modifier, e.g. ''Catalan''&lt;ref name="Mallol-2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferrer i Mallol |first1=Maria Teresa |last2=Mutgé i Vives|first2=Josefa |title=La corona catalanoaragonesa i el seu entorn mediterrani a la baixa edat mitjana: actes del seminari celebrat a Barcelona, els dies 27 i 28 de novembre de 2003 |trans-title=The Catalan-Aragonese Crown and its Mediterranean Environment in the Late Middle Ages: Acts of the Seminar held in Barcelona, November 27 and 28 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlP63J3YjDEC&amp;pg=PA1 |series=Anuario de Estudios medievales, Annex 58 |year=2005 |publisher=Editorial CSIC - CSIC Press |location=Barcelona |language=Catalan |isbn=978-84-00-08330-4 |page=1 |oclc=878594930 |type=conference pub. |accessdate=3 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''French''&lt;ref name=Goldsmith-1995 /&gt; crisis.

By 1929, French historian [[Marc Bloch]] was already writing about the effects of the crisis of the Late Middle Ages,&lt;ref name="IEC-2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Institut d'Estudis Catalans |title=Crisis frumentàries, iniciatives privades i polítiques públiques de proveïment a les ciutats catalanes durant la baixa edat mitjana: Coordinació a cura d'Antoni Riera i Melis |trans-title=Crises in grain production, private initiatives and public supply policies to Catalan cities during the Late Middle Ages: Coordination under the care of Antoni Riera i Melis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ow9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 |edition=1 |date=9 September 2013 |publisher=Institut d'Estudis Catalans |location=Barcelona |isbn=978-84-9965-180-4 |page=13 |oclc=870100518 |accessdate=3 November 2018 |quote=2.

Postan&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; i Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie,&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; les esmentades fams no són més que la manifestació d'un capgirament de la conjuntura dintre d'un cicle demogràfic i econòmic de llarga durada que s'havia iniciat a mitjan sigle X1; marquen el final dels «bons temps», de l'expansió, i l'inici d'un període d'estancament i de regressió que va cobrir, a bona part d'Europa, el segle XIV i gairebé tot el XV, i al qual s'ha designat com la «crisi de la baixa edat mitjana»&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; o la «gran depresió».&lt;br/&gt; &amp;nbsp; 12. Per a la difusió del terme ''crisi'', a mitjan segle XX, entre els historiadors i la seva primera utilització, amb un sentit més social i politic que econòmic, vegeu M. Bourin i F. Menant, 'Avant-propos', a M. Bourin, J. Drendel, i F.

Arno Borst (1992) says that it "is a given that fourteenth century Latin Christianity was in a crisis", and goes on to say that the intellectual aspects and how universities were affected by the crisis is underrepresented in the scholarship hitherto: "When we discuss the crisis of the Late Middle Ages, we consider intellectual movements beside religious, social, and economic ones", and gives some examples.&lt;ref name="Borst-1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Borst |first=Arno |title=Medieval Worlds: Barbarians, Heretics and Artists in the Middle Ages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKoRjQcCqAkC&amp;pg=PA167 |date=15 April 1992 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-06656-1 |page=167 |chapter=10.

Some question whether "crisis" is the right expression for the period at the end of the Middle Ages and the transition to Modernity. In his 1981 article ''The End of the Middle Ages: Decline, Crisis or Transformation?'' Donald Sullivan addresses this question, claiming that scholarship has neglected the period and viewed it largely as a precursor to subsequent climactic events such as the Renaissance and Reformation.&lt;ref name=Sullivan-1981&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The History Teacher  |last=Sullivan |first=Donald |title=The End of the Middle Ages: Decline, Crisis, or Transformation? |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/493689 |publisher=Society for History Education |date=1981 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=551–565 |doi= |via=JStor |access-date=4 November 2018 |quote=Modern interpretations of the period ca. 1300-1500, conventionally identified as the late Middle Ages in transalpine Europe, have received little serious attention.

While modern historiography has exhaustively examined the 'Renaissance Problem' the comparative neglect of the late medieval period stems largely from four centuries of viewing it primarily in relation to what was seen as more appealing or more significant eras, whether preceding, following, or overlapping it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his "Introduction to the History of the Middle Ages in Europe", Mitre Fernández wrote in 2004 that "[t]o talk about a general crisis of the Late Middle Ages is already a commonplace in the study of medieval history." &lt;ref name="Fernández-2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitre Fernández |first=Emilio  |title=Introducción a la historia de la Edad Media europea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0A7VLCRkpcwC&amp;pg=PA289 |series=Colección fundamentos, 56 |year=2004 |publisher=Ediciones AKAL |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-7090-479-0 |page=289 |chapter=1 La Crisis Economica y Social de la Baja Edad Media |oclc=819718540 |trans-title=Introduction to the History of the Middle Ages in Europe |orig-year=1st pub. 1976:Istmo |accessdate=2 November 2018 |quote=Hablar de crisis general de la Baja Edad Media europea resulta ya un lugar común dentro de los estudios de Historia medieval.

Heribert Müller, in his 2012 book on the religious crisis of the late Middle Ages, discussed whether the term itself was in crisis, saying,&lt;blockquote&gt;No doubt the thesis of the crisis of the late Middle Ages has itself been in crisis for some time now, and hardly anyone considered an expert in the field would still profess it without some ifs and buts, and especially so in the case of German Medieval historians.&lt;ref name="Müller-2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Müller |first=Heribert  |title=Die kirchliche Krise des Spätmittelalters: Schisma, Konziliarismus und Konzilien |trans-title=The Religious Crisis of the Late Middle Ages: Schism, Conciliarism, and Councils |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uR_nBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |series=Encyclopedia of German History, 90 |date=18 September 2012 |publisher=De Gruyter |location=Munich |isbn=978-3-486-71350-3 |page=1 |chapter=1.

==Demography==
{{main|Medieval demography}}

Some scholars contend that at the beginning of the 14th century, Europe had become overpopulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism|author=[[Perry Anderson]]|publisher=Verso|year=1974 |origyear=2006|isbn=1-85984-107-4|pages=186, 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=17594|publisher=Socialist Worker Online|title=Feudalism and the growth of the market|author=Jonathan Maunder|date=2009-04-07|accessdate=2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 14th century frontiers had ceased to expand and internal colonization was coming to an end, but population levels remained high.

The [[Medieval Warm Period]] ended sometime towards the end of the 13th century, bringing the "[[Little Ice Age]]"&lt;ref&gt;''World Regions in Global Context'', Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt; and harsher winters with reduced harvests. In Northern Europe, new technological innovations such as the heavy [[plough]] and the [[three-field system]] were not as effective in clearing new fields for harvest as they were in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] because the north had poor, clay-like soil.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006&gt;J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Food shortages and rapidly inflating prices were a fact of life for as much as a century before the plague. Wheat, oats, hay and consequently livestock, were all in short supply.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt;

Their scarcity resulted in [[malnutrition]], which increases susceptibility to infections due to weakened immune systems. In the autumn of 1314, heavy rains began to fall, which were the start of several years of cold and wet winters.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt; The already weak harvests of the north suffered and the seven-year famine ensued. In the years 1315 to 1317 a catastrophic [[List of famines|famine]], known as the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]], struck much of [[North-West Europe|North West Europe]]. It was arguably the worst in European history, perhaps reducing the population by more than 10%.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt;

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|right|450px|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]]]]

Most governments instituted measures that prohibited exports of foodstuffs, condemned [[underground economy|black market]] [[speculators]], set [[price controls]] on grain and outlawed large-scale fishing. At best, they proved mostly unenforceable and at worst they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad: from France because of the prohibition, and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by [[piracy|pirates]] or [[looter]]s to be sold on the black market.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt;

Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and [[Scotland]], had been at war, using up much of their [[treasury]] and exacerbating [[inflation]]. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the [[Black Death]], England and France went to war in what became known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. This situation was worsened when landowners and monarchs such as [[Edward III of England]] (r. 1327–1377) and [[Philip VI of France]] (r. 1328–1350), raised the fines and rents of their tenants out of a fear that their comparatively high [[standard of living]] would decline.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt;

The European economy entered a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] in which hunger and chronic, low-level debilitating disease reduced the productivity of labourers, and so the grain output was reduced, causing grain prices to increase. Standards of living fell drastically, diets grew more limited, and Europeans as a whole experienced more health problems.

When a [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] epidemic emerged, many thousands died in populated urban centres, most significantly [[Ypres]] (now in Belgium). In 1318 a [[infectious disease|pestilence]] of unknown origin, sometimes identified as [[anthrax]], targeted the animals of Europe, notably sheep and cattle, further reducing the food supply and income of the peasantry.

== Climate change and the Great Famine ==
As Europe moved out of the Medieval Warm Period and into the Little Ice Age, a decrease in temperature and a great number of devastating floods disrupted harvests and caused mass famine. The cold and the rain proved to be particularly disastrous from 1315 to 1317 in which poor weather interrupted the maturation of many grains and beans and flooding turned fields rocky and barren.&lt;ref name="Lucas-1930"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Henry S.|date=1930|title=The Great European Famine of 1315, 1316, and 1317|jstor=2848143|journal=Speculum|volume=5|issue=4|pages=343–377|doi=10.2307/2848143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan-1997"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Famine : Northern Europe in the Early Fourteenth Century|last=Jordan|first=William Chester|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarcity of grain caused price inflation, as described in one account of grain prices in Europe in which the price of wheat doubled from twenty shillings per quarter in 1315 to forty shillings per quarter by June of the following year.&lt;ref name="Lucas-1930" /&gt; Grape harvests also suffered, which reduced wine production throughout Europe. The wine production from the vineyards surrounding the [[Abbey of Saint-Arnould]] in France decreased as much as eighty percent by 1317.&lt;ref name="Jordan-1997" /&gt; During this climatic change and subsequent famine, Europe's cattle were struck with Bovine Pestilence, a pathogen of unknown identity (although some modern interpretations cite [[anthrax]], [[foot-and-mouth disease]], or [[rinderpest]]).&lt;ref name="Slavin-2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slavin|first=Philip|date=2012|title=The Great Bovine Pestilence and its economic and environmental consequences in England and Wales, 1318—50|jstor=23271688|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=65|issue=4|pages=1239–1266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathogen began spreading throughout Europe from Eastern Asia in 1315 and reached the British Isles by 1319.&lt;ref name="Slavin-2012" /&gt; Manorial accounts of cattle populations in the year between 1319 and 1320, places a sixty-two percent loss in England and Wales alone.&lt;ref name="Slavin-2012" /&gt; In these countries, some correlation can be found between the places where poor weather reduced crop harvests and places where the bovine population was particularly negatively affected.&lt;ref name="Slavin-2012" /&gt; It is hypothesized that both low temperatures and lack of nutrition lowered the cattle populations' immune systems and made them vulnerable to disease.&lt;ref name="Slavin-2012" /&gt; The proliferation of dead or unhealthy cattle drastically affected dairy production, and the output did not return to its pre-pestilence amount until 1331.&lt;ref name="Slavin-2012" /&gt; Much of the medieval peasants' protein was obtained from dairy, and milk shortages likely caused nutritional deficiency in the European population. Famine and pestilence, exacerbated with the prevalence of war during this time, led to the death of an estimated ten to fifteen percent of Europe's population.&lt;ref name="Jordan-1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slavin-2012" /&gt;

== Climate change and plague epidemic correlation ==
The Black Death was a particularly devastating epidemic in Europe during this time, and is notable due to the number of people who succumbed to the disease within the few years the disease was active. It was fatal to an estimated thirty to sixty percent of the population where the disease was present.&lt;ref name="DeWitte-2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeWitte|first=Sharon|date=2015|title=Setting the Stage for the Medieval Plague: Pre-Black Death Trends in Survival and Mortality|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=158|pages=441–451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is some question of whether it was a particularly deadly strain of Yersinia pestis that caused the Black Death, research indicates no significant difference in bacterial phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bos|first=Kirsten I.|last2=Schuenemann|first2=Verena J.|last3=Golding|first3=G.

This gap in plague activity during the Medieval Warm Period contributes to the hypothesis that climate conditions would have affected Europe's susceptibility to disease when the climate began to cool during the arrival of the Little Ice Age in the 13th century.

{{main|Popular revolts in late-medieval Europe}}
Before the 14th century, popular uprisings were not unknown, for example, uprisings at a manor house against an unpleasant overlord, but they were local in scope. This changed in the 14th and 15th centuries when new downward pressures on the poor resulted in mass movements and popular uprisings across Europe. To indicate how common and widespread these movements became, in Germany between 1336 and 1525 there were no less than sixty phases of militant peasant unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Blickle, ''Unruhen in der ständischen Gesellschaft 1300–1800'', 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The unity of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was shattered by the [[Western Schism]]. The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was also in decline in the aftermath of the [[Holy Roman Empire#Interregnum|Great Interregnum]] (1247–1273); the Empire lost cohesion, and politically the separate dynasties of the various German states became more important than their common empire.

==Malthusian hypothesis==
Scholars such as [[David Herlihy]] and [[Michael Postan]] use the term [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian limit]] to express and explain some tragedies as resulting from overpopulation. In his 1798 ''Essay on the Principle of Population'', [[Thomas Malthus]] asserted that eventually humans would reproduce so greatly that they would go beyond the limits of necessary resources; once they reach this point, catastrophe becomes inevitable. In his book, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'', professor David Herlihy explores this idea of plague as an inevitable crisis imposed on humanity to control the population and human resources. In the book ''The Black Death; A Turning Point in History?'' (ed. William M. Bowsky) he "implies that the [[Black Death]]'s pivotal role in [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] society ... was now being challenged. Arguing on the basis of a neo-Malthusian economics, [[Historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] recast the Black Death as a necessary and long overdue corrective to an overpopulated Europe."

Herlihy also examined the arguments against the Malthusian crisis, stating "if the Black Death was a response to excessive human numbers it should have arrived several decades earlier"&lt;ref name=Herlihy&gt;
{{cite book |last=Herlihy |first=David |title=The Black Death and the Transformation of the West |page=33 |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674076136 |year=1997 |accessdate=2 September 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-07612-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in consequence of the population growth of years before the outbreak of the Black Death. Herlihy also brings up other, biological factors that argue against the plague as a "reckoning" by arguing "the role of famines in affecting population movements is also problematic. The many famines preceding the Black Death, even the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|'great hunger' of 1315 to 1317]], did not result in any appreciable reduction in population levels".&lt;ref name=Herlihy /&gt; Herlihy concludes the matter stating, "the medieval experience shows us not a Malthusian crisis but a stalemate, in the sense that the community was maintaining at stable levels very large numbers over a lengthy period" and states that the phenomenon should be referred to as more of a deadlock, rather than a crisis, to describe Europe before the epidemics.&lt;ref name=Herlihy /&gt;{{rp|34}}

'''Cyber risk quantification''' involves the application of risk quantification techniques to an organization's cybersecurity risk.  Cyber risk quantification is the process of evaluating the cyber risks that have been identified and then validating, measuring and analyzing the available cyber data using mathematical modeling techniques to accurately represent the organization's [[cybersecurity]] environment in a manner that can be used to make informed cybersecurity infrastructure investment and risk transfer decisions.  Cyber risk quantification is a supporting activity to cybersecurity risk management; cybersecurity risk management is a component of enterprise risk management and is especially important in organizations and enterprises that are highly dependent upon their [[information technology]] (IT) networks and systems for their business operations.

One method of quantifying cyber risk is the [[value-at-risk]] (VaR) method that is discussed at the January 2015 World Economic Forum meeting (see external reference below).  At this meeting, VaR was studied and researched and deemed to be a viable method of quantifying cyber risk.

A metric related to Cyber Risk Quantification that has been identified and cited{{who|date=January 2017}} is "Cyber Risk Reduction Return on Investment" or "CR3OI" as a metric that uses Cyber VaR and is an expression of the return on investment of a single or series of cyber investments.  See [[Cyber Risk Reduction Return on Investment]].

==Tools==
{{advert section|date=May 2017}}
Cyber risk quantification can be an automated or software supported process that lets the user create a model of the system architecture and then uses the built in mathematical modeling techniques in the software to quantify the cyber security risks.
 
* foreseeti offers a commercial Cyber Risk Quantification tool – securiCAD. This tool focuses on cyber risk quantification of IT infrastructures using a CAD-based approach where assets are automatically or manually placed on a drawing pane. By encapsulating complex attack trees within generalizable assets (like hosts, dataflows, firewalls, and IDS), securiCAD makes Cyber Risk Quantification accessible also for non-experts. By attaching an Attacker to different attack steps on available Assets, different scenarios can be simulated and analyzed. It is intended for company cyber security management, from CISO to security engineer to IT technician.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foreseeti.com Cyber Threat Modeling and Risk Mgmt - securiCAD by foreseeti]&lt;/ref&gt; The further development of securiCAD is currently a part of the EU-funded project CyberWiz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberwiz.eu The CyberWiz Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt; An article (in German) about CyberWiz containing some insights in the functionality of securiCAD has been published in the expert portal "Informatik aktuell".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.informatik-aktuell.de/betrieb/sicherheit/cyberwiz-ein-eu-projekt-zum-schutz-kritischer-infrastrukturen.html/ CyberWiz - ein EU-Projekt zum schutz kritischer Infrastrukturen]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

Information security professional Paul Carugati states that training, awareness and education is "the only path forward to holistically protect ourselves against these very dynamic threats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Self-Defense {{!}} Paul Carugati {{!}} TEDxSpokane|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knLDY7hRm5I|accessdate=13 April 2017|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also advises employers to "continue to advance their employees in cyber self defense and look for cyber security skill level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zurkus|first1=Kacy|title=Social engineering scam doesn't fool this writer|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/3034218/security/social.html|website=CSO Online|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Hacking back"==
&lt;!--https://www.nap.edu/read/12997--&gt;

Legal theorists and policy makers are increasingly considering authorizing the private sector to take active measures on their own through "hacking-back" (also known as hackbacks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/international-law-and-private-actor-active-cyber-defensive-measures|website=Lawfare|accessdate=13 April 2017|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Megan L. |title=Authorizing Private Hackback Would Be a Wild West for Cybersecurity |url=https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2018/09/06/authorizing-private-hackback-would-be-a-wild-west-for-cybersecurity/ |accessdate=7 September 2018 |publisher=Law.com |date=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question: 'when does a cyber-attack (or threat therof) give rise to a right of self-defense?' is the subject of studies and discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waxman|first1=Matthew C.|title=Self-Defensive Force Against Cyber Attacks: Legal, Strategic and Political Dimensions|date=19 March 2013|ssrn=2235838|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 [[Tom Graves]] proposed the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC) that would enhance the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] (CFAA) to allow individuals and the private sector to use limited defensive measures, including tools that are currently restricted under the CFAA, for identification and stopping attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawkins|first1=Garrett|title=Rep.

Brad Maryman warns of [[unintended consequences]], stating that in his view "the notion that we should legislate and accept a level of undocumented and unmonitored cyber actions by anyone who thinks they have been hacked is unfathomable".&lt;ref name=usn1/&gt;

Officers and enlisted personnel, in the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] and elsewhere, regularly take an oral oath to support and defend the primary convening document (i.e. constitution, articles of confederation, ruling laws and statutes) and/or the supreme leader of the nation-state. There have been countless cases throughout human history where commissioned military officers and enlisted personnel—as individuals or small groups—have chosen to question and disobey the orders of their superior officers or the supreme leader of the state.

==Forms of dissent==
Dissent by military officers falls into two main categories: violent and non-violent. In essence, when a military officer, military leader chooses to oppose the orders given to him by his superior officers or national leader, he/she must decide whether his counter-action will be violent or non-violent in nature and in aim.

Violent or forcible dissent or opposition among military officers against their superiors or national authority is further broken down into the following categories:
* [[Assassination]]
* [[Coup d'état]]
* [[Sabotage]]

Non-violent actions which are designed to dissent from the command authority come in the following formats:
* Refusal to execute [[General order|orders]]
* Refusal to [[Military deployment|deploy]] or [[Mobilization|mobilize]]
* [[Conscientious objection]]
* [[Disinformation]]
* [[Espionage]]
* [[Defection]]
* Leaking of information to the [[news media|press]]
* Jumping the [[chain-of-command]] (appealing to a higher military authority)
* Modifying or changing original orders

==Dissent versus conscientious objection==
[[Conscientious objection]] commonly refers to those who are being drafted into military service, who are not currently in military service. However, there are cases in history where an officer or enlisted member of the military has volunteered for military service (or is drafted) and they find later on that they do not agree with their government's war policies or orders.

==Dissent in the case of war crimes==
There are countless examples in recent history where military officers have refused to execute the orders of their superiors because they felt their military was party to [[war crimes]].

Several [[Germany|German]] generals during [[World War II]] either refused orders, modified orders, or mounted [[coups]] or [[assassination]] attempts against the German leader [[Adolf Hitler]]. Many of these generals were highly respected by the [[German people]] and within the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]], notably [[Erwin Rommel]], [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], and [[Otto von Stülpnagel]].

With respect to recent history, [[United States]] and [[UK]] involvement in the [[War in Iraq]] has produced notable dissenters who, in their words, feel that war crimes have been perpetrated by American and British forces in [[Iraq]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Ehren Watada]] and [[Malcolm Kendall-Smith]]—an American officer and British officer, respectively—have been [[court martialed]] for refusing to deploy with their units. Both Watada and Kendall-Smith dissent on the grounds that their respective governments are party to war crimes in [[Iraq]].

An '''electoral list''' is a grouping of candidates for election, usually in [[Proportional representation|proportional election systems]], but also in some plurality election systems. An electoral list can be registered by a [[party-list proportional representation|political party]] or can constitute a group of independent candidates. Lists can be [[open list|open]], in which case electors have some influence over the ranking of the winning candidates, or [[closed list|closed]], in which case the order of candidates is fixed at the registration of the list.

Electoral lists are required for [[party-list proportional representation]] [[voting system]]s.

An electoral list (not to be confused with an [[electoral roll]]) is made according to the applying [[nomination rules]] and [[election law|election rules]]. Depending on the type of election, a [[political party]], a [[general assembly]], or a board meeting, may elect or appoint a [[nominating committee]] that will add, and if required, prioritize list-candidates according to their preferences. Qualification, popularity, gender, age, geography, and occupation are preferences that may influence the committee's work. The committee's proposed list may then be changed in a selection meeting, where new candidates may be added, or existing candidates may be moved or removed from the list.&lt;ref&gt;[[:no:Norges politiske system#Nominasjonsprosessen|The Norwegian political system (Norwegian)]]{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the internal process is over, the final list is made public and is printed on the [[ballot paper]] used in the election.

'''Euergetism '''(or '''evergetism''', from the [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|εὐεργετέω}}, "doing good deeds") was the ancient practice of high-status and wealthy individuals in society distributing part of their wealth to the community.  This was evident in the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron-client relations in ancient Rome]]. The modern term was coined by French historian [[André Boulanger]] and subsequently used in the works of [[Paul Veyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Politics of Munificence in the Roman Empire : Citizens, Elites and Benefactors in Asia Minor |last1= Zuiderhoek |first1= Arjan|year= 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge ; New York |isbn=978-0-521-51930-4 |url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/19304/excerpt/9780521519304_excerpt.pdf |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Patterns of Patronage: The Politics and Ideology of Public Building in the Eastern Roman Empire (31 BCE - 600 CE) |author= Angela V.

==Development of euergetism in the Hellenistic period==
[[File:Honorific inscription Athens Louvre Ma156.jpg|thumb|left|Inscription honoring Aristoxenos, son of Demophon probably benefactor of the gymnasium in Athens, late third or second century BC., Musée du Louvre.]]

During the second half of the 4th century BC, profound changes occurred in the financing of public institutions. Without the backing or funding from the wealthy, at least symbolically, the legitimacy of these institutions could be called into question by the city. The idea emerged that the rich people were not contributing unless required or compelled to do so. At the same time, around 355 BC, [[Demosthenes]] mentioned the lack of funding from the wealthy in the ''Against Leptines'' and [[Xenophon]] in ''Poroi''.

At the end of the century, [[Demetrius Phalereus]] abolished the two most important Athenian liturgies. The [[trierarchy]] was no longer necessary because Athens withdrew from the international arena after his defeat at 322,&lt;ref name="Baslez 2007, p. 350"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baslez|2007|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; and choregy, was replaced by a judiciary elective, "the presidential contest (agonothésie), whose funding was supported by the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Habicht|2000|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many honorary degrees in ''honor agonothetai'' were available, showing that the amounts incurred by them voluntarily to supplement those supported by the city far exceeded the cost of the former choregy. Thus, in 284/3, the agonothetai elected, the poet Philippides, ceased to be reimbursed by the city money it advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Habicht|2000|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some old [[magistrate]]s were often funded by their owner: Athens, priests generally provided the victims of sacrifice, when the cosmetic and continues to oversee the ephebia in the Hellenistic period, that is now on his own money that finances most of the sacrifices, prizes for competitions, and routine maintenance of equipment and buildings. Although no document mentions as such that the holder of the office shall assume the financial cost of its charge,&lt;ref name="Baslez 2007, p. 350"/&gt; entries published annually in his honor shows that oversees the flow of the institution, some emphasizing that this city does not have to spend this year.

Thus gradually it was chosen to operate close to the philanthropy, which, like Aristotle wrote, "to safeguard the oligarchs" for the most important [...], magistrates must attach their public expenditure, so that people do not agree to participate and have the same indulgence to the judges that they must pay their judiciaries of a large sum.&lt;ref name="Aristotle, Politics, VI, 7, 6"&gt;Aristotle, Politics, VI, 7, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "at their facility, judges will make magnificent sacrifices, and build some monuments and the people, then taking part in the banquets and feasts, and seeing the city splendidly decorated temples and buildings, wish to maintain the constitution and it will be for the rich as many beautiful testimonies of items they made.&lt;ref name="Aristotle, Politics, VI, 7, 6"/&gt;

However, until the middle of the 2nd century BC., the Greek philanthropy did not match the definition in Veyne. As demonstrated Philip Gauthier,&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Gauthier, Les cités grecques et leurs bienfaiteurs, Athens-Paris, 1985 (BCH, Suppl. XII)&lt;/ref&gt; this is a philanthropy that takes place most often "exclusively in official and civil (judicial and official business)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ouhlen|2004|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the 4th century BC and perhaps even the high Hellenistic period, the city did not create for his benefactors (benefactors) of separate status, superior to other citizens, and it recognizes their quality and not the title of benefactor. She thanked them and "get up with his service as any other citizen, but with higher average",&lt;ref name="Ouhlen, p. 339"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ouhlen|2004|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same way that voluntary contributions ([[epidoseis]]) enabled everyone, in proportion to his income, to demonstrate its commitment to the city by a gift of many talents or just a few pence.

The Euergetism, as they developed next to a liturgical system "which is both a continuation and denial",&lt;ref name="Ouhlen, p. 339"/&gt; allowed the city to direct its service expenditures of the richest of its members with greater emphasis before the official honors due to them in thanks. The latter could thus be obtained, whenever necessary, that funding is assured for the most urgent of needs, without incurring unnecessary costs, and without giving the feeling of stress to members of its elite, which retain the ability to book their wealth to their personal use.

The gradual disappearance of the liturgies occurred in the shift of the vocabulary of the Hellenistic period: the name {{transl|grc|leitourgia}} - and the verb {{transl|grc|leitourgein}} - loses its meaning strictly "expenditure imposed by the city" to mean "any part taken in an expenditure of public interest",&lt;ref name="Baslez 2007, p. 350"/&gt; including in conjunction with a public office (Judicial or priesthood).

This dilution of the immune system in a Liturgy of Euergetism will be consumed as part of low Hellenistic period. Financing Cities can then be compared to that in force throughout the Roman Empire at that time, the full Euergetism analyzed by Veyne in his book ''Bread and Circuses''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Veyne|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hellenistic generosity ==
'''Hellenistic generosity''' is a social practice where rich people help out poor ones, and it appeared in the Hellenistic world for the first time. This soon became a moral obligation for the wealthy citizens when seeking high magistrate positions, such as [[consul]] or [[aedile]]. Hellenistic generosity not only benefited {{lang|la|[[Bread and circuses|panis et circenses]]}}, but also public buildings and [[Roman road|roads]], which bore the inscription {{lang|la|D.S.P.F.}} ({{lang|la|de sua pecunia fecit}}, "done with his own money"), along with the name of the donator.

== End of euergetism ==
From the 3rd century AD on, economic pressures made euergetism more difficult to practice. It eventually disappeared after [[Justinian]]'s death and was replaced by the churches' redistribution action.

'''Forest Peoples Programme''' (FPP) advocates an alternative vision of how forests should be managed and controlled, based on respect for the rights of the peoples who know them best. FPP works with forest peoples in [[South America]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]], to help them secure their [[rights]], build up their own organisations and negotiate with governments and companies as to how economic development and conservation are best achieved on their lands.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/guyanas-wapichan-tribe-map-their-way-toward-a-greener-future/|title=Reuters AlertNet -|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024212/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/guyanas-wapichan-tribe-map-their-way-toward-a-greener-future|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Forest Peoples Programme (FPP) was founded in 1990 in response to the forest crisis, specifically to support indigenous forest peoples’ struggles to defend their lands and livelihoods. It registered as a non-governmental human rights Dutch Stichting in 1997, and then later, in 2000, as a UK charity, No. 1082158 and a company limited by guarantee (England &amp; Wales) Reg. No. 3868836, with a registered office in the [[UK]].

FPP’s focus, in the beginning, came from the expertise and relationships that the small founding team had with specific communities, primarily in the Guyanas and in South and [[South East Asia]].&lt;ref name="Guyana: Fragile Frontier"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Guyana-Fragile-Frontier-Marcus-Colchester/dp/0853459711/|title=Guyana: Fragile Frontier|first=Marcus|last=Colchester|date=18 June 1997|publisher=Monthly Review Press,U.S.|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest Peoples Programme has grown into a respected and successful organisation that now operates right around the tropical forest belt where it serves to bridge the gap between policy makers and forest peoples. Through [[advocacy]], practical projects and [[capacity building]], FPP supports forest peoples to deal directly with the outside powers, regionally, nationally, and internationally that shape their lives and futures. Forest Peoples Programme has contributed to, and continues supporting, the growing indigenous peoples' movement whose voice is gaining influence and attention on the world-wide stage.

==Vision==
Forests are owned and controlled by forest peoples in ways that ensure sustainable livelihoods, equity and well-being based on [[respect]] for their [[rights]], [[knowledge]], cultures and identities.

==Mission==
Forest Peoples Programme supports the [[rights]] of peoples who live in forests and depend on them for their livelihoods. FPP work to create political space for forest peoples to secure [[rights]], control their lands and decide their own futures.

==Goals==
• Get the [[rights]] and interests of forest peoples recognised in laws, policies and programmes&lt;br&gt;
• Support forest peoples to build their own capacities to claim and exercise their [[human rights]]&lt;br&gt;
• Counter top-down policies and projects that threaten the rights of forest peoples&lt;br&gt;
• Promote community-based sustainable forest management&lt;br&gt;
• Ensure equity, counter discrimination and promote gender justice&lt;br&gt;
• Inform NGO actions on forests in line with forest peoples’ visions&lt;br&gt;
• Link up indigenous and forest peoples’ movements at the regional and international levels

==Principles==
FPP aims to create a political space for forest peoples to secure their rights, control their lands and decide their own futures. Below are the cross-cutting core concepts that guide the approach and work of FPP.

'''Free, prior and informed consent (FPIC)'''
‘[[Free prior and informed consent]]’ (FPIC), is the principle that a [[community]] has the right to give or withhold its [[consent]] to proposed projects that may affect the lands they customarily own, occupy or otherwise use.

&lt;ref name="Oxfam: Guide to Free Prior and Informed Consent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/none/oxfam-guide-free-prior-and-informed-consent/|title=Oxfam: Guide to Free Prior and Informed Consent - Cultural Survival|website=www.culturalsurvival.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Forests Dialogue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.yale.edu/tfd/dialogues/free-prior-and-informed-consent/|title=The Forests Dialogue -|website=environment.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; FPIC, for years advanced by FPP, is now a key principle in international law and jurisprudence related to indigenous peoples.

'''Self-determination'''
FPP works to realise forest peoples’ right to [[self-determination]], a fundamental right of all peoples that underpins the work of the [[United Nations]]. That this right also applies to peoples within nation states is made explicitly clear in the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (UNDRIP) in Articles 3 and 4.

==Work Themes==
Forest Peoples Programme organises its work into three sub-programmes on: Legal and Human Rights, Environmental Governance, and Responsible Finance; and into three cross-cutting themes on: Climate and Forests, Communications, and Administration.

==Publications==
Forest Peoples Programme produces a wide range of publications, including reports, briefings, training manuals, papers, submissions to human rights bodies, statements, letters, urgent action requests, as well as [http://www.forestpeoples.org/news news articles] and the [http://www.forestpeoples.org/enewsletters FPP E-Newsletter].

The '''Franklin Community''' was the first [[List of Owenite communities in the United States|American Owenite community]] established in [[New York (state)|New York]] state. Founded in 1826 two miles from the [[Hudson River]] near the town of [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], the enterprise stumbled in its first year of existence and was terminated later that same year.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Portrait of Robert Owen.png|thumb|right|220px|Robert Owen (1771-1858), social theorist who inspired the establishment of Franklin Community.]]

The arrival of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] social reformer [[Robert Owen]] on American shores in the fall of 1824 was met with public curiosity and expectation. Owen's ideas about the relationship between human behavior and happiness and the material conditions of their existence were familiar to intellectuals in the United States from about 1817, when they were publicized in various British reviews.&lt;ref name=Bassett161&gt;T.D. Seymour Bassett, "The Secular Utopian Socialists," in Donald Drew Egbert and Stow Persons (eds.), ''Socialism and American Life: Volume 1.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1952; pg. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, those favoring the [[communitarianism|communitarian]] ideal had established an organization called the [[New York Society for Promoting Communities]], a group headed by a [[Quaker]] [[apothecary]] named Cornelius C. Blatchly.&lt;ref name=Bassett161 /&gt; It would be Blatchly and his associates who would welcome Owen to New York on November 4, 1824,&lt;ref name=Bassett161 /&gt; presenting the visitor with a copy of the group's 1822 publication extracting Owen's writings, ''Essay on Common Wealths.''&lt;ref&gt;Frank Podmore, ''Robert Owen: A Biography: Volume 1.'' London: Hutchinson &amp; Co., 1906; pg. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

A great popular interest surrounded Owen's arrival and subsequent announcement that he had purchased an entire established community in the state of Indiana from the [[Harmony Society]] for $140,000, with a view to establishing a model community to test his social theories in the crucible of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick A. Bushee, ''Communistic Societies in the United States," ''Political Science Quarterly, vol. 20, no. 4 (Dec. 1905), pg. 626.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite — or perhaps due to — the distance between New York and the Owenite example on the American frontier in Indiana, interest grew in establishment parallel communities elsewhere.

Despite the existence of the New York Society for Promoting Communities, it would not be the formal authority behind the creation of an Owenite colony; instead it would be a group of committed [[free thought|freethinkers]] from the New York City area, including [[atheist]] leader George Houston, who had previously suffered imprisonment in England for his anti-deist writings.&lt;ref name=Bestor203&gt;Arthur Bestor, ''Backwoods Utopias: The Sectarian Origins and the Owenite Phase of Communitarian Socialism in America, 1663-1829.'' [1950] Enlarged 2nd Edition. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1970; pg. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===

In the spring of 1826 the Franklin Community was founded, with a preparatory constitution approved in March and a site selected the following month.&lt;ref name=Bestor203 /&gt; The site selected was located about two miles from the [[Hudson River]] near the town of [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], New York. Included were 120 or 130 acres of farmland, with a purchase price of $16,000 or $18,000 stipulated.&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, ''Backwoods Utopias,'' pp. 203-204.&lt;/ref&gt; The enterprise was named in honor of [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1709-1790), one of the founding fathers of the American republic.

George Houston was named secretary of the new Owenite community.&lt;ref name=Bestor203 /&gt; Families began to move in immediately, beginning to farm the land early in May 1826.&lt;ref name=Bestor204&gt;Bestor, ''Backwoods Utopias,'' pg. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Many believed that their so-called "[[sweat equity]]" (to borrow a modern phrase) would be sufficient to attain membership in the community.&lt;ref name=Bestor204 /&gt; Deprived of access to Robert Owen's purse, the fledgling community found it difficult to raise funds, only managing to raise the necessary one-third downpayment on June 23, 1826.&lt;ref name=Bestor204 /&gt; A financial restructuring was required and the constitution was altered shortly thereafter to require a cash payment in exchange for community membership — a change which resulted in the great unhappiness of early participants, who felt themselves cheated and robbed of their pioneering labor.&lt;ref name=Bestor204 /&gt;
190 years later the house stands today in the town of Haverstraw on the outskirts of the village of West Haverstraw.  An article exists in the local paper titled "The short and unhappy life of a backwoods Utopia" by Isabelle Savell

Adding to the discord was the arrival of Houston and his atheist associates, who immediately set about secularizing the community's schools, encouraging Sunday labor in violation of Biblical precepts, and establishing a "Church of Reason" — backing their actions with anti-religious quotations from Robert Owen's written works.&lt;ref name=Bestor204 /&gt;

===Termination and legacy===

Underfinanced and wracked with discord, the Franklin Community failed about five months after the launch of the venture.&lt;ref name=Bestor204 /&gt;

Former secretary of the Franklin Community George Houston would found a new [[rationalism|rationalist]] journal in January 1827, called ''The Correspondent.''&lt;ref name=Bestor203 /&gt; Houston would be joined in his editorial task by [[Abner Kneeland]], whose subsequent trial for [[blasphemy]] would prove to be one of the landmark political events of the decade of the 1830s.&lt;ref name=Bestor203 /&gt;

'''Green jobs''' or '''green-collared jobs'''&amp;nbsp;are, according to the&amp;nbsp;[[United Nations Environment Program]], "work in agricultural, manufacturing,&amp;nbsp;[[research and development]]&amp;nbsp;(R&amp;D), administrative, and service activities that contribute(s) substantially to preserving or restoring&amp;nbsp;[[environmental quality]]. Specifically, but not exclusively, this includes jobs that help to protect ecosystems and&amp;nbsp;[[biodiversity]]; reduce energy, materials, and water consumption through high efficiency strategies; de-carbonize the economy; and minimize or altogether avoid generation of all forms of waste and pollution."&amp;nbsp;The environmental sector has the dual benefit of mitigating environmental challenges as well as helping&amp;nbsp;[[economic growth]].

Green jobs, according to the&amp;nbsp;[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]],&amp;nbsp;are classified as, "jobs in business that produce goods or services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/green/overview.htm|title=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "jobs in which workers' duties involve making their establishment's production processes more environmentally friendly or use fewer natural resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/green/green_definition.htm|title=The BLS Green Jobs Definition|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Labor Statistics categorizes Green Jobs into the following: Water conservation, Sustainable forestry, Biofuels, Geothermal energy, Environmental Remediation, Sustainability, Energy auditors, Recycling, Electric Vehicles, Solar power, and Wind energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/green/greencareers.htm|title=Green Careers|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These definitions include jobs which seek to use or develop [[renewable energy|renewable forms of energy]] (i.e. wind, [[hydropower]], [[geothermal]], wind, [[landfill gas]] and municipal solid waste) as well as increase their efficiency. Under the green jobs domain education, training, and public awareness are also included. These jobs seek to enforce regulations, support education, and increase public influence for the benefit of the environment.

==== Under Bush Administration 2001-2009 ====
The Business Energy Investment Tac credit is a United States federal policy introduced in 2005 under the Bush administration to promote the implementation of green energy sources through a 30% federal tax return in both residential and commercial projects. Individuals and companies were able to apply to the ITC to receive credits for investments in green energy technologies including solar, fuel cell and wind energy technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lips|first1=Bryan|title=Business Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC)|url=http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/658|website=dsireusa.org|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITC has been extended multiple times, most recently in 2015 through a multi-year extension that will maintain the 30% return up until 2019, afterward decreasing to 26% until 2020 and 22% until 2021. After 2021, commercial credits would reduce to 10% and 0% for residential projects. The Solar Energy Industries Association has attributed stability in the growth of solar energy industries in the U.S. to the implementation of the ITC since 2006 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Industry Data|url=http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data|website=seia.org|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the implementation of the ITC, the U.S. solar industry has experienced growth in implementation of solar technology, mainly due to the rapidly decreasing overhead costs as the solar industry was spurred to production and development through the ITC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Industry Data|url=http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data|website=seia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solar industry is projected to employ over 420,000 individuals by 2020- nearly double of the 260,000 solar workers in 2016- and contribute $30 billion to the United States economy annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC)|url=http://www.seia.org/policy/finance-tax/solar-investment-tax-credit|website=seia.org|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barack Obama|President Obama]] campaigned under the promise of creating 5 million new green jobs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/550007-barack-obama-2008-blueprint-for-change.html#document/p19/a85280|title=Barack Obama 2008: "Blueprint for Change"|last=(Politifact)|first=Becky Bowers|website=www.documentcloud.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obamas plan included the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (ACES)]] proposed a cap and trade system which would bring in revenue that would used to invest in clean energy technology creating 5 million new jobs&lt;ref name="Obameter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/439/create-5-million-green-jobs/|title=Updated - The Obameter: Create 5 million "green" jobs|work=PolitiFact|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed through the house but never made it to the senate floor and therefore was never written into law. Secondly, due to the 2013 Balanced Budget and [[Emergency Deficit Control Act]] the federal government "discontinued measuring all green jobs" which makes tracking job growth extremely difficult.&lt;ref name="Obameter" /&gt;

Although it is unclear if President Obama met his 5 million jobs goal, there was significant growth under his administration. As of March 2016 according to a nonpartisan group, Environmental Entrepreneurs, there were 2.5 million jobs in clean energy with 77,088 jobs solely in the wind industry.&lt;ref name="Obameter" /&gt; During this period of time employment in the solar field was also on the rise. According to the 2015 National Solar Census 2015 marked the third consecutive year in which solar growth was at 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesolarfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2015-Census-Factsheet-FINAL.pdf|title=2015 NATIONAL SOLAR JOBS CENSUS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA), passed in early 2009, includes provisions for new jobs in industries such as energy, utilities, construction, and manufacturing with a focus toward energy efficiency and more environmentally-friendly practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/greenjobs/ Going Green: Safe and Healthy Jobs].

In March 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] appointed [[Van Jones]] as [[Special Advisor for Green Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]] at the [[White House Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ).  Following Jones' resignation in September 2009, no further candidates appear to have been appointed to this position.

The measure was recanted days later, but Trump has proclaimed his intent to “drastically cut the EPA.”  [[Myron Ebell]], a former member of the Trump transition team, when asked about [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] cuts in an interview with [[Associated Press]], responded  "Let's aim [to cut] for half and see how it works out, and then maybe we'll want to go further."

In the 2018 "Make America Great Again Blueprint," the Trump administration projected EPA funding cuts of 31% and discontinued funding for the Clean Power Plan, international climate change programs, and climate change research and partnership programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/2018_blueprint.pdf|title=Whitehouse.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UNEP Green Jobs Initiative ====
In 2008 the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC), and the [[International Employers Organization]] (IEO) jointly launched the Green Jobs Initiative. The purpose is to bring a just transition to a green economy by providing space for workers, employers, and governments to negotiate on policy effective in providing equitable opportunity to green jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forschungsnetzwerk.at/downloadpub/2009_5501_en.pdf#page=10|title=Future Skill Needs for the Green Economy|last=Bulgarelli, et al|date=2009|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data collection and upkeep on Green Goods and Services (GGS) jobs has been discontinued due to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act in 2013. All "measuring green jobs" programs in the US government were eliminated by this Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ggqcew.htm|title=Green Goods and Services News Release|website=www.bls.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Jobs Act of 2007 (H.R. 2847), introduced by Reps. [[Hilda Solis]] (D-CA) and [[John F. Tierney|John Tierney]] (D-MA), "authorized up to $125 million in funding to establish national and state job training programs, administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, to help address job shortages that are impairing growth in green industries, such as energy efficient buildings and construction, renewable electric power, energy efficient vehicles, and biofuels development." &lt;ref&gt;[http://solis.house.gov/list/press/ca32_solis/wida6/greenjobscomm.shtml House Committee Passes Solis' Green Jobs Act], U.S. House of Representatives, June 27, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221125207/http://solis.house.gov/list/press/ca32_solis/wida6/greenjobscomm.shtml |date=21 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Independence and Security Act passed in December 2007 incorporates the Green Jobs Act of 2007.

==== Pathways out of Poverty ====
'''[[Pathways out of Poverty]]''' (POP) is a national workforce training program that was established on August 14, 2009 by the [[Obama administration]] and funded by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) of 2009. POP targets individuals living below or near the poverty level to provide them with skills needed to enter the green job market, focusing on the energy efficiency and renewable energy industries. The training programs focus on teaching basic literacy and job readiness skills. Some of the programs also provide supportive assistance with childcare and transportation to overcome barriers to employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009: Pathways Out of Poverty Grants|url=http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/eta20100039.htm|author=U.S. Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MillionTrees NYC Training Program ====
(MTTP) provides job training opportunities specifically to low-income, [[Job security|job insecure]] 18-24 year-olds who have a high school degree or GED. In 2009, secure full-time salaries of twice the New York State minimum wage of $7.25 were provided to graduates of MTTP by a grant from the [[United States Forest Service|US Forest Service]]. Out of the 16 employed graduates that were interviewed for a study by USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, 75% were male, 25% were female, 81% were black, 19% were brown, 75% had a High School Diploma, 19% had a GED, and 6% went to some high school.

== Demographics ==
According to the Green Equity Toolkit by [[Race Forward]], Green jobs are disproportionately occupied by white men.&lt;ref&gt;Keleher, Terry; Yen, Yvonne (November 2009).&amp;nbsp;''Green Equity Toolkit''. Oakland, CA: Applied Research Center.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Historically, the environmental movement has been white, middle- and upper-class.&lt;ref&gt;Commission for Racial Justice, “Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States: A National Report on the Racial and Socio-Economic Characteristics of Communities with Hazardous Waste Sites,”&amp;nbsp;''Fifty Years of Green: An Environmental History of Middlebury College since 1965'', accessed April 19, 2017,&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://omeka.middlebury.edu/fyg/items/show/316&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, minorities consisted of 1.9 percent (14 out of the 745) of workers for four of the largest environmental organizations ([[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Audubon Society]], and [[Sierra Club]]); out of sixty-three mainstream environmental organizations, 32 percent had no minorities staffed, 22 percent had no board members of color, 19 percent had no volunteers of color, 16 percent had no members of color.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Dorceta Taylor|Taylor, Dorceta E.]] (2011).&amp;nbsp;[http://epubs.utah.edu/index.php/jlrel/article/viewFile/467/335 ''Green Jobs and the Potential to Diversify the Environmental Workforce'']. Michigan: University of Michigan. p.&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a journal in the Ecology Law Quarterly published in 1992, white people disproportionately occupy green jobs since said jobs address environmental concerns not confronted by low-income people and people of color.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cole, L. Employment as the Key to Environmental Protection: The Need for Environmental Poverty Law (1992) 19 Ecology Law Quarterly 619-683.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Environmental lawyers (who are disproportionately white, middle- and upper-class) focus on environmental issues based on aesthetics, recreation, and protecting natural lands outside of their communities; they often do not face environmental problems in their communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Low-income communities and people of color who face environmental problems, such as pollution, do not often have access or will to seek green jobs due to the immediate health hazards in their communities. Instead of green jobs, they often engage in grassroots environmental activism to prevent mortality in their communities from toxicities, such as superfund sites, landfills, incinerators and other health hazards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A report published in 2014 titled, ''The State of Diversity in Environmental Organizations,'' states there has been increasing racial diversity over the past 50 years, but at a disproportionately slow rate. People of color consist of 38% of the US population and do not exceed 16% of the staff of the environmental organizations studied (191 conservation and preservation organizations, 74 government environmental agencies, 28 environmental grant-making foundations). Employed ethnic minorities disproportionately occupy lower-ranked positions in environmental organizations and fewer than 13% occupy leadership positions. A small number of environmental organizations have a diversity manager, diversity committee, or collaborate with low-income or ethnic organizations. Environmental organizations rarely recruit from minority-serving institutions, minority professional gatherings, and other pipelines with talented minorities. Minority interns to environmental organizations are hired less often than their white counterparts. Promotions often go to white females in environmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/els/files/2014/02/FullReport_Green2.0_FINALReducedSize.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green jobs and workforce education ==
The National Council for Workforce Education and AED published a report, Going Green: The Vital Role of Community Colleges in Building a Sustainable Future and a Green Workforce that examines how workforce education and community colleges contribute to the overall efforts in the move toward renewable and clean energy. The report gives examples of initiatives currently in effect nationally as well as offering information as to how to implement programs.

In response to high unemployment and a distressed economy workers need skills that are relevant to their specific geographical locations.  "Instead of making green jobs we need to make jobs green" says Ken Warden, an administrator in workforce education.

'''Healthcare real estate''' is a [[niche market]] within the larger real estate industry. Healthcare real estate or "medical real estate" describes buildings, offices, and campuses leased to members or organizations within the [[healthcare]] community.  These buildings can be owned by hospitals, health systems or private or public third party groups.  There is a rising trend among hospitals, [[health care systems]], and medical practitioners to embrace third party ownership and management of [[real estate]].  By using third party developers, they can preserve their capital resources for acute care needs and focus their attention on helping people, while passing on responsibility of building regulation and maintenance minutiae.

==Differentiation==
Healthcare facilities have detailed technological and regulatory requirements.  Even such building maintenance tasks as cleaning, heating, and cooling are done differently in health care, with demanding sterilization and filtration needs.  In addition to outsourcing building and management tasks, it's becoming increasingly attractive for hospitals to leave building ownership itself to someone else. The concept fits well with the current US development trend pairing [[not-for-profit]] hospitals with for-profit physician groups as partners in new specialty facilities. [[Illinois]], [[Texas]], [[California]], and [[Florida]] accounted for a third of healthcare construction starts in 2007, though the practice of third party ownership is also rising among all [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] areas where space is at a premium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1480052081.html]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130118031225/http://sanantonio.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2007/10/15/story1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

From an [[investor]] viewpoint, healthcare [[REIT]]s as a group generally trade at a premium yield to other REIT categories. It is also considered one of the more stable sectors, along with higher education and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2003/11/10/daily28.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713233009/http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2003/11/10/daily28.html |archivedate=2004-07-13 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; During times of economic decline, health care real estate continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2003/11/10/daily28.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713233009/http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2003/11/10/daily28.html |archivedate=2004-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Health care REITs offer prescription for stress in current market; Demand for doctors largely insulates the investment sector.(News)."

==Factors ==
In 2008, several factors converged to drive healthcare real estate:

*An aging population that requires ever more medical services: As of 2004, there were 36.3 million people in America 65 and older, accounting for 12% of total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/004083.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225231207/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/004083.html |archivedate=2008-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; US Census projects there will be 86.7 million people 65 and older by 2050, comprising 21% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/001720.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313083717/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/001720.html |archivedate=2008-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Advances in technology that allow increasing numbers of medical procedures to be done in offices outside of a hospital setting
*Tight medical office markets in many areas as little new construction came on line for several years
*Rapid population growth in some areas that has outstripped the supply of medical offices
*Increasing interest from investors looking to take advantage of high lease rates and a generally stable physician tenant base.

There have been growth in medical office development through 2015. By the end of 2015, it is estimated that 8.8 million square feet of medical office space will have been developed across the United States. In 2014, 7.1 million square feet was developed across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/speculative-developers-take-medical-projects-off-back-burner-1444728782|title=Speculative Developers Take Medical Projects Off Back Burner|first=Robyn A.|last=Friedman|date=13 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2017|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11065">The presence of LGBTQ officers in law enforcement has a history of controversy.  As times have changed, police forces have adapted by adding [[LGBTQ]] divisions, officers and committees within their ranks to account for legislation established by governments to protect individuals who previously had little or no voice when it came to laws impacting their own communities.
{{TOC right}}

==Diversity and inclusion in policing==
Diversity in service and the elimination of discrimination across the planet is led by many individuals, staff, associations and others within the global police community.

Inclusivity, evolution, acceptance, [[intersectionality]], organizational values and career advancement lead to proud cops and growing acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Couto|first1=Joe|title=Covered in Blue: Police Culture and LGBT Police Officers|url=https://dspace.royalroads.ca/docs/bitstream/handle/10170/736/couto_joe.pdf?sequence=1|website=RoyalRoads.ca|publisher=dspace.royalroads.ca|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, many LGBTQ individuals still face significant discrimination in the police force. In a 2013 study of British forces, Jones and Williams found that almost 20% of sexual minority officers said they experienced discrimination. At the same time, only 25% of those individuals reported the incident to a supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Matthew|last2=Williams|first2=Matthew L.|date=2015-03-04|title=Twenty years on: lesbian, gay and bisexual police officers' experiences of workplace discrimination in England and Wales|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10439463.2013.817998|journal=Policing and Society|volume=25|issue=2|pages=188–211|doi=10.1080/10439463.2013.817998|issn=1043-9463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kristin Halvorsen - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Former party leader [[Kristin Halvorsen]] at the [[World Economic Forum]] panel discussion in January 2008]]
The [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party of Norway]] ({{lang-no|Sosialistisk Venstreparti}} or SV) was founded in 1975. Its history shows a long-term rise in political influence, resulting in part from its emergence from older [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] parties, especially the [[Socialist People's Party (Norway)|Socialist People's Party]].  After initial political setbacks in the 1970s, the party reorganized and regained support, particularly under [[Theo Koritzinsky]] (1983–87) and [[Erik Solheim]] (1987–97). Support dropped in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1997|1997 parliamentary election]] but rose again by the 21st Century, thanks to the party's position as the only sizeable party to the left of the Norwegian [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]].  Labour's move further to the [[Right-wing politics|right]] under [[Jens Stoltenberg]] also helped the party's rise. By 2005, the Socialist Left Party had joined the Labour and [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre]] parties in Norway's governing [[Red-Green Coalition]]. The party has been led by [[Audun Lysbakken]] since 11 March 2012.

==Formation and early years (1973–76)==

After losing all of its seats in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1969|1969 parliamentary election]], the [[Socialist People's Party (Norway)|Socialist People's Party]] sought to create a coalition of various left-wing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Farvel til SF | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = 9 September 1969 | page = 2 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although previously sceptical about working with the [[Communist Party of Norway|Communist Party]], it became a member of the coalition, along with the [[Information Committee of the Labour Movement against Norwegian membership in the European Community|Democratic Socialists – AIK]] and various independent socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Allianser og perspektiver | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = 18 April 1973 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reidar T. Larsen]], then leader of the Communist Party, said that members at the party's [[national convention]] voted unanimously in favour of joining the coalition, which would later go by the name of the Socialist Electoral League.&lt;ref name="SocValg"&gt;{{cite news | title = Sosialistisk Valgforbund | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = 13 April 1973 | page = 6 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four leading members of the coalition were [[Finn Gustavsen]], [[Berge Furre]] (both from the Socialist People's Party), [[Berit Ås]] (from AIK) and Larsen (from the Communist Party). Furre and Ås emphasized that the three parties were still operating independently in 1973, while Larsen was very pleased with the outcome, saying that the main object of the Communist Party was to "unite all socialist parties" in one joint cause. The coalition also stressed that they did not want to create a joint platform for the three parties, claiming it to be unimportant for their image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Røiseland, Øystein | title = Reidar Larsen inn in utenrikskomiteen | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = 28 August 1973 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting in September elected Gustavsen as [[parliamentary leader]] of the coalition, [[Roald Halvorsen]] from the Communist Party as general secretary, and Larsen and Ås to the group board. It was decided that [[Torild Skard]] would seek the position of [[President of the Storting]]. After the meeting, the party sought to build a closer relationship with the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]] and said they would support a Labour-run [[minority government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Stemland, Jens Henrik |author2=Snare, Knut | title = SV Vil Bli Nytt Parti | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = 24 September 1973 | page = 14 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communist Party and founding (1975) ===
By late 1975, most Communist Party members were against dissolving the party to join what would become the Socialist Left. Reidar T. Larsen, the party leader at the time, supported dissolving the party, while deputy leader [[Martin Gunnar Knutsen]] wanted it to continue. Signs before the election showed that the majority supported Knudsen. The media speculated that a faction led by Larsen would split from the party to join the ranks of the Socialist Left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Stemland, Jens Henrik | title = Nå Går SV I Oppløsning | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = 29 September 1975 | page = 8 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Oslo chapter of the coalition, the Communist Party wanted [[Arne Jørgensen (politician)|Arne Jørgensen]], editor-in-chief of the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Friheten]]'', to get the top position on the election list for the [[Norwegian local elections, 1975|1975 local elections]]. However, most Socialist People's Party members in the Oslo chapter did not want him to top the list, because of his background in Norwegian local politics. Socialist People's Party members stated that they had nothing against nominating Communist Party members, pointing out that they had placed communist [[Karl Kromann]] in second place.  Jørgensen lost the election for the first spot, instead obtaining 11th place on the list and eventually losing his nomination to Socialist People's Party official [[Fred Dunhaug]]. Parliamentary leader Finn Gustavsen officially endorsed Jørgensen's candidacy during the national convention in [[Trondheim]], saying he did not want to "split the coalition", which would wreck his plan to unite the coalition into one political party. In May, the Oslo chapter of the coalition held an oral ballot for the top place on the election list, and Jørgensen received 189 votes against Dunhaug's 192. Because the margin was so small, they decided to hold a written ballot, and Dunhaug received 197 votes to Jørgensen's 196. After this result, twenty-one other communist candidates withdrew from their candidacy. This event damaged the unification process and internal conflict continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tross Apell fra Gustavsen: Oslo SV Sprakk | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 13 May 1975 | page = 7 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another conflict between the Socialist People's Party and the Communist Party was the proposal to merge the two party papers, ''Friheten'' and ''Orientering'', into a new one. However, Larsen rejected this offer, preferring the two papers to continue even if the two parties merged. Berit Ås felt that the party leadership had weakened its position, saying that they had "kicked the ball over to the communists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Kåre Kleivan|Kleivan, Kåre]] | title = Ingen sammenslutning ''Friheten''/''Orientering'': SVs reduserte plass forbauser Berit Ås | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 12 May 1975 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Communist Party rejected the offer, ''Orientering'' was replaced by ''[[Ny Tid]]''.&lt;ref name="nocommunists"&gt;{{cite news | title = Sosialistisk Venstreparti | publisher = [[Store Norske Leksikon|Store Norske Leksikon.no]] | date = | url = http://www.snl.no/Sosialistisk_Venstreparti | language = Norwegian |accessdate = 21 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it was always clear where Larsen stood in the unification process, ever since he became leader of the Communist Party in 1969, he had been able to maintain a strong following in the party. But his support started to waver when he wanted to put an end to the pro-Soviet line the party had held under the leadership of [[Emil Løvlien]]. Larsen had always held a vision of one single united left-wing party to the left of Labour, but this vision was not supported by the communist hardliners. In the aftermath of the Communist Party national convention, Larsen said that his speech was "behind closed doors – and behind closed ears". He suffered a clear defeat at the [[party conference]], and he and his remaining supporters left the Communist Party to join the Socialist Left,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Halvorsen, Terje | title = Reidar T.

Because the policies of the Socialist Left were nearly identical to those of the Socialist People's Party, it has often been seen as the latter's direct successor.&lt;ref name="nocommunists"/&gt;

[[Berit Ås]], a compromise candidate for the party leadership, was elected  at the so-called unification congress. During the 1975 local elections she became the party's most influential figure. However, her campaigning and her debating skills were criticised both by the Norwegian press and within her own party. During the election campaign, Ås wanted to become the party's representative at the leader debates, a position held since the 1960s by Finn Gustavsen from the Socialist People's Party. The weekly newspaper ''[[Dag og Tid]]'' described Ås' performance at the leader debates as "messy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Talen, Bjørn | title = Skulle holde kjeft om TV-striden, men Berit Ås "sladret" | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 2 October 1975 | page = 4 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the party's first national convention in November 1975, it was decided to maintain "a soft party line" towards the remaining Communist Party members still active in the Socialist Left Party. However, they did urge them to leave the Communist Party. [[Rune Fredh]], who had supported Larsen in the Communist Party, called the situation "insane". He still believed that Larsen and the remaining communists would continue to fight for communism in the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Talen, Bjørn |author2=Fure, Reidar | title = Myk SV-linje ovenfor NKP, men NKP'er hardest ut mot sine egne: "Vanvittig Brudd" | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 10 November 1975 | page = 6 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing what many observers called a bad election in 1976, a national convention was held early in 1976. During her short tenure, Ås lost all trust amongst party members. Several leading members were calling for Berge Furre to take over as party chairman. However, early in the nomination process, there were rumours that the party's AIK-Communist wing would establish a united front against former Socialist People's Party members. No factions or party notables supported Ås for reelection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Kleivan, Kåre | title = Sprengstoff på SV-kongressen | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 20 February 1976 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided at the convention that Socialist Left Party members could only be members of one party at the time, which meant that the remaining Communist Party members were forced to choose between the Socialist Left Party and the Communist Party. Larsen and Fredh, the [[Party Secretary of the Socialist Left Party|Socialist Left Party Secretary]], told delegates at the convention that "from now on, the road the Communist Party is following is its own".&lt;ref name="internalone"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Stamland, Jens Henrik |author2=Iversen, Arne | title = Oslo-Bitter Indre Strid: Berit Ås satt punktum for seg selv | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 21 February 1976 | page = 5 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furre was elected as party chairman at this convention, with little or no opposition.&lt;ref name="nocommunists"/&gt;

On the election list for the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1977|1977 election]], Ås became the party's second candidate in Oslo for a seat in the [[Storting]], having lost first place to [[Stein Ørnhøi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Malmø, Morten | title = Ørnhøi slo ut Berit Ås | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 12 December 1976 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the party's internal difficulties, its electoral base was greatly weakened in 1977:&lt;ref name="internalone"/&gt; only one Socialist Left candidate from Oslo, and only two nationwide, won seats in the Storting.&lt;ref name="secondelection"&gt;{{cite web | title = Stortingsvalget 1977.

==Berge Furre (1976–83)==

===Early leadership and internal strife (1976–77)===
[[Berge Furre]], previously known unofficially as the Socialist People's Party's "crown prince", became party chairman after the feud between Ås and Finn Gustavsen over who would represent the party during the 1975 local elections. Gustavsen resigned as parliamentary leader, as early signs indicated that he did not have the full support of the party's Election Committee. The party, which suffered several aftershocks after its founding, was severely disorganized. ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' speculated that the current leadership would be replaced by a troika consisting of Furre (from the Socialist People's Party) as party chairman, Larsen (from the Communist Party) as parliamentary leader and Ås (from the Democratic Socialists – AIK) as deputy leader.&lt;ref name="publicrelations"&gt;{{cite news | author = Stemland, Jens H. | title = Troika-ledelse eller Furre i SV? | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 14 February 1976 | page = 4 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the Socialist Left Party had several destabilising effects, such as weakening the party's voter base. Several opinion polls indicated that many voters were leaving, or thinking of leaving, the party or voting for the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] in the 1977 election.&lt;ref name="publicrelations"/&gt; As the power struggle between the left- and right-wing factions worsened, [[Steinar Stjernø]] was accused of trying to expel the party's [[social democratic]] wing (the right-wing faction). However, Sternjø called the rumours absurd. The reason for the accusation was that Stjernø wanted to create a "new and radical alternative for the Norwegian working class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Kleivan, Kare |author2=Iversen, Arne | title = ''Klassekampen'' lanseres fraksjonskamp i SV | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 11 September 1976 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the national convention where Ås stepped down as party chairwoman, the party had not succeeded in making itself a viable option for the common voter. Furre told the convention's delegates that the party would be able to win over voters, and take several from the Labour Party, if and when the internal situation stabilised. Another difficulty for the party, according to Furre, was that [[Nordli's Cabinet|Odvar Nordli's Cabinet]] was moving the Labour Party further to the [[Centrism|centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Stemland, Jens Henrik | title = SV fra kruttrøyk til abrakadabra | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 21 February 1976 | page = 4 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; It caused some controversy that two of the newly elected Members of Parliament had been [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|convicted of treason]] for collaborating with the Nazis during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2008/07/21/541337.html|title=Dommen over Hanna|work=[[Dagbladet]]|last=Dahl|first=Hans Fredrik|date=21 July 2008|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing that the Labour Party had moved further to the political centre, Furre commented that the Socialist Left Party could only support a left-oriented minority government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Kristiansen, Stein K. |author2=Aaserud, Ivar | title = SV-krav om venstrevri i AP | work = [[Verdens Gang]]  | date = 5 March 1977 | page = 5 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour Party Secretary [[Ivar Leveraas]] responded negatively to Furre's comment, saying "It isn't appropriate for the Labour Party to sit down together with the Socialist Left to discuss our political program and conditions for support, as Berge Furre requires."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Kristiansen, Stein K. | title = Furres skulder møter kald skulder | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 5 March 1977 | page = 5 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1977, it was known that both Furre and Finn Gustavsen had revealed classified information during an open meeting in the [[People's Houses|People's House]] of Oslo on 22 August 1977, after threatening to do so.&lt;ref name="skjebneor"&gt;{{cite news | author = Stemland, Jans Henrik | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | title = SV etter skjebneåret: – uten illusjoner | page = 3 | language = Norwegian |date = 21 December 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this became known, the parliament established a Committee to investigate them. Not knowing what to do, representatives from the [[Odelstinget]] voted to shelve the case.&lt;ref name="Furrecase"&gt;{{cite web | author = Forr, Gudleiv | url = http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Berge_Furre/utdypning | publisher = [[Store Norske Leksikon|Store Norske Leksikon.no]]  | title = Berge Furre | language = Norwegian |accessdate = 28 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 44 for and 47 against prosecuting them. When the result was made official, the media speculated that it was some kind of "punishment" of the party, since the incident proved that the party was unable to protect valuable information which could have jeopardized Norway's security interests.{{Clarify|date=December 2011|post-text=(see talk page)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | title = Folkets Selv Knuste SV | page = 5 | language = Norwegian |date = 13 October 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having what ''Verdens Gang'' described as a "disastrous election", in which the Socialist Left lost fourteen of their sixteen seats in the Storting, the party discussed changing its election platform. The platform, which had changed little since the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1973|1973 election]], was the centre of a power struggle, in which some Socialist Left Party members were calling for the removal of the peace paragraph (which called for the disbanding of the [[Military of Norway|Norwegian military]] and the removal of foreign military bases located in Norway). Several leading party members opposed this paragraph. Furre and Gustavsen, both of whom came from the moderate camp, wanted to make the paragrah more moderate, and they succeeded at the [[1977 Socialist Left Party national convention|1977 national convention]].&lt;ref name="skjebneor"/&gt; In the aftermath of the election, [[Odvar Nordli]], then the Labour [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]], criticised the Socialist Left for being "capitalists" who supported [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] policies, and further claimed that the Labour Party was the only remaining "anti-capitalist" alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | title = Er Nordli Blitt Helt Desperat? | page = 33 | language = Norwegian |date = 5 February 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[Norwegian local elections, 1979|1979 local elections]], the internal struggle continued, and ''Verdens Gang'' claimed the situation inside the party was like a "civil war". When asked about the situation, Furre controversially claimed that there had never been so much stability within the party, considering that the ''main'' policy issues had been solved during the [[1979 Socialist Left Party national convention|1979 national convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Kristiansen, Stein K. | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | title = Er Proletår "borgekrig" | page = 4 | language = Norwegian |date= 7 August 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's electoral base became even smaller during the 1979 election, when it won 4.1% in the municipal and 4.4% in the county elections.&lt;ref name="manyelections"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://home.online.no/~b-aardal/k_f_valg.pdf | title = Elections | page =  | publisher = Norsk Samfunnsvitenskapelig datatjeneste (NSD) | date =  | accessdate = 2 March 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100702145822/http://home.online.no/~b-aardal/k_f_valg.pdf | archivedate = 2 July 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1983 Socialist Left Party national convention|national convention of 1983]], the party was able to stabilise itself greatly. This national convention adopted socialism as the party's most important campaign promise during the election, with the majority of the delegates voting in favour. [[Hanna Kvanmo]], parliamentary leader of the Socialist Left Party, claimed after the convention that, for the first time in the party's history, there was a "consensus in most areas". Furre was again reelected as party chairman, while [[Hilde Bojer]] and [[Torbjørn Dahl]] became the party's first and second [[deputy leader]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Kristiansen, Stein K. |author2=Bjaaland, Nils | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | title = SV går i vannet | page = 3 | language = Norwegian | date = 16 March 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Socialist Left Party was able to increase its voting share by 0.7 percentage points, from 4.2% to 4.9% nationwide, during the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1981|1981 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref name="manyelections"/&gt;

=== Resignation (1981–83) ===
Beginning in 1981, Party Secretary [[Erik Solheim]] became very critical of the party's left wing. He claimed that these radicals contributed nothing to the party and were more interested in being against everything than in supporting any policies. Writing for the party newspaper, ''Ny Tid'', Solheim criticised the party's support for what he claimed to be extreme [[progressive taxation]], and said he wanted to give the party a new public image. He also accused the party of having become conservative&amp;nbsp;– objecting to change, for example&amp;nbsp;– and claimed that there had not been any major changes to the party's policies since its establishment in 1975. Many members supported Solheim's criticism, and it led to renewed conflict between the right- and left-wing factions of the party. Several leading party officials agreed with Solheim's criticism. Furre, for example, shared several of his views and told the press that the party had discussed the same old topics ''ad nauseam'' for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Talen, Bjørn | title = Nei til flere Nei | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 9 November 1981 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furre announced his resignation as party chairman early in 1983. None of the leading party members of the time, most notably Hanna Kvanmo, [[Per Maurseth]] and Hilde Bojer, sought the party's chairmanship. Because of this [[Theo Koritzinsky]] was elected the party's new chairman at its 1983 national convention. The majority in the party's Election Committee had officially endorsed him beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Gauslaa, Stein |author2=Solberg, Trond | title = Koritzinsky ny SV-leder | work = [[Verdens Gang]] | date = 4 January 1983 | page = 4 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its 1983 national convention, the Socialist Left Party initiated an action plan that supported an increase in [[government spending]] on the elderly and addressed what they called "serious issues with the [[welfare state]]". [[Theo Koritzinsky]] wanted to increase the pension up to at least 40,000 and at most 50,000 [[Norwegian krone]]r. The action plan was heavily promoted, and Koritzinsky tried to collaborate with both the Labour Party and the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]] to get it passed in the Storting. Another worry of Koritzinsky and the party was that, in their eyes, the [[public sector]] had begun to decay, which they feared would lead to increased unemployment within that sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = SV: Eldres trygghet må bedres | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 17 August 1983 | page = 18 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his campaign,{{Which|date=December 2011}} Koritzinsky made a habit of campaigning outside the major cities. In an interview with the [[Norwegian News Agency]], he expressed amazement at the support he was able to gather, and even claimed "renewed interest" in the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Demostrativt Usosialis Politikk | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 8 September 1983 | page = 4 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; While disappointed with the initial results in the [[Norwegian local elections, 1983|1983 local elections]], he was pleased with the overall outcome of both the Socialist Left Party and the Labour Party. However, he was worried about the increased interest in right-wing parties, especially the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Solvoll, Einar |author2=Svabø, Terje | title = Et skuffende valg, et dårlig valg! | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 13 September 1983 | page = 15 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Invasion of Grenada|American invasion of Grenada]], the party organised protests in Oslo against the war, during which Koritzinsky accused the political right of being slaves to the United States Government. Over 200,000 demonstrators attended the protests, and many Latin American interest groups were vocal in their support for the demonstrations. Koritzinsky criticised western diplomacy for condemning the Soviet Union, saying it was unfair that the [[First World]] only denounced military action when the Soviet Union or the communist bloc engaged in it, while remaining passive if the United States did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Godager, Alf B. | title = Tjenerne Tier | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 4 November 1983 | page = 5 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1983 national convention, the majority of the delegates sought to collaborate with the Labour Party in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1985|1985 parliamentary elections]]. [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], the Labour chairwoman at the time, told the press that she was considering a proposal by the Socialist Left Party that the two parties make joint lists during the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ap. avviser ikke valg samarbeide | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 5 December 1983 | page = 12 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another press conference, Koritzinsky told the press that he was worried that, if an election pact was not established between the two parties, the "bourgeois right-wing parties" would create their own, and maybe even win the election if the left did not respond properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Julsrud, Ottar | title = SV: Listeforbund på venstresiden?| work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 15 December 1983 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Theo Koritzinsky.jpg|thumb|left|Theo Koritzinsky in [[Stavanger]] in 2008, after retiring from national politics]]
In 1984, Koritzinsky wanted party members who were teachers to leave local trade unions for the much larger [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]] (NCTU). He was not the only one promoting this idea: the Labour and Communist parties had done so for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Hammer, Anne-Lise | title = Exit SV i Lektor laget? | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 10 January 1984 | page = 10 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; While supporting his original goal of enlarging the NCTU, Koritzinsky also recognized that there existed good reasons for teachers to work in traditional organisations – before being elected party chairman he was a member of a local trade union himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Frost, Stein | title = Ingen SVutmarsj fra Norsk Lektorlag! | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 12 January 1984 | page = 2 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; On another subject, Koritzinsky favored a [[referendum]] on the question of arming Norway with nuclear weapons, or letting foreign powers position nuclear weapons on Norwegian soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Ottar, Julsrud | title = Krav fra SV: Folkeavstemning om atomvåpen | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 12 March 1984 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Stein Ørnhøi retired from active politics in 1984,&lt;ref name="koritzinskyellergustavsen"&gt;{{cite news | title = Tre menn kjemper i Oslo SV | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 30 October 1984 | page = 5 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koritzinsky was seen as a likely candidate to replace him in the Storting, but it emerged that other party members were also interested in the Storting seat, most notably prominent [[County council (Norway)|Oslo city councillor]] Per Maurseth and veteran politician Finn Gustavsen. Early speculations were highly skeptical of Gustavsen's candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Skjævlesland, Odd Inge | title = Gustavsen på klar jumboplass | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 2 October 1984 | page = 2 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Socialist Left Party's Oslo nomination committee was split between Koritzinsky and Maurseth – they won 12 and 11 votes respectively, while Gustavsen won only one vote.&lt;ref name="koritzinskyellergustavsen"/&gt; As it turned out, Koritzinsky became the Socialist Left Party's first candidate for the Storting and Maurseth became the second, winning a contest against [[Kristin Halvorsen]] for second place. Gustavsen was not even on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Svabø, Terje | title = Gustavsen den store taper | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 2 November 1984 | page = 14 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the national convention of 1985, Koritzinsky told the delegates that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The voters accepted us as part of the labour movement a long time ago. This is proved by the fact that around one third of Labour voters consider the Socialist Left Party as their second voting preference. However, the Labour Party leadership has not accepted us a political force, and it is clear to us, and to them, that more voters will take us seriously if the Labour Party starts treating us with mutual respect. In it there is a political gain.&lt;ref name="SVAFTEN"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kvanmo quickly corrected "in it there is a political gain" to "it may be a political gain". She further stated that the party's most realistic goal was not to collaborate with the Labour Party, but to increase the party's voter base to five or six percent.&lt;ref name="SVAFTEN"&gt;{{cite news | author = Hellberg, Lars | title = SV appell om listeforbund | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 11 March 1985 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1985 national convention, Koritzinsky wanted the party to promote itself as a "red-green alternative" to the Labour Party, an idea which had broad support within the Socialist Left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Hellberg, Lars | title = Kan SV gjøre seg synlig? | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 7 March 1985 | page = 5 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; One month after the national convention, Koritzinsky visited West Germany with officials from the International Department of the Socialist Left Party to discuss [[green politics]] with members of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Green Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Selgård, Gunnar | title = SV inn i samarbeide med de tyske "grønne" | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 19 April 1985 | page = 9 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1985, the Socialist Left rejected an offer made jointly by the Communist Party, the [[Workers' Communist Party (Norway)|Workers' Communist Party]] and the [[Red Electoral Alliance]] (the electoral organisation of the Workers' Communist Party) to establish an electoral coalition in the 1985 parliamentary elections. Instead, Koritzinsky continued with his plans to establish some sort of electoral collaboration with the Labour Party by encouraging all local party chapters to initiate formal contact with their Labour Party counterparts. However, the Labour Party still showed no great interest in a coalition; it neither accepted nor rejected Koritzinsky's offer. Koritzinsky vehemently opposed any notion that his party could collaborate with the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal Party]], claiming that that party had chosen its own path&amp;nbsp;– a path "to suffer a slow and beautiful death in Norwegian politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Wettrejohnsen, Egil | title = SV inviterer til listesamarbeide med Ap. | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 3 June 1985 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism within the party had been able to manifest itself in the weeks before the election, with Party Secretary Erik Solheim believing that the 1985 election could be the party's best election yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Carlsen, Carsten | title = Vår beste valgkamp, tror SV | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 20 June 1985 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the results were announced, [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]] chairman [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]] told the press: "If the Labour Party had supported electoral reform, the socialists would have had a majority in the Storting". In response to Bondevik's statement, Koritzinsky said; "It is obvious that the lack of cooperation may have ruined the chances of a new socialist government", further claiming that he and his party had been open to cooperation with both the Liberal Party and Labour Party all along. [[Odd Einar Dørum]], a Liberal Party member, also criticised the Labour Party's unwillingness to collaborate with other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Hvis Arbeiderpartiet hadde gått inn for forslagene til ny valgordning | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | date = 10 September 1985 | page = | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was no socialist majority in parliament, most Socialist Left members were pleased with the outcome, increasing their vote from 4.9% to 5.4% nationwide and gaining two more seats in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Talen, Bjørn | title = SV fremgang – bitterhet mot Ap | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 10 September 1985 | page = 13 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaving office (1985–87)===
{{main|1987 Socialist Left Party national convention}}
By the mid-1980s, several key party members wanted to move the party closer to the centre of Norwegian politics and make it a viable and open social democratic alternative on the left. Many supported the idea and believed it would expand the party's electoral base. According to ''[[Aftenposten]]'', both Erik Solheim, leader of the party's right wing, and the ageing Finn Gustavsen, leader of its left wing, were likely candidates for the party chairmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Talen, Bjørn | title = Søkelys på Sosialistisk Venstreparti i gammelsosialismens fotefar | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 4 January 1986 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August 1986, Koritzinsky announced in ''[[Dagbladet]]'' that he would step down as party chairman at the 1987 national convention. When asked why, he replied that he found it difficult to combine the chairmanship, his work in the Storting and the extensive travelling, which strained his family life. By August, Solheim and [[Tora Haug]] were the most likely candidates for the position, as Gustavsen had become editor-in-chief of ''Ny Tid'', the party's newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = SV formann trekker seg | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 28 August 1986 | page = 16 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure, Koritzinsky became a well-known and respected public figure, although several leading Socialist Left Party members were discontented with his leadership style, some even complaining that "he was not clever enough" to lead the party. In self-defense, Koritzinsky stated that he himself believed he had received criticism for his unusual working methods, explaining further that during his party chairmanship, he had been worried that leading members had concentrated much power in their own hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Erlandsen, Hans Christian | title = Aktuell profil SVs snille leder | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 29 August 1986 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1986 national convention, the party again tried to improve its relations with the Labour Party, but this time, the Socialist Left Party would only collaborate with them if they moved more to the left. They were certain this could happen, considering that 39 percent of Labour Party members in a recent opinion poll said the Socialist Left Party was the second closest party to them in political views and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Talen, Bjørn | title = Stadig flere i Ap liker SV nest best | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 8 December 1986 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race between Solheim and Haug was close, so several members sought a compromise by trying to persuade Koritzinsky to extend his chairmanship two more years, until the next national convention. When this proved unfruitful, others tried to persuade Kvanmo to run for the chairmanship, but Kvanmo declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Andreassen, Thorleif | title = Trolig løsning på SVs lederproblem: Koritzinsky tar gjenvalg | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 21 January 1987 | page = 3 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 1987 Solheim beat Haug and became the party's new chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Andreassen, Thorleif | title = Erik Solheim ny SV-leder | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = 3 March 1987 | page = 10 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the belief expressed in the media that it would be close to impossible for the two parties to collaborate, the Socialist Left and the Labour Party managed to negotiate a tax settlement. This settlement was met with strong criticism from leading trade unionist [[Jan Davidsen]] of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, who claimed that higher taxes would help the [[Municipalities of Norway|municipalities]] and [[Counties of Norway|counties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | page = 10 | title = Stoltenberg vil ikke øke skattene | date = 20 September 2004 | work = [[Stavanger Aftenblad]] | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party later stated that the sitting government had weakened its position after handling{{Clarify|date=December 2011}} Norway's national budget with the Progress Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | page = | title = SV: – Opposisjonen styrket etter Hagens utfall | author = Christensen, Per | date = 26 September 2004 | publisher = [[Norwegian News Agency]] | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Independent Authority for Spanish Fiscal Responsibility''' (''Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal española'', AIReF) is an independent agency for [[Public finance|fiscal]] control in Spain. It was created in 2013 by the [[Spanish government|Spanish Government]], on the initiative of the [[European Union]] and to implement a constitutional mandate. Its aim is to guarantee the principle of budgetary stability, as well as the country's financial sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2013/11/13/economia/1384366936_319086.html ''El Congreso da luz verde definitiva a la Autoridad Fiscal Independiente'' ("Congress gives definitive green light to the Independent Fiscal Authority")], CincoDias, 13 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AIReF.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|AIReF logo]]

== History ==
Independent fiscal control bodies began to be formed in other countries in the mid-20th century. The first was established in the Netherlands in 1947, followed by Denmark, Germany, US, Belgium, Austria, Korea, Sweden and Canada.&lt;ref name=presion&gt;[http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2013/03/08/economia/1362746128_105523.html ''La presión de la UE acelera la oficina fiscal independiente'' ("Pressure from the EU hastens the independent fiscal office")], CincoDias, 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of such an authority in Spain formed part of the Spanish Strategy for Economic Policy, approved by the Spanish [[Council of Ministers (Spain)|Council of Ministers]] in September 2012, with the intention of ensuring compliance with legal requirements on budgetary stability.&lt;ref name=presion /&gt; On 14 November 2013, the Government of Spain published [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Law]] 6/2013, creating the Independent Authority of Spanish Fiscal Responsibility (AIReF). AIReF was set up with the appointment of [[José Luis Escrivá]] as its president in February 2014, having been accepted by the Congressional Commission of Inland Revenue and Public Administration. In March 2014 the Organic Law was approved and in the second quarter the rest of the Managerial Committee was created, comprising the president and the directors of the three divisions that make up the AIReF, with the assistance of the Director of the Spanish President's Cabinet. The Managerial Committee first met in June 2014, a date that may be considered as the start of the institution's activities. All the records of the Committee are published.&lt;ref name=escriva&gt;[http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2014/01/24/economia/1390567123_049789.html ''Escrivá, nuevo presidente de la autoridad fiscal independiente'' ("Escrivá, the new president of the independent fiscal authority")], CincoDias, 24 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Action Plan for 2014 was approved in July that year, and early in 2015 the Strategic Plan 2015–2020 was also approved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airef.es/documents/10181/283527/2016+03+07+AIReF+Strategic+Plan+English+version+29042015.pdf/9199fdb3-3e02-4928-8e80-f60bcc3bab07 Strategic Plan 2015–2020], accessed 9 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 April 2016 AIReF issued a communiqué expressing concern over the absence of data needed to prepare its annual report on macroeconomic forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airef.es/es/contenidos/noticias/576-la-falta-de-informacion-suficiente-impide-a-la-airef-elaborar-sus-informes-sobre-las-previsiones-macroeconomicas-y-el-programa-de-estabilidad-2016-2019 Communiqué by AIReF], AIReF official website, 18 April 2016, accessed 19 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
Some of AIReF's main aims are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2013/11/11/economia/1384175678_223956.html ''La autoridad fiscal independiente'' ("The independent fiscal authority")], CincoDías, 11 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transparency: to facilitate the publication and dissemination of data, and note possible bias in fiscal and macroeconomic projections issued by the Spanish authorities.
* Discipline: to provide an independent source of discipline, not exposed to the pressure of interest groups; commitment to medium-term financial objectives, ignoring any pressures on political parties stemming from the electoral cycle.
* Coordination: to advocate the internalization of any issues arising from fiscal indiscipline.

== Structure ==
The structure and activities of AIReF are regulated under the Organic Statute of the Independent Authority of Fiscal Responsibility, collected in the Royal Decree 215/2014, of 28 March 2014. This regulates among other things data analysis, publication, the functions of the president, and the control of the institution's own expenditure. AIReF comprises the president's office and three divisions&amp;mdash;Budgetary Analysis, Economic Analysis and Legal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airef.es/the-team The Team], AIReF website, accessed 9 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advisory board==
Under the founding statute, the president may be advised by professionals in relevant fields, for which purpose an Advisory Board has been formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airef.es/advisory-board ''Consejo Asesor de AIReF'' (membership of the Advisory Board)], AIReF website, accessed 9 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The president may attend the Managerial Committees.

== IFI network ==
AIReF is part of a [[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network|network of Independent Fiscal Institutions]] (IFI's) in other European countries. This network has set up a Committee for European Affairs, with the aim of constructing a Europe-wide platform to help the IFI's carry out their functions effectively, in particular those arising from the fiscal framework of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euifis.eu/ IFI network], official website, accessed 19 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Isayevich Bolotnikov''' ({{lang-ru|Ива́н Иса́евич Боло́тников}}) (1565-1608) was the leader of a popular uprising in [[Russia]] in 1606–1607 known as the Bolotnikov Rebellion (Восстание Ивана Болотникова). The uprising was part of the [[Time of Troubles]] in Russia.

==Early life==
Little information is available about Ivan Bolotnikov’s life before the uprising. It is known that he was a [[kholop]] and belonged to the household of Prince [[Andrei Telyatevsky]]. It appears that Bolotnikov fled from his master’s estate, then was captured by the [[Crimean Tatars]], and sold to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] as a [[galley slave]]. He somehow managed to escape from his owners, reached [[Venice]], and then was captured in [[Poland]] en route to Russia by the associates of [[Mikhail Molchanov]] (one of the assassins of [[Feodor Godunov]], who had successfully fled from [[Moscow]] and was again contemplating the second coming of [[False Dmitry II|False Dmitry]]). 

==Rebellion==
Molchanov sent Ivan Bolotnikov to the town of [[Putyvl]] to meet a [[Voivode|voyevoda]] named [[Grigory Shakhovskoy]]. The latter received him as the new [[tsar]]’s envoy and put him in charge of a [[Cossack]] unit. Ivan Bolotnikov used this opportunity to muster a small army of runaway kholops, peasants, outlaws, and vagabonds, disgruntled with social and economic situation in Russia. He promised them to exterminate the ruling class and establish a new social system. By the order of Grigory Shakhovskoy, Bolotnikov and his army advanced to [[Kromy]] (today’s [[Oryol Oblast]]) in August 1606, defeating the [[Muscovy|Muscovite]] army under the command of Prince [[Yury Trubetskoy]]. From there, he moved towards [[Serpukhov]] and ravaged the city&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/230750976|title=Velikai︠a︡ russkai︠a︡ smuta : prichiny vozniknovenii︠a︡ i vykhod iz gosudarstvennogo krizisa v XVI-XVII vv.|date=2007|publisher=Dar|others=Strizhova, I. M., Стрижова, И. М.|isbn=9785485001230|location=Moskva|oclc=230750976}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Rebels united===
At the time there were several other rebellions taking place across Russia, the participants of which would join Ivan Bolotnikov’s army. Most of the insurgents (Cossacks, [[gentry]], [[service class people]], and even [[boyar]] children) organized themselves into three main groups under the command of [[Grigory Sumbulov]], [[Prokopy Lyapunov]], and [[Istoma Pashkov]]. All these rebels united and besieged Moscow, settling in a village of Zagorye on October 12, 1606. The consensus among these rebellious groups, however, did not last long. Soon, the noblemen realized that most of Ivan Bolotnikov’s plans had really been aimed against them, so they figured it would be much safer to return their support to [[Vasili Shuisky]].

===Breakup===
On November 15, Sumbulov and Lyapunov left Zagorye and gave themselves up to the authorities, asking the tsar for forgiveness. Now that Bolotnikov’s army had lost some of its men, Vasili Shuisky decided to make his move. On December 2, Prince [[Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky]] (tsar’s cousin) attacked the enemy near [[Kolomenskoye]]. During the battle, Istoma Pashkov and his men decided to switch camps and joined the Muscovite army. Left all by himself, Ivan Bolotnikov suffered a defeat and fled to [[Kaluga]]. Vasili Shuisky’s commanders [[Fyodor Mstislavsky]] and [[Ivan Shuisky]] laid siege to the city, but Bolotnikov and his Cossacks managed to repel their attacks until the end of winter.

===Help from Prince Andrei Telyatevsky===
In the spring of 1607, another imposter by the name of [[False Peter]] (also known as [[Ileyka Muromets]]; he claimed to be the son of [[Feodor I of Russia]]) came to [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] with a whole mob of robbers to meet with Prince Grigory Shakhovskoy. Immediately after this, the latter dispatched Prince Andrei Telyatevsky and his men to help out Ivan Bolotnikov, forcing Prince Mstislavsky to lift the siege of Kaluga. Bolotnikov moved to Tula. Thus, all the rebels met together in one place, their joint forces numbering some 30,000 people. It was then that Vasili Shuisky decided to attack all of them at once and left Moscow on May 21, 1607. He besieged Tula, but the insurgents managed to hold out until October despite deprivations and hunger. Bolotnikov sent letters to [[False Dmitry II]] in [[Starodub]] asking for help, but to no avail&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/620935678|title=Ruski carevi|last=Željko.|first=Fajfrić,|date=2008|publisher=Tabernakl|isbn=9788685269172|edition=1. izd|location=Sremska Mitrovica|oclc=620935678}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Surrender and death===
Finally, Bolotnikov decided to negotiate his surrender. The tsar promised to pardon the insurgents in return for Tula. On October 10, the rebels surrendered to the authorities. Shuisky, however, did not keep his promise. Instead, he transported all of the rebel leaders to Moscow on October 30, and then executed each of them in a different way. Ivan Bolotnikov was transported to [[Kargopol]], blinded and then drowned&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The '''Jamaica Labour Party''' ('''JLP''') is one of the two major [[List of political parties in Jamaica|political parties in Jamaica]], the other being the [[People's National Party]] (PNP).

The JLP gained another seat in the November 2017 St Mary South East By-Election, increasing its majority to 33 to the PNP's 30.

In the November 2016 Local Government Elections, the party won eight of the fourteen municipal corporations (Kingston &amp; St. Andrew, Clarendon, St. Elizabeth, St. James, Trelawny, St. Ann, St. Mary and Portland).  With a 5-5 tie in the St. Thomas Municipal Corporation and with the JLP winning the popular vote in St. Thomas, the JLP gets control and therefore the mayorship and the PNP gets the deputy mayorship.

The JLP uses the [[Liberty Bell]], the [[victory sign]], and the colour [[green]] as electoral symbols.  The JLP is a member of the [[Caribbean Democrat Union]].

== History ==

The party was founded on 8 July 1943 by [[Alexander Bustamante]] as the political wing of the [[Bustamante Industrial Trade Union]]. Bustamante had previously been a member of the PNP.

It won the [[Jamaican general election, 1944|1944 general elections]] with 22 of the 32 seats.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', pp432-435 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to win the [[Jamaican general election, 1949|1949 elections]] with a reduced majority, before losing power to the PNP in the [[Jamaican general election, 1955|1955 elections]]. It remained in opposition following the [[Jamaican general election, 1959|1959 elections]], but was victorious in [[Jamaican general election, 1962|1962]] and was therefore the Government when Jamaica gained its political independence from Great Britain on 6 August 1962.

Bustamante suffered a stroke in 1964 and largely withdrew from politics.  However, he did not relinquish the title of party leader for another decade.  [[Donald Sangster]] took over as acting prime minister after Bustamante's stroke.  He was named First Deputy Leader in 1967, and led the party to victory as of the 21 February 1967 elections. Sangster suffered a brain hemorrhage and died about six weeks after the elections, while he was preparing for his budget presentation.

[[Hugh Shearer]] succeeded Sangster as First Deputy Leader and Prime Minister, defeating David Clement (DC) Tavares by two votes in a run-off by of the JLP parliamentarians. Tavares had come out on top in the first ballot, with Shearer and Robert Lightbourne being the other candidates. Under Shearer, the JLP lost power for the first time to the [[People's National Party]] and [[Michael Manley]] in [[Jamaican general election, 1972|1972]].  Shearer served as Opposition Leader until 1974.

Bustamante finally gave up the post of party leader in 1974, and [[Edward Seaga]] was elected his successor. The party lost the [[Jamaican general election, 1976|1976 elections]], but Seaga became Prime Minister after victory in [[Jamaican general election, 1980|1980]] when the party won by a landslide, capturing 51 of the then 60 parliamentary seats. In 1983 with the JLP achieving a spike in popularity, in part because of Seaga's support of the US-led military [[invasion of Grenada]], Seaga called [[Jamaican general election, 1983|early elections]] and won all sixty seats, the majority by acclamation, mainly because the opposition PNP boycotted those elections. The JLP suffered defeat in the [[Jamaican general election, 1989|1989 elections]] and went on to lose elections in [[Jamaican general election, 1993|1993]], [[Jamaican general election, 1997|1997]] and [[Jamaican general election, 2002|2002]], all under the continued leadership of Seaga.

In 2005 [[Bruce Golding]] succeeded Seaga as leader of the party, and led it to victory in the [[Jamaican general election, 2007|2007 elections]]. Golding resigned as head of the party and Prime Minister in October 2011 and was succeeded by current leader [[Andrew Holness]].  Soon after becoming leader, Holness called [[Jamaican general election, 2011|an election]] over a year before it was constitutionally due, and the party lost by a 2:1 margin to the PNP.  Holness was not blamed for the defeat, and continued to lead the party as Opposition Leader

The party held a leadership election on 10 November 2013 where Holness was challenged by his deputy, Shadow Minister for Finance [[Audley Shaw]]. Holness defeated Shaw by a margin of 2,704 votes to Shaw's 2,012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20131111/lead/lead1.html|title=Real 'Man A Yaad' - Holness clobbers Shaw to remain JLP leader|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holness went on to lead the JLP to a one-seat parliamentary majority (32-31) in the February 25, 2016 general elections, reducing the PNP to the opposition benches after one term.

== Political positions ==

The JLP is a conservative party. It believes in a market-driven economy and individual personal responsibility.

In May 2008, in an interview with [[Stephen Sackur]] of the [[BBC]], [[Bruce Golding]] PM and Party Leader declared that any [[Cabinet of Jamaica|cabinet]] formed by him would exclude any MP known to be gay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=8787 Premierminister: Homosexualität ist nicht jamaikanisch], queer.de, 23. Mai 2008 (german)&lt;/ref&gt; In previous statements, Golding stated that he and his party strongly opposed public displays of homosexuality in Jamaica and that he felt that they should continue to be illegal in keeping with Jamaican societal norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20070707T160000-0500_125077_OBS_GOLDING_SAYS__NO__TO_HOMOSEXUALITY.asp "Golding says 'no' to homosexuality"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614082925/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20070707T160000-0500_125077_OBS_GOLDING_SAYS__NO__TO_HOMOSEXUALITY.asp |date=14 June 2009 }}, ''Jamaica Observer'', 8 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He justified the [[LGBT rights in Jamaica|illegality of homosexual acts]] by referring to Christian values and the integrity of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/27/violent-prejudice-jamaica-gay-people Violent prejudice against Jamaica's gay people must stop] retrieved 19 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://glbtqjamaica.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/bruce-golding-on-is-jamaica-homophobic.html Is Jamaica homophobic] retrieved 19 May&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, family and education==
Rapping grew up in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. At a young age, Rapping went to demonstrations and protests with his mother, [[Elayne Rapping]], a community organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women's movements.&lt;ref name=Trend&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Karen|title=Transforming Public Defense|url=http://atlantatrend.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=870&amp;catid=40|publisher=Atlanta Trend|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about [[social justice]], and trying to change things in the world that aren't fair or right.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired the lawyers who worked to keep them out of jail.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;

Rapping attended [[Allderdice High School]] in [[Squirrel Hill (Pittsburgh)|Squirrel Hill]], and graduated in 1984.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branddolph|first1=Adam|title=Professor, lawyer with Pittsburgh ties earn MacArthur 'genius grants' |url=http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/6811526-74/foundation-hayes-macarthur#axzz3bVIhvdvN|website=triblive.com|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Rapping attended the [[University of Chicago]] where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[economics]] ''[[cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; People close to Rapping convinced him that he would incur tremendous debt if he went to law school, so he worked as a research assistant with the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. for two years,&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; following in the footsteps of his father, [[Leonard Rapping]], a well-known economist.  Rapping earned a scholarship to attend the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]] where he earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;  Rapping's sister, Alison Rapping has spent her career in the non-profit sector, and is widely considered a leader in that realm.  Both siblings attribute their commitment to social justice to the influence of their parents.

Right after graduating from Princeton and still unfulfilled, Rapping decided to attend [[George Washington University School of Law]] in Washington, D.C. After his first year of law school at GWU, Rapping interned with the [[Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia]], where he found his calling.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; He worked at PDS throughout law school.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;

While living in Washington, Rapping met and married his wife, Ilham Askia, who was teaching at an elementary school and then spent two years at a charter high school for court involved children.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Askia was born in [[Buffalo, New York]] and every man in her family has been a victim of the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Askia's father went to [[Attica Correctional Facility]] when she was five years old.  She helped raise her younger brother who ended up in prison.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Askia became a teacher to break the [[school-to-prison pipeline]], but soon questioned how much of a difference she could make on the front end.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;  This led to her joining Rapping to start Gideon's Promise and, ultimately, to become the organization's Executive Director, where she advocates for attacking the pipeline on the back end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0IGzOEHuaQ|title=Gideon's Promise receives 2015 MLK, Jr. Community Service Award|date=29 January 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

===Public defender===
After law school, Rapping worked as a staff attorney for The [[Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia]] (1995–2004), where he served his final three years as training director.&lt;ref name=Mac&gt;{{cite web|title=MacArthur Fellows / Meet the Class of 2014|url=http://www.macfound.org/fellows/925/|website=macfound.org|publisher=MacArthur Foundation|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004-2006, Rapping was the training director for the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt;

From 2006-2007, he served as training chief for the New Orleans Office of the Public Defender.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; In recognition of his work in New Orleans to rebuild the public defender system post-[[Hurricane Katrina]], he was a co-recipient of the Lincoln Leadership Award, given by Kentucky's Department of Public Advocacy to honor leadership in national efforts to improve indigent defense.

===Gideon's Promise===
In 2007, Rapping created the Southern Public Defender Training Center, subsequently renamed [[Gideon's Promise]], along with his wife, Ilham Askia. Named after the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case Gideon v. Wainwright, Gideon's Promise teaches public defenders to work more effectively within the judicial system by providing coaching, training, and professional development as well as a supportive network of peers and mentors from around the country. Rapping received a grant to help start the center from [[George Soros]]' [[Open Society Foundations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over $1 Million Awarded to Visionary Leaders in Criminal Justice|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/press-releases/over-1-million-awarded-visionary-leaders-criminal-justice|publisher=Open Society Foundations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, the organization has grown from a single training program for sixteen attorneys in two offices in Georgia and Louisiana, to a multi-tiered enterprise with over 300 participants in more than 35 offices across 15 mostly Southern states. An initial three-year "Core" program for new public defenders has since expanded into a comprehensive model that includes programs for graduates of the initial Core program as they continue their development, public defender leaders, trainers and supervisors, and law students. Further, the organization is unique in that it intervenes at the trial stage, rather than after conviction, where challenges to criminal injustice often take place.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt;

In 2013, HBO Films produced a documentary called [[Gideon's Army]], based in part on the Gideon's Promise program and highlighting participants in the program.

Gideon's Promise has won numerous awards including [[Emory University]]'s 2014 Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Service Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.emory.edu/stories/2015/01/er_king_week_events/campus.html|title=Emory honors MLK legacy with service, awards, special events|work=emory.edu|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Southern Center for Human Rights]]' 2013 Gideon's Promise Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schr.org/action/resources/schr_to_honor_justice_harold_clarke_with_lifetime_achievement_award|title=SCHR to Honor Justice Harold Clarke with Lifetime Achievement Award|work=schr.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Association of Sentencing Advocates and Mitigation Specialists 2013 Sentencing Project Award, and the American College of Trail Lawyers' 2011 Emil Gumpert Award.

In 2014, Rapping became the Director of Strategic Planning and Organizational Development for the [[Maryland Office of the Public Defender]]. In 2014, Rapping earned a [[MacArthur Foundation]] "Genius Fellow."&lt;ref name=ATL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Michelle|title=Atlanta lawyer Jonathan Rapping wins MacArthur 'genius grant'|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/atlanta-lawyer-jonathan-rapping-wins-macarthur-gen/nhN5M/|website=ajc.com|publisher=AJC|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law professor===
Since 2007, Rapping has also been an associate professor at Atlanta's John Marshall Law School.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; In 2015 he was promoted to full Professor.  Rapping is also a visiting associate professor of law at Harvard Law School.&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Bio for Rapping|url=http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11243/Rapping|website=harvard.edu|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Rapping was selected as one of Harvard Law School's Wasserstein Public Interest Fellows in recognition of his contribution to the public interest legal arena.&lt;ref name=harvard/&gt; In 2013, Rapping was the Public Interest Scholar in Residence at Touro Law School.&lt;ref name=touro&gt;{{cite web|last1=Touro Law Center|title=Distinguished Public Interest Lawyer in Residence Program|url=http://law.touro.edu/AboutTouroLaw/?pageid=379#.VBoXOvldV8E|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings &amp; views==
Rapping has been a leading voice in discussing how culture shapes our [[criminal justice system]].  He has written and talked extensively about the culture of criminal justice, has theorized how criminal justice reform can be accomplished through cultural transformation, and through his work with Gideon's Promise, has applied his ideas to build a movement of public defenders to drive criminal justice reform.  He is a thought leader in articulating the critical role public defenders must play in any comprehensive criminal justice reform strategy.  His work in this area earned him a 2014 MacArthur "Genius" grant.

Rapping first applied organizational culture theory to indigent defense reform in his 2007 article, Directing the Winds of Change.&lt;ref name=winds/&gt; In 2009, he laid out a vision for how to put this theory to practice in describing the work of the Southern Public Defender Training Center (the precursor to Gideon's Promise) in You Can't Build on Shaky Ground.&lt;ref name=shaky/&gt;  He made the case that supporting public defenders in their quest to drive cultural transformation should be a priority of the [[United States federal government]] in National Crisis, National Neglect.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt;  And in 2012—applying his work to prosecutors in Who's Guarding the Henhouse—he examined how prosecutors too have been shaped by the existing criminal justice culture and, as a result, help perpetuate injustice.&lt;ref name=henhouse/&gt;

Believing that well-intentioned professionals are shaped by a criminal justice system that has become unmoored from is foundational values, Rapping's vision involves supporting defenders as they struggle to resist the pressure to adapt to the status quo.  This vision is best articulated in his article "Redefining Success as a Public Defender"&lt;ref name=redefine/&gt; and in a speech he delivered at Touro Law School.&lt;ref name=Tourotalk&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IgR_jBnt_E|title=Jonathan Rapping - Touro Law - 2013 Public Interest Lawyer in Residence - Public Speech|date=16 October 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has examined how the American story of justice has evolved to a narrative that would be unrecognizable to our founding fathers in "Reviving the Hero Image of the Public Defender."&lt;ref name=reviving/&gt;  He has analyzed how defenders can combat the pernicious role of race in driving this culture in "Implicitly Unjust."&lt;ref name=implicit/&gt;  And in "Retuning Gideon's Trumpet," he answers skeptics who believe public defenders are only important to individuals and play no role in driving systemic reform.&lt;ref name=retuning/&gt;

Rapping frequently addresses criminal justice issues of the day by promoting a narrative in which a movement of public defenders, serving as the voice for the vast majority of people in the criminal justice system, serve as the catalyst for reform.  As the nation grappled with a seeming epidemic of police killings of young black men like Michael Brown, [[Eric Garner]], and Tamir Rice, Rapping urged that we not see that issue as disconnected from "routine injustice" destroying poor communities of color every day.  In "It's Not Just the Cops"&lt;ref name=cops/&gt; and "From Ferguson to Staten Island: In Case Anyone Doubted the Public Needs Defending,"&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; he argues that public defenders are a necessary component to a comprehensive strategy to realize equal justice that is illusive throughout the criminal justice system.  In "The Other Baltimore Story," he makes a similar argument as the nation focused its attention on the killing of [[Death of Freddie Gray|Freddy Gray]] by reminding us of the routine injustice in [[Baltimore]] through the story of Ronald Hammond, and the response of public defenders.&lt;ref name=bmore/&gt;

In articles like "Continuing the March of Civil Rights Warriors in Selma,"&lt;ref name=selma/&gt; "One of the Most Important Civil and Human Rights Battles of Our Time,"&lt;ref name=battle/&gt; and "Redefining Success as a Public Defender,"&lt;ref name=redefine/&gt; Rapping makes the case that criminal justice is the civil rights struggle of this generation and that public defenders are on the front lines of that battle.

He routinely tips his hat to the men and women who represent poor people accused of crimes, particularly in essays like "Reviving the Hero Image of the Public Defender By Changing the Story of Our Clients,"&lt;ref name=hero/&gt; "To All the Patriots Out There, and Especially Our Public Defenders,"&lt;ref name=patriots/&gt; and "Gideon's Orchestra: It's Time For the Encore."&lt;ref name=orchestra/&gt;  And in pieces like "The Special Few"&lt;ref name=special/&gt; and "Who Will Heal the Public Defenders,"&lt;ref name=heal/&gt; he explains the emotional toll that makes this work so difficult.

Rapping's 2015 TEDx Atlanta talk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-j20aGs6uU|title=Building a new generation of public defenders - Jonathan Rapping - TEDxAtlanta|date=8 May 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a powerful articulation of the critical role of culture in shaping our criminal justice system and the importance of a public defender movement to transforming it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6126">'''Land titling''' is a form of [[land reform]] in which private individuals and families are given formal [[property rights]] for land which they have previously occupied informally or used on the basis of [[customary land tenure]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernadette Atuahene. "[http://works.bepress.com/bernadette_atuahene/1/ Land Titling: A Mode of Privatization with the Potential to Deepen Democracy]", 50 Saint Louis University Law Journal 761 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that providing formal titles increases security of [[land tenure]], supports development of markets in land, and allows better access to credit (using land titles as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]). Peruvian economist [[Hernando de Soto Polar]] is the most well-known advocate of the approach, but it has a long history.&lt;ref name=Larmour/&gt; Recently, "inspired by these ideas, and fostered by international development agencies, land titling programs have been launched throughout developing and transition economies as part of poverty alleviation efforts."&lt;ref name=Galiani&gt;Sebastian Galiani and Ernesto Schargrodsky (2010), "Property rights for the poor: Effects of land titling", ''Journal of Public Economics'', Volume 94, Issues 9-10, October 2010, Pages 700-729&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of poverty alleviation and urban management, however, can lead to conflicts in the design of land titling programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monkkonen|first=Paavo|title=The Demand for Land Regularization: Theory and Evidence from Tijuana, Mexico|journal=Urban Studies|year=2012|volume=49|issue=2|pages=270–287|doi=10.1177/0042098011405691}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research in China by [[Landesa]] and others has found that more than 40% of farmers lack written documentation to confirm their land rights, and that local governments can frequently take away or sell off their land rights. Where policy reforms have been implemented, the organizations report, farmers invest in and benefit from their land, and they estimate that secure land rights represent the equivalent of $1.2 trillion in farmers' hands.&lt;ref&gt;National Bureau of Asian Research Special Report #18 "[http://www.landesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2009_RDI_NBR_China_Survey.pdf "Secure Land Rights as a Foundation for Broad-Based Rural Development in China: Results and Recommendations from a Seventeen-Province Survey]", Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[UN Habitat]] launched a "Global Campaign for Secure Tenure".&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

Evidence on the effectiveness of land titling for [[poverty reduction]] and [[economic development]] is mixed, with the key issue being the impact of titling on the security of [[land tenure]], which varies.&lt;ref name=Payne&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Payne | first1 = G. | last2 = Durand-Lasserve | first2 = A. | last3 = Rakodi | first3 = C. | year = 2009 | title = The limits of land titling and home ownership | url = | journal = Environment and Urbanization | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 443–462 | doi=10.1177/0956247809344364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly where [[customary land]] is involved, the introduction of formal [[land registration]] may have unpredictable effects, with the efficiency and marketisation of existing forms of land tenure underestimated, and the costs of formal registration underestimated and the security of formal land title overestimated.&lt;ref name=Larmour&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larmour | first1 = P | year = 2002 | title = Policy transfer and reversal: Customary land registration from Africa to Melanesia | url = | journal = Public Administration and Development | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 151–161 | doi=10.1002/pad.210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, recipients of formal title have later found that their titles did not give them the expected security in the face of market or state requirements to obtain their land.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; Some studies have found positive outcomes, albeit less strong than expected; one recent study on land titling in [[Argentina]] found that "entitling the poor increases their investment both in the houses and in the [[human capital]] of their children."&lt;ref name=Galiani/&gt; 

The way in which land titling is carried out may raise gender issues. While titling was expected to promote long term investments and ensure the transfer of land from less efficient to more efficient users, studies assessing the impact of tenure reform in Africa often found few significant effects of privatisation on production and, in some cases, even negative effects (Bruce and Migot Adholla 1994). The impacts of privatisation of pastoral rangelands on production have been particularly contentious (Rutten 1992, Peters 1994, Pinckney and Kimuyu 1994, Archambault 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diana Deere | first1 = Carmen | last2 = León | first2 = Magdalena | year = 2001 | title = Who Owns the Land? Gender and Land-Titling Programmes in Latin America | url = | journal = Journal of Agrarian Change | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 440–467 | doi=10.1111/1471-0366.00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint titling successes happen, though most have not been complete successes, even when significant reforms have taken place. Despite Tanzanian legislation providing women the right to land and implementing default joint-titling, there has been little work on
the ground to ensure this is implemented. In India, even with political support for joint-titling policy, institutional backing from local land authority's is needed to make progress. As each reform is important for establishing joint-titling regimes, they are worth considering independently, even if they ultimately failed &lt;ref&gt;Matthew Collin, 2013, Joint-titling of land and housing - Examples, causes and consequences, ECONOMIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PROFESSIONAL EVIDENCE AND APPLIED KNOWLEDGE SERVICES, https://partnerplatform.org/file2.axd/1ad5a995-3b36-42a1-ac2e-e0962a24927c/EPS%20PEAKS%20helpdesk%20response%20-%20Joint%20titling.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leftist errors''' ({{lang-sh|leva/lijeva skretanja}}) was a term used by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY) to describe radical policies and strategies – described as the '''Red Terror''' by others – pursued by self-described  [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] elements among the party and [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan units]] during [[World War II]], mostly in [[Montenegro]], [[Herzegovina]] and [[Serbia]], as well as to a lesser extent in [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]].{{sfn|Banac|1990|p=89}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|2008|p=287}} {{lang|hr|"Bila je to akcija nazvana kasnije „lijeva skretanja" ponajviše provođena u Bosni i Crnoj Gori, a mnogo manje u Hrvatskoj."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NIN: nedeljne informativne novine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ft8xAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Politika|page=4&lt;!-- |quote=...тзв. лева скретања, односно убиства „кулака" у Херцеговини, Црној Гори, Босни и Срему, злочини извршени у тзв.

==Background==
[[File:Josip Broz Tito uniform portrait.jpg|thumbnail|140px|[[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] formulated the leftist strategy of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|CPY]] in October 1940]]
[[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] was the main protagonist of the leftist deviations.{{Sfn|Petranović|1992|p=307&lt;!-- |ps=: Glavni skretač u „levo" bio je Josip Broz Tito, o čemu govore i njegove inicijative 1941-1942. i 1943. godine" --&gt;}} Tito was well known as leftist who was against any arrangements with non-[[Communism|communists]]. His formal appointment as general secretary of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY) was confirmed in October 1940 during the Fifth Land Conference of the CPY in [[Zagreb]]. At this conference Tito formulated the leftist strategy of the CPY as focused on revolutionary seizure of power in the country in order to organize [[Soviet]]-style administrative organization in [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Krieger|title=The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wd30pXJxpYC&amp;pg=PA838|date=2 August 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-511739-4|page=838|quote=...in 1939 and received internal confirmation at the Fifth Land Conference of the KP, held in Zagreb, in October 1940. Tito was already noted as a leftist who put little stock in Popular Front arrangements with non-Communists. Moreover, he was federalist, seeing the solution of the nationality question in Yugoslavia in Soviet style federation. This led him to complain against Soviet pleas for cooperation with anti-Communist and Greater Serbian [[Chetnik]]s during the war and prompted him to emphasize the revolutionary seizure of power.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inc1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FFtYAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=978-0-85229-633-2|page=804|quote=At Fifth Land Conference of CPY, as underground minicongres held in Zagreb in October 1940, Tito sketched CPY's leftist strategy, which focused the party on armed insurrection and on Soviet style federalist solution to Yugoslavia. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=77&lt;!-- |ps=: "The political line of the Fifth Conference was strictly leftist..." --&gt; }}

In July 1941, after the beginning of the Second World War, the Communist Politburo adopted the strategy which insisted that the Partisans should aim to create "liberated territories", cleared of enemies. According to the instructions of the Poliburo, such territories were to be administered by the communists in a state-like manner so the local population would be exposed to the ideas and practice of the [[socialism]].

In mid-August 1941, Đilas wrote a letter to the Regional Committee of Yugoslav Communist Party for Montenegro, Boka and Sandžak and recommended an isolation and destruction of the [[fifth column]]. He emphasized that tolerance and inactivity of communists toward spies is a crime equal to treason. At the end of August 1941 the Regional Committee issued a directive which follows the recommendations of Đilas and insists on cleansing of the villages from the fifth column. In another directive issued in October the Regional Committee repeated similar instructions insisting on the destruction of those who disturb the mobilization of insurgents even by saying ''"wait, it's not the right moment yet"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/istorija/cg_u_2_svj_ratu/lijeve_greske_drugo_ime_za_zlocin.htm Dragutin Papović: “LIJEVE GREŠKE” – DRUGO IME ZA ZLOČIN], montenegrina.net; accessed 8 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Đilas himself wrote how retreating Partisans, who only punished their opponents in July, arbitrarily executed them following the Italian counteroffensive of August 1941.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|pg=214|ps=: "Milovan Djilas, the highest ranking Montenegrin in the Communist leadership, and Arso Jovanovic,...., were dispatched from Serbia to fan the scattered flames into a single bonfire.

From September 1941 onward, Communist Party program documents began to mention courts authorized to prescribe the death penalties. This immediately came to life in practice.

The Partisans occupied [[Kolašin]] in January and February 1942, and turned against all real and potential opposition, killing about 300 people and throwing their mangled corpses into pits they called the "dogs' cemetery". Due to this and other examples of communist terror, a part of Montenegrin population turned against the Partisans.

==Serbia==
In September 1941, Serb Partisans established the [[Republic of Užice]], a short-lived military mini-state with its administrative center in Užice. At the end of November 1941 Partisans were defeated and had to retreat from Serbia. The policy of leftist errors pursued by [[Josip Broz Tito]] substantially contributed to Partisan defeat in the Republic of Užice.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=81&lt;!-- |ps=: "This defeat stemmed in good part from the leftist policy pursued by Tito in the liberated territory centered on Uzice, ..." --&gt;}} Because of the repression of the communists and their intention to carry on with communist revolution the population of Serbia also turned against the uprising and communist insurgents.

In January and February 1942 alone, [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] executed 250 people in [[East Herzegovina|Eastern Herzegovina]] because they were accused of belonging to "fifth column".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|2008|p=287}} {{lang|hr|"Samo u siječnju i veljači 1942. strijeljano je u istočnoj Hercegovini oko 250 ljudi, optuženih da pripadaju „petoj koloni”"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Herzegovina alone the total number of civilians murdered by communists in 1941–42 was probably around 500.{{sfn|Banac|1988|pp=82-83}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14029">'''Liberties and Responsibilities of Universities''' is the official name of a French law aiming at revamping entirely the [[Education in France|French public higher education system]]. The bill was presented by the [[French Ministry of Education and Research|French Ministry of Higher Education]] [[Valérie Pécresse]] and was officially voted on 11 August 2007 by the [[Parliament of France|Parliament]]. The law is commonly referred to as the '''law LRU''' (after the acronym of the official name), or '''Law Pécresse'''. It is sometimes called the '''law on the autonomy of universities''', because the law give universities more financial autonomy, so that the government will stop funding them.

The text of the bill consists of six titles. The first title recall public service and higher education's mission. The second title is about the management of universities. The third deals with the new responsibilities for universities. The three other titles give additional details about the reform.

The bill was rapidly voted by the Parliament in July 2007, and definitively adopted on 1 August 2007, less than three months after Nicolas Sarkozy's election. The university student, in holidays during the vote of the law, began to express their discontentment in October 2007.

== First draft ==
University Reforms had been promised by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] before the [[French presidential election of 2007|2007 Presidential Elections]].  Prime Minister [[François Fillon]] announced the reform would be the most important of his term in office. Therefore, the reform was debated long before the bill was officially presented by the government.

Soon after the presidential elections in May 2007, the Higher Education minister [[Valérie Pécresse]] announced to university representatives (students, teachers, researchers, presidents of universities) that her ministry would work on the reform. She said the bill on university autonomy would be voted in July by Parliament, during an extraordinary session, while the other reforms would follow in the next months. The ministry released a first draft on 22 June. Some representatives were dissatisfied, saying that independency was not the main concern.  The priority was to address student failure.

University autonomy concerns university management, i.e. the powers of the presidents and the administration councils, also recruitment and paying teachers. The majority of the representatives of students, teachers and researchers said they were strongly opposed to reform:
* The Minister of Higher Education Valerie Pécresse highlighted that university fees would be increased, but specified the Ministry would keep this increase under control, despite the university independency. Trade unions said they also wanted to influence the amount of the fees, as part of the new autonomy.
* The bill was to give the 85 French universities entire financial autonomy, i.e. control over their budget, recruitment and estate management, but only if they wanted it, as Nicolas Sarkozy had announced during the presidential campaign. The government would help them be more independent. Some said this autonomy would increase the inequalities between universities, and that some of them would get more financial funds than others. The system would become increasingly elitist, with greater competition between universities to attract the best students and teachers.
* The government announced that the law would not be applied before 2012.
* It was announced the bill would reduce the number of members in the administration council from more than 60 to 20. Representatives of students would decrease from 15 to 3. There were concerns the students would be underrepresented. Others said student representatives were pointless.
* There were also concerns about the increasing selectivity the bill would impose. A diploma would be delivered for student at the end of the first year, to make universities more competitive at a European level. Some said it would reduce the number of students.
* Other central points of the reform was to be the increasing links between the universities and the labour market. People of the professional world would be included in the administration councils of the universities. Researchers and teachers said it would be detrimental to scientific and literal research. They feared some studies (literature and human sciences in particular would be underfunded).

== Official discussions ==
To satisfy the students, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said the presentation of the bill would be delayed (the bill was to be examine during the Ministers Council on 26 June). At the end of June, he met and discussed the bill with president of universities, then with representatives of researchers, then of teachers, and finally students organizations (mainly UNEF and UNI), along with [[François Fillon]] and [[Valérie Pécresse]]. The [[Union Nationale des Étudiants de France|UNEF]], the [[Fage]] and the [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]], the main associations of students, withdrawn from the discussions. The most controversial measures were the selectiveness in universities and the underrepresentation of students in administration councils. 

All the organizations were satisfied by the postponement of the bill. The students organizations (mainly UNEF) said the government had retained the lessons from the CPE discontentment. The presidents of universities conference (CPU) said they would have time to pass amendments, notably to make the reform compulsory for all universities, while it was to be initially optional.

Nicolas Sarkozy, François Fillon and Valérie Pécresse declared they were ready to grant some points to the representatives. They said they were ready to modify the text on administration councils to include more people in it, but refused to include more students. They were ready to discuss the selectiveness.

== Second draft ==
A new bill was released by the [[French Ministry of Education and Research|Ministry of Higher Education]] on 26 June. The number of students in the administration councils could be extended to 5, and the total number of members to 30. The reform would apply to all universities (as opposed to the initial draft) by 2012. A vice-president would be appointed by the students to represent them. The measure on selectiveness (diploma at the end of the first year) was abandoned. 

Organizations expressed their satisfaction, but criticized the increasing power of presidents of universities and the new management in universities. The bill include measures reinforcing the powers of the administration councils. They would define the missions of each teachers-researchers. Bonuses are decided by the board and the president. Recruitment is managed by the president and a board composed of professionals of companies and teachers-researchers.

== Parliamentarian discussions ==
On 11 July 2007, just before the examination of the bill by the Senate, more than 800 teacher-researchers signed a petition, to demand various modifications of the bill. The petition expressed concerns about the university directory board choosing itself the teachers instead of electing them, and about the excessive power of university presidents over recruitment.

The bill was submitted to the [[French Senate|Senate]] on 12 July 2007. Senators modified the text so that the external members of the directive board be elected by the other members, instead of being nominated by the president. Thus, these external members would be able to take part in the election of the president with the other members. Valerie Pécresse accepted the modification. The bill was voted on 13 July. The Socialist Party voted against the bill.

On 24 July, the bill was examined by the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. The Socialist Party said that while if they agreed to reform the higher education system, the management of universities was not a priority, and that the bill was unadapted to the needs. The socialist deputies criticized the law and voted against it. They said they expected a real reform of the higher education system. Valérie Pécresse argued this law was the indispensable basis for further reform.

The deputies removed the senatorial amendment which modified the election of the president. The major change came from an amendment proposed by the UMP deputy [[Claude Goasguen]]. The amendment proposed that the president of university be reserved for a teacher-researcher. The amendment was unanimously voted, while Valerie Pécresse had opposed it. However, the minister succeeded in modifying the bill, so that any executive of the university can be elected president.

As the government chose to use the urgency procedure to pass the bill, only one vote was permitted for each house of the parliament. A joint commission of 7 senators and 7 deputies then worked again on the text. The final bill was definitively approved by the houses on 1 August 2007.

== Protests ==
At the beginning of October 2007, period when university classes begin, students began to express their opposition to the bill. Students of the three [[Toulouse]] universities call for a general mobilization to demand the removal of the Pécresse law. They said they were ready to go on strike. Students from [[Lille]] also announced they were ready to take measures. Various universities began to be blocked by students at the beginning of November, including Le Mirail (Toulouse II), Tours, Paris I (Tolbiac), Rouen, Perpignan, Lille II, Rennes III. Aix-Marseille 1 only decided a strike. The students denounced the privatization of universities. Valerie Pécresse declared these movements were unjustified, arguing the state would remain implicated in the funding of universities. 

Students organizations declared the new management of universities would make non-profitable studies disappear. They condemned the inequalities between universities the law would cause, without the support of the government. They also opposed the increasing power of the presidents and the underrepresentation of students in directive boards. They said governmental action should focus on financial aids to students.

The blockages extended on 7 and 8 November to Paris IV Clignancourt, Aix-Marseilles, Nantes, Lille I, while Lyon-II, Lyon-III and Lille III only decided a strike. Other action was planned in other universities, but did not lead to blockages. On 9 November, demonstrations took place in [[Paris]], [[Rennes]], [[Toulouse]] and [[Perpignan]], with clashes with police. Around 15 universities (out of 85) were blocked for a week, and more than 50 organized demonstrations. The next week, the movement amplified and 36 universities were blocked on 14 November, 42 on 15 November. Students organizations (UNEF, UNI, Cé, Fade)  met with Valerie Pécresse, without outcome. Organizations (among them the UNEF) said they would continue the movement unless the government gave guarantee on state fundings. On 22 November, demonstrations were held in Paris, Rennes, Bordeaux, Lyon, along with lycées students. The next week, from 26 November, various lycées began to be blocked. 

On 26 November, François Fillon promised to increase the budget dedicated to universities in the next years to satisfy the students. The prime minister said the governmental funding for universities would increase by 50% in the next five-year period, which means an additional one billion euros for each year until 2012, the total budget for the five years passing from 10 to 15 billions euros.  On 27 November, while various demonstrations took place in France, with 30.000 participants, discussions were held between students organizations and Valérie Pécresse. The minister of higher education promised various modifications of the law, including a reduction of selectiveness. UNEF representants said they were satisfied by these guarantees. Soon after, the organization chose to stop the blockages. However, the mobilization amplified in lycées. In Paris, more than 30 lycées out of 73 were blocked, and more than 200 in total.

At the end of November, some 100 lycées (out of 1,500 in France) and some 40 universities were still blocked, but at the beginning of December, the classes resumed in most universities and lycées. On 13 December, Valérie Pécresse unveiled a plan to address university students' failure, the second point of the vast reform of university.

[[File:Kunglig Hovleverantör.jpeg|thumb|Purveyors to the Court of Sweden are entitled to display the [[Coat of Arms of Sweden|royal coat of arms]] with the motto ''Kunglig hovleverantör'' underneath.]]
'''Royal warrants of appointment''' in [[Sweden]] are granted to the purveyor ({{lang-sv|Kunglig hovleverantör}}) by the [[King of Sweden|king]] or the [[Queen of Sweden|queen]]. To qualify for a warrant, the order must come from the royal court and the company must deliver its goods or services to the court. A royal warrant is personal and usually awarded to the managing director of the company rather than the company itself. All goods and services are paid for by the court.&lt;ref&gt;

This is a '''list of fictional [[anarchism|anarchists]]''', including the source material in which they are found, their creator(s), the individual(s) who interpreted them as anarchists during development (if not originally created as such), and short descriptions of each.

An anarchist is a person who rejects any form of compulsory government (cf. "[[State (polity)|state]]") and supports its elimination. Anarchism is a [[political philosophy]] encompassing theories and attitudes which reject compulsory government&lt;ref&gt;Malatesta, Errico, ''Towards Anarchism''.&lt;/ref&gt; (the state) and support its elimination,&lt;ref name=definitions&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9117285 Anarchism]". ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2006. Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service. 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=definitions2&gt;"Anarchism". ''The Shorter [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''. 2005. P. 14 "Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable."&lt;/ref&gt; often due to a wider rejection of involuntary or permanent [[authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin, Mikhail, ''God and the State'', pt. 2.; Tucker, Benjamin, ''State Socialism and Anarchism''.; Kropotkin, Piotr, ''Anarchism: its Philosophy and Ideal''; Malatesta, Errico, ''Towards Anarchism''; Bookchin, Murray, ''Anarchism: Past and Present'', pt. 4; An [http://www.spunk.org/texts/intro/sp001550.html Introduction to Anarchism] by Liz A. Highleyman&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism is defined by ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' as "the view that society can and should be organized without a coercive state."&lt;ref name=slevin&gt;Slevin, Carl. "Anarchism". ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics''. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, fictional anarchists are subject to the personal interpretations and opinions of Anarchism held by the creator, and as such may imbue negative anarchist stereotypes. Further, characters may be interpreted as anarchists by second parties involved in their development. The inclusion of these characters may be controversial, but is necessary for purposes of objectivity. This provides a means by which social attitudes regarding anarchism and anarchists may be studied and compared to those of other eras and cultures.

Characters who are popularly considered "anarchic", but who are not specifically identified as anarchists by their source material, are excluded.

'''New Lanark''' is a village on the [[River Clyde]], approximately 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometres) from [[Lanark]], in [[Lanarkshire]], and some {{convert|25|mi}} southeast of [[Glasgow]], Scotland.  It was founded in 1786 by [[David Dale]], who built [[cotton mills]] and housing for the mill workers.  Dale built the mills there in a brief partnership with the English inventor and entrepreneur [[Richard Arkwright]] to take advantage of the water power provided by the only waterfalls on the [[River Clyde]]. Under the ownership of a partnership that included Dale's son-in-law, [[Robert Owen]], a Welsh [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] and [[social reform]]er, New Lanark became a successful business and an early example of a planned settlement and so an important milestone in the historical development of [[urban planning]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Colin and Rose (1972) City Fathers: The Early History of Town Planning in Britain. Penguin, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Lanark mills operated until 1968. After a period of decline, the New Lanark Conservation Trust (NLCT) was founded in 1974 (now known as the [http://www.newlanark.org/world-heritage-site/new-lanark-trust.shtml New Lanark Trust] (NLT)) to prevent demolition of the village.  By 2006 most of the buildings have been restored and the village has become a [[Tourism in Scotland|major tourist attraction]]. It is one of six [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s in [[World Heritage Sites in Scotland|Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21 World Heritage Sites you have probably never heard of|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/10999939/21-World-Heritage-Sites-you-have-probably-never-heard-of.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Anchor Point of ERIH - the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]].

== History ==
The New Lanark cotton mills were founded in 1786 by [[David Dale]] in a brief partnership with [[Richard Arkwright]]. Dale was one of the self-made "Burgher Gentry" of [[Glasgow]] who, like most of this gentry, had a summer retreat, an estate at Rosebank, [[Cambuslang]], not far from the [[Falls of Clyde (waterfalls)|Falls of Clyde]], which have been painted by [[J. M. W. Turner]] and many other artists. The mills used the recently developed water-powered cotton spinning machinery invented by [[Richard Arkwright]]. Dale sold the mills, lands and village in the early 19th century for £60,000, payable over 20 years, to a partnership that included his son-in-law [[Robert Owen]]. Owen, who became mill manager in 1800, was an industrialist who carried on his father-in-law's [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] approach to industrial working and who subsequently became an influential [[social reform]]er. New Lanark, with its social and welfare programmes, epitomised his [[Utopian socialism]] (''see also [[Owenism]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Donnachie, Ian (2000) Robert Owen: Owen of New Lanark and New Harmony, Tuckwell Press, East Linton&lt;/ref&gt; The town and mills are important historically through their connection with Owen's ideas, but also because of their role in the developing [[industrial revolution]] in the UK and their place in the history of [[urban planning]].&lt;ref name = unesco&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Committee Nomination Documentation (2001) 'New Lanark'. File 429rev.pdf, 16 December 2001. Available at http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/429/documents/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell and Bell (1972) City Fathers&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Lanark mills depended upon water power. A [[dam]] was constructed on the Clyde above New Lanark and water was drawn off the river to power the mill machinery. The water first travelled through a tunnel, then through an open channel called the lade. It then went to a number of water wheels in each mill building. It was not until 1929 that the last waterwheel was replaced by a water turbine. Water power is still used in New Lanark. A new water turbine has been installed in Mill Number Three to provide electricity for the tourist areas of the village.

In Owen's time some 2,500 people lived at New Lanark, many from the [[poorhouse]]s of Glasgow and [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell and Bell (1972) City Fathers&lt;/ref&gt; Although not the grimmest of mills by far, Owen found the conditions unsatisfactory and resolved to improve the workers' lot. He paid particular attention to the needs of the 500 or so children living in the village (one of the tenement blocks is named Nursery Buildings) and working at the mills, and opened the first [[infants school|infants' school]] in Britain in 1817, although the previous year he had completed the Institute for the Formation of Character.&lt;ref name = donnachie93&gt;Donnachie, Ian and Hewitt, George (1993) Historic New Lanark: The Dale and Owen Industrial Community since 1785, Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The mills thrived commercially, but Owen's partners were unhappy at the extra expense incurred by his welfare programmes. Unwilling to allow the mills to revert to the old ways of operating, Owen bought out his partners. In 1813 the Board forced an auction, hoping to obtain the town and mills at a low price but Owen and a new board (including the economist [[Jeremy Bentham]]) that was sympathetic to his reforming ideas won out.&lt;ref name = donnachie93/&gt;

New Lanark became celebrated throughout Europe, with many statesmen, reformers and royalty visiting the mills. They were astonished to find a clean, healthy industrial environment with a content, vibrant workforce and a prosperous, viable business venture all rolled into one. Owen's philosophy was contrary to contemporary thinking, but he was able to demonstrate that it was not necessary for an industrial enterprise to treat its workers badly to be profitable. Owen was able to show visitors the village's excellent housing and amenities, and the accounts showing the profitability of the mills.

As well as the mills' connections with reform, socialism and welfare, they are also representative of the [[Industrial Revolution]] that occurred in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries and which fundamentally altered the shape of the world. The planning of employment in the mills alongside housing for the workers and services such as a school also makes the settlement iconic in the development of [[urban planning]] in the UK.&lt;ref name= unesco/&gt;

In 1825, control of New Lanark passed to the Walker family when Owen left Britain to start settlement of [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] in the US. The Walkers managed the village until 1881, when it was sold to Birkmyre and Sommerville and the Gourock Ropeworks (although they tried unsuccessfully to sell the mills and the town in 1851).&lt;ref name = donnachie93/&gt;  They and their successor companies remained in control until the mills closed in 1968.

The town and the industrial activity had been in decline before then, but after the mills closed migration away from the village accelerated, and the buildings began to deteriorate.&lt;ref name = unesco/&gt; The top two floors of Mill Number 1 were removed in 1945 but the building has since been restored and is now the New Lanark Mill Hotel. In 1963 the New Lanark Association (NLA) was formed as a housing association and commenced the restoration of Caithness Row and Nursery Buildings. In 1970 the mills,  other industrial buildings and the houses used by Dale and Owen were sold to Metal Extractions Limited, a scrap metal company. In 1974 the NLCT (now the NLT) was founded to prevent demolition of the village. A [[compulsory purchase order]] was used in 1983 to recover the mills and other buildings from Metal Extractions after a repairs notice had been served in 1979. This was because of the state of repair of the buildings despite their listing as historic buildings that required their legal preservation in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Historic Scotland (n.d.) Listing of historical buildings. Available at www.historic-scotland.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt; They are now controlled by the NLT, either directly through the Trust or through wholly owned companies (New Lanark Trading Ltd, New Lanark Hotel Ltd and New Lanark Homes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = New Lanark World Heritage Site|title = New Lanark Trust |url =  http://www.newlanark.org/world-heritage-site/new-lanark-trust.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 most of the buildings had been restored and the village has become a major tourist attraction.

== Living conditions ==

In the mid 19th century, an entire family would have been housed in a single room. Some sense of such living conditions can be obtained by visiting the [[David Livingstone Centre]] at Blantyre. David Dale, who founded New Lanark, was also involved in the mills at Blantyre. Only one tenement row has survived in Blantyre, and that building is now a museum. This is mostly devoted to [[David Livingstone]], who was born there in 1813, but it includes a re-creation of the single~room living conditions of the time at New Lanark, featuring [[trundle bed]]s for children such as Livingstone would have used. The David Livingstone Centre is 18 miles by road from New Lanark, between Glasgow and Hamilton.

The living conditions in the village gradually improved, and by the early 20th century families would have had the use of several rooms. It was not until 1933 that the houses had interior cold water taps for sinks and the communal outside toilets were replaced by inside facilities.

From 1938 the village proprietors provided free electricity to all the homes in New Lanark, but only enough power was available for one dim bulb in each room. The power was switched off at 10 pm Sunday-Friday, 11 pm Saturday. In 1955 New Lanark was connected to the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newlanark.org/edu-teachersnotes.pdf] New Lanark ''Key Themes about New Lanark for Teachers''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NewlanarkNL07.jpg|thumb|right|Dereliction in New Lanark in 1983.]]

== New Lanark today ==
It has been estimated that over 400,000 people visit the village each year. The importance of New Lanark has been recognised by [[UNESCO]] as one of Scotland's six [[World Heritage Site]]s, the others being [[Edinburgh]] Old and New Towns, Heart of Neolithic Orkney, [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]], the [[Antonine Wall]] and the [[Forth Rail Bridge|Forth Bridge]]. The mills and town were listed in 2001 after an unsuccessful application for World Heritage listing in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;New Lanark Trust (n.d.) The Story of New Lanark, New Lanark Trust, Lanark&lt;/ref&gt;

About 200 people live in New Lanark. Of the residential buildings, only Mantilla Row has not been restored. Some of the restoration work was undertaken by the NLA and the NLCT. Braxfield Row and most of Long Row were restored by private individuals who bought the houses as derelict shells and restored them as private houses. In addition to the 20 owner-occupied properties in the village there are 45 rented properties let by the NLA, which is a registered housing association. The NLA also owns other buildings in the village. 

In 2009 the NLA was wound up as being financially and administratively unviable, and responsibility for the village's tenanted properties passed to the NLCT. The same year, [[Clydesdale Bank]] released a new series of [[Scottish banknotes]], of which the 20-pound note features New Lanark on its reverse.

Considerable attention has been given to maintaining the historical authenticity of the village. No television aerials or satellite dishes are allowed in the village, and services such as telephone, television and electricity are delivered though buried cables. To provide a consistent appearance all external woodwork is painted white, and doors and windows follow a consistent design. Householders used to be banned from owning dogs, but this rule is no longer enforced.

Some features introduced by the NLT, such as commercial signage and a glass bridge connecting the Engine House and Mill Number Three, have been criticised. The retention of a 1924-pattern [[red telephone box]] in the village square has also been seen as inappropriate.

The mills, the hotel and most of the non-residential buildings in the village are owned and operated by the NLT through wholly owned companies.

*Braxfield Row, built c1790 – a [[tenement]] block converted to ten owner-occupied houses, nine are four-storey and one five-storey.
*Long Row, built c1790 - a tenement block converted to 14 three-storey houses. Ten are owner occupied and four are tenanted.
*Double Row, built c1795 – a tenement block of seven four storey houses and one five storey that were occupied from the 1790s to the 1970s. They originally contained back-to-back apartments. The side facing the river was also known as Water Row. Seven of the houses have been externally renovated to be sold as single occupancy homes. Number seven is known as the ‘Museum Stair’ and is designated a Scheduled Monument, due to the remarkable survival of original artefacts and materials such as fireplaces, sinks, ‘set-in’ beds, remnants of wallpaper and linoleum.
*Mantilla Row, built c1795 – a tenement block demolished when it became structurally unsafe. New foundations and some walls have been laid, but the row has not been completely rebuilt.
*Wee Row, built c1795 – a tenement block converted to a youth hostel in 1994. It was once operated by the Scottish Youth Hostels Association but is now managed by the New Lanark Mill Hotel.
*New Buildings, built 1798 – a four-storey building containing the bell tower. The bell, which once summoned the workers to the mills,  is now sounded at midnight on the last day of the year. The building contains a museum and tenanted flats.
*Nursery Buildings, built 1809 – a three-storey building that has been converted to tenanted flats. It was once used to house the orphan children who worked in the mills.

On 18 August 2017, Ankit Love attended a Panthers Party campaign rally at [[Baramulla district|Barmulla district]] in Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.5dariyanews.com/news/202219-Ankit-Love-and-Prof-Bhim-Attacked-By-Al-Qaeda-Terrorists-in-Kashmir|title=Ankit Love and Prof. Bhim Attacked By Al-Qaeda Terrorists in Kashmir|last=Pampori|first=Rouf|date=2018-08-19|work=5 Dariya News|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the rally he called for the abolition of [[Article 35A of the Constitution of India|Article 35A]], and the reunification of India and Pakistan to stop the threat of an “apocalyptic nuclear war for Kashmir.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greaterjammu.com/2017/08/13/ankit-love-returns-to-kashmir-with-a-dream-to-reunite-india-pakistan-by-referendum/|title=Ankit Love returns to Kashmir with a dream to reunite India-Pakistan by referendum – Greater Jammu  {{!}}{{!}} The Daily News Paper|last=|first=|date=2018-08-13|website=greaterjammu.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after leaving the rally, Love and his convoy of twenty-two Indian army guards, survived an armed attack by [[Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent|Al-Qaeda]] terrorists, in which his father, [[Bhim Singh (politician)|Bhim Singh]], was wounded.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

== Policies ==
The party described itself as "techno-progressive".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2016/09/05/dawa-ma-one-love-candidate-hackney-mayoral-election/|title=Meet the candidates for Hackney Mayor: Dawa Ma, One Love|last=Loeb|first=Josh|date=9 May 2016|work=Hackney Citizen|access-date=19 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party proposed legalising, licensing and taxing drugs such as [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in the hope of ending the war on drugs and reducing violent crime.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenationalstudent.com/National/2016-05-04/free_university_and_legal_drugs_meet_ankit_love_the_london_mayoral_candidate_you_ve_never_heard_of.html|title=Free university and legal drugs: meet Ankit Love, the London mayoral candidate you've never heard of|last=Miller|first=Lucy|date=4 May 2016|work=The National Student|access-date=20 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oneloveparty.eu/end-war-on-drugs/|title=End War on Drugs|last=|first=|date=|website=One Love Party|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love claimed that the prohibition of drugs "was originally based on racism, and it funds all the criminal activity in our society."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; During the London mayoral campaign, it proposed to do this through municipality-owned licensed dispensaries.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/mayor-london-polish-prince-ankit-love-456864?rm=eu|title=What's it like to run for Mayor of London?|last=Lowe|first=Josh|date=6 May 2016|work=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=20 July 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party called for a [[People's Vote|vote on the final Brexit deal]], which would have enfranchised citizens of the [[European Union]] resident in the United Kingdom and 16- and 17-year-olds. Because EU citizens could not vote in it, the party claimed that the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit referendum]] was illegal, violating the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanchristianpost.com/detail.php?communityid=487|title=NPP Chief appeals Hackney electorate to vote One Love Party in Mayor By-Election|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Pakistan Christian Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the London mayoral election campaign, the party endorsed [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]]'s proposal to build six new bridges across the [[River Thames]] in order to boost the regeneration of East London and provide 47,000 homes.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riverthamesnews.com/News934.html|title=One Love Party candidate Ankit Love's policies for the Thames|last=|first=|date=|website=River Thames News|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The party also pledged to introduce "discount travel cards for Londoners"&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/west-london-news/what-11-things-one-love-11172808|title=Mayoral elections: 11 things the One Love Party want to change|last=Joshi|first=Amita|date=14 April 2016|work=getwestlondon|access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and make higher education free for London residents up to phD level.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

During the Tooting by-election campaign, Love favoured bringing the [[Crossrail 2|Crossrail 2 line]] through [[Tooting Broadway tube station|Tooting Broadway]] and voiced his opposition to [[High Speed 2|HS2]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Environment ===
The One Love Party's priority issue was [[air pollution]],&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; which it described as a [[pandemic]] situation, quoting figures that 50,000 people die from it annually in the UK.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world/a-kashmiri-dogra-who-wants-to-be-mayor-of-london/story-4zu6gLKKDsVa5fpH4mtysJ.html|title=A Kashmiri Dogra who wants to be mayor of London|last=Sonwalkar|first=Prasun|date=27 April 2016|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|access-date=20 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It campaigned for immediate emergency action to bring fossil fuel emissions to zero by the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] and [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]] to force all power production, shipping, aviation and automobile companies to convert to only clean energy sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The party pledged to ban all cars except electric and hydrogen vehicles.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2016/10/26/hackney-central-masterplan-resurrecting-hackney-brook-ideas-feedback/|title=Reborn river among weird and wonderful ideas as council invites masterplan feedback|last=Loeb|first=Josh|last2=Schöffmann|first2=Katharina|date=26 October 2016|website=Hackney Citizen|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2016|last3=Eckersley|first3=Max}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Love had previously called for the [[British Armed Forces|army]] to organise a military coup d'état and overthrow [[David Cameron]], then the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], on the issue of air pollution.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In an interview with ''[[London Live (TV channel)|London Live]]'', Love expressed his long-term intention to decommission power stations using fossil fuels across the UK.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

During the London mayoral election campaign, the party called for a ban on all fossil fuel emissions vehicles from the capital&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; and wanted to introduce [[Autonomous car|driverless]] electric cars for public transport.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Love called for the city's [[List of cycle routes in London|cycle superhighways]] to be suspended from the railway network.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The party would have converted all [[water vessel]]s from [[bunker fuel]] to [[hydrogen fuel]], solar or [[SkySails]].&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; The party also pledged to increase the use of driverless electric vehicles,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; reduce the cost of installing solar panels in residential homes,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; adopt electric and hydrogen-powered buses,&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; scrap the [[Garden Bridge]] project,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; cancel the [[Silvertown Tunnel|Silvertown tunnel]] project, revive the Thames' eel population and investigate the potential of new moorings.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Love also called for adverts for cars to be banned in the same way as adverts for cigarettes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; During the Hackney mayoral by-election campaign, the party called for a monument to remember the victims of air pollution akin to a war memorial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Technology ===
In agreement with its techno-progressive philosophy, the party supported the expansion of drones, driverless cars, robotic technology and artificial intelligence, stating that these would make more efficient use of scarce resources even if they increased unemployment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The One Love Party believed in an accelerated program of space exploration, including the [[colonization of Mars|colonisation of Mars]] and [[Colonization of Venus|Venus]] and the [[Asteroid mining|mining of asteroids]] to mitigate economic scarcity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

They had pledged to establish a London municipal space program to detect unknown asteroids on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/31007/1/the-ex-mtv-sensation-aiming-to-be-london-s-pro-weed-mayor|title=The ex-MTV sensation aiming to be London’s pro-weed mayor|last=Kirkinis|first=Andreas|date=5 May 2016|work=[[Dazed]]|access-date=20 July 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By applying robotic technology and [[artificial intelligence]], the party wished to abolish personal income taxes and introduce a [[Basic income|universal basic income]] for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oneloveparty.eu/manifesto/|title=Manifesto|last=|first=|date=|website=One Love Party|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the London mayoral election campaign, the party pledged to introduce [[Li-Fi]] networks&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/9249-2/|title=MAYORAL ELECTION: candidates for UKIP and the One Love party layout their plans for London - Southwark News|last=|first=|date=4 May 2016|work=|newspaper=Southwark News|access-date=18 July 2018|language=en-GB|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use maintenance drones to oversee roadworks and street and building repairs.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Love said that he wanted London to be the first major city "to have driverless cars on an everyday basis."&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Housing market ===
During the London mayoral election campaign, the party pledged to build one million social homes in four years. They pledged to achieve this by constructing skyscrapers akin to quick-build flatpack buildings in [[China]] on land owned by [[Transport for London]] and the [[Greater London Authority]];&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; the building would have been funded by bank loans&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; and private financing.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; At the same time, the party said it would outlaw purchases of new apartments for buy-to-let or investment purposes.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== International relations ===
The party proposed a confederate economic union for India, [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]] and China, akin to that of the European Union, which would have included free movement of labour and a single currency, with the aim of ending the "potential of an apocalyptic nuclear war".&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Love [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|supported]] the United Kingdom's continued membership of the European Union.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

'''Ontogenetic depth''' is a [[pseudoscientific]] idea proposed in February 2003 by [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul Nelson]], an American philosopher of science, [[young earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] and [[intelligent design]] advocate;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Basically, Nelson concludes in his 'hypothesis' that developmental complexity is [[wikt:infrangible|infrangible]], and that if he shows [[Cambrian]] organisms to be complex, then it is therefore impossible for them to have evolved.&lt;ref name='discussion paper'&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson proposes '[[Ontogeny|ontogenetic]] depth' as evidence of [[specified complexity]], and a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent, in opposition to [[modern evolutionary theory]].

Nelson subsequently stated that ontogenetic depth is "Currently Impossible to Measure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/04/10/paul-nelson-takes-a-stab-at-on/ Paul Nelson takes a stab at Ontogenetic Depth again…which makes me go stab-stab-stabbity-stab] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408213822/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/04/10/paul-nelson-takes-a-stab-at-on/ |date=2014-04-08 }}, by [[PZ Myers]], at [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]]; published April 10, 2011. Retrieved April 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Biologist [[PZ Myers]], who works in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], dismissed the concept, stating in 2010 that "Nelson is a creationist who made up this wacky claim of "ontogenetic depth", saying he had a way of objectively measuring the complexity of the developmental process in organisms with a number that described the distance from egg to adult. Unfortunately, he forgot to tell us how one calculated this number, or how it actually accounted for the complexity of a network, or even how we'd get a number that was different for a sponge and a cat. But he did say he'd get back to us with the details tomorrow...six years ago."&lt;ref name='PZ Myers'&gt;{{cite web

| dead-url     = no
| df           =
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers concludes that "ontogenetic depth is a sloppily-defined concept with no theoretical support for its validity and no apparent operational utility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of 'ontogenetic depth' has not been published in any [[peer-reviewed journal]], there are no methods described that would allow to measure this value in any organisms, nobody other than Nelson and his collaborator, Marcus Ross, do anything with the idea.&lt;ref name='PZ Myers' /&gt;

'''Pantarchy''' is a social theory proposed by [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]] in the 19th century. Andrews was considered the "American rival of [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]," because of his work on an all-encompassing philosophy of [[universology]], and his political proposals had similar scope, combining elements of the individualist anarchism of [[Josiah Warren]], whose works Andrews had edited, with a strong belief in natural hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dorchester. ''Christianity in the United States''. Cincinnati: Phillips and Hunt, 1888. 834; Stephen Pearl Andrews. ''Constitution or Organic Basis of the Pantarchy''. New York: Baker and Godwin, 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The plan of this party proposes a NEW SPIRITUAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE WORLD, called THE PANTARCHY, which includes a NEW CHURCH and a NEW STATE, with, to use his own language, " all other subordinate institutions, educational, informational, &amp;c., which are universal in their scope and nature, and which can be devised and established as subservient to the collective wants of mankind." &lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dorchester. ''Christianity in the United States''. Cincinnati: Phillips and Hunt, 1888. 834.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrews scheme of pantarchy was discussed in a series of "Weekly Bulletins" in the pages of ''[[Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly|Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly]]''. The American Section 12 of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] adopted some of Andrews' proposals.

'''People Before Profit''' ('''PBP''') is a [[Socialism|socialist]] political party formed in October 2005.&lt;ref name=SWN_1/&gt; It is active in both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

==History==
PBP was established in 2005, primarily by members of the [[Socialist Workers Network|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP).&lt;ref name=SWN_1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clririshleftarchive.org/organisation/254/|work=Irish Left Archive|title=About Socialist Workers' Network|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistworkeronline.net/about-the-swp/|title=About the SWP|work=Socialist Worker online|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT_20151009&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/harry-mcgee-people-before-profit-and-the-anti-austerity-alliance-spot-the-difference-1.2384459|work=The Irish Times|author=Harry McGee|title=People Before Profit and the Anti Austerity Alliance - spot the difference|quote=For anybody who has not been intimately involved with the Socialist Workers Party or the Socialist Party, you would need to have a PhD in semantics and rhetoric to winkle out the actual ideological difference between them.

==Republic of Ireland==
PBP contested several constituencies in the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 general election]], polling around 9,000 [[first preferences]], with [[Richard Boyd Barrett]]—the candidate in the [[Dún Laoghaire (Dáil constituency)|Dún Laoghaire constituency]]—missing a seat on the 10th and final count by 7,890 votes to 9,910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/elections2007/results/constit-22.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818183706/http://www.rte.ie/news/elections2007/results/constit-22.html |archivedate=18 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=4256 |title=Ciaran Cuffe |website=ElectionsIreland.org |date= |accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, PBP [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008|launched a campaign]] calling for a No vote on the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] when it was put to the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.peoplebeforeprofit.ie/node/156 |title=Lisbon Treaty is unchanged and must be rejected &amp;#124; People Before Profit Alliance |website=Archive.peoplebeforeprofit.ie |date= |accessdate=19 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604231511/http://archive.peoplebeforeprofit.ie/node/156 |archivedate=4 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Republic's [[Irish local elections, 2009|2009 local elections]] PBP ran twelve candidates, including ten in County Dublin. It secured five seats in three of Dublin's four councils. As well as ten members of the SWP, [[Joan Collins (politician)|Joan Collins]] and Pat Dunne of the CWAG ran in Dublin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=6163|title=Pat Dunne|work=ElectionsIreland.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Donnie Fell (a former [[Waterford Crystal]] worker and trade union representative) in Waterford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Olivia|last=Kelly|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0507/breaking70.htm|title=Left alliance to run 13 candidates|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=7 May 2009|accessdate=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Republic's [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]], both Richard Boyd Barrett and Joan Collins were elected to [[Dáil Éireann]] as TDs (deputies), running under a joint People Before Profit and [[United Left Alliance]] banner.

In April 2013 [[Joan Collins (politician)|Joan Collins]] TD and Cllr Pat Dunne left the group to form [[United Left (Ireland)|United Left]], a political party with former Socialist Party TD [[Clare Daly]].

In the May 2014 local elections, PBP won 14 seats including two seats outside Dublin on Sligo and Wexford County Councils.

Discussions were held in August 2015 with the [[Anti-Austerity Alliance]] about forming a new political grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/anti-austerity-alliance-people-before-profit-2259896-Aug2015/|title=Could we be about to get another new political group?|work=TheJournal.ie|date=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September 2015, the two parties announced they had formally registered as a single political party for electoral purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/anti-austerity-alliance-and-people-before-profit-to-launch-new-party-1.2353674|title=Anti Austerity Alliance and People before Profit to launch new party|work=The Irish Times|date=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new organisation was called the [[Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit]].

At the [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 general election]], Boyd Barrett was re-elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2016&amp;cons=113|title=Dún Laoghaire – General Election: 26 February 2016|work=ElectionsIreland.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was joined by fellow PBP candidates [[Gino Kenny]] and [[Bríd Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2016&amp;cons=95|title=Dublin Mid West – General Election: 26 February 2016|work=ElectionsIreland.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2016&amp;cons=103|title=Dublin South Central – General Election: 26 February 2016|work=ElectionsIreland.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
People Before Profit unsuccessfully ran one candidate, Sean Mitchell, in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2007|2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election]], polling 774 first preferences in the [[Belfast West (Assembly constituency)|Belfast West constituency]]. He successfully gained the right to stand in an election by threatening to take the then [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[Peter Hain]], to court if the legal loophole preventing him from doing so was enforced. (England, Scotland and Wales had secured the right to contest candidates under the age of 20, providing they were over 18, for constituencies for devolved government, whereas Northern Ireland had been simply excluded).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

People Before Profit ran four candidates in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2011|Northern Ireland Assembly election of May 2011]], winning 5,438 first-preference votes between them but no seats in the new Assembly. Its most successful candidate in this election was [[Eamonn McCann]], who won 3,120 first-preference votes, or 8% of the total, in [[Foyle (Assembly constituency)|Foyle]].

In the June 2011 [[Belfast West by-election, 2011|Belfast West by-election]], [[Gerry Carroll (politician)|Gerry Carroll]] won 1,751 votes (7.6%), coming in third place and ahead of both unionist candidates.

In the [[Belfast City Council election, 2014|2014 Belfast City Council election]], Gerry Carroll became the first PBP councilor elected in Northern Ireland, winning 3rd place in the [[Black Mountain (District Electoral Area)|Black Mountain DEA]], with 1,691 1st Preference votes.

In May 2016, Carroll]] topped the poll in the [[Belfast West (Assembly constituency)|Belfast West]] constituency at the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2016|2016 Assembly Election]] with 8,299 votes (22.9%), almost 4,000 first-preference votes clear of his nearest challenger, [[Sinn Féin]] MLA [[Fra McCann]] (Sinn Féin was running five candidates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/northern-ireland-constituencies/N06000004 |title=Belfast West - Northern Ireland Assembly constituency - Election 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=6 May 2016|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This victory secured PBP with their first elected MLA. [[Eamonn McCann]] also took a seat in the Derry constituency of [[Foyle (Assembly constituency)|Foyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/northern-ireland-constituencies/N06000008 |title=Foyle - Northern Ireland Assembly constituency - Election 2016 |publisher=BBC News |date=7 May 2016|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2017|2017]], Carroll retained his seat but with a much reduced vote (12.2%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/northern-ireland-constituencies/N06000004 |title=Belfast West - Northern Ireland Assembly constituency - Election 2017 |publisher=BBC News |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while McCann lost his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/northern-ireland-constituencies/N06000008 |title=Foyle - Northern Ireland Assembly constituency - Election 2017 |publisher=BBC News |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Northern Ireland Assembly, the party is designated as neither [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] nor [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]], but 'Other'.

===2016 EU Membership referendum===
People Before Profit supported and campaigned for a Leave vote in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 EU referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/opinion/letterstotheeditor/2016/07/04/news/brexit-fallout-has-undermined-the-principle-of-consent-586751/|title=Brexit fallout has undermined the principle of consent|work=Irish News|date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Tony Briffa was born with [[Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome]], raised as a girl and castrated at age seven to impose that [[assigned sex]] of rearing. Speaking to a 2013 [[Senate of Australia]] inquiry into the ''Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia'', Briffa describes how doctors "convinced my mother to approve me to be castrated":
{{quotation|"I have a few pages here from my medical records...It says: 'Mother now ready for gonadectomy.' ... The histology reports, which I will also tender, show that they were healthy testes. But there was no Family Court approval. If we are talking about coercion, doctors coerce families, parents, into believing by saying: 'We need to remove these testes because it will make your child normal'... Of course, part of the whole sterilisation thing is that you have pretty big surgery and scars, so they are making you different! ... [and surgery is] usually over the summer holidays, so your summers are spent in hospital".&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Involuntary_Sterilisation/Sec_Report/index | title = Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia | publisher = [[Australian Senate]] Community Affairs Committee | date = October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Personal life ==

=== Birth certificate ===
[[Norrie May-Welby]] is popularly regarded as the first person with an indeterminate birth certificate, and "non-specific" sex was awarded by the High Court of Australia in April 2014 on the basis of May-Welby's failed sex affirmation surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie |vol=2014 |reporter=HCA |opinion=11 |pinpoint=11 |court=High Court of Australia |date=2 April 2014 |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2014/11.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tony Briffa had previously obtained a birth certificate with a blank sex classification.&lt;ref name="Cr Tony Briffa"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://briffa.org/about | title = About Tony | work = Briffa.org | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{Citation

{{quotation|My birth certificate, from the state of Victoria, does not classify me as male or female. I have certainly had a female birth certificate, I had a male birth certificate at one stage and I have a blank birth certificate now. But we are hoping that one day in the future our birth certificates will actually be able to reflect, for those who want it, the way nature made us. If people feel female that is great, and if they feel male that is great, but there are also people like me: I just accept the way nature made me. I am happy for my birth certificate to say that I am both male and female. One day, hopefully, we will have that as well.}}

=== Pronouns ===
Briffa made the following statement: "I am very public about being born biologically partially female and partially male and that I was raised as a girl and lived as a woman until I was 30. I ask all my friends and colleagues to respect my sex as what nature made me; both female and male."&lt;ref name="herald sun" /&gt; On his website Briffa posted: &lt;blockquote&gt;“I feel very comfortable having accepted my true nature. I am not male or female, but both. I am grateful for the years I lived as a woman and the insight and experiences it gave me. I am still ‘Antoinette’ and have now also incorporated and accepted my male (‘Anthony’ or ‘Tony’) side. I feel whole. I’ll continue to live as Tony but I feel I am now at a point in my life where I can celebrate being different.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/10/tony-briffa-intersex-mayor_n_1140840.html|title=Tony Briffa Of Australia's City Of Hobsons Bay Becomes World's First Intersex Mayor|date=2011-12-10|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He also added that now that he has come to accept the male part of himself, he is now using male pronouns however continue to identify as neither male or female.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Marriage ===
Legal issues presented by Tony Briffa's non-specific birth certificate meant that Briffa could not lawfully marry in Australia until late 2017. On 27 September 2013, Tony Briffa married Manja Sommeling in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.samesame.com.au/features/10308/Tony-and-Manjas-little-Kiwi-wedding.htm | work = SameSame.com.au | date = 8 October 2013 | title = Tony and Manja's little Kiwi wedding}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/national/tony-briffa-to-wed-partner-in-nz-ceremony-12022.html | title = OII VP Tony Briffa to Wed Partner in NZ Ceremony | work = Gay News Network | date = 27 September 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170103013232/http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/national/tony-briffa-to-wed-partner-in-nz-ceremony-12022.html | archivedate = 3 January 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersex Human Rights Australia notes:&lt;ref name="congrats"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oii.org.au/23608/congratulations-tony-manja/ | title = Congratulations, Tony and Manja! | work = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] | date = 27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

{{quotation| Tony was born in Victoria with Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PAIS), one of many intersex variations, and Tony's birth certificate does not state a sex. Marriage in Australia is currently only permissible between a man and a woman, and Tony is not eligible.

Tony is able to marry in New Zealand because legislation providing marriage equality was passed earlier this year. Tony has had to declare an "indeterminate" gender for the purposes of today's marriage.&lt;ref name="congrats" /&gt;}}

{{Politics of the European Union}}
'''Withdrawal from the European Union''' is the legal and political process whereby an [[member state of the European Union|EU member state]] ceases to be a member of the Union. Under '''Article 50''' of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU), "Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html|title=Article 50|publisher=[[Eurostep]]|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No member state has as of yet withdrawn from the EU (or the [[European Communities|EC]]); however, the Government of the [[United Kingdom]] [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|triggered Article 50 to begin the UK's withdrawal from the EU]] in March 2017 following a referendum, and the withdrawal is scheduled to occur on 29 March 2019.

Article 50, which allows a member state to withdraw, was originally drafted by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Crossbencher|cross-bench]] [[peerage|peer]] and former diplomat [[Lord Kerr of Kinlochard]], the secretary-general of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Convention]], which drafted the [[Constitutional Treaty for the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/article-50-design-dictators-not-uk-eu-european-lisbon-treaty-author-lord-kerr-a7655891.html |title=Article 50 was designed for European dictators, not the UK, says man who wrote it| work=The Independent |date= 29 March 2017 |quote=Article 50 was designed to be used by a dictatorial regime, not the UK government, the man who wrote it has said. ... As Secretary General of the European Convention in the early 2000s, Lord Kerr played a key role in drafting a constitutional treaty for the EU that included laws on the process by which states can leave the bloc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the failure of the ratification process for the European Constitution, the clause was incorporated into the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] which entered into force in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37852628 |title=Article 50 author Lord Kerr says Brexit not inevitable| work=BBC News |date= 3 November 2016 |quote=After leaving the foreign office, he was secretary-general of the European [C]onvention, which drafted what became the Lisbon treaty. It included Article 50 which sets out the process by which any member state can leave the EU.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, no provision in the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]] or [[Law of the European Union|law]] of the EU outlined the ability of a state to voluntarily withdraw from the EU. The absence of such a provision made withdrawal technically difficult but not impossible.&lt;ref name="expel"/&gt; Legally there were two interpretations of whether a state could leave. The first, that sovereign states have a right to withdraw from their international commitments;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurd |first=Ian |date=2013 |title=International Organizations: Politics, Law, Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cROAAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=10 |isbn=9781107040977}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second, the treaties are for an unlimited period, with no provision for withdrawal and calling for an "ever closer union" – such commitment to unification is incompatible with a unilateral withdrawal. The [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] states where a party wants to withdraw unilaterally from a treaty that is silent on secession, there are only two cases where withdrawal is allowed: where all parties recognise an informal right to do so and where the situation has changed so drastically, that the obligations of a signatory have been radically transformed.&lt;ref name="expel"/&gt;

==Procedure==
{{wikisource|Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title VI: Final Provisions#Article 50|The Withdrawal Clause}}
Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, enacted by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] on 1 December 2009, introduced for the first time a procedure for a member state to withdraw voluntarily from the EU.&lt;ref name="expel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Athanassiou|first1=Phoebus|title=Withdrawal and Expulsion from the EU and EMU: Some Reflections|journal=Legal Working Paper Series|number=10|date=December 2009|format=PDF|publisher=European Central Bank|page=9|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp10.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2013|issn=1830-2696}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is specified in Article 50 of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on European Union|Treaty on European Union]], which states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union|publisher=[[HM Government]] |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228848/7310.pdf#page=40|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|

# Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.
# A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the [[European Council]] of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN page 99 of 344]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].

# For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it. &lt;p&gt; A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
# If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49.}}

This provision does not cover certain overseas territories which under [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Seven: General and Final Provisions#Article 355|TFEU Article 355]] do not require a full treaty revision.&lt;ref&gt;Instead, the European Council may, on the initiative of the member state concerned, change the status of an [[overseas countries and territories|overseas country or territory]] (OCT) to an [[outermost region]] (OMR) or vice versa.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invocation===
Thus, once a member state has notified the [[European Council]] of its intention to leave, a period begins during which a withdrawal agreement is negotiated, setting out the arrangements for the withdrawal and outlining the country's future relationship with the Union. Commencing the process is up to the member state that intends to leave.

The article allows for a negotiated withdrawal, due to the complexities of leaving the EU. However, it does include in it a strong implication of a unilateral right to withdraw. This is through the fact that a state would decide to withdraw "in accordance with its own constitutional requirements" and that the end of the treaties' application in a member state that intends to withdraw is not dependent on any agreement being reached (it would occur after two years regardless).&lt;ref name="expel"/&gt;

===Negotiation===
The treaties cease to apply to the member state concerned on the entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of such an agreement, two years after the member state notified the European Council of its intention to leave, although this period can be extended by unanimous agreement of the European Council.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title VI: Final Provisions#Article 50|Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The leaving agreement is negotiated on behalf of the EU by the [[European Commission]] on the basis of a mandate given by the remaining Member States, meeting in the [[Council of the European Union]]. It must set out the arrangements for withdrawal, taking account of the framework for the member state's future relationship with the EU, though without itself settling that framework. The agreement is to be approved on the EU side by the Council of the EU, acting by [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|qualified majority]], after obtaining the consent of the [[European Parliament]]. For the agreement to pass the Council of the EU it needs to be approved by at least 72 percent of the continuing member states representing at least 65 percent of their population.&lt;ref name="constunit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://constitution-unit.com/2016/01/19/what-happens-if-we-vote-for-brexit/ |title=What happens if we vote for Brexit? |last=Renwick|first=Alan|date=19 January 2016|website=The Constitution Unit Blog|access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement is concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council and must set out the arrangements for withdrawal, including a framework for the State's future relationship with the Union, negotiated in accordance with [[s:Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Part_Five:_External_Action_by_the_Union#Article_218|Article 218(3)]] of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]. The agreement is to be approved by the Council, acting by [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|qualified majority]], after obtaining the consent of the [[European Parliament]]. Should a former Member State seek to rejoin the European Union, it would be subject to the same conditions as any other applicant country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 50(4) of Lisbon Treaty which cites Article 49 Accession process&lt;/ref&gt;

Remaining members of the EU would need to manage consequential changes over the [[Budget of the European Union|EU's budgets]], voting allocations and policies brought about by the withdrawal of any member state.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Tim|title=Europe without Britain: Assessing the Impact on the European Union of a British Withdrawal|url=http://www.swp-berlin.org/en/publications/swp-research-papers/swp-research-paper-detail/article/europe_without_britain.html|publisher=Stiftung Wissenshaft und Politik|access-date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure of negotiations===
This system gives a negotiated withdrawal, due to the complexities of leaving the EU (particularly concerning the [[euro]]). However it does include in it a strong implication of a unilateral right to withdraw. This is through the fact the state would decide "in accordance with its own constitutional requirements" and that the end of the treaties' application in said state is not dependent on any agreement being reached (it would occur after two years regardless).&lt;ref name="expel"/&gt;

If negotiations do not result in a ratified agreement, the seceding country leaves without an agreement, and the EU Treaties shall cease to apply to the seceding country, without any substitute or transitional arrangements being put in place. As regards trade, the parties would likely follow [[World Trade Organization]] rules on [[tariffs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/what-would-brexit-mean-for-british-trade/|title=What will Brexit mean for British trade?|author=|date=|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-entry or unilateral revocation===
Article 50 does not spell out whether Member States can rescind their notification of their intention to withdraw during the negotiation period while their country is still a Member of the European Union. However, the President of the European Council said to the European Parliament on 24 October 2017 that “deal, no deal or no Brexit” is up to Britain. Indeed, the prevailing legal opinion among EU law experts and the EU institutions themselves is that a member state intending to leave may change its mind, as an “intention” is not yet a deed and intentions can change before the deed is done. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/not-passed-point-no-return/|title=We have not passed the point of no return – Richard Corbett|date=26 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is untested in court. 

The European Parliament resolution of 5 April 2017 on negotiations with the United Kingdom following its notification that it intends to withdraw from the European Union states, "a revocation of notification needs to be subject to conditions set by all EU-27, so that it cannot be used as a procedural device or abused in an attempt to improve on the current terms of the United Kingdom’s membership." &lt;ref name=" Text adopted by EU parliament "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2017-0102+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|title=European Parliament resolution of 5 April 2017 on negotiations with the United Kingdom following its notification that it intends to withdraw from the European Union, paragraph L|date=5 April 2017|publisher= European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union Policy Department for Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs has stated that a hypothetical right of revocation can only be examined and confirmed or infirmed by the EU institution competent to this purpose, namely the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|CJEU]].&lt;ref name="Revocability of the withdrawal notification"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2018/596820/IPOL_IDA(2018)596820_EN.pdf|title=The (ir-)revocability of the withdrawal notification under Article 50 TEU – Conclusions|date=March 2018|publisher=The European Union Policy Department for Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the European Commission considers that Article 50 does not provide for the unilateral withdrawal of the notification.&lt;ref name="EU Commission Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-2001_en.htm|title= State of play of Article 50 negotiations with the United Kingdom|date=12 July 2017|publisher=The European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|Brexit Secretary]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] has stated that the British Government "does not know for sure" whether Article 50 is revocable; the British prime minister "does not intend" to reverse it.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

Should a former member state seek to rejoin the European Union after having actually left, it would be subject to the same conditions as any other applicant country and need to negotiate a Treaty of Accession, ratified by every Member State.&lt;ref&gt;Article 50(4) of Lisbon Treaty, which cites Article 49 accession process.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outermost regions==
[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Seven: General and Final Provisions#Article 355|TFEU Article 355]](6), introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon allows the status of French, Dutch and Danish overseas territories to be changed more easily, by no longer requiring a full treaty revision. Instead, the European Council may, on the initiative of the member state concerned, change the status of an [[overseas countries and territories|overseas country or territory]] (OCT) to an [[outermost region]] (OMR) or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;The provision reads:

{{quote|"6. The European Council may, on the initiative of the Member State concerned, adopt a decision amending the status, with regard to the Union, of a Danish, French or Netherlands country or territory referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. The European Council shall act unanimously after consulting the Commission."||[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00014.en07.pdf Treaty of Lisbon] Article 2, point 293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withdrawals==
Some former territories of European Union members broke formal links with the EU when they gained independence from their ruling country or were transferred to an EU non-member state. Most of [[Special Member State territories and the European Union#Former special territories|these territories]] were not classed as part of the EU, but were at most associated with [[Overseas Countries and Territories|OCT]] status, and [[EC law]]s were generally not in force in these countries.

Some current territories changed or are in the process of changing their status so that, instead of EU law applying fully or with limited exceptions, EU law mostly will not apply. The process also occurs in the opposite direction, as formal [[Enlargement of the European Union#Detail|enlargements]] of the union occur. The procedure for implementing such changes was made easier by the [[Treaty of Lisbon#Enlargement and secession|Treaty of Lisbon]].

===Past withdrawals===
====Algeria====
[[French Algeria]] had joined the [[European Communities]] as part of France (since legally it was not a colony of France, but rather one of its [[overseas department]]s). Upon [[Algerian War|independence]] in 1962, Algeria left France and thus left the European Communities.

====Greenland====
{{main|Withdrawal of Greenland from the European Communities}}
[[Greenland]] chose to leave the [[European Communities|EU predecessor]] without also [[secede|seceding]] from a member state. It initially voted against joining the EEC when [[Denmark]] joined in 1973, but because Denmark as a whole voted to join, [[County of Greenland, Denmark|Greenland, as a county of Denmark]], joined too. When [[home rule]] for Greenland began in 1979, it held a new [[Greenlandic European Economic Community membership referendum, 1982|referendum]] and voted to leave the EEC. After wrangling over fishing rights, the territory left the EEC in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7DE103BF937A35751C0A963948260 "Greenland Out of E.E.C.,"] ''New York Times'' (4 February 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; but remains subject to the EU treaties through [[Overseas Countries and Territories|association of Overseas Countries and Territories]] with the EU. This was permitted by the [[Greenland Treaty]], a special treaty signed in 1984 to allow its withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/droit_communautaire/droit_communautaire.htm|title=European law mentioning Greenland Treaty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saint Barthélemy====
[[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] and [[Saint-Barthélemy]] in 2007 [[Politics of Guadeloupe|seceded from Guadeloupe]] ([[overseas department]] of France and [[outermost region]] (OMR) of the EU) and became [[overseas collectivity|overseas collectivities]] of France, but at the same time remained OMRs of the European Union. Later, the elected representatives of the island of Saint-Barthélemy expressed a desire to "obtain a European status which would be better suited to its status under domestic law, particularly given its [[remote and isolated community|remoteness]] from [[mainland France|the mainland]], its small insular economy largely devoted to [[tourism]] and subject to difficulties in obtaining supplies which hamper the application of some [[European Union law|European Union standards]]." France, reflecting this desire, requested at the [[Council of the European Union]] to change the status of Saint Barthélemy to an [[Overseas Countries and Territories|overseas country or territory]] (OCT) associated with the European Union.&lt;ref name="StBarthelemey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/10/st15/st15224.en10.pdf|title=Draft European Council Decision on amendment of the European status of the island of Saint-Barthélemy – adoption|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status change came into effect from 1 January 2012.&lt;ref name="StBarthelemey"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union}}
[[File:Prime Ministers letter to European Council President Donald Tusk.pdf|thumb|200px|Letter from [[Theresa May]] invoking Article 50]]

The UK's planned withdrawal, known as "Brexit",&lt;ref name="bbc-define"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887 |title=Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU |publisher=BBC News |first1=Alex |last1=Hunt |first2=Brian |last2=Wheeler |date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first and only invocation of Article 50, as of December 2017.

The British government [[Second Cameron ministry|led by David Cameron]] held a [[Referendums in the United Kingdom|referendum]] on [[European Union Referendum Act 2015#Referendum question|the issue]] in 2016; a majority voted [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|to leave]] the [[European Union]].

The [[Continuing UK relationship with the EU|terms of withdrawal]] have not yet been negotiated, and the UK remains a full member of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-british-nationals-travelling-and-living-in-europe|title=Advice for British nationals travelling and living in Europe|last=|first=|date=19 January 2017|website=British Government Website|publisher=The U.K. Government|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; May said that the UK government would not seek permanent [[British membership of the European Economic Area|single market membership]],&lt;ref name="wilkinson"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/17/theresa-may-brexit-12-point-plan-live/|title=Theresa May confirms Britain will leave Single Market as she sets out 12-point Brexit plan.|last=Wilkinson|first=Michael|date=17 January 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promised a [[Great Repeal Bill 2016|Great Repeal Bill]] that would repeal the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act]] and would incorporate existing [[European Union law]] into the [[Law of the United Kingdom|domestic law]] of the UK.&lt;ref name="bbc-trigger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37532364|title=Brexit: PM to trigger Article 50 by end of March|date=2 October 2016|publisher=BBC News|language=en-GB|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential future withdrawals===
{{main article||Euroscepticism}}
Several states have political parties and individuals advocating and seeking withdrawal from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/brussels-fear-of-the-true-finns-rise-of-populist-parties-pushes-europe-to-the-right-a-758883.html "Brussels' Fear of the True Finns: Rise of Populist Parties Pushes Europe to the Right,"] Spiegel (25 April 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  In member states, there are political movements of varying significance campaigning for withdrawal.

====Parties in the EU advocating or considering withdrawal====
{{main article|Euroscepticism#Euroscepticism in the EU member states}}
While no country other than the United Kingdom has voted on whether to withdraw from the EU, political parties criticizing the federative trend of the European Union and advocating its reshaping into a looser cooperation framework have gained prominence in several member states since the last [[European Parliament election, 2014|European Parliament election in 2014]], similarly to the rise of [[UKIP]] in the United Kingdom. 

The main parties are:
* [[Party for Freedom]] and [[Forum for Democracy]] ([[Netherlands]]) – see [[Dutch withdrawal from the European Union]]
* [[National Rally (France)|Rassemblement national (former Front National)]] and [[Popular Republican Union (2007)|Popular Republican Union]] ([[France]]) – see [[Frexit]]
* [[Lega Nord]] ([[Italy]])
* [[Liberty (Poland)|Liberty]] ([[Poland]])
* [[Jobbik]] ([[Hungary]])
* [[Left Party (Sweden)|Vänsterpartiet]] and [[Sweden Democrats|Sverigedemokraterna]] ([[Sweden]])
* [[Finns Party|Perussuomalaiset]] ([[Finland]])
* [[Danish People's Party|Dansk Folkeparti]] and [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialistisk Folkeparti]] ([[Denmark]])
* [[Alternative for Germany|Alternative für Deutschland]] ([[Germany]])

The European Parliament currently includes two official groups of Eurosceptic members opposing the EU institutions: [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]] and [[Europe of Nations and Freedom]].

====Secession from a member state====
{{main|Future enlargement of the European Union#Internal enlargement}}
There are no clear agreements, treaties or precedents covering the scenario of an existing EU member state breaking into two or more states. The question is whether one state is a successor rump state which remains a member of the EU and the other is a new state which must reapply and be accepted by all other member states to remain in the EU, or alternatively whether both states retain their EU membership following succession.&lt;ref&gt;Edward, David, "Scotland's Position in the European Union", Scottish Parliamentary Review, Vol. I, No. 2 (Jan 2014) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21195630|title=Scottish independence: Irish minister says EU application 'would take time'|date=25 January 2013|accessdate=2 February 2013|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a region leaving its state would leave the EU - for example, if any of the various proposals for the [[enlargement of Switzerland]] from surrounding countries were to be implemented at a future date.

During the failed [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish independence referendum of 2014]] it was clarified by the European commission that any newly independent country would be considered as a new state which would have to negotiate with the EU to rejoin.&lt;ref name="scot apply"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/13/independent-scotland-would-have-to-apply-to-join-eu-commission-says|title=Independent Scotland 'would have to apply to join EU' – Brussels official|first=Jennifer Rankin Severin|last=Carrell|date=14 March 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such considerations also apply to the likes of Catalonia where even if the independence movement is in favor of rejoining the EU, other states may have an interest in blocking membership to deter independence movements within their own borders.&lt;ref name="cat pro eu"&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/10/10/the-catalan-independence-movement-is-pro-eu-but-will-the-eu-accept-it/ The Catalan independence movement is pro-EU – but will the EU accept it?], London School of Economics 10/OCT/17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal effect on EU citizenship==
{{main|Citizenship of the European Union#Loss of EU citizenship due to member state withdrawal}}

[[Citizenship of the European Union]] is dependent on citizenship (nationality) of a member state, and citizenship remains a competence entirely vested with the member states. Citizenship of the EU can therefore only be acquired or lost by the acquisition or loss of citizenship of a member state. A probable but untested consequence of a country withdrawing from the EU is that, without otherwise negotiated and then legally implemented, its citizens are no longer citizens of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilecproject.eu/sites/default/files/GUIDELINES%20INVOLUNTARY%20LOSS%20OF%20EUROPEAN%20CITIZENSHIP%20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; But the automatic loss of EU citizenship as a result of a member state withdrawing from the EU is the subject of debate.&lt;ref name="ir.lawnet.fordham.edu"&gt;http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2324&amp;context=ilj&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expulsion==
{{main|Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union}}
While a state can leave, there is no provision for a state to be expelled. But [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 7|TEU Article 7]] provides for the suspension of certain rights of a member state if a member persistently breaches the EU's founding values.

[[File:"Unity" - NARA - 558865.jpg|thumb|Unification is a key cornerstone of womanist ideology.]]

'''Womanism''' is a social theory based on the history and everyday experiences of [[women of color]]. It seeks, according to womanist scholar Layli Maparyan (Phillips), to "restore the balance between people and the environment/nature and reconcil[e] human life with the spiritual dimension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Layli |editor1-last=Phillips |editor1-first=Layli |title=The Womanist Reader |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York and Abingdon |pages=xix–liv (xx) |chapter=Introduction. Womanism: On Its Own|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer [[Alice Walker]] coined the term ''womanist'' in a short story, "Coming ----Apart", #7 35527432

==Theory==
Womanist theory, while diverse, holds at its core that both femininity and culture are equally important to the woman's existence. In this conception one's femininity cannot be stripped from the culture within which it exists.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Layli|title=The Womanist Reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first glance, this seems similar to the thought process of third wave feminism, which embraced the concept of intersectionality. The difference lies in the valuation placed on intersectionality within the theoretical frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Kalenda|title=Womanism Literature, and the transformation of the Black community|date=1965–1980|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Womanism espouses the idea that the culture of the woman, which in this case is the focal point of intersection as opposed to class or some other characteristic, is not an element of her femininity, but rather is the lens through which femininity exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillman|first1=L|title=Unassimilable feminisms: reappraising feminist, womanist, and mestiza identity politics|date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a woman's Blackness is not a component of her feminism; instead, her Blackness is the lens through which she understands her femininity.

In discussing womanist theory, one must acknowledge the racism that was perceived by black women in the feminist movement. This perception fuels two different conceptions of womanism's relationship with feminism. Some womanists believe that the experience of Black women will not be validated by feminists to be equal to the experience of White women because of the problematic way in which some feminists treated blackness throughout history.&lt;ref name="The Afrocentric Paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mazama|first1=Ama|title=The Afrocentric Paradigm|date=2003|publisher=Africa World Press|location=Trenton}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they do not see womanism as an extension of feminism, but rather as a theoretical framework which exists independent of feminist theory. This is a move from the thought of Black feminists who have carved their own space in feminism through academia and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James, Joy|title=The Black feminist reader|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0631210078|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all womanists hold this view of feminism. The chronological first conception of womanism can be captured through Alice Walker's quotation "womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Alice|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose|date=2005|orig-year=1983|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=9780753819609|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this description, the theories are intimately tied, with womanism as the broad umbrella under which feminism falls.

==Theoretical origins==
===Alice Walker===
Author and poet [[Alice Walker]] first used the term "womanist" in her short story, "Coming Apart", in 1979,{{sfn|Phillips|2006|p=xix}} and later in'' [[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|In Search of our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose]]'' (1983). Walker defined a "womanist" as a "black feminist or feminist of color. From the black folk expression of mothers to female children, 'You acting womanish'", referring to grown-up behavior.{{sfn|Walker|2005|p=xi}}&lt;ref name="the challenge of blackness"&gt;''The Black Scholar'', Vol. 26, No. 1, ''The Challenge of Blackness'' (Winter/Spring 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The womanish girl exhibits willful, courageous, and outrageous behavior that is considered to be beyond the scope of societal norms. She goes on to say that a womanist is also:

{{quote|A woman who loves other women, sexually and/or nonsexually. Appreciates and prefers women's culture, women's emotional flexibility&amp;nbsp;... and women's strength. ... Committed to survival and wholeness of entire people, male ''and'' female. Not a separatist, except periodically, for health&amp;nbsp;... Loves music. Loves dance. Loves the moon. ''Loves'' the Spirit&amp;nbsp;... Loves struggle. ''Loves'' the folk. Loves herself. ''Regardless''. Womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender.{{sfn|Walker|2005|p=xii}}}}

According to Walker, while feminism is incorporated into womanism, it is also instinctively pro-humankind; womanism is a deeper subset of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayat|first1=Fatema|title=What is a Womanist?|url=https://progressivepupil.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/what-is-a-womanist/|website=Progressive Pupil|publisher=Progressive Pupil|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the theology is not on [[gender inequality]], but race and class-based oppression.&lt;ref name="maparyan"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Womanist Idea|last=Maparyan|first=Layli|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2012|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sees womanism as a theory/movement for the survival of the black race; a theory that takes into consideration the experiences of black women, black culture, black myths, spiritual life, and orality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ANIH|first1=UCHENNA BETHRAND|title=A Womanist Reading of Douceurs du bercail by Aminata Sow Fall|journal=Matatu: Journal for African Culture &amp; Society|issue= 41|pages=105–124|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker's much cited phrase, "womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender", suggests that feminism is a component beneath the much larger ideological umbrella of womanism.&lt;ref name= "the challenge of blackness"/&gt; Walker's definition also holds that womanists are [[Universalism|universalists]]. This philosophy is further invoked by her metaphor of a garden where are all flowers bloom equally. A womanist is committed to the survival of both [[male]]s and [[female]]s and desires a world where men and women can coexist, while maintaining their cultural distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="the challenge of blackness"/&gt; This inclusion of men provides Black women with an opportunity to address gender oppression without directly attacking men.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Patricia|title=What's In a Time: Womanism, Black Feminism, and Beyond|journal=The Black Scholar|year=1996|volume=26|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third definition provided by Walker pertains to the sexuality of the women portrayed in her review of "Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson". Here, she argues that the best term to describe Rebecca Jackson, a black Shaker who leaves her husband and goes on to live with her white Shaker companion, would be a womanist, because it is a word that affirms the connection to the world, regardless of sexuality.&lt;ref name="maparyan"/&gt; The seemingly contrasting interpretations of womanism given by Walker validates the experiences of African-American women, while promoting a visionary perspective for the world based on said experiences.&lt;ref name= "the challenge of blackness" /&gt;

The short story "[[Everyday Use]]" by Alice Walker illustrates the voice of a black rural middle class woman through the relationship that a black woman shares with her two daughters Dee and Maggie.&lt;ref name="Walker, Use"&gt;Walker, "Everyday Use".&lt;/ref&gt; Dee is spoiled and believes that her education and experiences make her better than her mother and her sister. On the other hand, Maggie envies her sister for her the beauty and arrogance that always gets her what she wants.&lt;ref name="Walker, Use"/&gt; Historically, it has been very common for people of color to have their stories told by Caucasians. However, Walker attempts to break this tradition by having a black rural middle class woman tell the story of her relationships with her two daughters. An important part of the story occurs when the mother in "Everyday Use" states, "You've no doubt seen those TV shows where the child who has "made it" is confronted, as a surprise, by her own mother and father, tottering in weakly from backstage… Sometimes I dream a dream in which Dee and I are suddenly brought together on a TV program of this sort…".&lt;ref name="Walker, Use"/&gt; Here the mother reminisces about a family experience that she has witnessed on television that she wishes she could have for herself. A heart-warming scene similar to the one that the mother witnessed on television does not take place when her daughter Dee comes to visit. Instead when Dee comes to visit the mother a rough, awkward tension-filled encounter slowly unfolds. Walker employs this story and its context to illustrate that a majority of womanism is characterized by black women telling their stories.

Much of Alice Walker's progeny admits that while she is the creator of the term, Walker fails to consistently define the term and often contradicts herself.&lt;ref name="Critical Essays on Alice Walker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dieke|first1=Ikenna|title=Critical Essays on Alice Walker|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some points she portrays womanism as a more inclusive revision of Black feminism as it is not limited to Black women and focuses on the woman as a whole. Later in life she begins to regret this peace seeking and inclusive form of womanism due to the constant and consistent prejudice inflicted upon Black women, specifically, whose voices had yet to be validated by both White women and Black men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winchell|first1=Donna Haisty|title=Alice Walker|date=1992|publisher=Twayne|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clenora Hudson-Weems===
[[Clenora Hudson-Weems]] is credited with coining the term [[Africana womanism]]. In 1995, the publication of her book, ''Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves'' sent shock waves through the Black nationalism community and established her as an independent thinker.&lt;ref name= "Alexander-Floyd and Simien"&gt;Nikol G. Alexander-Floyd and Evelyn M. Simien. ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 1 (2006), pp. 67-89. {{jstor|4137413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson-Weems rejects feminism as the theology of [[Africana studies|Africana]] women, that is to say women of the [[African diaspora]], because it is philosophically rooted in Eurocentric ideals.&lt;ref name="maparyan"/&gt; She further asserts that it is impossible to incorporate the cultural perspectives of African women into the feminism ideal due to the history of slavery and [[racism in America]]. Furthermore, Weems rejects feminism's characterization of the man as the enemy. She claims that this does not connect with Africana women as they do not see Africana men as the enemy. Instead the enemy is the oppressive force that subjugates the Africana man, woman, and child.&lt;ref name="The Afrocentric Paradigm"/&gt;  She claims that feminism's masculine-feminine binary comes from a lack of additional hardship placed on women by their circumstances (i.e. race and socio-economic) as feminism was founded to appeal to upper-class White women.&lt;ref name="The Afrocentric Paradigm"/&gt;

She also distances the Africana woman from Black feminism by demarcating the latter as distinctly African-American which is in turn distinctly western.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubbard|first1=LaRese|title=Anna Julia Cooper and Africana Womanism: Some Early Conceptual Contributions|journal=Black Women, Gender &amp; Families|date=2010|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also critiques Black feminism as a subset of feminism needing the validation of White feminists for their voices to be heard. She claims that feminism will never truly accept Black feminists, but instead relegate them to the fringes of the feminist movement. She ultimately claims that the matriarchs of the Black feminist movement will never be put into the same conversation as the matriarchs of the feminist movement.  A large part of her work mirrors separatist Black Nationalist discourse, because of the focus on the collective rather than the individual as the forefront of her ideology. Hudson-Weems refutes Africana womanism as an addendum to feminism, and asserts that her ideology differs from Black feminism, Walker's womanism, and African womanism.&lt;ref name="Womanist Reader Review"&gt;Russo, Stacy. "The Womanist Reader by Layli Phillips" (review), ''Feminist Teacher'', 2009: 243-45. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi===
[[Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi]] is a Nigerian literary critic. In 1985, she published the article "Womanism: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Black Female Novel in English", and described her interpretation of womanism. She asserts that the womanist vision is to answer the ultimate question of how to equitably share power among the races and between the sexes.&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;Phillips, L. (2006). ''The Womanist Reader'', New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived at her interpretation of the term independently of Alice Walker's definition, yet there are several overlaps between the two ideologies. Rather than citing gender inequality as the source of Black oppression, Ogunyemi takes a separatist stance much like Hudson-Weems, and dismisses the possibility of reconciliation of white feminists and black feminists on the grounds of the intractability of racism.&lt;ref name="maparyan"/&gt; She uses a few examples of how feminists write about Blackness and African Blackness specifically to make salient the need for an African conception of womanism. These critiques include the use of Blackness as a tool to forward feminist ideals without also forwarding ideals related to blackness, the thought that western feminism is a tool which would work in African nations without acknowledging cultural norms and differences, and a co-opting of things that African women have been done for centuries before the western notion of feminism into western feminism.&lt;ref name="palava"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ogunyemi|first1=Chikwenye Okonjo|title=Africa wo/man palava:the nigerian novel by woman|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important to note that Ogunyemi finds her conception of womanism's relationship with men at the cross roads of Walker's and Hudson Weems' conceptions. Walker's expresses a communal opportunity for men while acknowledging how they can be dangerous to the womanist community.&lt;ref name="Critical Essays on Alice Walker"/&gt; While Hudson-Weems' conception refuses to see the Africana man as an enemy, disregarding the harm that Africana men have imparted on to the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=N|title=Theorizing female agency and empowerment through black women's literary writings (Clenora Hudson-Weems, Bettina Weiss)|journal=Research In African Literatures|volume=39|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- (Commenting out this sentence because it makes no sense as written. If you can clarify it, please do so. Thanks.) Ogunyemi ultimately says that these need to be combined where African men are uplifted in the community to have womanist thought, however are positioned in the community so as to not able to assert themselves in mediums that they do not know of&lt;ref name="palava"/&gt;--&gt;

==Ideologies==
Womanism has various definitions and interpretations. At its broadest definition, it is a universalist ideology for all women, regardless of color. A womanist is, according to Walker's 1979 story ''Coming Apart'', an African-American heterosexual woman willing to utilize wisdom from African-American lesbians about how to improve sexual relationships and avoid being sexually objectified.  In the context of men's destructive use of pornography and their exploitation of Black women as pornographic objects, a womanist is also committed to "the survival and wholeness of an entire people, male and female"&lt;ref name="Hogan, Linda 1995"&gt;Hogan, L. (1995), ''From Women's Experience to [[Feminist Theology]]'', Sheffield, England: Sheffield Academic Press,1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; through confronting oppressive forces. Walker's much cited phrase, "womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender" suggests that Walker considers feminism as a component of the wider ideological umbrella of womanism.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt; It focuses on the unique experiences, struggles, needs, and desires of not just Black women, but all women of color in addition to critically addressing the dynamics of the conflict between the mainstream feminist, the Black feminist, the African feminist, and the Africana womanist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Deborah|title=Womanist, Womanism, Womanish|url=http://gem.greenwood.com/wse/wsePrint.jsp?id=id689|work=Women's Studies Encyclopedia|publisher=Greenwood Press|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is Black nationalist discourse prevalent within womanist work and for this reason scholars are divided between associating womanism with other similar ideologies such as [[Black feminism]] and [[Africana womanism]] or taking the stance that the three are inherently incompatible.&lt;ref name=" Alexander-Floyd and Simien"/&gt;

===Black feminism===
{{Main|Black feminism}}
The [[Black feminism|Black feminist]] movement was formed in response to the needs of women who were racially underrepresented by the Women's Movement and sexually oppressed by the [[Black Liberation Army|Black Liberation Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=But Some of Us Are Brave: A History of Black Feminism In the United States|journal=The Thistle|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black feminist scholars assert that African-American women are doubly disadvantaged in the social, economic, and political sphere, because they face discrimination on the basis of both race and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Simien, E. (2004). "Gender differences in attitudes toward Black feminism among African Americans", ''Political Science Quarterly'', 119(2), 315-338. Retrieved November 20, 2013, from the JSTOR database.&lt;/ref&gt; Black women felt that their needs were being ignored by both movements and they struggled to identify with either based on race or gender. African-American women who use the term Black feminism attach a variety of interpretations to it.&lt;ref&gt;''Off Our Backs'', Vol. 3, No. 10 (September 1973), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; One such interpretation is that Black feminism addresses the needs of African-American women that the feminism movement largely ignores. Feminism, as Black feminist theorist Pearl Cleage defines it, is "the belief that women are full human beings capable of participation and leadership in the full range of human activities—intellectual, political, social, sexual, spiritual, and economic".&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt; With this definition, the feminist agenda can be said to encompass different issues ranging from political rights to educational opportunities within a global context.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt; The Black feminist agenda seeks to streamline these issues and focuses on those that are the most applicable to African-American women.

===Africana womanism===
Clenora Hudson-Weems's [[Africana womanism]] arose from a nationalist [[Africana studies]] concept. In ''Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves'', Hudson-Weems explores the limitations of feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Dove, N. (1998), "African Womanism: An Afrocentric Theory", ''Journal of Black Studies'', 28(5), 515-539.&lt;/ref&gt; At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is set up in a way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be okay for black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice.&lt;ref name="maparyan"/&gt; She further asserts that the relationship between a [[Black man]] and a [[Black woman]] is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man.&lt;ref name="maparyan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, R., M. Keaveny, &amp; V. Patton (2002). "'Come Colour My Rainbow': Themes of Africana Womanism in the Poetic Vision of Audrey Kathryn Bullett". ''Journal of Black Studies'', 32(4), 464-466. Retrieved October 20, 2013, from the JSTOR database.&lt;/ref&gt; She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to the black experience. Unlike womanism,&lt;ref name="Alexander-Floyd and Simien"/&gt; Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.&lt;ref name="maparyan"/&gt;

==Womanist identity==
In her introduction to ''The Womanist Reader'', Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its main concern is not the black woman per se but rather the black woman is the point of origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. "Purple is to Lavender" illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss.&lt;ref name="Jain &amp; Turner 67-83"&gt;Jain &amp; Turner, pp. 67-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In "Purple is to Lavender", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty.&lt;ref name="Jain &amp; Turner 67-83"/&gt; They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities.&lt;ref name="Jain &amp; Turner 67-83"/&gt; Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino (Jain &amp; Turner, pp.&amp;nbsp;67–70). They go on to describe the concept of "The Politics of Naming" which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism (Jain &amp; Turner, pp.&amp;nbsp;73–75). Jain states: "I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a foreign substance that I was being forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride" (Jain &amp; Turner, p.&amp;nbsp;68). Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels like she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, "The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level" (Jain &amp; Turner, p.&amp;nbsp;73). This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: "I don't choose womanism because it is "better" than feminism ... I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it… because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see" (quoted in Jain &amp; Turner, pp.&amp;nbsp;77–78).

For a majority of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals to the world that surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism it is important to remember that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuruta, D. (2012), "The Womanish Roots of Womanism: A Culturally-Derived and African-Centered Ideal(Concept)", ''The Western Journal of Black Studies'', 36(1), 4. Retrieved November 20, 2013, from the EHIS database.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and activism===
Womanist literature and activism are two areas that are largely interpolated, with each having a considerable effect on the other. A major tenet of womanist literature and activism is the idea that Black activists and Black authors should separate themselves from the feminist ideology. This stems from assertions by Kalenda Eaton, Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, and numerous other womanist theologians that the goal of a womanist should be to promote the issues affecting not just Black women, but black men and other groups that have been subjected to discrimination or impotence.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, M. L. (2010). "Introduction". ''Gifts of virtue, Alice Walker, and womanist ethics'' (p. 2). New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, a white woman writer may be a feminist, but a black woman writer is likely to be a womanist. That is, she recognizes that along with battling for sexual equality, she must also incorporate race, economics, culture, and politics within her philosophy.&lt;ref name="Smorol"&gt;Sarah Smorol, ''Rocky Mountain Review'', Vol. 63, No. 1 (Spring, 2009), pp. 133-134.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kalenda Eaton's, ''Womanism, Literature and the Black Community'', black women writers are portrayed as both activists and visionaries for change in the Black Community following the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. She interweaves the historical events of African-American history with the development of Afro-Politico womanism in a bid to create a haven for Black female [[activism]] within the black community.&lt;ref name="Smorol"/&gt; This Afro-Politico womanism veers from the traditional feminist goal of gender equality within a group and rather seeks to fight for the men and women whose [[civil rights]] are infringed upon. While Eaton takes the stance that Black women were largely excluded from the more prominent positions within the Black Movement, she argues that black women activists had the greatest effect in small-scale grassroots protests within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, K. (2004). [https://etd.ohiolink.edu/ "Talkin' Bout a Revolution: Afro-Politico Womanism and the Ideological Transformation of the Black Community, 1965-1980"] (electronic thesis or dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; Using various characters from [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'', Alice Walker's ''[[Meridian (novel)|Meridian]]'', [[Toni Cade Bambara]]'s ''[[The Salt Eaters]]'', and [[Paule Marshall]]'s ''[[The Chosen Place, the Timeless People]]'' as symbols of the various political agendas and issues that were prevalent within The Black Movement, Eaton draws upon the actions of the protagonists to illustrate solutions to the problems of disgruntlement and disorganization within the movement.  Often the main task of these literary activists was to empower the impoverished masses—defined by Eaton as mainly Southern African-Americans, and they used the black middle class as a model for the possibility of social mobility within the African-American community.&lt;ref name="Smorol"/&gt; A common theme within womanist literature is the failure of Black women writers to identify with feminist thought. Womanism becomes the concept that binds these novelists together.

===Spirituality===
Spirituality concerns the desire for a connection with the sacred, the unseen, the superhuman, or the nonexistent.&lt;ref name="maparyan"/&gt; [[Patricia Hill Collins]] offers this definition:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Spirituality is not merely a system of religious beliefs similar to logical systems of ideas. Rather, spirituality comprises articles of faith that provide a conceptual framework for living everyday life&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereby religion is an institutional mechanism, spirituality is a personal one. Unlike religion, spirituality cannot be abandoned or switched. It is an integral component of one's consciousness.&lt;ref name= "maparyan"/&gt; Womanist spirituality has six identifying characteristics—it is eclectic, synthetic, holistic, personal, visionary, and pragmatic. It draws from its resources and uses the summation of said resources to create a whole from multiple parts. Although it is ultimately defined by self, it envisions the larger picture and exists to solve problems and end injustice.&lt;ref name="maparyan"/&gt; Emilie Townes, a womanist theologian, further asserts that womanist spirituality grows out of individual and communal reflection on African American faith and life. She explains that it is not grounded in the notion that spirituality is a force but rather a practice separate from who we are moment by moment.&lt;ref&gt;Townes, E. M. (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;" In a blaze of glory: womanist spirituality as social witness. Nashville: Abingdon Press. One of the main characteristics of womanism is its religious aspect, commonly thought of as Christian. This connotation paints the picture of spiritual black womanists being "church going" women that play a vital role in the operation of the church. In William's article "Womanist Spirituality Defined" she discusses how womanist spirituality is directly connected to an individual's experiences with God.&lt;ref name="Williams 97"&gt;Williams 97.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Williams declares, "the use of the term spirituality in this paper speaks of the everyday experiences of life and the way in which we relate to and interpret God at work in those experiences".&lt;ref name="Williams 97"/&gt; However, this connotation is disputed in [[Monica Coleman]]'s Roundtable Discussion: "Must I Be a Womanist?" where she focuses on the shortcomings of womanism that result from how individuals have historically described womanism.&lt;ref name="Coleman 85-98"&gt;Coleman, Monica A., [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_feminist_studies_in_religion/v022/22.1coleman.html "Must I Be A Womanist?"], ''Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion'', Volume 22, Number 1, Spring 2006 (85–136), pp. 85–98.&lt;/ref&gt; This holistic discussion of womanism is the result of a roundtable discussion. Coleman, who initiated the discussion, describes her thoughts on why she prefers black feminism as opposed to womanism, and she also discusses the limited scope that womanist religious scholarship embodies.&lt;ref name="Coleman 85-98"/&gt; Coleman offers deep insight into the spiritual aspect of womanism when she declares that, "Intentionally or not, womanists have created a Christian hegemonic discourse within the field".&lt;ref name="Coleman 89"&gt;Coleman, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Coleman explains that the majority of womanists have painted the spiritual aspect of womanism to be spiritual in terms of Christianity. A specific example of this occurs in Walker's "Everyday Use", in the instance when the mother suddenly gains the courage to take a stand against her spoiled daughter as she declares, "When I looked at her like that something hit me in the top of my head and ran down to the soles of my feet. Just like when I'm in church and the spirit of God touches me and I get happy and shout".&lt;ref name="Walker, Use"/&gt; This could be categorized as an example of the spiritual aspect of womanism because of the mention of relation to the Christian God. However, Coleman provides a counter example to this assumption when she states: "How, for example, might a womanist interpret the strength Tina Turner finds in Buddhism and the role her faith played in helping her to leave a violent relationship?"&lt;ref name="Coleman 89"/&gt; Here Coleman pokes a hole in the pre-conceived notions of womanist scholarship. Coleman believes that the notorious sector of spirituality that womanism is most known for referring to is limited in its scope. Womanist religious scholarship has the ability to spread across a variety of paradigms and represent and support radical womanist spirituality. Considering womanism as a whole, it is also important to understand how it relates to feminism.

===Ethics===
Womanist ethics is a religious discipline that examines the ethical theories concerning human agency, action, and relationship. At the same time, it rejects social constructions that have neglected the existence of a group of women that have bared the brunt of injustice and oppression.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; Its perspective is shaped by the theological experiences of African-American women.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; With the use of analytic tools, the effect of race, class, gender, and sexuality on the individual and communal perspective is examined. Womanist ethic provides an alternative to Christian and other religious ethics while utilizing the elements of critique, description, and construction to assess the power imbalance and patriarchy that has been used to oppress women of color and their communities. The publication of Katie Cannon's ''The Emergence of Black Feminist Consciousness'' was the first to directly speak on womanist ethics. In this article, Cannon argues that the perspectives of Black women are largely ignored in various religious and academic discourses. [[Jacquelyn Grant]] expands on this point by asserting that Black women concurrently experience the three oppressive forces of racism, sexism, and classism.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; Black feminist theory has been used by womanist ethics to explain the lack of participation of African-American women and men in academic discourse. [[Patricia Hill Collins|Patricia Collins]], credits this phenomenon to prevalence of white men determining what should or should not be considered valid discourse and urges for an alternative mode of producing knowledge that includes the core themes of Black female consciousness.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

==Critiques==
A major ongoing critique about womanist scholarship is the failure of many scholars to critically address homosexuality within the black community.  Walker's protagonist in ''Coming Apart'' uses writings from two African-American lesbians, [[Audre Lorde]] and [[Luisah Teish|Louisah Teish]], to support her argument that her husband should stop consuming pornography. She posts quotes from Audre Lorde above her kitchen sink. ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|In Search of Our Mother's Garden]]'' states that a womanist is "a woman who loves another woman, sexually and/or non-sexually", yet despite ''Coming Apart'' and ''In Search of Our Mother's Garden'', there is very little literature linking womanism to the lesbian and bisexual issue.  Womanist theologian Renee Hill cites Christian influences as the cause of the lack of sympathy towards [[heterosexism]] and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Black feminist critic [[Barbara Smith]] blames it on the Black community's reluctance to come to terms with homosexuality.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;  On the other hand, there is an increase in the criticism of heterosexism within womanist scholarship. Christian womanist theologian Pamela R. Lightsey, in her book ''Our Lives Matter: A Womanist Queer Theology'' (2015), writes, "To many people, we are still ''perverts''.  To many, the Black pervert is the most dangerous threat to the American ideal.  Because the Black conservative bourgeoisie has joined the attack on our personhood, Black LGBTQ persons cannot allow the discourse to be controlled such that our existence within the Black community is denied or made invisible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Our Lives Matter|last = Lightsey|first = Pamela|publisher = Pickwick Publications|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4982-0664-8|location = |pages = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional critique lies within the ambivalence of womanism. In Africana womanism and African womanism, the term is associated with black nationalist discourse and the separatist movement. [[Patricia Hill Collins|Patricia Collins]] argues that this exaggerates racial differences by promoting homogeneous identity. This is a sharp contrast to the universalist model of womanism that is championed by Walker. The continued controversy and dissidence within the various ideologies of womanism serves only to draw attention away from the goal of ending race and gender-based oppression.&lt;ref name="Alexander-Floyd and Simien"/&gt;

The '''World Policy Conference (WPC)''' is an independent organization&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2015/11/22/923633/iranian-diplomat-in-switzerland-for-world-policy-conference|title=Tasnim News Agency - Iranian Diplomat in Switzerland for World Policy Conference|website=Tasnim News Agency|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose aim is to contribute to improving all aspects of [[governance]], with a view to promoting a world that is more open, prosperous, fairer and more respectful of the diversity of States and nations. It was launched in 2008, by [[Thierry de Montbrial]], President and Founder of the [[Institut français des relations internationales|French Institute of International Relations (''Ifri'')]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/patrick/2011/12/12/nuggets-from-the-world-policy-conference/|title=The Internationalist » Nuggets from the World Policy Conference|website=Council on Foreign Relations - The Internationalist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This annual conference revolves around debates gathering economic and political leaders, [[diplomat]]s, representatives of [[civil society]], experts and [[journalist]]s from all over the world. It aims at reflecting, debating, and offering constructive solutions to major regional and international issues, in an atmosphere of respect and tolerance.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iman-worldwide.org/newsroom/our-news/ribal-alassad-attends-the-world-policy-conference-in-montreux-switzerland|title=The Iman Foundation|website=www.iman-worldwide.org|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the World Policy Conference ranked 3rd best Think Tank Conference according to The Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP) at the Lauder Institute, [[University of Pennsylvania]] '2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report'.

== History ==
Launched in 2008 by [[Thierry de Montbrial]], the President and Founder of the [[Institut français des relations internationales|French Institute of International Relations (''Ifri'')]], the World Policy Conference (WPC) is the first effort to foster systematic reflection on organizing [[global governance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/presidents-and-chiefs-of-state/view-obama-administration/p35216|title=The View from the Obama Administration|website=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; tailored to 21st century realities, bringing together the highest-level decision-makers, experts and opinion leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/monde-trois-raisons-inquieter-world-policy-conference-jean-marc-sylvestre-926210.html|title=Le monde a trois raisons de s'inquiéter|website=Atlantico.fr|language=french|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the conference took place in [[Évian-les-Bains|Evian]] ([[France]]), from October 6–8, 2008.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/first-world-policy-conference-meets-in-evian/|title=First World Policy Conference meets in Evian|website=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The foundations of the WPC ==
The World Policy Conference (WPC) was founded on three complementary ideas:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=DIPLOMATIC MEMO; Europe Still Likes Obama, But Doubts Creep In|last=Erlanger|first=Steven|date=2009-11-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Policy Conference|last=|first=|publisher=World Policy Conference|year=2014|isbn=978-2-36567-274-0|location=https://www.worldpolicyconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WPC_interieur_ANG.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Striving for an effective global governance|last=|first=|publisher=World Policy Conference|year=2011|isbn=|location=https://www.worldpolicyconference.com/wpc_compendium/index.html|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- the nature of [[Globalization|globalisation]]

The World Policy Conference falls within a context where [[Globalization|globalisation]] and interconnections between countries have never been stronger, whether it is on a political, economic or environmental level. During its first edition in 2008, the conference has addressed the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|subprime crisis]], which had just broken out in the [[United States]] and has spared no continents since then.

- [[International relations]] are still centered on relations between states

Despite phenomena of [[Globalization|globalisation]], the world is still organized around political entities, States. They are characterized by a territory, a population and a government. They also share common culture, values, institutions, and have delimited borders.

- The construction of the new international system – or rather of its [[governance]] – is not just a matter for states

In order to ensure good [[global governance]], states must reform and cooperate. However, they cannot be the only ones to work to that end. [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[think tank]]s, including the [[Institut français des relations internationales|French Institute of International Relations ''(Ifri)'']], have to take part in this process as well. Each member should be able to express his point of view and influence the choices made via a proper decision-making process. Finally, global institutions ([[United Nations|UN]]), as well as regional ([[African Union]], [[Arab League]]) and specialized institutions ([[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[World Bank]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[World Health Organization]]) have to adjust to the new global order and find adequate solutions.

== A centre of influence, thinking and debate ==
The three meeting formats – namely, the plenary sessions,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; workshops and lunch or dinner debates – are based on the concept of constructive public-private interaction at the highest level. During plenary sessions, each speaker has an exclusive and equal right to the floor, regardless of his home country’s status on the world stage.

== An informal meeting-place ==
Each participant is individually chosen on the basis of a range of criteria, such as regional, functional and media-related factors. The number of participants at each conference remains limited to ensure that meetings are as productive as possible. On this basis and in a warm and welcoming setting, all the conditions are met for participants to speak their mind freely, thereby creating a very high-level yet informal meeting-place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Conference follow-up ==
As the conference proceedings are intended to fuel public debate, they are largely “on the record” and widely disseminated.

=== Print publications ===
A report is published after each WPC conference. This report contains the most noteworthy excerpts from the presentations and the profiles of all the participants, as well as a description of all the WPC’s partners. Each conference’s highlights are illustrated with a large number of images. Thousands of copies of this bilingual (French-English) publication are distributed worldwide every year. The report can also be downloaded in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format from the WPC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldpolicyconference.com/2015-publications/|title=World Policy Conference  » 2015 Publications|website=www.worldpolicyconference.com|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital media ===
The WPC website provides access not only to all past conferences but also to the latest information on the forthcoming conference.

• WPC TV: WPC TV provides access to interviews with and statements by the participants in the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicyconferencetv.com/|title=World Policy Conference TV|website=World Policy Conference TV Official|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

• Conference proceedings: The proceedings of each conference are published online, with all presentations entirely available in video and text formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldpolicyconference.com/2015-conference-proceedings/|title=World Policy Conference  » 2015 Conference proceedings|website=www.worldpolicyconference.com|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Social networking service|Social networks]] and sharing ===
The WPC can be followed on [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Pearltrees]] and [[Pinterest]]. Moreover, the whole intellectual content of the event is saved in video format and is available on [[YouTube]].

== Guests ==
Each year, the World Policy Conference gathers political, economic and social leaders: [[Head of state|Heads of States]] and governments, [[minister (government)|ministers]], members of parliaments, [[ambassador]]s, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], experts, [[journalist]]s and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs’]] members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
