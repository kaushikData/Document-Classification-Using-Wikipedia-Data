      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14390">When a work's [[copyright]] expires, it enters the '''[[public domain]]'''. The following is a '''list of works that enter the public domain in 2017'''. Since laws [[List of countries' copyright lengths|vary globally]], the copyright status of some works are not uniform.

==Entering the public domain in countries with life + 70 years==
With the exception of [[Belarus]], a work enters the [[public domain]] in Europe 70 years after the creator's death, if it was published during the creator's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/publishing/eu-extends-copyright-term-to-70-years-1005348552.story |title=EU Extends Copyright Term To 70 Years &amp;#124; Billboard |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0116:EN:NOT Directive 2006/116/EC]&lt;/ref&gt; The list is sorted alphabetically and includes a notable work of the creator that entered the public domain on January 1, 2017. This term also applies to unpublished works in the United States (otherwise see below).

==Entering the public domain in Australia==
{{See also|Copyright law of Australia}}

In 2004 copyright in Australia changed from a "plus 50" law to a "plus 70" law, in line with America and the European Union. But the change was not made retroactive (unlike the 1995 change in the European Union which brought some e.g. British authors back into copyright). Hence the work of an author who died before 1955 is normally in the public domain in Australia; but the copyright of authors was extended to 70 years after death for those who died in 1955 or later, and no more Australian authors will come out of copyright until 1 January 2026 (those who died in 1955).

==Entering the public domain in the United States==
{{See also|Public domain in the United States}}

The [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] means no published works will enter the public domain in this jurisdiction until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Copyright and the Public Domain |publisher=Public Domain Information Project |url=http://www.pdinfo.com/Copyright-Law/Copyright-Law.php |accessdate=2015-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801121535/http://www.pdinfo.com/Copyright-Law/Copyright-Law.php |archive-date=2014-08-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception are unpublished works, which are subject to 70 years after the death of the creator, as above.

The '''American Society for the Judicial Settlement of International Disputes''' was organized in [[Baltimore]] 6 February 1910, at the residence of [[Theodore Marburg]].&lt;ref&gt;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/02/07/104920172.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The organization aimed for not only the creation of a permanent [[tribunal]] for the [[Justice|judicial]] settlement of international conflicts, but also wanted to create the sentiment that the international controversies should be resolved by a permanent international court.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2186808 The American Society for the Judicial Settlement of International Disputes]" (Oct. 1910) ''The American Journal of International Law'' Vol. 4, No. 4. p 930&lt;/ref&gt; The Society was the forerunner of the [[League to Enforce Peace]], which developed into the [[League of Nations]] concept and ultimately into the [[United Nations]].

The Society planned to establish a permanent tribunal at the [[Hague]].

[[William Howard Taft]] was its first president. Theodore Marburg was its president from 1913 to 1916.

== History ==

=== Early development ===
In 1994, [[Robin Li]] (Li Yanhong, 李彦宏) joined IDD Information Services, a [[New Jersey]] division of [[Dow Jones and Company]], where he helped develop software for the online edition of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/bizfocus/archives/2006/09/17/2003328060 Robin Li's vision powers Baidu's Internet search dominance]", ''[[Taipei Times]]'', September 17i, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked on developing better algorithms for search engines and remained at IDD Information Services from May 1994 to June 1997.

In 1996, while at IDD, Li developed the RankDex site-scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Andy, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/1005/technology-baidu-robin-li-man-whos-beating-google.html "The Man Who's Beating Google"], ''Forbes'' magazine, October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yanhong Li, "Toward a Qualitative Search Engine," ''IEEE Internet Computing'', vol. 2, no. 4, pp. 24–29, July/Aug. 1998, {{DOI|10.1109/4236.707687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rankdex.com/about.html "About: RankDex"], ''rankdex.com''&lt;/ref&gt; and received a US patent for the technology.&lt;ref&gt;USPTO,
[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT5920859&amp;id=x04ZAAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=yanhong+li&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=yanhong%20li&amp;f=false "Hypertext Document Retrieval System and Method"], US Patent number: 5920859, Inventor: Yanhong Li, Filing date: Feb 5, 1997, Issue date: Jul 6, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He later used this technology for the Baidu search engine.

In 2000, the company Baidu launched in [[Beijing]], China. The first office was located in a hotel room, which was near [[Peking University]] from where Robin graduated.

In 2003, Baidu launched a news search engine and picture search engine, adopting a special identification technology capable of identifying and grouping the articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/436093/article-1G1-105619810/baidu-launched-news-search-engine-and-pictures-search| title=Baidu Launched News Search Engine and Pictures Search Engine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domain name redirection attack ===
On January 12, 2010, Baidu.com's DNS records in the United States were altered such that browsers to baidu.com were redirected to a website purporting to be the [[Iranian Cyber Army]], thought to be behind the attack on [[Twitter]] during the [[2009 Iranian election protests]], making the proper site unusable for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baidu hacked by 'Iranian cyber army' |publisher=BBC News  |date=2010-01-12 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8453718.stm |accessdate=2010-01-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100113052111/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8453718.stm| archivedate= January 13, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet users were met with a page saying "This site has been attacked by [[Iranian Cyber Army]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/6866089.html|title=China's top search engine Baidu hacked|date=January 12, 2010|work=People's Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese hackers later responded by attacking Iranian websites and leaving messages.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/12/iranian-hackers-chinese-search-engine|title='Iranian' hackers paralyse Chinese search engine Baidu|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=January 12, 2010|work=The Guardian |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baidu later launched legal action against [[Register.com]] for gross negligence after it was revealed that Register.com's technical support staff changed the email address for Baidu.com on the request of an unnamed individual, despite failing security verification procedures. Once the address had been changed, the individual was able to use the forgotten password feature to have Baidu's domain passwords sent directly to them, allowing them to accomplish the [[domain hijacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703837004575013742840069602|title=Baidu Sues Register.com, Alleges Negligence in Hacking Attack|first=Aaron|last=Back|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9162118/Baidu_Registrar_incredibly_changed_our_e_mail_for_hacker "Baidu: Registrar 'incredibly' changed our e-mail for hacker," ''Computer World'', February 24, 2010.] Accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baidu workers arrested ===
On August 6, 2012, the [[BBC]] reported that three employees of Baidu were arrested on suspicion that they accepted bribes. The bribes were allegedly paid for deleting posts from the forum service. Four people were fired in connection with these arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19149185 |title=BBC News – Baidu workers arrested for 'deleting posts for money' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-08-06 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 91 Wireless acquisition ===
On July 16, 2013, Baidu announced its intention to purchase [[91 Wireless]] from [[NetDragon]]. 91 Wireless is best known for its app store, but it has been reported that the app store faces piracy and other legal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=BrightWire News |url=http://bw-original-reporting.tumblr.com/post/55606959057/91-wireless-app-store-has-piracy-and-other-legal |title=91 Wireless’ App Store Has Piracy and Other Legal Issues |last=Hsu |first=Alex |date=16 Jul 2013 |access-date=July 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105014542/http://bw-original-reporting.tumblr.com/post/55606959057/91-wireless-app-store-has-piracy-and-other-legal |archive-date=November 5, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, 2013, Baidu announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Baidu (Hong Kong) Limited has signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire 91 Wireless Web-soft Limited from [[NetDragon]] Web-soft Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=188488&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1847426&amp;highlight=  Baidu Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire NetDragon's Subsidiary 91 Wireless],''Baidu Press Releases'', August 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; for 1.85 billion dollars in what was reported to be the biggest deal ever in China's IT sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/14/us-baidu-91wireless-idUSBRE97D0AR20130814| title=Baidu says agrees to buy Netdragon's 91 Wireless for $1.85 billion | author=Paul Carsten | publisher=Reuters | date=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 2013, Baidu launched its Personal Assistant app, designed to help CEOs, managers and the white-collar workers manage their business relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinainternetwatch.com/2718/baidu-personal-assistant-app-android/  Baidu Launch Personal Assistant App for Android Phones],''CHINA INTERNET WATCH'', August 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2014, Baidu appointed [[Andrew Ng|Dr. Andrew Ng]] as chief scientist.

On July 18, 2014, the company launched a Brazilian version of the search engine, ''Baidu Busca''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.techinasia.com/baidu-launches-search-engine-in-brazil/|title= China web giant Baidu launches search engine in Brazil|author= Paul Bischoff|date=2014-07-18|accessdate= 2014-08-04|work= Tech In Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2014, Baidu announced acquisition of Brazilian local e-commerce site Peixe Urbano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/09/us-peixe-urbano-m-a-baidu-idUSKCN0HY1EN20141009|title= China's Baidu buys control of Brazil's Peixe Urbano in expansion push |publisher=Reuters| date=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Baidu announced the launch of its [[Apolong|Apollo project (Apolong)]], a self-driving vehicle platform in a bid to help drive the development of [[autonomous car]]s including vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/baidu-project-apollo/|title=Baidu is making its self-driving car platform freely available to the automotive industry|publisher=TechCrunch|author=Jon Russell|date=18 April 2017|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baidu plans to launch  this project in July this year, before gradually introducing fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baidu-autonomous-idUSKBN17L05K?il=0|title=Baidu to launch self-driving car technology in July|publisher=REUTERS|author=Sangameswaran S|date=19 April 2017|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Baidu partnered with [[Continental AG|Continental]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], auto industry suppliers, on automated driving and connected cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/baidu-teams-up-with-bosch-and-continental-on-self-driving-tech|title=Baidu teams up with Bosch and Continental on self-driving tech|publisher=TechCrunch|author=Darrell Etherington|date=1 June 2017|access-date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Baidu'' (百度) literally means "a hundred times", or alternatively, "countless times". It is a quote from the last line of [[Xin Qiji]] (辛弃疾)'s classical poem "Green Jade Table in The Lantern Festival" (青玉案·元夕) saying: "Having searched '''hundreds of times''' in the crowd, suddenly turning back, he is there in the dimmest candlelight." (众里寻他千'''百度'''，蓦然回首，那人却在灯火阑珊处。)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=188488&amp;p=irol-homeprofile|title=The Baidu Story|publisher=Baidu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] and [[Chinese industry]] sources stated that Baidu received a license from Beijing, which allows the search engine to become a full-fledged news website. Thus Baidu is able to provide its own reports, besides showing certain results as a search engine. Baidu is the first Chinese search engine to receive such a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gadget4boys.com/index.php?page=articles&amp;catid=3&amp;id=20|title=Google's Lookalike is Expanding in China|publisher=Gadget4boys.com|date=January 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baidu locates file formats such as MP3, [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] and [[Macromedia Flash|SWF]]. The multimedia search feature is mainly used in searches for [[Chinese pop music]]. While such works are [[copyright]]ed under [[Chinese law]], Baidu claims on its legal disclaimer that linking to these files does not break Chinese law.

Baidu is creating the content of this encyclopedia largely from participants of its "rural information competition" ({{lang|zh|乡村信息化大赛}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xiangcun.baidu.com/|title=xiangcun.baidu.com|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014183801/http://xiangcun.baidu.com/|archive-date=October 14, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; on which it has spent roughly five million yuan on incentives. Baidu sees China's rural areas as great potential for electronic business ([[e-business]]), evidenced by the fact that revenue grew the fastest from agriculture, forestry, animals, and fishery in the company's keyword promotion project, a crucial source of Baidu's total revenue.  In addition to Baidu Encyclopedia, the company scales up keyword promotion and takes advantage of other products, such as Baidu Zhidao and Baidu Youa, to provide consultation, brand ad exhibitions and online network marketing/sales platform support, marketing information for rural tourism and promoting local products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-internet-china.com/search-engine/china-news/baidu-will-compile-the-rural-digital--encyclopedia.php|title=Baidu will compile the rural digital  Encyclopedia – BIC|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertisements ==

Baidu's primary advertising product is called Baidu Tuiguang and is similar to [[Google Adwords]] and [[Adsense]]. It is a [[pay per click]] advertising platform that allows advertisers to have their ads shown in Baidu search results pages and on other websites that are part of Baidu Union. However, Baidu's search results are also based on payments by advertisers. This has prompted criticism and skepticism among Chinese users, with [[People's Daily|People's daily]] commenting in 2018 on issues regarding reliability of Baidu results. Often as many as the first two pages of search results tend to be paid advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baidu should stop using paid listings|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201805/02/WS5ae8f485a3105cdcf651b696.html|accessdate=2 May 2018|publisher=China Daily|date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pay for placement (P4P) ===
Baidu focuses on generating revenues primarily from [[online marketing]] services. Baidu's [[pay for placement]] (P4P) [[computing platform|platform]] enables its customers to reach users who search for information related to their products or services. Customers use automated online tools to create text-based descriptions of their web pages and bid on [[index term|keywords]] that trigger the display of their webpage information and link. Baidu's P4P platform features an automated online sign-up process that customers use to activate their accounts at any time. The P4P platform is an online marketplace that introduces Internet search users to customers who bid for priority [[favored placement|placement]] in the search results. Baidu also uses third-party distributors to sell some of its online marketing services to end customers and offers discounts to these distributors in consideration of their services.

Baidu offers certain consultative services, such as keyword suggestions, account management and performance reporting. Baidu suggests synonyms and associated phrases to use as keywords or text in search listings. These suggestions can improve [[clickthrough rate]]s of the customer's listing and increase the likelihood that a user will enter into a transaction with the customer. Baidu also provides online daily reports of the number of clickthroughs, clicked keywords and the total costs incurred, as well as statistical reports organized by geographic region.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} However, this too has invited criticism amongst Chinese internet users.

=== ProTheme ===
Baidu offers ProTheme services to some of its Baidu Union members, which enable these members to display on their properties its customers' [[advertising campaign|promotional]] links that are relevant to the subject and content of such members' properties. Baidu generates revenues from ProTheme services based on the number of clicks on its customers' links and share the revenues with its Baidu Union members in accordance with pre-agreed terms. Baidu's fixed-ranking services allow customers to display query-sensitive text links at a designated location on its search results pages. Its Targetizement services enable customers to reach their targeted Internet users by displaying their advertisements only when their targeted Internet users browse Baidu's certain Web pages.

=== Baidu TV ===
Baidu operates its advertising service, Baidu TV, in partnership with Ads it! Media Corporation, an online advertising agency and technology company. Baidu TV provides advertisers access to the websites of its Baidu Union members, allowing advertisers to choose Websites on which they post their video advertisements with the aid of its advertisement targeting and matching system. It also offers a brand advertising service, Brand-Link. In June 2008, Baidu launched My Marketing Center, a customized platform integrating industry information, market trends and business, and industry news and reports to assist existing customers in their sales and marketing efforts. Other forms of its online advertising services allow customers to display [[Web search query|query]] sensitive and non-query sensitive advertisements on its websites, including graphical advertisements.

== Baidu Union ==
Baidu Union consists of several third-party websites and [[software application]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://union.baidu.com/|title=百度联盟-让合作伙伴更强|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union members incorporate a Baidu search box or [[toolbar]] and match its [[sponsored link]]s with the content on their properties. Their users can conduct search via the Baidu search box or toolbar and can click the sponsored links located on their properties. Baidu has also launched programs through which it displays the [[online advertising]] of its customers on Baidu Union websites, and share the fees generated by these advertisements with the owners of these Baidu Union websites. As of May 2011, there were 230,000 partner websites that displayed Baidu Union ads on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lin|first=Susan|title=Baidu's Content Network – Baidu Union|url=http://www.nanjingmarketinggroup.com/blog/baidu/baidus-content-network-baidu-union|work=NanjingMarketingGroup.com|publisher=NanjingMarketingGroup.com|access-date=April 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406135629/http://www.nanjingmarketinggroup.com/blog/baidu/baidus-content-network-baidu-union|archive-date=April 6, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition ==
Baidu&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/160829/annual-revenue-of-baidu-since-2007/ Statistics on Baidu's Annual Revenue], Baidu. March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; competes with [[Google Search]], [[Qihoo|360]] Search (www.so.com), [[Sogou]] Search (www.sogou.com), [[Yahoo! China]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[MSN Messenger]], [[Sina.com|Sina]], [[NetEase]]'s [[Youdao]], [[Tencent]]'s [[Soso.com]] and PaiPai, [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]]'s [[Taobao]], [[TOM Online]], and [[EachNet]].

Baidu is the No. 1 search engine in China, controlling 76.05 percent of China's market share. The [[List of countries by number of Internet users|number of Internet users]] in China had reached 705 million by the end of   2015, according to a report by the internetlivestats.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Internet Users|url=http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/china/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2010 ''Wall Street Journal'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703999304575399162122796630?KEYWORDS=baidu | work=Wall Street Journal | title=Baidu's CEO Pursues Long-Term Growth | first=Owen | last=Fletcher | date=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baidu played down its benefit from [[Google]]'s having moved its China search service to [[Hong Kong]], but Baidu's share of revenue in China's search-advertising market grew six percentage points in the second quarter to 70%, according to Beijing-based research firm Analysys International.

It is also evident that Baidu is attempting to enter the Internet social network market. {{As of|2011}}, it is discussing the possibility of working with Facebook, which would lead to a Chinese version of the international social network, managed by Baidu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=255 传百度与Facebook签合作协议 – Baidu signed a cooperation agreement with Facebook], [http://www.thinkingchinese.com/ ThinkingChinese], April 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This plan, if executed, would face off Baidu with competition from the three popular Chinese social networks [[Qzone]], [[Renren]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renren.com|title=人人网，中国领先的实名制SNS社交网络。加入人人网，找到老同学，结识新朋友。|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kaixin001]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaixin001.com|title=开心网|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as induce rivalry with instant-messaging giant, [[Tencent QQ]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=270 Baidu and QQ aren't willing to remain outside the Chinese Social Network market], [http://www.thinkingchinese.com/ ThinkingChinese], April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 2012, [[Hudong]] submitted a complaint to the [[State Administration for Industry and Commerce]] asking for a review of the behavior of Baidu, accusing it of being monopolistic.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Yang (杨阳 ''Yáng Yáng''). Translated by Guo Wei. "[http://www.eeo.com.cn/ens/Industry/2011/03/04/195125.shtml China's "Wikipedia" Submits Complaint about Baidu]."

On January 9, 2013, Baidu was still number one in the market, with 64.5% of the users, the closest competitor, Qihoo 360, who launched its own search engine in August, has already taken hold of 10.2% users. Following are Google and Sogou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketingtochina.com/china-seo/|title=SEO in China – Top Innovative Agency|date=January 9, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 2014, Baidu's search market share in China has dropped to 56.3%, where Qihoo 360, its closest competitor who has rebranded its search engine as so.com, has increased its market share to 29.0%, according to report from CNZZ.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2463495-china-search-engine-market-share-august-2014|title=China Search Engine Market Share – August 2014|first=China Stock|last=Research|date=September 1, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Baidu was alleged to use anticompetitive tactics in Brazil against the Brazilian online security firm PSafe and [[Qihoo 360]] (the largest investor of PSafe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/brazil-becomes-a-new-front-in-the-battle-between-baidu-and-qihoo/|title=Brazil Becomes A New Front In The Battle Between Baidu And Qihoo|first=Julie|last=Ruvolo|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrazillawblog.com/baidus-alleged-anticompetitive-tactics-in-brazil/|title=Baidu's Alleged Anticompetitive Tactics in Brazil|date=April 14, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and patents ==
Baidu has started to invest in [[deep learning]] research and is integrating new deep learning technology into some of its apps and products, including Phoenix Nest. Phoenix Nest is Baidu's ad-bidding platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=BrightWire News |url=http://bw-original-reporting.tumblr.com/post/55521356692/baidu-using-deep-learning-technology-to-boost-phoenix |title=Baidu Using Deep-Learning Technology to Boost Phoenix Nest Revenue |last=Hsu |first=Alex |date=15 July 2013 |access-date=July 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105020459/http://bw-original-reporting.tumblr.com/post/55521356692/baidu-using-deep-learning-technology-to-boost-phoenix |archive-date=November 5, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 Baidu applied for a patent for its "DNA copyright recognition" technology. This technology automatically scans files that are uploaded by Internet users, and recognizes and filters out content that may violate copyright law. This allows Baidu to offer an infringement-free platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hack4mobile.com/marvel-contest-champions-cheats-tool/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218054738/http://hack4mobile.com/marvel-contest-champions-cheats-tool/|date=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baidu Applies for DNA Copyright Recognition Technology Patent |url=http://www.brightwire.com/news/203281-baidu-applies-for-dna-copyright-recognition-technology-patent |publisher=BrightWire |access-date=April 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619200937/http://www.brightwire.com/news/203281-baidu-applies-for-dna-copyright-recognition-technology-patent |archive-date=June 19, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baidu has applied for a utility patent in the UK, for its proprietary site-wise search technology which is currently available in China.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Censorship ==
According to the ''[[China Digital Times]]'', Baidu has a long history of being the most active and restrictive online censor in the search arena. Documents leaked in April 2009 from an employee in Baidu's internal monitoring and censorship department show a long list of blocked websites and censored topics on Baidu search.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked/ Baidu's Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (1)], Xiao Qiang, ''China Digital Times'', April 30, 2009&lt;br /&gt;[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked-2/ Baidu's Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (2)]&lt;br /&gt;[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked-3/ Baidu's Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, activists sued Baidu in the United States for violating the U.S. Constitution by the censorship it conducts in accord with the demand of the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Stempel, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/19/china-baidu-sued-internet-censorship_n_864006.html China, Baidu Sued In U.S. For Internet Censorship]", ''Reuters'', May 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A U.S. judge has ruled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/214981183/Zhang-et-al-v-Baidu-Com-Inc-et-al|title=Zhang et al v. Baidu.Com Inc. et al|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Chinese search engine Baidu has the right to block pro-democracy works from its query results, dismissing a lawsuit that sought to punish the company for Internet censorship.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Controversies ==
{{main article|zh:对百度的争议|Criticism of Baidu}}
Baidu's reviews are mixed for in many fields{{explain|date=March 2018}} and it is controversial. The examples are promoting and commercialization of [[Baidu Tieba]].

=== Death of Wei Zexi ===
{{Main|Death of Wei Zexi}}
In May 2016, Baidu's P4P search results reportedly caused the death of a student who tried an experimental cancer therapy he found online. The 21-year-old college student was named Wèi Zéxī  (魏则西), who studied in [[Xidian University]]. Wei was diagnosed with [[synovial sarcoma]], a rare form of cancer. He found the Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police Corps (武警北京市总队第二医院) through the search engine Baidu, on which the hospital had been promoting itself. The treatment proved to be unsuccessful.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

After Wei's family spent around 200,000 yuan (around 31,150 USD) for treatment in the hospital, Wei Zexi died on April 12, 2016. The incident triggered massive online discussions after Wei's death. The fact that Baidu valued money way more than life kindled nationwide rage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0502/c90000-9052118.html |title=Commentary: Death of college student raises questions on Baidu's ethics |work=People's Daily |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 2, 2016, [[Cyberspace Administration of China]] (CAC), the top watchdog for China's Internet space, dispatched a team of investigators to Baidu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-05/02/c_135328902.htm |title=China Focus: Investigation into Baidu after student death |agency=Xinhua News Agency |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is still ongoing. One report claimed medical advertising makes up for 30% of Baidu's ad revenue, much of which comes from for-profit hospitals that belong to the "Putian Network", a collection of hospitals across the country founded by medical entrepreneurs associated with the [[Putian]] region of Fujian province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qz.com/674030/baidu-chinas-version-of-google-is-evil-a-growing-number-of-users-say/ |title=Baidu, China's version of Google, is 'evil,' a growing number of users say |work=Quartz |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation led Chinese regulators to impose several restrictions on Baidu, including adding disclaimers to promotional content and establishing channels for complaints about Baidu services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-orders-baidu-to-revamp-advertising-results-in-online-searches-1462798762 |title=China Orders Baidu to Revamp Advertising Results in Online Searches |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercialization of Tieba ===
Baidu sold the hemophilia online community, one of the communities of Tieba, to unqualified hospitals. In January 2016, Baidu announced that it will stop selling all of its illness-related Tieba.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2016-01/12/content_23052646.htm Baidu to halt commercialization of Tieba health forums]'', China Daily, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|blue-pencil}}

The '''blue pencil doctrine''' is a legal concept in [[common law]] countries, where a [[court]] finds that portions of a [[contract]] is [[Void (law)|void]] or unenforceable, but other portions of the contract are [[enforceable]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Blue Pencil Rule allows the legally-valid, enforceable provisions of the contract to stand despite the nullification of the legally-void, unenforceable provisions. However, the revised version must represent the original meaning; the rule may not be invoked, for example, to delete the word "not" and thereby change a negative to a positive.

==Etymology==
The term stems from the act of editing [[copy (written)|written copy]] with a [[blue pencil (editing)|blue pencil]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

==In UK law==
The principle was established by the [[House of Lords]] in the case of ''[[Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co]]'' (1894).{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Other statutory provisions such as the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|date=17 March 1993
|accessdate=|title=Statutory Instrument 1994 No. 3159 - The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999
|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; have established the Blue Pencil principle in statute law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In [[Rose &amp; Frank Co v JR Crompton &amp; Bros Ltd]], the Blue Pencil Rule was used to strike out an unacceptable clause in a [[memorandum of understanding]] agreement which appeared to try to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts. The unenforceable part having been excised, the remainder of the agreement was valid, and served to establish that the MOU agreement was not intended by the parties to be binding at law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==In other jurisdictions==
In most jurisdictions, courts routinely "blue pencil" or reform [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] that are not reasonable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The blue pencil doctrine gives courts the authority to either strike unreasonable clauses from a [[Non-compete clause|non-compete agreement]], leaving the rest to be enforced, or actually modify the agreement to reflect the terms that the parties originally could have&amp;mdash;and probably should have&amp;mdash;agreed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Putting the Blue Pencil Down: An Argument for Specificity in Noncompete Agreements|first=Griffin Toronjo|last=Pivateau|journal=[[Nebraska Law Review]]|volume=84|issue=3|ssrn=1007599|date=31 August 2007|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Israel]] the blue pencil method has been used to strike out illegal or unconstitutional parts of a statute, leaving the rest intact.&lt;ref&gt;http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/12/460/071/b24/12071460.b24.htm Supreme Court decision regarding illegal aliens of 16 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution''' (CEDR) is a [[London]]-based [[mediation]] and [[alternative dispute resolution]] body. It was founded as a non-profit organisation in 1990, with the support of The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and a number of British businesses and law firms, to encourage the development and use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and mediation in commercial disputes. Professor Karl Mackie, a barrister and psychologist, became the organisation's Chief Executive and Eileen Carroll QC (hon), a Trans-Atlantic partner with a law firm (who had been involved in the initiative to form CEDR) joined to become the Deputy Chief Executive in 1996. On 12 June 2010 it was announced in the Queen's Birthday Honours that Karl Mackie was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by the UK Government for ‘services to mediation', the first citing of this reason for the award.&lt;ref name="Law Society Gazette Jun 17 2010"&gt;[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/news-in-brief/cbe-mackie Law Society Gazette, June 17 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929072546/http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/news-in-brief/cbe-mackie |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Initially CEDR's focus was, by necessity, UK-focused, where in the early 1990s mediation was not well established in business disputes. Through its campaigning and training work CEDR helped influence the civil justice system. In 1996 the then Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord [[Harry Woolf]] (who now retired is Chair of CEDR's International Advisory Council), published his 'Access To Civil Justice Report' which encouraged the use of ADR, followed by the Civil Procedure Rules in 1999 which enabled judges to impose cost sanctions to either party when ADR was refused or ignored. These guidelines, along with case law (for example Dunnet v Railtrack, 2002) and subsequent clarification of the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) saw the growth of the use of ADR and in particular mediation in the UK. Parallel to this was a growth in demand for CEDR's services in dispute resolution and training.  From the mid-1990s onwards CEDR's focus became international, to begin with encouraging mediation in other European countries and working on international cases, to establishing the MEDAL international mediation service provider alliance (2005) and creating the first international mediation centre in China with China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).

==Areas of activity==
CEDR works in four main ways.

===Promotion===
CEDR states that all money raised from its activities get put into the promotion of mediation and ADR, through events, schemes and running many services at cost. CEDR, a UK registered charity (no.1060369), asks global businesses to be members to support these activities. CEDR runs a number of elements under this umbrella, which include:
The Exchange Participant Network Programme – quarterly events and newsletter for mediators around the world (over 700 members).
The European Mediation Congress – a biennial conference event always held in London, last held in 2007. In 2009 this was instead a Conference on Settlement in International Arbitration.&lt;ref name="Commercial Dispute Resolution News"&gt;[http://www.cdr-news.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=466%3Asettling-arbitration-cedrs-rules-in-practice&amp;Itemid=1 Commercial Dispute Resolution News]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Excellence in ADR Awards – another biennial event - a 20th Anniversary Awards will be held in 2010.
The Mediator Audit – again biennial, previously to coincided with the Congress and gauges the quantity and quality of mediations in the UK over the previous two years. The last audit was published May 2010.&lt;ref name="2010 CEDR Mediation Audit"&gt;[http://www.cedr.com/docslib/CEDRMediatorAudit2010.pdf 2010 CEDR Mediation Audit]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[International Mediation Institute]] - as a board member of IMI since 2014, CEDR participates in setting quality standards and promoting the adoption of quality mediation around the world.

===Dispute resolution===
CEDR is the dispute resolution service arm of CEDR. Any business or law firm facing a dispute can call to speak to a case adviser who will provide advice and be able to recommend an accredited mediator to resolve their dispute. A number of the world's top mediators are only available via this service{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} but CEDR Solve says it has over 130 accredited mediators on its panel of experts and with 50 mediators directly (including Lord Woolf). The service says it has advised on over 16,000 disputes to date and mediates approximately 600 major cases a year.&lt;ref name="2009 Report"&gt;[http://www.cedr.com/docslib/2009_Achievements_at_CEDR3.pdf 2009 Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2011 it was announced that, the previous day, CEDR had acquired IDRS Ltd, the dispute resolution service of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.&lt;ref name="ADR Resources"&gt;[http://adrresources.com/adr-news/826/cedr-buys-idrs-from-ciarb]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 CEDR started the Commission on International Arbitration, chaired by Lord Woolf and Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, to investigate settlement in international arbitration and to make recommendations on how arbitral institutions and tribunals can give parties greater assistance. The Commission is composed of 75 figures from the field and is also consulting 45 organisations from different jurisdictions. In 2009 the Commission published its Rules &amp; Recommendations for Settlement in International Arbitration.&lt;ref name="Law Society Gazette Dec 03 2009"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/woolf-calls-arbitration-overhaul-he-launches-new-guidance# |title=Law Society Gazette, December 3 2009 |access-date=2010-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206165842/http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/woolf-calls-arbitration-overhaul-he-launches-new-guidance# |archive-date=2009-12-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Training ===
Training mediators for over seventeen years, its Mediator Training Skills is widely thought to be the best in the world. With a faculty of 30 experienced mediators, CEDR says over 5000 mediators from different countries have been trained to date.&lt;ref name="2009 Report"/&gt; Once passed mediators can go on to become accredited. In the last ten years CEDR has also branched out and offers other courses such as a Certificate in Advanced Negotiation, Advocacy Skills for lawyers and Conflict Management for managers.

=== Consultancy and named clients ===
Increasingly CEDR says it is called into organizations and disputes at an early stage to design a resolution system or training scheme. In 2006 CEDR announced it had been appointed by the World Bank's [[International Finance Corporation]] to introduce mediation to Pakistan. In its 2005 report CEDR said it has also worked with IBM, the Court of Appeal and the National Association of Pension Funds.

Whilst no organizations were mentioned in its 2006 annual report, in 2007&lt;ref name="2007 Report"&gt;[http://www.cedr.com/news/resolutions/Review07.pdf 2007 Report]&lt;/ref&gt; CEDR said it ran projects or consulted with the IFC and World Bank, the European Patent Office, the London Olympics 2012, the Federal Government of India, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Germanischer Lloyd Wind Energy, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, the Chartered Institute of Public Relations, the Ministry of Justice (UK), the National Health Service (UK), the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (UK) and UNCITRAL. The report shows that in addition to its work in the UK, in 2007 CEDR also worked in South Africa, China, the Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Vietnam, the United States, Bosnia and Croatia.

The 2008 report&lt;ref name="2008 Report"&gt;[http://www.cedr.com/news/resolutions/Review_2008.pdf 2008 Report]&lt;/ref&gt; names law firms it worked with as Allen &amp; Overy, Ashurst, Clifford Chance, Eversheds, Herbert Smith, Lewis Silkin, Lovells, Mayer Brown, Nabarro and Norton Rose.

A '''confidential birth''' is a birth where the mother gives birth to a child without her identity being disclosed by the authorities. In many countries, confidential births have been legalized for centuries in order to prevent formerly frequent [[infanticides|killings of newborn children]], particularly outside of marriage.

In a confidential birth, the mother's right of [[informational self-determination]] suspends the children's right to know about their biological [[ancestry]] until she changes her mind or until the grown up child requests disclosure at a later point. The alternative concept of an [[anonymous birth]], where the mother doesn't disclose her identity to the authorities at all or where her identity remains infinitely undisclosed, goes beyond this. 

== History ==
{{section expand |date=October 2015}}
An early forerunner of confidential birth legislation can be found in [[Sweden]] where the [[Infanticide Act (Sweden)|Infanticide Act]] of 1778 granted mothers both the right and all means to give birth to their child anonymously. the act's 1856 amendment however restricted this legislation to confidential births, where the [[midwife]] was ordered to keep the mother's name in a sealed envelope.

In [[France]], confidential births were legalized in 1793, when Article 326 of the [[Code Civil]] introduced both the concepts of ''anonymous'' and ''confidential births''.

===== [[Infanticide]]: =====
In Western Society Christianity, the reaction to infanticide is of disgust because they feel that what the pregnant female did was against nature and reason and now the parent is denying like to the offspring. Infanticide can be seen as a cover up for sexual misconduct or in more dramatic terms denial of social order. Infanticide was specifically popular in the eighteenth-century through the nineteenth-century because of the difficulty with prosecution and the nature of the offense. In most places, a humanitarian view led to those prosecuting to consider that the newborns killed were done by helpless unmarried children and pushed them to convict them less. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=G. S.|date=1991|title=Infanticide, Its Judicial Resolution, and Criminal Code Revision in Early Pennsylvania|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/987032|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=135|issue=2|pages=200–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infanticide decreased as resolutions came changing the perceptions of females to themselves and others. Society was realizing their oppressive behaviors led to the death of the children. Thus, encouraging society to reconsider the patterns and roles that they play on those involved in the accidents. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Infanticide in definition is a person deliberately killing a child who had yet reached the of discretion, which is to be nine years old. This can be the mother, father, or even grandparents of the child. If the mother were married, then the case would not be tried as infanticide but as common law under murder. If the child was born stillborn, she was to prove it by one witness and a documentation of the newborn's death by an official. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Legal situation in the United States==
{{section expand |date=October 2015}}

=== The Right to Privacy: ===
Privacy in America is something that was slow to growth. The reason for the inclusion of this section is to give historical background on privacy and how it will come into play for the right of sealed birth records and confidential birth. From the beginning of the creation of the constitution and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], there is a use of private, such as [[Private property|private property,]] but it never uses the word privacy and allowing people the right to privacy. Privacy is something that is implied through the language of the laws in place but not something that was emphasized or govern-mentally protected. &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Griswold v. Connecticut: Birth Control and the Constitutional Right of Privacy|last=Johnson|first=John W.|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;It was not until the 1850's that privacy began to be something to be fought for as a right and this began when the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] was created and people enacting upon criminal activity of people transcribing messages illegally. The right to privacy eventually came from the court case of ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' where it argued for there to be a constitutional and legal basis for those seeking privacy in 1965. ''Griswold v. Connecticut'' is a case of the State of Connecticut v. [[Estelle Griswold|Estelle T. Griswold]] and [[C. Lee Buxton]]. Estelle Griswold felt that medically prescribed methods of [[Birth control movement in the United States|birth control]] should be offered and available to married women for the concerns of the health of mothers and economic and emotional stability. Dr. Buxton testified that he advised married women onto certain methods of [[birth control]] to preserve the lives and health of women with certain medical conditions.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; In addition, mentioning the use of contraceptives at that time as a commonplace medical practice in the country, so that birth control should not be seen differently. In conclusion from the representative of that of the State of Connecticut, it stressed that a physician must abide by the law anti contraception statute in the state of Connecticut and advice patients otherwise. Griswold and Buxton were found guilty under the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut because they assisted certain married women for the purpose of preventing conception rather than for medical reasons. When the case was brought all the way to the Supreme Court, lawyer of Griswold and Buxton, Emerson made an argument that - the right to privacy was being violated by the 1879 anti contraception law. He continued the argument that statutes are not followed and if the anti contraception law were to be followed then it would be threatening the privacy of married couples in the state of Connecticut. &lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;This argument then led to the protection of the privacy of activities in 1965. The votes were seven in favor of the reversing the Connecticut Supreme Court on birth control appeal and two supporting its affirmation. After fifty years of trying to modify and repeal the Connecticut anti contraception law, to extend the First Amendment protections to peripheral activities and this was also covered under the Bill of Rights. &lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Sealed records law was installed in 1917, allowing both parties to benefit from the confidentiality, mainly the state and whoever else was involved. Birth certificates are sealed for those adopted so that the adoptive parents feel autonomy from the biological parents and receive the privacy that birth parents have.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adoption, Identity, and Kinship: The Debate over Sealed Birth Records|last=Wegar|first=Katarina|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=82-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sealed records law lets anyone adopted to create own fate without influence from biological parents and their origins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Reasons for Confidential Birth and Birth Records not being of Public Matter: ===
Some women choose not to give their personal information when giving birth to a child for the fact of privacy and keeping their personal information private/ confidential. They feel that the information asked is too personal and is not useful for medical records. Questions asked include: What is the highest level education reached by both parents? What is the standing employment for parents? How many times has the mother terminated pregnancies? Did the mother smoke during pregnancy, before, or after? &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;"Mom Won't Fill Out Form; Kids Denied Birth Certificates." ''Milwaukee Journal'', Jan 16, 1995, pp. 1A''. ProQuest'', &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ezproxy.plu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.plu.edu/docview/333665338?accountid=2130&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;How many cigarettes per day? What was the alcohol use per day before and during pregnancy? But to be able to receive the birth certificate, they must fill out the sheet. The questionnaire is not of an anonymous format. The questions are used for the National Center for Health Statistics and is entered in a confidential data set but the data is saved with the mother's name attached. &lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

Through research, it is often times those of adolescent who decide to have confidential births and confidential adoptions. For some they have unresolved issues being of pubescence with their own family and life. Without the psychological maturity of adulthood, it can be difficult for an adolescent to take on the task of parenting an infant. For adolescents they have just reached the level to link possible consequences to certain actions and not firmly established. &lt;ref name=":06"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=af29136d-cde6-44ab-a4e8-c56c0d033f79@sdc-v-sessmgr01|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;Those who experience pregnancy have various of reactions when pregnant of either denial and self-blame or the need for the pregnancy to solve depression or to affirm femininity which can be the reason for little effort of prevention of pregnancy. The relinquish of responsibility leads to adoption and the decision to give the child a better life and the woman the freedom.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; Because of the lack of information when giving the child up for adoption and the intensity of the time, the mother is asked of whether they want to relinquish their parental rights and asked at the same time if she wants to keep contact with the child. The reaction of the mother could be positive as to want connection with the child or they can have unhappiness about the pregnancy and wants riddance of the child and the consequence of it. &lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

Statistics of birth records are used to register humans but there are problems in acquiring records from children who are: born out of wedlock, children of unknown parentage, they are legitimated children, adopted children.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1951|title=Review of The Confidential Nature of Birth Records|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30018637|journal=Social Service Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Association of Registration Executives and the Council on Vital Records and Statistics created a statement for the need of a nation-wide policy on the confidential nature of birth records which will (1) assure the confidentiality of all birth records; (2) regulation of completeness and accuracy of all information given within birth reports, adoptions, and legitimations; (3) allowing the individual to secure the information regarding their birth or family relationship; (4) protect individuals from the release of information that is undesired; (5) the required information from an administration to keep records secure within programs.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This policy of secured birth records require the complete and accurate registration of births essential as individuals need certification of their birth for evidence. As well as, health and social agencies need this information for statistical and administrative purposes, but if the information is left for the general public than information that could be harmful to the child or parents would be insecure. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Change from Traditional Confidential Adoption to Open Adoption: ===
Change from Traditional Confidential Adoption to Open Adoption:

Confidential adoption- where the non-identifying or those who keep the records confidential still exchange the medical data regarding the parents between the adoptive and the biological parents through an agency.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

Open Adoption- identifying data is exchanged through the contact between the adoptive parents and biological parents and is encouraged. Contact continues throughout the life of the child with things such as, letters, gifts, photographs, or even visits between both sets of parents and the child. Some families put limits on the meeting of biological parents and child with either limited openness or just open.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

{{ct law}}
The '''Constitution of the State of Connecticut''' is the basic governing document of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Connecticut]]. It was approved by [[referendum]] on December 14, 1965, and proclaimed by the [[Governor of Connecticut|governor]] as adopted on December 30. It comprises 14 articles and has been [[constitutional amendment|amended]] 31 times.

This constitution replaced the earlier constitution of 1818. It is the state's second constitution since the establishment of the United States. An earlier constitution dating from colonial times, the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]], remained the basis of government even as Connecticut gained its independence from Great Britain, existed as an independent polity, and joined the United States.

== Articles ==
The constitution consists of fourteen articles:

# ''Declaration of Rights'' – Analogous to the [[United States]] [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], providing rights to speech, assembly, speedy trial, bearing of arms, and [[religion]], among others.
# ''Of the Distribution of Powers'' – Establishes three branches of government in the state: legislative, executive, and judicial.
# ''Of the Legislative Department'' – Creates a two-house [[legislature]], sets standards for districting, elections, and [[ethics]].
# ''Of the Executive Department'' – Sets terms, requirements, and powers of the [[governor]], lieutenant governor, secretary of the state, treasurer and comptroller.
# ''Of the Judicial Department'' – Establishes [[supreme court|supreme]], [[superior court|superior]], and lesser courts, and the rules that govern how judges are chosen.
# ''Of the Qualifications of Electors'' – Lists age and residency requirements for voters.
# ''Of Religion'' – Reiterates the right to free practice of religion.
# ''Of Education'' – Charters a free [[elementary school]] school system, the [[University of Connecticut]], and [[Yale College]].
# ''Of Impeachments'' – Sets rules for [[impeachment]] and [[treason]] trials.
# ''Of Home Rule'' – Gives the general assembly the right to delegate authority to cities and towns.
# ''General Provisions'' – The oath of office, restrictions on salary raises, and other miscellaneous rules.
# ''Of Amendments to the Constitution'' – Establishes the method of amending the state constitution.
# ''Of Constitutional Conventions'' – Creates the method of calling for a special convention to amend or revise the constitution.
# ''Of the Effective Date of This Constitution'' – The constitution became effective after approval by a popular vote and proclamation by the governor.

== Amending the constitution ==
;Legislature and referendum
The Connecticut constitution can be amended via a process that originates in the General Assembly. If a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment passes each house of the General Assembly with three-quarters of the votes cast, the amendment is submitted to the voters in the next even-numbered year's general election. If such a joint resolution fails to win a two-thirds vote in either house but obtains a majority, it must receive a majority in each house during the next legislative session before being submitted to the voters in the next even-numbered year's general election. An amendment that wins a majority of the votes cast in the referendum is adopted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.megalaw.com/ct/ctconst/ctc_12.php&lt;/ref&gt;

;Constitutional convention
A constitutional convention can amend the constitution. Such a convention is called either:
* when called for by a two-thirds vote of each house of the General Assembly, provided at least 10 years have passed since a constitutional convention was convened; or
* when approved by a majority vote of the electorate, to whom the question "Shall there be a Constitutional Convention to amend or revise the Constitution of the State?" is submitted whenever 20 years have passed since a constitutional convention was convened and since the question of calling a convention was submitted to the voters.

The General Assembly shall decide, by a two-thirds vote of each house, the method for selecting convention delegates and the date of the convention's convening and adjournment. The most recent referendum on calling a constitutional convention was held on November 4, 2008. Voters opposed calling a constitutional convention by a vote of 847,518 to 579,904.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/electionservices/electionresults/2008_election_results/constitutional_questions_on_the_ballot.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Connecticut constitutions ==
{{Main|Connecticut Constitutional History}}
The ''[[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]]'' (1638) is considered by many to be the state's first constitution, although it was adopted while the state was still an [[England|English]] [[colony]].  The document recognized no allegiance to England but instead an independent government. ''The Charter of the Colony of Connecticut'' (1662) officially superseded the Fundamental Orders, but the local government continued operating under the previous rules. Even after the [[American Revolutionary War]], the state retained its constitution for another 40 years.

The colonial charter was abolished with the adoption of the first state constitution in 1818. In contrast to the Fundamental Orders, that constitution provided for freedom of religion.

On October 1, 1901, Connecticut residents voted nearly 2-to-1 in favor of calling of a constitutional convention to revise the constitution. A convention was held, and a revised constitution was proposed. On June 16, 1902, voters rejected the revised constitution by a margin of more than 2-to-1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">The '''Declaration of Table Mountain''' is a statement on [[freedom of the press|press freedom]] in [[Africa]]. The statement was issued by the [[World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers]] (WAN-IFRA) and World Editors Forum (WEF) at the 60th meeting of the World Newspaper Conference and 14th World Editors Forum Conference in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], 3–6 June 2007. It is named after [[Table Mountain]], at the southern tip of the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of Table Mountain", ''Index on Censorship'', Volume 36, Number 3, 2007, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In country after country, the African press is crippled by a panoply of repressive measures, from the jailing and persecution of journalists to the widespread scourge of 'insult laws' and criminal defamation. As the start of an intensive campaign to improve this appalling situation, the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) adopted the Declaration of Table Mountain on 3 June 2007 in Cape Town, South Africa, during its annual meeting.

Through this Declaration, WAN-IFRA has stated its conviction that Africa urgently needs a strong, free and independent press to act as a watchdog over public institutions, a crucial role that the press is hindered from and punished for playing by the widespread resort to 'insult laws' and criminal defamation, in particular.

Major African and international non-governmental organisations that, day after day, defend and promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press have now endorsed the Declaration and expressed their readiness to contribute to this campaign. Together, with determination, we will now aggressively press our case in the hope for a better future for African media freedom.

==Background==

Life-long Brusly resident Jordan graduated from Brusly High School and the [[historically black]] [[Southern University]] and the [[Southern University Law Center]], both in the capital city of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. An attorney since 1998, Jordan has represented the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]], the [[Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality]], and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]. He co-owns Cypress Insurance Agency in Baton Rouge. He is a graduate of the leadership programs offered by both the West Baton Rouge/[[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville]] [[Chamber of Commerce]] and the Council For A Better Louisiana. He is a member of the West Baton Rouge Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; 

He and his wife, Stacie, have two children, Jailen and Jace Jordan.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; 

==Political life==

On November 21, 2015, Jordan lost the House race to Ronnie Edwards the regular [[general election]]. He polled 4,768 votes (40.9 percent) to Edwards' 6,887 (59.1 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11212015/11212015_Legislative.html|title=Election Results|date=November 21, 2015|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards defeated Jordan to succeed Representative [[Regina Barrow]], who in turn followed [[Sharon Weston Broome]] in the [[Louisiana State Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf|title=Membership of the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1812-Current: East and West Baton Rouge parishes|publisher=house.louisiana.gov|accessdate=March 9, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105414/http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf|archivedate=October 6, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrow and Broome are also African-American Democrats. Edwards like Barrow formerly worked for Broome. Gary Chambers of ''The Rouge Collection'' wrote that Jordan answered questions in a public forum while Edwards did not make an appearance. "Honestly, in the white community, this would never have happened. We as blacks blindly vote for people, based on name recognition, and we must change this pattern," Chambers said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therougecollection.net/therouge/the-broome-dynasty-wins-again-with-ronnie-edwards-being-elected-to-serve-as-state-representative-in-district-29/|title=The Broome Dynasty Wins Again, With Ronnie Edwards being Elected to Serve as State Representative in District 29|publisher=''The Rouge Collection''|author=Gary Chambers|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Democrats were candidates in the special election held on April 9 to choose Edwards' successor. In the second round of balloting between the top two vote-getters, Jordan defeated in a low-turnout contest another Democrat, Vereta Tanner Lee (born March 1958), a third-term member of the [[East Baton Rouge Parish School Board]], 2,019 votes (59.6 percent) and 1,368 (40.4 percent). Eliminated in the primary were Tyra Banks Sterling, who had been Edwards' former legislative assistant, attorney Victor Woods, Jr., and Albert White, occupation not available. No [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] filed in the heavily Democratic district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/news/elections/15158323-123/five-democrats-qualify-for-state-rep-election-to-fill-ronnie-edwards-seat|title=Five Democrats qualify for state rep election to fill Ronnie Edwards’ seat|author=Rebekah Allen|publisher=''The Baton Rouge Advocate''|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 campaign, Jordan focused on what he called setting the "state budget in line with the priorities that enhance opportunity, not diminish it. Strong economic development and the retention of high quality graduates is an absolute necessity. More specifically, I will fight to balance the disproportionate economic disparity between north and south Baton Rouge. Instead of trying to form a new city, we need to bring businesses to District 29 and help rejuvenate this district."&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swagher.net/2015/07/15/edmond-jordan-announces-candidacy-for-louisiana-house-district-29/|title=Edmond Jordan Announces Candidacy for Louisiana House District 29|date=July 15, 2015|publisher=swagher.net|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[John Bel Edwards]] called to congratulate his fellow Democrat on learning of Jordan's election to the state House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therougecollection.net/therouge/edmond-jordan-beats-vereta-lee-for-district-29-state-representative-seat/|title=Edmond Jordan Beats Vereta Lee for District 29 State Representative Seat|date=May 14, 2016|publisher=therougecollecton.net|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Elections and Registration Act 1915''' (5&amp;6 Geo.5 c.76) was a [[First World War|war time]] [[act of parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that postponed local elections and the preparation of registers of electors. Initially the postponement was for one year, but the Act was renewed annually until the electoral cycle was resumed in 1919 following the cessation of hostilities.

==Background== 
Elections to local authorities in the United Kingdom were held annually in either April or November. In August 1914 war broke out, although this did not initially effect the municipal elections which were duly held in November 1914 and April 1915.

A coalition government was formed in May 1915, and in June it was announced that the cabinet intended to introduce legislation to both extend the life of Parliament by a year to 1917, and also to postpone the November 1915 borough elections. The postponement of elections would also mean that local authorities would not need to compile new electoral registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Next General Election. No Dissolution During the War |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page=8 |date=19 June 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Elections and Registration Bill''' was duly introduced to the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|Commons]] only 22 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elections and Registration Bill |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1915/jul/22/elections-and-registiution-bill |date=22 July 1915 |work=Hansard 1803 &amp;ndash; 2005 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed all stages in both houses rapidly, and received the [[royal assent]] on 29 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal Assent |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1915/jul/29/royal-assent#S5CV0073P0_19150729_HOC_12 |date=29 July 1915 |work=Hansard 1803 &amp;ndash; 2005 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The Act was a short document containing only four sections.

*Section 1 provided that the.. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"next statutory elections of [[county council|county]] and [[municipal borough|borough]] councillors, [[Local Government Act 1894|district councillors]], [[board of guardians|guardians]], and [[Parish councils in England|parish councillors]], shall be postponed for a year, and the term of office of the existing councillors and guardians shall accordingly be extended by one year.'"&lt;/blockquote&gt; Elections were no longer to be required to fill casual vacancies occurring in the membership of local councils and boards. Instead a vacant seat was to "be filled by means of the choice by the council or board of a person"... and  "a councillor or guardian so chosen shall hold office in the same manner in all respects as if he had been elected to fill the vacancy".
*Section 2 exempted the Common Council of the [[City of London]] from the Act.
*Section 3 provided that the parliamentary and local government register of electors in force at the time of the passing of the Act, should remain in force until 31 December 1916.
*Section 4 dealt with the application of the Act to Scotland and Ireland.

==Renewal==
With the continuation of the war until November 1918, the provisions of the 1915 legislation had to be renewed on three occasions by the Parliament and Local Elections Acts of 1916, 1917 and the Parliament and Local Elections (No. 2) Act, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;6&amp;7 Geo.5. C.44, 7&amp;8 Geo.5. C.13, 7&amp;8 Geo.5 C.50&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5128">The '''Financial Stability Forum''' ('''FSF''') was a group consisting of major national financial authorities such as [[finance ministry|finance ministries]], [[central bank]]ers, and international financial bodies. It was first convened in April 1999 in Washington. At the [[2009 G20 London summit]], the [[G20]] nations established an FSF successor called the [[Financial Stability Board]] with an expanded membership and broadened mandate.&lt;ref name=thing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411064057/http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Forum was founded in 1999 to promote international financial stability. Its founding resulted from discussions among Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the [[G7]] countries, and a study which they commissioned.&lt;ref name="Founding"&gt;[http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html Genesis of the FSF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614000000/http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html |date=June 14, 2008 }}, FSF website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum facilitated discussion and cooperation on supervision and surveillance of financial institutions, transactions and events. FSF was managed by a small secretariat housed at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="FSF home"&gt;[http://www.fsforum.org fsforum.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512222115/http://www.fsforum.org/ |date=2009-05-12 }}, main website.&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF membership included about a dozen nations who participate through their central banks, financial ministries and departments, and securities regulators, including: the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]] and several other industrialized economies as well as several international economic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html FSF:Who we are] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614000000/http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html |date=June 14, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the G20 summit on November 15, 2008, it was agreed that the membership of the FSF will be expanded to include emerging economies, such as China. The [[2009 G-20 London summit]] decided to establish a successor to the FSF, the [[Financial Stability Board]]. The FSB includes members of the G20 who were not members of FSF.&lt;ref name=thing/&gt;

==Meetings and actions==
The Financial Stability Forum met in [[Rome]] on 28–29 March 2008 in connection with the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. Members discussed current challenges in financial markets, and various policy options to address them from this point forward.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"&gt;[http://www.bis.org/press/p080329.htm Financial Stability Forum meets in Rome], 29 March 2008, Press release, Website of [[Bank for International Settlements]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At this meeting, the FSF discussed a report to be delivered to [[G7]] Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2008. it identifies key weaknesses underlying current financial turmoil, and recommends actions to improve market and institutional resilience. The FSF discussed work underway at the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] with regard to [[sovereign wealth fund]]s (SWFs). The IMF is working closely with SWFs to identify a set of voluntary best practice guidelines, and is focusing on the governance, institutional arrangements and transparency of SWFs.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"/&gt;

On April 12, 2008, the FSF delivered a [https://web.archive.org/web/20080724030541/http://www.fsforum.org/publications/FSF_Report_to_G7_11_April.pdf report] to the G7 Finance Ministers which details out its recommendations for enhancing the resilience of the financial markets and financial institutions. These are in five areas:
*Strengthened prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management 
* Enhancing transparency and valuation 
* Changes in the role and uses of [[credit rating]]s
* Strengthening the authorities' responsiveness to risks 
* Robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system [http://www.bis.org/press/p080412.htm]

== History  ==
The practical use of gels was limited until the 1950s as advances in copolymerization techniques led to reproducible, batchwise preparation of swellable resins with uniform cross-linking.&lt;ref name=Markus&gt;
{{citation
 | inventor-last = Markus
 | inventor-first = Richard L.
 | publication-date = October 22, 1957
 | title = Batchwise copolymerization technique
 | country-code = US
 | patent-number = 2810716
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was later used in the development of a "substantially continuous, adherent, particulate coating composition of water-swollen, gelled particles of a crosslinked, water-insoluble, water-swellable polymer."&lt;ref name=Bashaw&gt;
{{citation

 | inventor-first = Robert N.
 | publication-date = January 18, 1966
 | title = Method for controlling the spread of fire
 | country-code = US
 | patent-number = 3229769
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water-absorbent polymers in fire-retardant gels are similar to those used in diapers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of retardation ==
The polymer in gels soaks up hundreds of times its weight in water creating millions of tiny drops of water surrounded by and protected by a polymer shell. The result is a "bubblet" or a drop of water surrounded by a polymer shell in contrast to a bubble which is air surrounded by liquid. As the gel and water are sprayed onto an exposed surface, millions of tiny "bubblets" are stacked one on top of another.  The stacking of the water "bubblets" form a thermal protective "blanket" over the surface to which it is applied. In order for the heat of the fire to penetrate the protected surface, it must burn off each layer of the gel "bubblets" coating.  Each layer holds the heat away from the next layer of bubblets beneath.  The polymer shell of each bubblets and their stacking significantly prevent water evaporation.

The stacking of the bubblets is similar to aspirated [[fire fighting foam]] or [[Compressed Air Foam System|compressed air foam systems]], except that bubblets are water filled, whereas foam bubbles are only filled with air.  Due to the high [[specific heat]] of water, it requires more energy to raise the temperature of water than air.  Therefore, water-filled bubblets will absorb more heat than the air-filled foam bubbles (which are more effective for vapor suppression).  When gel is applied to a surface such as an exterior wall, the water-filled bubblets can absorb much of the heat given off by the fire, thereby slowing the fire from reaching the wall.

Gels can provide thermal protection from fire for extended periods even at {{convert|3500|F|C}}.  Depending on the fire conditions, applied fire retardant gels offer fire protection for periods of 6 to 36 hours.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

After the retained water is completely evaporated from a gel, fire resistance is lost, but can be restored by re-wetting the surface if gel material is still adherent.&lt;ref name="CDF Letter"/&gt;

==Uses==
During a fire in the [[Black Hills National Forest]], "nearly all homes coated with a slimy gel were saved while dozens of houses nearby burned to the ground."&lt;ref&gt;

Certain supplemental fire protection insurance may include the application of fire-retardant gel to homes during wildfire. Claimed to work "best when applied hours before a fire approaches", gel is applied using specially designed trucks by private firms.  However, danger may be high and private firms may interfere with fire efforts.  In response to such a concern, Sam DiGiovanna, chief of Firebreak response program, a private response team, stated: "If whoever is running the fire thinks it's too dangerous to go into a particular area, we don't go into that area."&lt;ref&gt;

These gels are useful when filming scenes in which it is desired to give the illusion that someone is on fire. To do so, the gel is applied to an area of the body. Next, a fuel is placed on top of the gel. When ready to film the scene, the fuel is lit on fire. The gel insulates the person from the energy released from the burning fuel. The energy from the burning fuel goes into the gel, but not the stunt person. Thus, the stunt person is protected from being burned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">The '''Folkewall'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holon.se/folke/projects/openliw/openlev_en.shtml Folkewall]&lt;/ref&gt; is a construction with the dual functions of growing plants and purifying waste water.  It was designed by Folke Günther&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holon.se/folke/cv/Eng/Biography/short.shtml Folke Günther]&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden. 

Inspired by the "Sanitas wall" at Dr Gösta Nilsson's Sanitas farm project in [[Botswana]], this technique makes an efficient use of space by fulfilling two essential functions: vertical plant growing and [[Water purification|purification]] of [[greywater]]. This system is also known as a living wall or [[green wall]].

==Design==
The basic design is a wall of hollow concrete slabs, with compartments opening on one or both sides of the wall. The hollows are filled with inert material like [[gravel]], [[expanded clay aggregate]], [[perlite]], or [[vermiculite]]. It is designed to let the water [[Trickling filter|trickle]] over the longest possible treatment path along the length of the wall among the pebbles. 

The water is brought in at the top, and percolates following a zig-zag pattern inside the wall. As it does so the plant roots grow among the inert material and extract nutrients from the water. A film of [[Bioremediation|beneficial bacteria]] grows over the pebbles, releasing the nutrients in the percolating greywater. At the bottom of the wall a container collects the purified water, which can then be used for non-[[potable]] household use, for watering the garden, or it can be returned to the top of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/features/digital/archives/0702dignews-1.asp Living wall systems ''(subscription required)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
''Plants used'': since the harvesting of the plants is a part of the purification process, fast growing, herbaceous crops are particularly suited for the Folkewall. Annual food crops are suitable, perennials like trees and shrubs should be avoided.

''Greywater'': The water feeding the plants in the wall must be free of [[heavy metals]] and/or unsafe [[pollutants]], notably [[human waste]]. This requires using source-separating toilets.

==Advantages==
* '''Better use of greywater''': most of the evaporation happens through the plant's leaves, which makes the method especially useful in arid climates. The Folkewall makes use of this aspect.
* '''More efficient use of the area'''. For example in greenhouses or other glazed areas where a wall is used as a greywater purification device, it also works as a '''heat exchanger and buffer'''.
* '''Purification''' of the percolating water, so greywater can be used as irrigation water.
* In warm climates, the wall can be used on the sunny side to '''cool the building'''. 
* '''Low-cost housing''': the combined use of Folkewalls and source-separating toilets would "reduce the infrastructure cost by about 30%".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastonline.org/CD3WD_40/JF/JF_OTHER/SMALL/Growing%20wall%20-%20Water.pdf Growing walls]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Follow the money'''" is a [[catchphrase]] popularized by the 1976 [[drama-documentary]] motion picture ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', which suggests a money trail or [[corruption scheme]] within high (often political) office.

==Origin==
For the film, screenwriter [[William Goldman]] attributed the phrase to [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]], the informant who took part in revealing the [[Watergate scandal]]. However, the phrase is mentioned neither in the [[All the President's Men|non-fiction book that preceded the film]], nor in any documentation of the scandal. The book does contain the phrase "The key was the secret campaign cash, and it should all be traced," which Woodward says to Senator [[Sam Ervin]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Bernstein, All the President's Men, Chapter 12, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The phrase ''Follow the money'' was mentioned by [[Henry E. Peterson]] at the 1974 [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearings as [[Earl J. Silbert]] was nominated to U.S. Attorney. A 1975 book by Clive Borrell and Brian Cashinella, ''Crime in Britain Today'', also uses the phrase.

Since the 1970s, "follow the money" has been used several times in [[investigative journalism]] and [[political debate]]. One example is ''Follow the Money'', a series of CBS reports.

===Donald Trump===
In September 2016, the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] used the phrase in criticizing [[Hillary Clinton]] and the [[Clinton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schreckinger |first1=Ben |last2=Vogel |first2=Kenneth P. |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-iowa-money-228873 |title=Trump launches 'follow the money' attack |work=Politico |date=September 28, 2016 |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2017, [[Carl Bernstein]] used the phrase to encourage reporters to discover [[Presidency of Donald Trump|President Trump]]'s potential conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Skoczek |first=Tim |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/politics/carl-bernstein-axe-files/ |title=Carl Bernstein on covering Trump: Follow the money |date=February 2, 2017 |work=CNN |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
*In the 2002 episode "Game Day" (number 9 of the first season) of ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', Detective Lester Freamon uses the phrase when investigating the dealings of a Baltimore criminal gang to explain the political difficulty of investigating organized crime, saying "You follow drugs, you get drug addicts and drug dealers. But you start to follow the money, and you don't know where the fuck it's gonna take you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020636/quotes|title=Det. Lester Freamon (Character)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In "[[Mr. Monk and the Candidate]]", the series premiere of the television series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', [[Adrian Monk]] tells [[Sharona Fleming]] that their next investigative step is to "follow the money", then shivers with excitement and admits, "I've always wanted to say that!"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3192">'''Free video''' refers to [[video]] content that is free to use for any purpose, or licensed under a [[copyleft|free and open license]] to such an effect, at least for distribution, and at most for modification and commercial usage. This can also apply to graphical [[animation]]s.

==Free video and included media==
{{see also|Podsafe}}
To be a free video - referring to freedom (as in [[free software]]), not to [[price]] - a video's entire content must be previously licensed under a free content license. A video is considered legally unfree if any portion of the video was previously licensed under a proprietary license that restricts usage and prevents derivations and commercial usage.

Under this approach, a video cannot be considered free if it includes snippets or whole copies of any text, image, video or audio that has been previously licensed under a proprietary, unfree license. The legal concept of [[fair use]] of a third party's music or other content in one's own video work may protect against [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] takedowns. In the 2015 court case ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Group Inc.]]'', the court determined that [[Universal Music Group]] should have considered fair use before issuing a take-down. The case focuses on the usage of a song licensed by Universal that was used in a [[YouTube]] video of a dancing toddler.

==Free video licenses==
At the moment, there are no known [[List of free content licenses|free content licenses]] that are specifically designed for video content. Instead, most known free video content is under a [[creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons license]] and other, non-media-type-specific free content licenses, or within the [[public domain]] as the video's copyright has already expired.

==Free video formats==
While the discussion on free video is related to an extent to the advocacy for [[Open source codecs and containers|freely-licensed data compression technologies]] such as [[Theora]] for video and [[Ogg Vorbis]] for audio (particularly in the [[HTML 5#Ogg controversy|2008 debate on whether to include the two]] within the [[WHATWG]] draft for [[HTML5]] on multimedia), the latter argument is related more to the advocacy of [[free software]].

However, it is arguable that the free software movement stands to gain from the licensing of video and audio in a freely-usable format under a free content license.

==Free video on Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Commons==
Free video is used extensively on Wikipedia, and is also the exclusive type of video content stored on the Wikimedia Commons. While Wikipedia allows for the uploading of fair use video (only in Ogg Theora format), the Wikimedia Commons strictly forbids the uploading of fair use video or any video containing depiction of symbols or other content that is prior licensed under a proprietary license.

'''GM-AvtoVAZ''' is a joint venture in Russia between [[General Motors]] and [[AvtoVAZ]] set up in 2001 and began producing the [[Chevrolet Niva]], based on the Lada Niva, at its factory in [[Tolyatti]] from 2002. Though both companies have an equal share of ownership, the venture is managed exclusively by General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=«Когда-то Lada по сравнению с Dacia считалась люксовым брендом»|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/auto/characters/2016/06/14/645207-kompaniyu-pribilnosti|accessdate=7 July 2017|publisher=Vedomosti|date=13 June 2016|quote=– В этом СП «АвтоВАЗа» и GM по 50%, но фактически управляет им GM? – Да.Мы являемся для них важным поставщиком и обсуждаем условия по новой платформе.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Chevrolet Niva Concept.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chevrolet Niva]]]]
In 2004 the joint venture briefly produced the [[Chevrolet Viva]], based on the 1998 [[Opel Astra]] saloon, but after low sales of only 5,000 the model was dropped.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|title=GM: Learning the Ropes In Russia|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-02-08/gm-learning-the-ropes-in-russiabusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|work=Bloomberg Business Week|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The joint venture reached difficulties and production stoppages for a fortnight in February 2006 when AvtoVAZ was taken over by [[Rosoboronexport]], the Russian state-owned arms-export agency, and a disagreement between the new owners and GM lead to stoppages of the supply of engines and other components.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;

The joint venture announced plans in September 2012 to expand by 2015, with an additional 1400 staff and increasing its annual production capacity from 100,000 to 120,000 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GM-AvtoVaz To Expand Capacity By 20% By 2015|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120921-702821.html|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
[[File:Russia Re-Industrializes as Energy Boom Fades.theora.ogv|thumbnail|[[Voice of America]] report, showing operations inside the plant and an interview with a representative from GM Russia.]]
The joint venture was created with investment from GM ($99.1m, 41.61%), AvtoVAZ ($99.1m, 41.61%) and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] ($40m, 16,78%, plus a loan facility for $100 million). In September 2012 GM and Avtovaz purchased EBRD's share, turning the joint venture into a 50/50 relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Company|url=http://gm-avtovaz.ru/en/company/chevrolet_niva/|website=GM Avtovaz|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
As of December 2014, the joint venture has produced 571,852 vehicles since production at Tolyatti commenced in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Production and Sales Results|url=http://gm-avtovaz.ru/en/company/news/2014_production_and_sales_results/|website=GM AutoVAZ|accessdate=22 January 2015|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerald Fitzgibbon''', [[King's Counsel|K.C.]] (8 October 1866 – 6 December 1942),&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Kenneth ed. ''King's Inns Barristers 1868-2004''   Dublin 2006 p.187&lt;/ref&gt; was an Irish barrister, [[Independent politician|independent]] [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) and one of the original judges of the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]].

==Family==
He came from a noted legal family: his grandfather, [[Gerald Fitzgibbon (author)|Gerald Fitzgibbon]] was a [[Queen's Counsel]]  and [[Master in Chancery]] and his father, also [[Gerald FitzGibbon (Irish lawyer)|Gerald Fitzgibbon]], was a [[Lord Justice]] of the pre-independence [[Irish Court of Appeal]]: along with [[Christopher Palles]] and [[Hugh Holmes]], the second Gerald  Fitzgibbon was credited with making the Court of Appeal a tribunal whose judgements are still quoted with respect today. Mr. Justice Fitzgibbon through his mother was the grandson of [[Francis Alexander FitzGerald]],  Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)|Court of Exchequer]].

==Early career==
He was born in [[Dublin]] into an [[Church of Ireland|Anglican]] family, eldest son of Gerald Fitzgibbon and Margaret Anne Fitzgerald. He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, and the [[University of Dublin]], where he took his degree of  Bachelor of Arts. He was called to the [[Irish Bar]] in 1887, practised on the [[Munster]] Circuit, became [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1908, and a Bencher of the [[King's Inns]]  in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
He was elected unopposed to the [[House of Commons of Southern Ireland]] at the [[Irish elections, 1921|1921 elections]], representing the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] constituency as an independent [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]], and acted as Speaker at its single session, with only four representatives attending. As a unionist he did not participate in the Second Dáil.&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;HouseNum=3&amp;MemberID=407&amp;ConstID=95|title=Mr. Gerald Fitzgibbon|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected for the same constituency at the [[Irish general election, 1922|1922 general election]] and became a member of the [[Third Dáil]]. He did not contest the [[Irish general election, 1923|1923 general election]].&lt;ref name=elecs_irl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1129|title=Gerald Fitzgibbon|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==
In 1924, the forced retirement of almost all the senior judges of the former regime made the selection  of suitable replacements a serious issue. [[Hugh Kennedy]], the new [[Chief Justice of the Irish Free State]], recommended Fitzgibbon as a judge of the Supreme Court simply on account of his legal ability,&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, Gerard V.  ''Chief Justice Kennedy and Sir James O'Connor's application''  Irish Jurist Vol. 23 p.144&lt;/ref&gt; despite their serious differences on political issues, which Hogan refers to  as a clash between Kennedy's "enthusiastic nationalism" and Fitzgibbon's "pessimistic scepticism".&lt;ref&gt;Hogan p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Hugh Kennedy===
Kennedy soon came to regret his decision to recommend Fitzgibbon for appointment to the Bench: his diary records the increasing tension between the two men.  Although Fitzgibbon was a [[Protestant]] Unionist,  his  friends insisted  that he was by no means opposed, at first,  to the new regime&lt;ref name="Hogan p.157"&gt;Hogan p.157&lt;/ref&gt;  (and indeed if he had been,  he would hardly have accepted high office in it). However he seems to have  become deeply disillusioned  with the increasingly [[Roman Catholic]] [[Irish Free State]], and by 1929 he and Chief Justice Kennedy are said to have regarded each other with deep suspicion.&lt;ref name="Hogan p.157"/&gt;

The tension came to a head in 1935 when Fitzgibbon was in the majority in ''State (Ryan) v Lennon''; over  Kennedy's strong dissenting judgment,  he found that the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] contained provisions for its own amendment which allowed for  suspension of the most basic [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;''State (Ryan) v Lennon'' [1935] 1 I.R. 170, esp. 235-237.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Re Westby''&lt;ref&gt;[1934] I.R. p.311&lt;/ref&gt; in 1934, on the straightforward  question of whether a Protestant [[ward (law)|ward of court]] should or should not be educated at an English [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]],   Chief Justice Kennedy's decision that the boy should be educated in Ireland was overruled by the Supreme Court, presided over by Fitzgibbon. Kennedy regarded Fitzgibbon's judgment as a personal attack on him.

===Later years===
He took some interest in the enactment of the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] and made some suggestions on the procedure for referring a Bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26.

Despite his obvious unhappiness in his professional life,   he remained on the Supreme  Court until he reached retirement age in 1938;  Chief Justice  Kennedy believed that his  somewhat unsatisfactory [[pension]]  arrangements made Fitzgibbon cling to  an office he had come to despise. Hogan points out that in this regard  at least Fitzgibbon had  good reason to be bitter with his treatment by the Government: because he was required on age grounds to retire 9 months before he qualified for the full amount, he seems to have received a pension equivalent to only 42% of his salary.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan p,151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works, honors, and recognition==
In 1966, Kay served on the California Governor's Commission on the Family, which proposed that California adopt a no-fault regime for divorce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5475">The '''hut tax''' was a type of [[tax]]ation introduced by [[British Empire|British]] [[colonialism|colonialists]] in [[Africa]] on a per hut or household basis. It was variously payable in money, labour, grain or stock and benefited the colonial authorities in four related ways: it raised money; it supported the currency (see [[chartalism]]); it broadened the cash economy, aiding further development; and it forced Africans to labour in the colonial economy.&lt;ref name =Scramble/&gt; Households which had survived on, and stored their wealth in cattle ranching now sent members to work for the colonialists in order to raise cash with which to pay the tax. The colonial economy depended upon black African labour to build new towns and railways, and in southern Africa to work in the rapidly developing mines.

==South Africa==
By 1908 the following hut taxes were imposed in southern Africa: 
* In Natal, under Law 13 of 1857, 14 [[shillings]] per hut occupied by natives. Natives that lived in European style houses with only one wife were exempt from the tax.&lt;ref name="garran-n157"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garran|first=Robert|title=The government of South Africa|publisher=Central News Agency|location=Cape Town|year=1908|pages=n157|chapter=XXII - Sources of Revenue|url=https://archive.org/details/governmentofsout02centiala|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In the [[Transkei]], 10 [[shillings]] per hut.&lt;ref name="garran-n159"/&gt;
* In the [[Cape Colony]], various forms of the "house duty" had existed since the 1850s. The tax was legally applicable to all house-owners in the Cape, regardless of race or region, but was only partially enforced, especially in rural areas. A full and universally applicable house tax was imposed in 1870 (Act 9 of 1870), and was more fully enforced, due to the government's severe financial difficulties at the time.&lt;ref group="1870 Note"&gt;For houses valued under £100, five shillings were levied; for houses valued between £100 and £500, ten shillings were levied; for houses valued between £500 and £1,000, twenty shillings were levied; and for every additional £500 above, an additional ten shillings were added to the tax amount.&lt;/ref&gt; The highly unpopular tax was terminated in 1872 (Act 11 of 1872), but a new and higher duty was applied by the [[Gordon Sprigg|Sprigg]] government during the wars of 1878, when government expenditure was extremely high. The Cape's most controversial "hut tax" was established under Act 37 of 1884, and specified 10 [[shillings]] per hut with exclusions for the elderly and infirm. It was repealed under Act 4 of 1889.&lt;ref name="garran-n159"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garran|first=Robert|title=The government of South Africa|publisher=Central News Agency|location=Cape Town|year=1908|pages=n159|chapter=XXII - Sources of Revenue|url=https://archive.org/details/governmentofsout02centiala|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zimbabwe==
In [[Mashonaland]], now part of [[Zimbabwe]], hut tax was introduced at the rate of ten [[shilling]]s per hut in 1894.&lt;ref name =Scramble/&gt; Although authorized by the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]] in London, the tax was paid to the [[British South Africa Company]], the agent of colonial government in the area. Coinciding with confiscations of cattle, the introduction of forced labour and a series of natural disasters, the tax probably contributed to the [[Shona people|Shona]] part of the rebellion against the colonialists in 1896, known as the First ''[[Chimurenga]]'' or [[Second Matabele War]].&lt;ref name =Scramble&gt;

[[Liberia]] also implemented a hut tax, which in one case led to a [[Kru people|Kru]] revolt in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/BarclayArthur6.htm President Arthur Barclay (1904-1912): External and internal threats to Americo-Liberian rule]. liberiapastandpresent.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.denison.edu/~waite/liberia/history/30-44.htm |title=Liberia from 1930 to 1944 |publisher=Personal.denison.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidental questions in private international law with respect to the problems and elements discussed below{{Conflict of laws}}
In the Roman [[private international law|conflict of laws]], an '''incidental question''' is a legal issue that arises in connection with the major cause of action in a [[lawsuit]]. The forum [[court]] will have already decided that it has [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case (resolving any issue relating to [[forum shopping]]) and will be working through the next two stages of the conflict process, namely: [[characterisation (conflict)|characterisation]] and [[choice of law]]. For example, the court may classify the cause as "succession", but it notes that the [[plaintiff]] brings the claim for relief as the deceased's widow. Before the court can adjudicate on the main issue, it must first decide whether the plaintiff actually has the status claimed, i.e. the incidental question would be the validity of the claimed [[marriage (conflict)|marriage]]. The inconvenient reality is that many lawsuits involve a number of interdependent legal issues. In purely domestic cases, this poses no difficulty because a judge will freely move from one domestic law to another to resolve the dispute. But in a conflict case, the question is whether the incidental question is resolved by reference either to its own choice of law rules, or to the same law that governs the main issue (the ''[[lex causae]]''). [[Jurisdiction (area)|States]] have not formulated a consistent answer to this question.

For an incidental question to arise, the forum court must have applied its characterisation rules to determine that:
*the main cause of action is governed by a foreign law;
*as a precondition to the main cause of action, there is a subsidiary question which has its own choice of law rule pointing to a different ''lex causae'';
*there will be a different result depending on which foreign law is applied.

Suppose that a French court hears the case of an American [[nationality|national]] who dies [[domicile (law)|domiciled]] in [[California]] leaving movables in England. The French choice of law rule would refer the distribution of personal property to California law which has [[community property]] provisions entitling his widow to share in his estate. The marriage was in England and, as both the ''[[lex loci celebrationis]]'' and the ''[[lex situs]]'', [[English law]] declares it valid even though it is void ''ab initio'' under California law because it is considered [[bigamy|bigamous]] (see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]): a [[divorce (conflict)|divorce]] decree granted by the Arcadian courts was recognised as valid in England, but not in California. Should the widow's claim be determined by the English or California law? There are different views:
*the widow's claim should be dismissed because otherwise the French conflict rule that succession to movables is governed by California law would be undermined;
*the widow should be entitled to share in her husband's estate because otherwise the French conflict rule that the validity of the marriage is governed by English law would be undermined.
One of the more interesting cases on this topic is the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Canadian Supreme Court]] case of ''Schwebel v Ungar'' [1964] 48 DLR (2d) 644 in which a Jewish husband and wife, domiciled in [[Hungary]], married in Hungary. While they were emigrating to [[Israel]], they found themselves in [[Italy]] and the husband divorced his wife by [[get (conflict)|get]]. Under the laws of Hungary (their ''[[lex domicilii]]'') and Italy, the religious form of divorce was invalid, but it was recognised as effective by the law of Israel where they acquired a domicile of choice. Subsequently, the wife moved to [[Canada]] and, without abandoning her Israeli domicile, went through a second ceremony of marriage. The second husband petitioned for nullity alleging that the marriage was bigamous. The Supreme Court held the marriage to be valid. The main question was the wife's capacity to marry which, under [[law of Canada|Canadian law]], is determined by her ''lex domicilii'', i.e. the law of Israel at the time of the second ceremony. The incidental question was the validity of the divorce which was to be determined either by their ''lex domicilii'' at the relevant time or by Italian law as the ''[[lex loci actus]]''. The judgment seems to suggest that the court decided both questions by reference to the law of Israel as the law governing the main question.

In ''Lawrence v Lawrence'' [1985] Fam 106 the English Court of Appeal was asked by the second husband to rule on the validity of another potentially bigamous marriage. The wife first married in [[Brazil]] and then divorced the husband in [[Nevada]] (this was not recognised in Brazil) and immediately married the second husband in Nevada. The two laws were the wife's ''lex domicilii'' to which English choice of law rules referred her capacity to marry (under Brazilian law she lacked capacity to marry the second husband) and the validity of the second marriage which was determined under the ''lex loci celebrationis''. The case was decided by characterising the case as one of divorce recognition rather than capacity to marry.

The outcome suggests that the same law will be applied to both the main and the incidental questions on the understanding that the forum court is probably making a [[public policy (law)|policy]] decision on which outcome is the more desirable{{spaced ndash}}in both cases, the courts seem to have been interested in upholding the validity of the second marriage reflecting a rebuttable presumption in both jurisdictions to recognise marriages valid under their ''lex loci celebrationis'' in default of any strong policy reason to the contrary.

'''Judicial appointments''' '''in Canada''' are made by &lt;nowiki/&gt;the federal government or provincial government. Superior and federal court judges are appointed by federal government, while inferior courts are appointed by the provincial government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

== Court system ==
There are two levels of courts in each [[provinces and territories of Canada|province or territory]] (except [[Nunavut]]): [[superior court|superior]] (upper level) courts appointed by the [[Canadian government|federal government]], and a [[provincial court|provincial or territorial court]] appointed by the province or territory.

==Provincial courts==

=== Advisory committee ===
Candidates for these courts are screened by a judicial advisory committee established for each province or territory. Several provinces have created arm's length committees that make a short list of recommendations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Committee are often composed of representatives of the federal and provincial governments, the legal profession, the judiciary, and the general public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Ontario Judicial Appointments Advisory Committee ====
In Ontario, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Committee (JAAC) is made up of 13 members: 7 lay members, 2 judges, 1 member appointed by the Ontario Judicial Council, and 3 from the legal community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the system argue that this procedure has limited [[patronage]] appoints to Ontario courts, and has diversified the makeup of judges in the province.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike other committees, the JAAC advertises openings and interviews candidates in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===
Lawyers who meet the [[Law of Canada|legal]] and [[Constitution of Canada|constitutional]] requirements can apply, as well as existing provincial or territorial court judges. These candidates must complete a comprehensive Personal History Form, which is submitted to the appropriate advisory committee. In its assessment of each candidate, the committee reviews the PHF and consults references and other persons both in and outside the legal realm. Some committees interview the candidate.

== Superior and federal courts ==

=== Judicial Appointment Committees ===
A committee of eight persons vets candidates in each region across Canada.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each candidate is assessed as being "recommended" or "not recommended."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A third designation, "highly recommended" was eliminated in 2007, which critics say enhanced the government's ability to make patronage appointments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The federal government said the system emphasizes merit, and the large pool allows the government "to address the particular needs of the court in question."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Minister of Justice ===
A list of all candidates reviewed by the committee, together with the above categorization and reasons, or "comments" in the case of judge candidates, is forwarded by the committee to the federal [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]].

The Minister draws an appointment from the list of names received from the committees, and recommends that individual to the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]]. Where the appointment is that of a [[Chief Justice of Canada|Chief Justice]] or a [[Puisne Justice]], the recommendation to cabinet is made by the [[Prime Minister of Canada]].

"Elevation," or the appointment of a superior court judge already in office to another superior court (usually an appellate court), is not subject to the above application and assessment procedures. These appointments are effected through a recommendation to cabinet by the Minister of Justice (or Prime Minister) following consultations undertaken by the Minister.

In November 2005, a [[standing committee (Canada)|subcommittee of the Canadian parliament]] expressed the need for change and for more [[Transparency (social)|transparency]] in this appointment process. The subcommittee proposed that the Minister consult the Chief Justice of the court involved on the needs of the court prior to an appointment, that specific court vacancies and their requirements be advertised and that, subject to further study, advisory committees develop a short list of interviewed candidates for each vacancy.

===Federal courts===
Appointments to the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] and to the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] are subject to the application and assessment procedure.  
 
Appointments to the Tax Court are subject to candidate assessments by a single five member advisory committee for all Canada which includes a representative of the Tax Court—as a one-year pilot project announced in November 2006.

==Supreme Court of Canada==
Eligibility for the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is set out in the [[Supreme Court Act]]. Judges of the court are made up of eight [[puisne judge]]s and the [[Chief Justice of Canada|Chief Justice]].&lt;ref name=SCC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Supreme Court of Canada|url=http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/info/eng-ang.pdf|website=|publisher=Supreme Court of Canada|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates must have either been a judge of a superior court or a lawyer for at least ten years in their province's bar.&lt;ref name=Parl&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court of Canada|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/SupremeCourt.aspx?Menu=SupremeCourt&amp;Current=True|website=Parliament of Canada|publisher=Library of Parliament|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointments are made by the [[Governor General of Canada]] on advice of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=Parl /&gt;

Appointments to the Supreme Court of Canada are subject to the legal requirement that three judges must be appointed from [[Quebec]]. By [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], the other 6 are appointed from [[Ontario]] (3), [[Western Canada]] (2), and [[Atlantic Canada]] (1). These appointments are not subject to the procedures described above for the appointment of superior court judges, and are made on the basis of a recommendation to cabinet by the Prime Minister. Recently, this has been augmented through the establishment of an ad hoc advisory committee for each vacancy on the Court; this committee reviews a list of 7 nominees submitted by the federal Minister of Justice, and shortlists three candidates from which the Prime Minister chooses a name for appointment. In addition, in February 2006 a parliamentary committee was allowed to interview the Prime Minister's selected candidate prior to his appointment.

===Criticism of process===
The appointment process has been the source of some controversy in recent years, as appointments occur with no input from [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] or [[Official Opposition (Canada)|opposition political parties]]. Critics{{Who|date=September 2014}} have alleged that this process has allowed the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] to effectively "stack" the courts with ideologically like-minded individuals who will support the current government's stance. Conservative critics{{Who|date=September 2014}} have argued this leads to the rise of partisan, [[activist judge]]s instead of neutral ones. Conversely, supporters{{Who|date=September 2014}} have justified the process of appointment on the grounds that quiet appointments made as a result of the Prime Minister's consultation with experts result in better choices than ones that would be made in a public process where opposition politicians were allowed to interrogate the nominees and politicize the process.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Recent developments===

====Under Martin====
In response to the critics, Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] made a few changes the appointment process in 2004. He indicated his intention to appoint a special parliamentary committee to screen the new nominees and report to parliament on their findings, though neither this committee nor the parliament has the power to block recommendations.  Similarly, the committee would not have the ability to directly interview the nominee. The Minister of Justice appeared before the  House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to explain, for the first time in public, the process for selecting the justices.&lt;ref name=Parliament&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKay|first1=Robin|title=Appointments to the Supreme Court of Canada|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2011-65-e.htm|website=Parliament of Canada|publisher=Library of Parliament Research Publications|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the names of Justices [[Rosalie Abella|Abella]] and [[Louise Charron|Charron]] were put forward, parliament was [[dissolution of parliament|dissolved]], and thus unable to form committees. The government announced that the nominees would be reviewed by a special parliamentary committee, which would issue a report to Parliament. An ad hoc parliamentary committee was created to review Abella and Charron's appointments.&lt;ref name=Parliament /&gt;

In addition to the parliamentarians, the committee also had two members of the [[Canadian Judicial Council]], sitting judges who participated in the [[in camera|closed door]] discussions on the process, and recused themselves for the consideration of the specific appointees.  Committee members from the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] refused to sign their committee's final report, calling the entire process "insufficient."

In April 2005, the [[Twenty-Seventh Canadian Ministry|Liberal government]] announced another change to the selection process: the advisory committee (which includes many federal nominees) would see a list of seven names given to them by the Minister of Justice and would be required to cut the list to three.  The Prime Minister would choose one name from the list of the three remaining candidates to put forward to the Governor General.  The advisory committee includes a [[Member of Parliament]] from each [[official party status|recognized party]], a retired judge and, from the region where the vacancy arises, a nominee of the provincial [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorneys General]], a nominee of the law societies and two prominent Canadians who are neither lawyers nor judges. A new advisory committee will be formed each time a Supreme Court vacancy occurs.

====Under Harper====
In February 2006, Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]'s used an "Ad Hoc Committee to Review a Nominee for the Supreme Court of Canada" to interview [[Marshall Rothstein]] prior to his appointment.&lt;ref name=Parliament/&gt; The committee had no power to veto the nomination, which was simply to allow for questions from parliamentarians.&lt;ref name=Parliament /&gt; The Prime Minister maintained the final say on who to recommend for appointment.&lt;ref name=Parliament /&gt;

In 2011, Harper again appointed two Supreme Court justices, [[Andromache Karakatsanis]] and [[Michael Moldaver]], from a shortlist of 6 candidates unanimously approved by a multi-party committee of [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]], [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], and [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|Members of Parliament]].&lt;ref name=Star&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacCharles|first1=Tonda|title=Supreme Court appointments highlight a secret process|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/10/17/supreme_court_appointments_highlight_a_secret_process.html|accessdate=18 September 2014|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They each later appeared before hoc parliamentary committees, although the committee had no authority to approve or deny the appointments.&lt;ref name=Star /&gt;

In 2013, Harper appointed [[Marc Nadon]] as a member from Quebec.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Prime Minister of Canada |url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=1&amp;featureId=6&amp;pageId=26&amp;id=5714 |title=PM announces appointment of Justice Marc Nadon to the Supreme Court of Canada |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220405/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=1&amp;featureId=6&amp;pageId=26&amp;id=5714 |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to controversy about the appointment, the federal government referred the constitutionality of the appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada. In their decision in ''[[Reference Re Supreme Court Act, ss 5 and 6]]'', the Supreme Court quashed his appointment, concluding he did not meet the eligibility criteria provided in the ''Supreme Court Act''.&lt;ref name="Jordan Press"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/21/marc-nadon-not-allowed-to-sit-on-supreme-court-of-canada-top-court-rules/ |title=Marc Nadon not allowed to sit on Supreme Court of Canada, top court rules |author=Jordan Press |accessdate=March 21, 2014 |date=March 21, 2014 |publisher=''[[National Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Chief Justice [[Beverley McLachlin]] called Harper to consult with him on the advisability of Nadon's appointment. Harper refused to take the call and criticized McLachlin for making the call. Harper's comments were criticized by the legal community and a complaint was forwarded to the [[International Commission of Jurists]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/05/02/stephen_harper_lashes_out_at_top_judge_on_supreme_court.html |title=Stephen Harper lashes out at top judge on Supreme Court |date=May 2, 2014 |newspaper=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/05/13/canadas_legal_community_steps_up_its_demand_that_stephen_harper_withdraw_criticism_of_chief_justice.html |title=Legal community demands Stephen Harper withdraw criticism of Beverley McLachlin |date=May 13, 2014 |newspaper=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICJ concluded that McLachlin deserved an apology from Harper, but none had been given as of July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/politics/beverley-mclachlin-chief-justice-deserves-apology-from-pm-international-jurists-say-1.2718342 |title=International Commission of Jurists demands Stephen Harper apologize to Beverley McLachlin |date=July 25, 2014 |newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenure of judges and removal from the bench==

Judges in positions that are under federal control (federally appointed positions) are eligible to serve on the bench until age 75.  In some but not all Provincial and Territorial positions, appointed judges have tenure until age 70 instead.

As for removal from the bench, judges have only rarely been removed from the bench in Canada.  For federally appointed judges, it is the task of the Canadian Judicial Council to investigate complaints and allegations of misconduct on the part of federally appointed judges. The Council may recommend to the (federal) Minister of Justice that the judge be removed.  To do so, the Minister must in turn get the approval of both the House of Commons and the Senate before a judge can be removed from office. (The rules for provincial/territorial judges are similar, but they can be removed by a provincial or territorial cabinet.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/dept-min/pub/ccs-ajc/page4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206002308/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/dept-min/pub/ccs-ajc/page4.html |archivedate=2011-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''legal status of ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' in the [[United States]]''' varies, with 29 states (and the territory of [[Guam]]) having completely banned it and others considering proposals for banning its use.

{{TOC right}}

==Background==
In late 2002, [[Rep. Joe Baca]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]- California) introduced a bill (Congress bill HR 5607) to schedule salvia as a controlled substance at the national level.  Those opposed to Joe Baca's bill include [[Daniel Siebert (ethnobotanist)|Daniel Siebert]], who sent a letter to Congress arguing against the proposed legislation,&lt;ref name="Siebert2002"&gt;[[#refSiebert2002|Siebert 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [http://www.cognitiveliberty.org Center for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics] (CCLE), who sent key members of the US Congress a report on ''Salvia divinorum'' and its active principle,&lt;ref name="Boire2002"&gt;[[#refBoire2002|Boire 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt; along with letters from an array of scientists who expressed concern that scheduling ''Salvia divinorum'' would negatively impact important research on the plant.  Baca's bill did not pass.

Despite this, a number of states have proposed their own legislation. For example, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee,  Delaware, Florida, Illinois, North Dakota, and Minnesota have so far passed laws prohibiting ''Salvia divinorum''. ''Salvia divinorum'' remains legal in other states, however. Though some bills have died during session, the situation is subject to further change pending the outcome of more recent bills still at the proposal stage.

Similar to the international situation, in the United States, where individual state legislation does exist, it varies from state to state in its prohibitive degree. Some states, such as Delaware, Louisiana, and Missouri, have imposed the strictest Schedule I classification. By contrast, the state of Maine has passed laws imposing age restrictions, prohibiting use by and sale to minors under 18 years of age - in a manner generally consistent with controls existing for tobacco and alcohol.&lt;ref name="Haskell20070208"&gt;[[#refHaskell20070208|Haskell 2007-02-08 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Tennessee has some provision for ''Salvia divinorum'' in its natural plant form. - There the law classes its use as a 'Class A misdemeanour', but it is not an offence to possess, plant, cultivate, grow, or harvest ''Salvia divinorum'' for "aesthetic, landscaping, or decorative purposes".&lt;ref name="Burchett2006"&gt;[[#refBurchett2006|Burchett 2006]], section 1 (c).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states there is no mention of ''Salvia divinorums's'' active constituent at all. In Delaware for example the plant in its natural form is classified as 'Schedule I', while much more potent purely extracted salvinorin A remains quite legal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPeterson2006|Peterson 2006]], section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Illinois, the wording of the legislation does not mention salvinorin A either, but instead includes "the seeds thereof, any extract from any part of that plant, and every compound, ''[...]'' derivative, mixture, or preparation of that plant".&lt;ref name="Reboletti2007JanFTp7"&gt;[[#refReboletti2007Jan|Reboletti 2007 (Jan)]], full text - p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Siebert has criticised this wording as being "absurdly broad in scope, for it implies that any substance extracted from ''Salvia divinorum'' (water, chlorophyll, whatever) would be treated as a Schedule I controlled substance under the proposed law."&lt;ref name="ErowidLegalStatus"&gt;[[#refErowidLegalStatus|Erowid (Legal status)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] has indicated on its website that it is aware of ''Salvia divinorum'' and is evaluating the plant for possible scheduling. Daniel Siebert claims he was informed on July 20, 2007, that the DEA had initiated an Eight Factor Analysis of ''Salvia divinorum''. The Controlled Substances Act requires that this analysis be performed before a substance can be scheduled as a controlled substance. The eight factors considered are:
* Actual and potential for abuse
* Pharmacology
* Other current scientific knowledge
* History and current pattern of abuse
* Scope, duration, and significance of abuse
* Public health risk
* Psychic or physiological dependence liability
* If an immediate precursor of a controlled substance

Based on the results of the analysis, the DEA may recommend that ''Salvia divinorum'' be scheduled as a controlled substance. This analysis will probably take several months to be completed. Siebert said "Given that there is no compelling evidence to suggest that ''Salvia divinorum'' presents a significant risk to public safety, I am hopeful that the DEA will be reasonable and not criminalize this beneficial plant unnecessarily. If they do decide to criminalize it, it will take a minimum of 30 days after they give public notice of their intentions in the Federal Register before the change of legal status takes effect."&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus"&gt;[[#refSiebertLegalStatus|Siebert (Legal status)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2007, Senator Hank Erwin (R) proposed [http://www.thesafeharbor.org/uploads/news/SB330-int.pdf Senate Bill 330], which would have made ''Salvia divinorum'' a Schedule I substance in Alabama; however, the bill died in the Senate Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEhinger20071022|Ehinger 2007-10-22 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2007, State Senator Roger Bedford (D-Russellville), and Representative Johnny Mack Morrow (D-Red Bay) were reported as saying that they are going to propose legislation again that would make salvia a Schedule I drug, in Alabama.

Morrow said - "Drug dealers throughout America are always trying to come up with new methods of selling our children drugs," [...] "This legislation is all about protecting our children."

Bedford said - "We want to see the law catch up with these designer drugs".

Franklin County District Attorney Joey Rushing said that he hopes Alabama can step up as a leader in fighting to control it before it becomes a major problem - "It's cheap, it's easy to buy and it's dangerous," [...] "Those are combinations that we need to stop before it's too late" he said.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWillis20071018|Willis 2007-10-18 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, it was reported that Senator Bedford's bill had died, having never got onto the Senate's work agenda.

Senator Hank Erwin, who was sponsoring a salvia bill for the second year, was reported as saying that he will try again next year "because people of any age can legally buy salvia in Alabama".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRawls20080508|Rawls 2008-05-08 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alaska===
On April 5, 2006, Senator Gene P. Therriault (R) proposed adding ''Salvia divinorum'' to Alaska's list of Schedule IIA controlled substances. The bill died in committee.

On January 16, 2007, he proposed another bill (Senate Bill 38).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTherriault2007|Therriault 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2008, the Anchorage Daily News reported that the bill still remained in the Finance Committee, but that Therriault hoped it would be addressed in the 2008 session. The bill did not progress last time because it got buried behind higher-priority bills that needed to be heard in Finance, said Miles Baker, legislative assistant to Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, who co-chairs the committee.

Therriault claimed that the drug's effects are similar to LSD's, and too powerful, dangerous and unpredictable to leave it unrestricted. "What I'm trying to do here is be proactive instead of reactive to the newest drug on the scene," he said. Theriault also communicated in an email to an individual expressing concern over the criminalization of this plant that "we cannot have people worshiping plants" which raises concern over his Baptist background and the separation of religion and State.

Lt. Andy Greenstreet, deputy commander of the Alaska Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Enforcement said, "Reports of problems stemming from the plant's use are rare to nonexistent in Alaska."

Jack Degenstein, with the [[Alaska Libertarian Party]], who opposed Therriault's bill in a Senate hearing in 2007, said, "This is absolutely not a public safety risk" [...] "just because it's powerful doesn't mean it's dangerous."

Jason Dowell, chairman of the Alaska Libertarian Party, said people should have the freedom to choose, especially when the choice is about a plant that has had traditional medicinal uses in Mexico. "It's ridiculous that they would try to make plants illegal," Dowell said. "It's just a recipe for disaster. They're going to send innocent people to prison and invade their privacy."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHalpin20080202|Halpin 2008-02-02 (US Media story)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Seibert's website reported that Therriault's second salvia bill (Senate Bill 38) also died in committee.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus"/&gt;

However, in February 2009, it was reported that Alaska's Health and Social Services committee has passed (referred to the next stage Judiciary committee) Therriault's third attempt to outlaw salvia (Senate Bill 52).

"The problem with continuing to allow uncontrolled access to salvia is that the long term effects appear to be the same as other hallucinogens, such as LSD and mescaline, and that is often depression and schizophrenia," said Sen. Gene Therriault.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAlaska20090224|Alaska State Legislature 2009-02-24 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
On February 5, 2007, Assembly Member [https://web.archive.org/web/20070815102603/http://republican.assembly.ca.gov/members/Index.asp?Dist=59&amp;Lang=1 Anthony Adams] (R) proposed Assembly Bill 259.&lt;ref name="Adams2007"&gt;[[#refAdams2007|Adams 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; The bill wording was amended on March 12, 2007 to include salvinorin A. The bill proposed adding ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A to California's list of Schedule I controlled substances.

The bill was referred to the [http://www.assembly.ca.gov/acs/newcomframeset.asp?committee=57 Committee on Public Safety] with a due date for public hearing on March 27, 2007. [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20041009203015/http://www.assembly.ca.gov/committee_hearings/stand_comm_hearing.asp] The bill analysis [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_0251-0300/ab_259_cfa_20070326_094143_asm_comm.html] indicated that opposition to the bill was registered by, among others, [[Daniel Siebert (ethnobotanist)|Daniel Siebert]] and the [[Drug Policy Alliance]]. The bill was defeated in Committee by a 3-2 vote. A reconsideration was granted and the second hearing was on January 15, 2008.&lt;ref name="Adams2007" /&gt;

The bill wording was significantly amended on January 7, 2008. The proposal for Schedule I classification was dropped and replaced instead with restrictions on the sale to minors. Section 379 to be added to the penal code - "Every person who sells, dispenses, distributes, furnishes, administers, gives, or offers to sell, dispense, distribute, furnish, administer, or give ''Salvia divinorum'' or salvinorin A, or any substance or material containing ''Salvia divinorum'' or salvinorin A, to any person who is less than 18 years of age, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding six months, or by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment."

The amended bill was passed out from the Assembly Committee on Appropriations to 'Consent Calendar' with a recommendation 'Do Pass' (Ayes 16,  Noes 0) on January 24, 2008, having passed the Assembly Committee on Public Safety (Ayes 7, Noes 0) the previous week.&lt;ref name="Adams2008"&gt;[[#refAdams2008|Adams 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams said he was initially asked to address the issue of ''Salvia divinorum'' by officials from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Lt. Barbara Ferguson, the department's legislative liaison, said "I am not real happy with the limited bill that we have. Our intention, when we started this, was to make it completely illegal. ... But because of how liberal the legislature is here in California, that was impossible to do. There will come a time when we can completely outlaw it here in California."&lt;ref name=Bigham20080505&gt;[[#refBigham20080505|Bigham 2008-05-05 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that Anthony Adams had met Kathy Chidester during discussions over the bill. Kathy Chidester believes salvia was a contributing factor to her son's suicide, which occurred in January 2006. She argued for an outright ban in her home state of Delaware. Schedule I classification was introduced there three months after the teenager's death in the form of "[[Brett’s law]]". Since then Kathy Chidester has campaigned more widely to see bans introduced in other states.&lt;ref name=Bigham20080505/&gt;

Adams's amended bill passed unanimously in the Assembly on January 29, 2008 (Ayes: 76, Nays: 0). It passed in the Senate on July 2, 2008 (ayes: 23, nays: 5). Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) signed the bill into law on July 22, 2008. It went into effect on January 1, 2009.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus"/&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Delaware===
On January 23, 2006, Delaware teenager, [[Brett’s law#Case|Brett Chidester]] took his own life by climbing into a tent with a charcoal grill where he died of carbon monoxide poisoning [http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060226/NEWS/602260356/-1/NEWS01]. In an essay found after his death, he wrote "Salvia allows us to give up our senses and wander in the interdimensional time and space…Also, and this is probably hard for most to accept, our existence in general is pointless. Final point: Us earthly humans are nothing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChalmers2006|Chalmers 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it was written earlier, Brett's notes have subsequently been presented in media reports as if they were part of his suicide note. Brett's suicide note did not mention salvia. There are arguably more relevant factors, with the extent and significance of Brett's use of alcohol being a matter of contention [[Talk:Brett Chidester]], and with it being [https://web.archive.org/web/20080105212407/http://www.nbc10.com/news/8628557/detail.html reported] that Brett had been suffering from depression. Given the details of Brett's suicide, in particular its premeditated nature and slow method, it is unlikely that he was immediately under ''Salvia divinorum's'' influence at the time of his death. There have been no other reported cases of salvia-related suicides anywhere else in the world. Also, Brett had told his parents that he had actually ceased his experimentation with the plant.

Despite the doubts that have been expressed about the lack of evidence against salvia in this case [http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/2006/04/herb-induces-hallucinations-proposed.html], [http://www.legis.state.de.us/Legislature.nsf/7f4f680c99e8e0d1852569c10055e9d4/5346256aaf6cd669852569d8005369f3?OpenDocument# Senator Karen Peterson] sponsored [http://www.legis.state.de.us/LIS/LIS143.NSF/93487d394bc01014882569a4007a4cb7/0ba011176a7dcf3e852571310079379e?OpenDocument Senate Bill 259], "Brett’s law", which passed as state legislation classifying ''Salvia divinorum'' as a Schedule I controlled substance.

Senator Karen Peterson and Brett's parents Kathy and Dennis Chidester have subsequently continued to campaign for and support [[Controlled Substances Act#Drug Schedules|Schedule I]] legislation beyond their home state of Delaware. [http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=local&amp;id=4188369]

===Florida===

''Salvia divinorum'' is a Schedule I [[controlled substance]] in the state of [[Florida]] making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.&lt;ref name="Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL"&gt;[http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0800-0899/0893/0893.html Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL]&lt;/ref&gt; Its listing in Schedule I reads as follows: {{quote|35. Salvia divinorum, except for any drug product approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] which contains Salvia divinorum or its isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers, if the existence of such isomers, esters, ethers, and salts is possible within the specific chemical designation.}}

This reveals a certain level of incompetence or sloppyness in whomever wrote the statute since ''Salvia divinorum'' is a plant, not a chemical, and therefore cannot have [[isomers]], [[esters]], [[ethers]], [[salts]], nor salts of isomers, esters, or ethers. However, this is addressed on the next line of the statue with the listing of salvia A.

The Florida statute lists ''Salvia divnorum'' and salvia A as separate substances, thusly making possession of the plant illegal as well as the salts of isomers, esters, or ethers derived from the plant.

In March 2008 it was reported that Florida state Representative [[Mary Brandenburg]] had proposed a bill to make possession of salvia a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

"As soon as we make one drug illegal, kids start looking around for other drugs they can buy legally. This is just the next one," said Brandenburg.

Florida state Senator Evelyn Lynn, who was on the committee to study the salvia bill, said salvia should be criminalized. "I'd rather be at the front edge of preventing the dangers of the drug than waiting until we are the 40th or more," she said.&lt;ref name=Gresko20080311&gt;[[#refGresko20080311|Gresko 2008-03-11 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The House bill number was HB 1363. It proposed including ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A on Florida's Schedule I list of controlled substances. There were also similar Senate bills SB340, and SB1612 proposed concurrently.[http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=38384&amp;BillText=salvia&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;SessionId=57&amp;]

On April 16, 2008, HB1363 passed the House, and advanced to the Senate floor. On April 23, 2008, the bill unanimously passed the Senate by a vote of 39-0. Having passed both House and Senate, the bill was signed into law on May 29, 2008 by Governor Charlie Crist becoming effective July 1, 2008.[http://www.sun-herald.com/floridanews.cfm?id=2992] {{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/legislature/sfl-0416salvia,0,3788784.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420024323/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/legislature/sfl-0416salvia%2C0%2C3788784.story |archivedate=20 April 2008 |title=Florida House votes to ban trendy hallucinogen |accessdate=27 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
On March 8, 2007, Senator [https://web.archive.org/web/20060704211355/http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/senate/bullochbio.htm John Bulloch], (R-Ochlocknee), filed Senate Bill [https://web.archive.org/web/20120323052038/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2007_08/sum/sb295.htm SB295] which proposes that "It shall be unlawful to knowingly produce, manufacture, distribute, possess, or possess with intent to produce, manufacture, or distribute the active chemical ingredient in the hallucinogenic plant Salvia divinorum A" (sic). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070401072259/http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2007_08/fulltext/sb295.htm]

Violation of the proposed law would be considered a misdemeanor under Georgia's code. It would not apply to "the possession, planting, cultivation, growing, or harvesting of such hallucinogenic plant strictly for aesthetic, landscaping, or decorative purposes".

Sen. John Bulloch reportedly saw a report on an Atlanta television news station about the increased use of ''Salvia divinorum''. He was quoted as saying - "I thought, 'Why hasn't somebody already jumped on this?'" before filing Senate Bill 295. "I hurriedly got legislative counsel to draft the bill…Everything that I read about it is it's considered to be a hallucinogenic drug…A lot of the reading that I've found on it says that it gives a quicker and more intense high than LSD." [https://web.archive.org/web/20090123040053/http://savannahnow.com/node/239324]. Senator [https://web.archive.org/web/20071220001130/http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/senate/dthomasbio.htm Don Thomas] (R-Dalton), a physician and member of the reviewing Senate [https://web.archive.org/web/20080224071445/http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2001_02/senate/gashhs.htm Health and Human Services Committee], was reported as saying—"I just know about the publicity of the dangers of it, and the use of it, so my first impression is to ban anything of that nature". [https://web.archive.org/web/20090123040053/http://savannahnow.com/node/239324]

As of July 1, 2010, Georgia code lists salvinorin A as a dangerous drug, prohibiting its sale, distribution, and possession. The only exemption to this is the 'possession, planting, cultivation, growing, or harvesting of ''Salvia divinorum'' or ''Salvia divinorum A'' strictly for aesthetic, landscaping, or decorative purposes' O.C.G.A. § 16-13-72

===Illinois===
On January 19, 2006, [http://www.ilga.gov/senate/Senator.asp?MemberID=1125 Senator John J. Millner] (R) introduced [http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=2589&amp;GAID=8&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;LegId=23512&amp;SessionID=50&amp;GA=94 Senate Bill 2589] to the Illinois State Legislature. This bill sought to add ''Salvia divinorum'' to that state's list of Schedule I controlled substances. The Bill failed to pass as the session ended [[sine die]] (adjourned with no date set for resumption).

On January 26, 2007, Representative [[Dennis Reboletti|Dennis M. Reboletti]] (R) filed House Bill HB457&lt;ref name="Reboletti2007Jan"&gt;[[#refReboletti2007Jan|Reboletti 2007 (Jan)]].&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed Schedule I classification for ''Salvia divinorum'' (including "the seeds thereof, any extract from any part of that plant, and every compound, [...] derivative, mixture, or preparation of that plant"). The bill does not mention the active chemical constituent salvinorin A.&lt;ref name="Reboletti2007JanFTp7" /&gt; [[Daniel Siebert (ethnobotanist)|Daniel Siebert]] criticised this wording as being "absurdly broad in scope, for it implies that any substance extracted from ''Salvia divinorum'' (water, chlorophyll, whatever) would be treated as a Schedule I controlled substance under the proposed law."&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus" /&gt;

In March 2007, news of the bill's passage on Reboletti's website alleged that salvia is a "powerful psychoactive plant which in appearance looks like marijuana but has the psychoactive properties of LSD". Reboletti said, "It's important that we in the legislature are proactive in protecting our children from highly addictive substances" and "For a drug to be classified as a Schedule 1 substance signifies that it's a highly dangerous and potentially lethal drug for its user. Hopefully, the passage of my bill will bring attention to "Magic Mint" and help law enforcement combat the future rise of this drug."&lt;ref name="Reboletti2007Mar"&gt;[[#refReboletti2007Mar|Reboletti 2007 (Mar)]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' article references and other sources indicate, however, that salvia does not look like marijuana. Its psychoactive properties are not like those of LSD, and that ''Salvia divinorum'' is not generally understood to be either addictive or toxic.

By May 22, 2007, HB0457 had received support from all 173 members in both bodies of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|democratic]] majority [[Illinois General Assembly]]. It was sent to the [[Governor of Illinois]], [[Rod Blagojevich]] (D), on June 20, 2007 and was signed into law on Friday August 17, 2007.&lt;ref name="Reboletti2007Jan" /&gt; The law came into effect on January 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="Colindres20070818"&gt;[[#refColindres20070818|Colindres 2007-08-18 (US Media).]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement given prior to the bill coming into effect Reboletti said, "I've seen the argument to legalize marijuana. It is a gateway drug, like salvia could be a gateway drug,"&lt;ref name="ChicagoST20071231"&gt;[[#refChicagoST20071231|Chicago Sun-Times 2007-12-31 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and "We decided to move forward rather than waiting for someone to be killed because of it."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMitchum20071225|Mitchum 2007-12-25 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical editorial was published by the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' on the eve of Reboletti's law coming into effect. It commented - "Legislators must have been on something to zero in on this obscure organic substance ... The last time we checked, Illinois was not besieged by a salvia epidemic. We don't see the urgency in criminalizing a substance with no clear track record of causing people to act in a dangerous manner or hurt other people ... considering how overcrowded our prisons are with dangerous criminals, trolling around for more nonviolent drug offenders to punish is counterintuitive... Regulating use of, rather than banning salvia, would have been a more sober approach."&lt;ref name="ChicagoST20071231" /&gt;

Alcohol-related financial contributions featured highly for Representative Dennis Reboletti's 2006 political campaign. According to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, 'Beer, Wine &amp; Liquor' was his seventh highest industry contributor.&lt;ref name="MiSP2006" /&gt;

===Indiana===
A few days after a local TV news report aired in November 2007, a follow-up story reported that Representative Dennis Avery (D-Evansville) was interested in a possible ban. Representative Avery was quoted as saying - "I had never heard of this product until a very short time ago when 14 News brought it to my attention." The news report went on to say - "Several local drug prevention organizations and area law enforcement tell 14 News there hasn't been any indication salvia is a problem substance."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLyles20071122|Lyles 2007-11-22 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An online poll was conducted in connection with Indianapolis news channel's stories also in November 2007, asking the question - "Do you believe Indiana should regulate ''Salvia divinorum''?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWallace20071126|Wallace 2007-11-26 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of 76% of the polls respondents were opposed to outright prohibition (59% preferring age regulations, and 17% no restrictions at all).

On January 13, 2008, it was reported that State Representative [[Suzanne Crouch]] (R-Evansville) was proposing a bill that wants Indiana law rewritten to declare ''Salvia divinorum'' a Schedule 1 controlled substance. Crouch's proposal would make the manufacture, sale or possession with intent to deliver salvia a Class B felony, carrying a potential penalty of 6 to 20 years.

The offense would be a Class A felony if the delivery or sale of ''Salvia divinorum'' were to someone under age 18, on a school bus or within 1,000 feet of school property, a park, family housing complex or youth program center. A conviction for a Class A felony would carry a 50- to a life sentence. The bill has not yet been assigned to a committee.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCorbin20080113|Corbin 2008-01-13 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Crouch was reported as saying - "The fact it has that kind of (hallucinogenic) reaction and is not illegal certainly caused me to look at it seriously".

An editorial published by the Evansville Courier &amp; Press on January 15, 2008 asked - " Are the proposed penalties of decades in prison appropriate? It's easy to demand Draconian sentences, until it's your teenager who gets caught". It suggested that there were other, more pressing, concerns for Indiana's lawmakers during the 2008 legislative session, saying - "Crouch's bill instead should be referred to a study committee for hearings this summer, with an eye to considering it in the 2009 session. It's not as if we have an epidemic of ''Salvia divinorum'' abuse that requires immediate action."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEvansvilleCourier20080115|Evansville Courier &amp; Press editorial 2008-01-15 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol-related financial contributions featured highly for Representative Suzanne Crouch's 2006 political campaign. According to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, 'Beer, Wine &amp; Liquor' was her eighth highest industry contributor.&lt;ref name="MiSP2006" /&gt;

===Iowa===
On January 18, 2007, the [http://www.state.ia.us/government/odcp/index.html Governor’s Office of Drug Control Policy] proposed House/Senate Study Bills [http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&amp;service=billbook&amp;GA=82&amp;hbill=HSB133 HSB133] and [http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&amp;service=billbook&amp;GA=82&amp;hbill=SSB1051 SSB1051]. These bills propose classification of ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A as Schedule I controlled substances. As of July 29, 2011, Governor Terry Branstad signed these bills into law, making ''Salvia divinorum'' a Schedule One Controlled Substance in Iowa. [http://www.iowa.gov/odcp/docs/LegislativeAlert7-29-11.pdf]

===Kansas===
On January 18, 2008, Senate bill 481 was proposed to amend current Kansas state law to add ''Salvia divinorum'' and datura stramonium ([[jimson weed]]) to schedule I of the Kansas Controlled Substances Act. The fiscal note from the Division of Budget stated the passage of this bill would have no fiscal effect.

The proponents of the bill included Senator Peggy Mast; Tom Stanton, Kansas County and District Attorneys Association; and Teresa Walters, Emporians for Drug Awareness. There was no testimony in opposition to the bill.&lt;ref name=Mast2008a&gt;[[#refMast2008a|Mast 2008a]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On her website Peggy Mast said - "A bill that would outlaw salvia has entered the Senate as well as one in the House. It looks positive that these bills will get the support needed in both chambers. This drug has become widely abused and it is time to pass legislation to make it illegal."&lt;ref name=Mast2008b&gt;[[#refMast2008b|Mast 2008b]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was passed by the Senate (yeas 40 nays 0) on February 20, 2008 and moved on for review by the House Judiciary committee. The House voted in favor of the bill on March 27, 2008 (ayes: 122, nays: 1). On April 14, 2008, it was sent to Governor Kathleen Sebelius (D) for executive approval.&lt;ref name=Mast2008a/&gt;

On April 24, 2008, the bill was signed into law by the Governor, making Kansas the 9th state to criminalize the possession, use, or sale of ''Salvia divinorum''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansas.com/news/state/story/386601.html kansas.com/news/state/]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kentucky===
In February 2009, Representative Will Coursey (D-Benton) was reported as having introduced a bill that would make possession of ''Salvia divinorum'' a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days. Cultivation of ''Salvia divinorum'' would be a Class A misdemeanor, which could bring up to 12 months in jail. Trafficking in iuoy ''Salvia divinorum'' would also be a misdemeanor, and the penalty would depend upon the amount. [http://www.lrc.ky.gov/record/09RS/HB228.htm House Bill 228] was referred to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration.

Representative Coursey said he heard about the drug in talking with youth group leaders in Western Kentucky who encouraged him to file the legislation. House Speaker Greg Stumbo (D-Prestonsburg) co-sponsored the bill. Stumbo said, "During my time in the legislature, and especially as attorney general, I have heard far too many stories of Kentuckians getting trapped in the drug culture, and it appears that salvia could be the next gateway drug for many. We need to stop that before it gets a foothold in the state."

Jennifer Brislin, a spokeswoman for the state Justice Cabinet, said the bill was something that they had been pushing. "We see it as a growing problem. We are just trying to stay ahead of the curve."

Representative Coursey said that Kentucky State Police officials and Van Ingram, acting director of Kentucky's Office of Drug Control Policy, are among the bill's proponents. "The last thing we need in Kentucky is another substance for people in Kentucky to be abusing," said Ingram.

Officer Chris Sutton, a spokesman for the Lexington police department, said they hadn't had any recorded complaints about salvia. But Sutton said the department supports the legislation because it aims to make the public safer, "If it has detrimental effects on its users, it concerns us." he said.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSpears20090209|Spears 2009-02-09 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective June 8, 2011 KRS 218A.1451 [http://www.lrc.ky.gov/krs/218a00/1451.pdf] states: "Possession of salvia is a Class B misdemeanor" and that "A person is guilty of possession of salvia when he or she knowingly and unlawfully possesses salvia for human consumption."

Kentucky also has enacted a tax stamp law for controlled substances.&lt;ref name="KRS 138.872"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kentucky|title=Tax Stamp Law|url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/krs/138-00/874.PDF|work=KRS Statutes|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax evasion is a felony.&lt;ref name=IRS&gt;{{cite web|last=IRS|title=General Tax Fraud|url=https://www.irs.gov/compliance/enforcement/article/0,,id=106790,00.html|work=Related Statutes and Penalties|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisiana===
Effective from August 8, 2005 (signed into law on June 28, 2005), Louisiana [https://web.archive.org/web/20120305223119/http://www.legis.state.la.us/billdata/streamdocument.asp?did=318544 Act No 159] made 40 plants, including ''Salvia divinorum'', illegal if sold for human consumption. It is still legal to own the plants.  Simple possession of an illegal form of Salvia is a [[felony]] for which the maximum sentence is 5 years; production (even for personal use) or distribution (even for free) has a maximum sentence of 10 years and a minimum sentence of 2 years. In addition, the defendant can even be sentenced to [[hard labor]] for either offense.

===Maine===
In December 2006, [http://janus.state.me.us/house/hsebios/barscr.htm Rep. Chris Barstow] proposed legislation for the State of Maine. According to reports Barstow believes salvia "is a drug very similar to LSD" and "We need to have it banned as soon as possible" [http://www.keepmecurrent.com/Community/story.cfm?storyID=29230]. Barstow's [http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/billpdfs/LD006601.pdf initial bill]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} proposed that ''Salvia divinorum'' be broadly classed the same as marijuana (classified as 'Schedule Z' in Maine). Under the proposed bill possession of ''Salvia divinorum'' is a [http://janus.state.me.us/legis/ros/manual/Webdman-21.htm 'Class E' crime ], and trafficking or furnishing of ''Salvia divinorum'' is a 'Class D' crime.

Barstow's action followed an approach from Kimberly A. Johnson, director of the Maine Office of Substance Abuse [http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/osa/], after she had seen ''Salvia divinorum'' on sale in her home town of Gorham. Johnson indicated that she would not be satisfied with only the enforcement of age restrictions to control salvia, asserting—"This drug is just as dangerous to someone who's 30 as someone who's 17". [http://bangordailynews.com/news/t/news.aspx?articleid=144637&amp;zoneid=500]

Lawmakers on the Criminal Justice Committee amended the proposed bill on February 6, 2007. The amendment proposed regulating salvia only for minors, so that selling or providing ''Salvia divinorum'' to anyone under the age of 18 would be a criminal offense. Possession by a minor would be a civil violation, punishable by a fine and community service. Adults 18 and over could continue to legally purchase and use the herb.

According to news reports [https://web.archive.org/web/20070222044942/http://bangordailynews.com/news/t/news.aspx?articleid=146136&amp;zoneid=500], several committee members at the work session questioned the need to criminalize a drug that had not been causing a problem and apparently has little or no addictive potential.

The amended measure was signed by the governor on May 15, 2007. It was "Passed to be enacted" (last Senate action) on September 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBarstow2007|Barstow 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maryland===
On January 28, 2008, Councilwoman Belinda Conaway (D), together with several fellow Democrat cosponsors, introduced Bill No. 08-0032 and Bill No. 08-0006R to the Baltimore City Council. These bills sought to prohibit the sale, possession, and use of salvia. Conaway said she was not aware of a problem in Baltimore City, but she wanted "to be on the front end." Other Maryland officials said they did not see salvia use as a widespread problem. The bills did not make it out of committee.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus" /&gt;

On January 14, 2009, Senator Richard Colburn (R) introduced Senate Bill 9 to the Maryland State Legislature. If enacted, this bill would make ''Salvia divinorum'' a Schedule I controlled substance in that state. The text only mentions ''Salvia divinorum'' it does not mention salvinorin A.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus" /&gt; The bill was co-sponsored by delegates Adelaide C. Eckardt (R-37B-Dorchester), and Jeannie Haddaway (R-37B-Talbot).

Haddaway said members of the Worcester County Commissioners brought the issue to her and Colburn that salvia was available without restriction at several Boardwalk retailers. "It's considered by most scientists to be more potent than LSD, and it's readily accessible to anyone in the state of Maryland who wants to purchase it. All around us, states are restricting it or banning it, and in Maryland you can still get it. Young people who may not have ever tried drugs before can legally purchase this and not realize how potent this is or what the effect is going to be."

Colburn noted the hundreds of thousands of videos posted on the Web site YouTube showing people under salvia's influence, saying, "It's nothing short of disturbing. Watch it for yourselves. See how they lose all coordination, experience emotional swings, dizziness and nausea. Now, imagine that person is your child or grandchild."

Salvia was blamed for the suicide of Delaware teen Brett Chidester in January 2006, shortly after which Delaware became the first state to outlaw salvia under what was dubbed "Brett's Law". His mother, Kathleen Chidester, has advocated for similar laws across the United States. "My hope and goal is to have salvia regulated across the U.S. It's my son's legacy and I will not end my fight until this happens." she said in written testimony in support of Colburn's bill.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMichael20090128|Michael 2009-01-28 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCollins20090128|Collins 2009-01-28 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  With over 4,000 teen suicides in the US per year, there is no way conclusively to determine if ''Salvia divinorum'' caused this suicide.

Colburn was reported as saying it's possible the bill could be amended to regulate salvia, rather than ban it outright, depending out how the bill escapes from committees.

The bill has opposition from the Drug Policy Alliance in Maryland, which called it an "unwarranted extension of the U.S. war on drugs." Naomi Long, director of the group's Washington metro area branch, urged legislators to reject the proposal, calling salvia's medical value "very promising" for treating health issues from depression and eating disorders to HIV infections. She also warned that if criminalized, salvia could be driven underground. Long said "the most effective approach" would combine age controls with restrictions on who could sell it, and where it gets placed in a store. She said lawmakers should model salvia regulations after tobacco laws, which, along with education campaigns, she said led to a dramatic drop in cigarette use among preteens since 1999. "We didn't have to criminalize tobacco or create long prison sentences for cigarettes to achieve these amazing results," she said. "The decrease was due to quality, comprehensive education at all grade levels about the health consequences of smoking and strict laws about sales to minors. This approach is working for tobacco."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refShane20090129|Shane 2009-01-29 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts===
On May 16, 2007, Representatives [[Viriato deMacedo]] (R) and Daniel Webster (R) introduced [http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/185/ht04pdf/ht04434.pdf House Bill 4434] to the Massachusetts State Legislature. If enacted, this legislation would have made ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A Class C controlled substances in that state. However, [http://www.mass.gov/legis/185history/h04434.htm the bill status] indicates that on June 15, the House Committee recommended it ought not to pass (under Joint Rule 10), and a closing entry (January 2009) suggests no further action. On January 12, 2009, Representatives [[Viriato deMacedo]] (R) and Daniel Webster (R) reintroduced bills to make Salvia divinorum and salvinorina A Class C controlled substances. These bills are [http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/186/ht01pdf/ht01336.pdf House Bill 1336], [http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/186/ht01pdf/ht01789.pdf House Bill 1789], and [http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/186/ht02pdf/ht02037.pdf House Bill 2037].

A town law, enacted by the town's Board of Selectman in April 2008, prohibits the sale of ''Salvia divinorum'' in the Town of West Bridgewater, Massachusetts.

====Boston====
Boston Municipal Code 16-54 states, in part, that "No person shall sell, offer for sale or possess ''Salvia divinorum'' or salvinorin A within the City of Boston." This ordinance was adopted in 2009.

In January 2009, Boston City Councilor Rob Consalvo called for Boston to outlaw ''Salvia divinorum''. "I’m scared by this," Consalvo said. "I can see this being the new meth if we don’t get our arms around it." Consalvo, was reportedly outraged that the State Legislature has failed to pass a bill making ''Salvia divinorum'' illegal in 2008, so filed his own legislation in the City Council that would make selling or possessing salvia in Boston a crime punishable with a $300 fine.&lt;ref name="MasonSnuff"&gt;[[#refMason20090130|Mason 2009-01-30 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The report went on to quote Sharon Levy, medical director of adolescent substance abuse at Children’s Hospital, "There’s no reason for kids to use this product. It’s a dangerous substance for kids to experiment with." The credibility of such statements are suspect though, considering that developmental studies on ''Salvia divinorum'' use have not been conducted.  Also, [[salvinorin A]] produces [[dysphoria]] as well as hallucinations, thus making it less likely for users to chronically use it.  As far as safety is concerned, it is not possible to lethally overdose on salvinorin A using the common methods of ingestion (smoked/intrabuccal/sublingual/oral).  However, the actions of people under the influence of salvinorin A could lead to serious harm (running, falling, drowning, crashing a vehicle, etc.), which is why traditional use suggests having other people present during its use to restrain the user if necessary.  In regards to safety in terms of addiction, unlike more traditional hallucinogens like [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]], [[salvinorin A]] affects [[kappa Opioid receptor]]s and is noted for its reverse tolerance. As such, using ''Salvia divinorum'' decreases tolerance to salvinorin A and makes [[dysphoria]] more likely with continual use (this effect can turn people away from its use).  Thus, like most hallucinogens, salvinorin A has low abuse potential.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Elaine Driscoll, a Boston Police Department spokeswoman, said the Hub "has not experienced widespread usage of this substance, however, it is always a good idea to get in front of an issue before it becomes a problem."&lt;ref name="MasonSnuff" /&gt;

===Michigan===
On April 16, 2010, Representative Rick Jones submitted house bill HB6038, which proposes Schedule I classification of a number of substances including ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A in the state of Michigan. The bill was passed by the House on June 23, 2010 (Yeas: 105 Nays: 1) and after minor changes, approved by the Senate (YEAS 36 NAYS 0 EXCUSED 1 NOT VOTING 1) on September 22, 2010.  The bill was signed into law by Governor Granholm September 30, 2010 and took effect October 1, 2010.

===Minnesota===
On February 28, 2008, Representative Joe Atkins introduced House bill HF2949 which proposes that ''Salvia divinorum'' be added to schedule IV of the controlled substance schedules in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAtkins2008|Atkins 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; Atkins was reportedly concerned that "It's becoming a drug of choice for college kids on campus, because it's legal and readily available."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSnyders20080409|Snyders 2008-04-09 (US Media)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Snyders, a journalist for the Minneapolis newspaper City Pages, tried ''Salvia divinorum'' for himself as part of his journalistic investigations. On April 9, 2008 he told of calling Representative Atkins and inviting him to do the same in order to research the issue more thoroughly. Snyders argued that Atkins would "be able to brandish his position with more credibility were he to experience the "drug" firsthand." Representative Atkins reply was "Frankly, it's not something that I have a considerable amount of time to do. Even if I wanted to." Snyders then asked "What if only I smoked it? Would you at least want to observe the effects?"

"Not particularly," Atkins said. Snyders report concluded:

{{"|Ultimately, it's this fundamental disconnect that accounts for the misunderstanding surrounding Salvia. As has been the case with other mind-expanding substances, the inability and unwillingness to differentiate between "psychedelically potent" and "socially dangerous" has spawned quixotic efforts to dispose of a natural plant via government prohibition.|[[#refSnyders20080409|Snyders 2008-04-09 (US Media)]]}}

A companion bill (Senate Bill 2668) was also introduced by Senator Steve Murphy (D) in 2008. Both bills died with the dissolution of the 85th legislative session.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus"/&gt;

In February 2009, another bill ([https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/revisor/pages/search_status/status_detail.php?b=House&amp;f=HF0484&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2009 HF 484]) was put up for consideration in the Minnesota House that would make ''Salvia divinorum'' a Schedule I controlled substance in Minnesota, making sales and possession of the plant a crime. Rep. Morrie Lanning (R-Moorhead) is given as the primary author of the bill, with co-authors Rep. Joe Atkins (D-Inver Grove Heights), Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound), Rep. Paul Marquart (R-Dilworth) and Rep. Tony Cornish (R-Good Thunder).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBirkey20090205|Birkey 2009-02-05 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; A Senate companion bill ([https://www.revisor.mn.gov/revisor/pages/search_status/status_detail.php?b=Senate&amp;f=SF0569&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=0&amp;ls=86 SF 569]) was authored by Sen. Bill Ingebrigtsen (R-Alexandria), with co-authors Sen. Julie Rosen (R-Fairmont), Sen. Joe Gimse (R-Willmar), and Sen. David Hann (R-Eden Prairie). The proposed bill did not pass a committee vote and thus died before making it to the floor.

The following year, February 2010, another bill ([https://www.revisor.mn.gov/revisor/pages/search_status/status_detail.php?b=House&amp;f=HF2975&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2010 HF2975]) was introduced that would make sale and possession a gross misdemeanor, once again authored by Lanning, with co-authors Atkins, Cornish, Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound), Rep. Denny McNamara (R-Hastings), and later by Karla Bigham (D-Cottage Grove). A companion bill ([https://www.revisor.mn.gov/revisor/pages/search_status/status_detail.php?b=Senate&amp;f=SF2773&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=0&amp;ls=86 SF2773]) authored by Ingebrigtsen and Rosen in the Senate additionally would make salvinorin A sale and possession illegal. In response to the opposition, Ingebrigtsen said, "We still have to go to battle every day. We don't want a state of euphoria walking around us."

Both bills prevailed in committee votes, but the House bill was postponed indefinitely due to wording not being identical (the Senate bill also makes salvinorin A illegal). On April 29, 2010, the Senate bill passed 61-6 and was passed by the House 116-15&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/votes/votes.asp?ls_year=86&amp;session_number=0&amp;year=2009&amp;id=2917]&lt;/ref&gt; on May 13, 2010. The bill was signed by Governor Pawlenty on May 18, 2010, making sale a gross misdemeanor and possession a misdemeanor, effective August 1, 2010.

===Mississippi===
Senator Hob Bryan (D) proposed adding ''Salvia divinorum'' to Mississippi's Schedule I list of controlled substances in January 2008. The bill sailed through the senate unopposed (Yeas 52, Nays 0), similarly through the House (Yeas 118, Nays 0), and was approved by the governor on April 15, 2008. The law became effective July 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBryan2008|Bryan 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the law had passed, it was reported that Attorney General Jim Hood was sending warnings to Mississippi business owners that it was no longer legal to sell ''Salvia divinorum''. The Madison County Herald told how local law enforcement raided one store and took all of the salvia stock. The business owner claimed he was unaware that it was now against the law to sell salvia. The Attorney General said, "Many local law enforcement officers are going around and removing salvia from stores within their respective jurisdictions. If the stores have the product, they are given a warning and notified of the recent changes in the law. If they are caught a second time, they will face charges."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMadisonCountyHerald20080923|Madison County Herald 2008-09-23 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missouri===
On January 5, 2005, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071206061219/http://house.missouri.gov/bills051/member/mem006.htm Representative Rachel L. Bringer] introduced House Bill 165 to the Missouri State legislature. This bill sought to add ''Salvia divinorum'' to that state's list of Schedule I controlled substances. Despite the CCLE sending [http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/pdf/bringer_salvia.pdf a letter to Representative Bringer] advising of its earlier report to Congress,&lt;ref name="Boire2002" /&gt; the following month saw the introduction of [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012111950/http://house.state.mo.us/bills051/biltxt/intro/HB0633I.htm House Bill 633], which sought to place ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A in Schedule I and also proposed to add 12 other substances to Missouri's list of controlled substances. This second bill was introduced on February 23, 2005 by [https://web.archive.org/web/20071119170635/http://www.house.mo.gov/bills041/member/mem157.htm Representative Scott A. Lipke] (R) and Representative Bringer. On August 28, 2005 the bill was incorporated into section 195.017 of the state's drug regulation statutes. Thus, ''Salvia divinorum'' became a Schedule I substance in the state of Missouri. Possession is a Class C felony under MRS 195.202, which allows a maximum sentence of 7 years.

===Nebraska===
Attorney General [[Jon Bruning]]'s office planned to pursue a bill to make ''Salvia divinorum'' illegal during Nebraska's 2008 legislative session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ago.ne.gov/media/010708_Leg_PKG_NR.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511232256/http://www.ago.ne.gov/media/010708_Leg_PKG_NR.pdf# |archive-date=2008-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release aired by Nebraska TV he was reported as saying - "Salvia is a powerful hallucinogen that can be purchased legally.  This legislation will make it illegal and put it on par with other powerful drugs like peyote, psychedelic mushrooms and LSD," [...] "Several other states have already made salvia illegal.  It's time to add Nebraska to the list."

[[Vickie D. McDonald|Senator Vickie McDonald]] supported the legislation, saying - "Videos of teens using this common plant to get high have become an internet sensation," [...] "Nebraska needs to classify ''Salvia divinorum'' and its active ingredient, salvinorin A, as a controlled substance in order to protect our children from a drug being portrayed as harmless when it's not."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBruning20080107|Bruning 2008-01-07 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill proposed addition of ''Salvia divinorum'' to Schedule I of the Nebraska Uniform Controlled Substances Act. Possessing salvia would have been considered a Class IV felony with a penalty of up to five years.  Trafficking would have fallen under a Class III felony with up to a 20 year penalty.

In TV reports Senator Vickie McDonald said - "Anytime anything's on YouTube it's an issue," and "Legislators, parents, grandparents, we need to be on top of these things," [...] "We need to protect our children and this is one way we can do it."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBerry20080107|Berry 2008-01-07 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWhite20080108|White 2008-01-08 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Vickie McDonald's second highest political campaign contributions from industry groups in 2006 came from "Beer, Wine &amp; Liquor"-related industries. Her third highest campaign contributors in 2006 came from industries related to "Tobacco companies &amp; tobacco product sales".&lt;ref name="MiSP2006" /&gt;

The proposed bill was submitted to the Nebraska legislative process as bill number LB840 on January 10, 2008. However, its status was updated in April 2008, showing on the Nebraskan legislature website as "Indefinitely postponed".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcDonald2008|McDonald 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, it was reported that the Nebraska legislature had voted 44-0 in favour of bill [http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=6474 LB 123], proposing ''Salvia divinorum'' as a Schedule I controlled substance. The bill's sponsor Sen. Russ Karpisek (R-Wilbur) said, "Please, think about our children when you think about this one. It's another gateway drug. I think that it will entice people to use the drug and see what it's like. Scary thought to me."&lt;ref name=DWC20090130&gt;[[#refDWC20090130|DRCNet 2009-01-31 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in June 2008, that a Nebraskan store owner was being prosecuted for selling ''Salvia divinorum'' at his store. Proposed bills specific to ''Salvia divinorum'' had not passed into law. However, Christian Firoz was cited under a more general Nebraskan statute where it is illegal to sell a product to induce an intoxicated condition.{{#tag:ref|Firoz was charged with knowingly selling an intoxicating compound in violation of Nebraska Statutes; sections [http://law.justia.com/nebraska/codes/s28index/s2804019000.html 28-419] and [http://law.justia.com/nebraska/codes/s28index/s2804020000.html 28-420]. In section 28-419 intoxicated conditions are deemed to include "stupefaction, depression, giddiness, paralysis, inebriation, excitement, or irrational behavior, or in any manner changing, distorting or disturbing the auditory, visual, mental or nervous processes".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNebRevStatS28-419|Nebraska Revised Statutes, section 28-419]].&lt;/ref&gt; Note that section [http://law.justia.com/nebraska/codes/s28index/s2804021000.html 28-421] of Nebraska's Statutes provides exception for alcohol - "The provisions of sections 28-419 to 28-424 shall not apply ''[...]'' to the use or sale of alcoholic liquors as defined by section 53-103."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNebRevStatS28-421|Nebraska Revised Statutes, section 28-421]].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

Susan Kirchmann, Firoz's lawyer, argued that statute is too vague and is unconstitutional - "The law can't be fairly interpreted. It can be interpreted in so many different ways so that anyone that looks at that statute looks at in one way, another person looks at it at another, the next person looks at it in a different way. Because it can be interpreted in many different ways, it doesn't give a person fair notice of what is acceptable behavior or not in this state".

Firoz said salvia is a herbal meditation supplement and that everyone has a right to have it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKOLN20080626|KOLN 2008-06-26 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in September 2008, it was reported that the state's argument, i.e. that "Firoz was not selling cleaning chemicals with no idea they were to be used to get high. Instead, he was knowingly selling salvia his purchasers would use to become intoxicated" had been sided with by Lancaster County Judge Gale Pokorny. In a September 10 order, Pokorny ruled that Firoz must stand trial because he knew what he was selling - "This judge is of the opinion that Mr. Christian Firoz knew precisely that the Salvia Divinorum he was selling was a 'substance' his purchasers were buying intended for human ingestion for the sole purpose of achieving mind-altering intoxication. While there may be others who potentially might be caught up in some confusing terminology contained in these two statutes, Mr. Christian Firoz does not appear to be one of them."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPokorny2008|Pokorny 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The report said Firoz was to go on trial for unlawfully selling a legal substance in October 2008. He faced up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDWC20080918|DRCNet 2008-09-185 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, reported in February 2009, that the jury had returned a verdict of not guilty in this case.&lt;ref name=DWC20090130/&gt;

===New Jersey===
On April 6, 2006, Assemblywoman Linda Stender (D) announced that she was proposing legislation to ban ''Salvia divinorum''. On May 15, 2006, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120902001918/http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/sweeney.asp Senator Stephen Sweeney] (D) proposed [http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2006/Bills/S2000/1867_I1.HTM Senate Bill 1867] to the State Senate. Assemblywoman Stender introduced an identical bill to the State Assembly on May 22, 2006. It is designated Assembly Bill 3139 and is cosponsored by Assemblyman Jack Conners (D) and Assemblyman Herb Conaway (D). If passed, these bills would classify ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A as Schedule I controlled substances in New Jersey. Neither bill has come up for a vote.

As of April 18, 2009, there are still two bills seeking to criminalize salvia pending in the New Jersey Legislature. The bills, A-1323 and S-2436, are pending in the Assembly Judiciary Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee, respectively.

=== New Mexico ===
On January 21, 2009, [https://www.nmlegis.gov/Members/Former_Legislator?SponCode=HMART Representative] [[W.

Gardner]. If enacted, this legislation would have made ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A Schedule I controlled substances in New Mexico. It passed in the House of Representatives and was sent to the Senate, where it died with a status of Action Postponed Indefinitely. On February 3, 2011, [https://www.nmlegis.gov/Members/Legislator?SponCode=HCOOK Representative] [[Zachary Cook|Zachary J.

HB336 passed in the House of Representatives and was sent to the Senate, where it died with a status of Action Postponed Indefinitely. On January 27, 2014, [https://www.nmlegis.gov/Members/Former_Legislator?SponCode=SBEFF Senator] [[Sue Wilson Beffort]] introduced [https://www.nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?Chamber=S&amp;LegType=B&amp;LegNo=127&amp;year=14 Senate Bill 127] to the legislature, again seeking to add ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A to the list of Schedule I controlled substances in New Mexico.

New Mexico's list of controlled substances is found in [http://public.nmcompcomm.us/nmnxtadmin/NMPublic.aspx New Mexico Statutes], chapter 30, article 31, also known as the "Controlled Substances Act".

===New York===
Salvia is currently legal in the state of New York. Bills to outlaw the sale and possession of Salvia have stalled in the state assembly.
One such bill failed to pass during the 2005-06 session. In January 2011, State Sen. John J. Flanagan renewed attempts to have the substance criminalized by drawing attention to the alleged use of Salvia by mass murderer [[Jared Lee Loughner]].

===North Carolina===
[http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2009/Bills/Senate/HTML/S138v5.html State Law 2009-0538] was signed into law by [[Bev Perdue|Governor Bev Perdue]] on August 28, 2009 and came into effect Dec 1st, 2009. The bill makes it unlawful to manufacture, sell, deliver, or possess ''Salvia divinorum''. A violation of the law on the first or second offense is subject to a fine of not less than twenty‑five dollars ($25.00). On a third or subsequent offense the person is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. There is an exception that the law does not apply to (1) employees or contractors of any accredited college or school of medicine or pharmacy at a public or private university in [[North Carolina]] while performing medical or pharmacological research for such institution or to (2) possession, planting, cultivation, growing, or harvesting of a plant strictly for aesthetic, landscaping, or decorative purposes.

===North Dakota===
On January 15, 2007 Senators [https://web.archive.org/web/20120310170455/http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/60-2007/senate/senators/bios/daveoehlke.html Dave Oehlke] (R) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120310170504/http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/59-2005/senate/senators/bios/randelchristmann.html Randel Christmann] (R), together with Representative [https://web.archive.org/web/20120310170508/http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/60-2007/house/representatives/bios/brendaheller.html Brenda Heller] (R) proposed [http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/60-2007/bill-actions/ba2317.html Senate Bill 2317] to classify ''Salvia divinorum'' as Schedule I controlled substance.

The original text of the bill only mentioned ''Salvia divinorum''. The Senate Judiciary Committee amended this on April 5, 2007, changing the bill wording to include salvinorin A and "any of the active ingredients" of ''Salvia divinorum''. Daniel Siebert has questioned this vague wording - "since it could be interpreted to include many commonly occurring pharmacologically active compounds, such as tannins, [[oleanolic acid]], [[ursolic acid]], etc". The amended bill passed in the Senate on February 7, 2007 (ayes: 47, nays: 0). It passed in the House on March 16, 2007 (ayes: 83, nays: 6). It was signed into law by Governor John Hoeven (R) on April 26, 2007. The new law went into effect on August 1, 2007.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus" /&gt;

====Kenneth Rau====
In April 2008, the case of Bismarck resident Kenneth Rau, a 46-year-old bottling plant worker, was reported as likely being the first person charged for ''Salvia divinorum'' possession in the United States. He was arrested on April 9, 2008 when police searched his home looking for his adult son, who was on probation for drug charges,

Burleigh County States Attorney Cynthia Feland confirmed, "He is being charged with possession of salvia with intent to deliver".
Rau suggested that this is a long used drug prosecutors ploy "to make dealers out of everyone," saying of his untreated leaf, "Nobody wants leaves. Everyone is buying those 10X and 20X and 30X extracts." [...] "I bought eight ounces of leaf on eBay by bidding $32 for it. Now they're charging me with possession with intent." [...] "This is ridiculous since an ounce is clearly the standard saleable unit for [untreated] leaf."

Rau's interest in salvia was reported as deriving from a broader interest in herbalism, religion and spirituality. - "I read that salvia facilitates lucid dreaming, so I tried chewing some leaves before bed time, and it was interesting because I would see faces and remember names I had long forgotten." He also tried salvia as a cure for depression. "I have some childhood issues to deal with. They had me on Paxil," he said. "They want you to take their pharmaceuticals, but if you want to take an herbal remedy, they want to throw you in prison. Are they going to save me from myself by throwing me in prison for years?"

Rau said his arrest has motivated him. "Maybe this is an opportunity for me to join the fight. I've never been a drug user, never been arrested. I started experimenting with this stuff because, I thought it was legal. I didn't want to get into trouble, but now they're treating me just like some meth dealer." [...] "I've emailed the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project, but I haven't heard back from them yet."

The Drug Reform Coordination Network (DRCNet) reported that it had contacted Republican lawmakers, state Sens. Dave Oelke and Randel Christmann and state Rep. Brenda Heller, but none of the three legislators responded to requests for comment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDWC20080425|DRCNet 2008-04-25 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistant State's Attorney Cynthia Feland said that people contacting the Burleigh County State's Attorney's Office urging them not to continue with the prosecution would not have any effect on the case. "We can't pick and choose what to prosecute''," she said.

Senator Randy Christmann admitted that he received, and continues to receive, e-mails from people across the country in favor of keeping ''Salvia divinorum'' legal, but said, "We felt there was no good reason to allow that to continue lawfully, I just feel it's a destructive thing without enough up-side to justify its use."

Kenneth Rau questioned why North Dakota needs to prohibit salvia when the federal government has not moved in a similar way, but Christmann reportedly felt that waiting for Washington to act was not in the best interests of North Dakota, saying, "I'm not one who usually relies too much on what the federal government tells me to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMichael20080803|Michael 2008-08-03 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, it was reported that Rau had been given a deferred sentence in relation to his salvia charge. He had pleaded guilty to the charge of Class C felony possession of salvia, Class A misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia and Class B misdemeanor possession of marijuana at the Burleigh County Courthouse. South Central District Judge Tom Schneider imposed a three-year deferred imposition of sentence for the salvia and drug paraphernalia charges and a two-year deferred imposition of sentence for the marijuana charge. Rau will be on supervised probation for three years, and the charges will be removed from his record if he successfully completes his time on supervision.

Burleigh County Assistant State's Attorney Cynthia Feland recommended a deferred sentence on the salvia charge saying that Rau had no recent criminal history, no history of prior drug use and bought the salvia over the Internet before its illegal status in North Dakota was widely known. Judge Schneider ordered Rau to complete a chemical dependency evaluation and any recommended treatment and pay $575 in court fees.

After the hearing, Rau said he was not surprised at the type of sentence he got. "It's kind of what I expected," he said. "I didn't think I would get any better from a jury trial."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMichael20090422|Michael 2009-04-22 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ohio===
In May 2007, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516224839/http://www.house.state.oh.us/jsps/MemberDetails.jsp?DISTRICT=90 Representative Thom Collier] (R) proposed [http://archives.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=127_HB_215 House Bill 215] seeking to make ''Salvia divinorum'' a Schedule I drug in the state of Ohio. [http://www.ohio.com/mld/ohio/news/17205666.htm] The bill passed unanimously (95-0) on April 16, 2008. The bill moved to the Senate, and passed unanimously (33-0) on December 16, 2008. The bill now moves to conference committee, and then to the governor.

On January 6, 2009, Gov. Ted Strickland signed a law which added ''Salvia divinorum'' to the Ohio controlled substances act. The law took effect 90 days from the day of the signature. ''Salvia divinorum'' is now a schedule I substance along with marijuana.  [http://www.thepost.ohiou.edu/Articles/News/2009/01/07/26649/]

===Oklahoma===
Representative's John Nance (R) bill HB 2485 was passed into law in the State of Oklahoma on the May 26, 2006. The wording of the bill—"Salvia divinorum'' [that] ''has been enhanced, concentrated or chemically or physically altered"[http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:ZJdvlhU2mRYJ:webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2005-06bills/HB/HB2485_CCS.RTF+Salvia+divinorum&amp;hl=en]—means that its particular focus was on high-strength extracts, rather than untreated natural strength ''Salvia divinorum'' leaf or plants.

In 2008, the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics (OBNDD) was reported as working with Representative David Derby (R-Owasso), and Senator Jonathan Nichols (R-Norman), to enact House Bill 3148. Governor Brad Henry signed the measure into law June 2, 2008. The law comes into effect November 1, 2008 and classifies ''all'' forms of ''Salvia divinorum'' as Schedule I substances in Oklahoma. After that date, possession of ''Salvia divinorum'' will be a felony offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and distribution carries a penalty of 5 years to life in prison. Daniel Siebert described the penalties as draconian.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus"/&gt; OBNDD Director R. Darrell Weaver was reported as saying, "There is nothing good that comes from salvia and we will fight tirelessly to control such unwanted substances in Oklahoma."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBlakey20080615|Blakey 2008-06-15 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oregon===
In 2011 (March), the house considers a ban on salvia http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/03/house_considers_ban_on_salvia.html

During the year 2003, two bills were proposed to criminalize ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A. Both bills died upon adjournment of the Oregon Judiciary Committee. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063732/http://www.leg.state.or.us/03reg/measures/hb3400.dir/hb3485.intro.html House Bill 3485] (introduced March 15, 2003) sought to impose particularly severe penalties. If it had passed, possession would have been punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment, a $200,000 fine, or both. Delivery would have been punishable by a maximum of 20 years imprisonment, a $300,000 fine, or both. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063751/http://www.leg.state.or.us/03reg/measures/sb0500.dir/sb0592.intro.html Senate Bill 592] only proposed to make delivery a crime. If it had passed, delivery would have been punishable by a maximum of one year's imprisonment, a $5,000 fine, or both.

Efforts to ban ''Salvia divinorum'' were renewed on January 25, 2007. Representative John Lim (R) introduced House Bill 2494 to the Oregon State Legislature.&lt;ref name="Lim2007"&gt;[[#refLim2007|Lim 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; If passed, this legislation would have made ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A Schedule I controlled substances in that state. Possession would be punishable by a maximum of 1 year's imprisonment, a $6250 fine, or both. Manufacture or delivery would be punishable by a maximum of 20 years imprisonment, a $375,000 fine, or both.

Rep. John Lim has been quoted as saying—"From what I understand this drug is at least as dangerous as marijuana or LSD", and Seth Hatmaker, a spokesman for Lim—"I think it's only a matter of time before we find people addicted to this stuff".&lt;ref name="Clark20070305"&gt;[[#refClark20070305|Clark 2007-03-05 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; There is little or no research evidence to support these views. In fact, the scientific consensus is mostly to the contrary. ''Salvia divinorum'' is not generally understood to be addictive.

House Bill 2494 died in committee upon adjournment on June 28, 2007.&lt;ref name="Lim2007" /&gt;

===Pennsylvania===
The Pennsylvania General Assembly website indicates three salvia-related bills in the 2007-2008 Regular Session. These are Senate bill 710 (P.N. 781), House Bill 1379 (P.N 1951) and House Bill 1379 (P.N. 1726).[http://www.legis.state.pa.us/dtsearch.asp?cmd=search&amp;searchType=allwords&amp;maxfiles=10&amp;autoStopLimit=1000&amp;sort=Hits&amp;CiScope=20070txt&amp;CiRestriction=Salvia]  The different bills were introduced by different bill sponsors, but all proposed adding ''Salvia divinorum'' to Pennsylvania's Schedule I listing of controlled substances.[http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2007&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=S&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billnbr=0710&amp;pn=0781] [http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2007&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billnbr=1379&amp;pn=1726] House Bill No. 1547 also listed salvinorin A and divinorin A (salvinorin A is also known as divinorin A).[http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2007&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billnbr=1547&amp;pn=1951] Their last actions were recorded as: Referred to Judiciary, March 29, 2007 for Senate Bill 710;[http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?&amp;syear=2007&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0710] Referred to Judiciary, May 29, 2007 House Bill 1379;[http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?&amp;syear=2007&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1379] and, Referred to Judiciary, June 18, 2007 for House Bill 1547.

Salvinorin A is specifically banned by the act if derived from ''Salvia divinorum''. A compound based on the molecular structure of salvinorin A is banned as an isomer.[http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2009&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=0559&amp;pn=0608] On September 29, 2010 the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed an amended version of H.B. 176, which would place ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A under Schedule I of the PA Controlled Substance Act. HB 176 was referred to the Pennsylvania Senate Judiciary Committee on October 12, 2010. It was not voted on before the 2009-2010 session ended. There may be efforts to introduce the bill during the next session. Such a ban on ''Salvia divinorum'' might infringe on the religious rights protected by the Pennsylvania Constitution. On June 16, 2011, The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Senate Bill 1006 which bans several drugs including ''Salvia divinorum'', salvinorin A, and divinorin A, and presented the bill to the governor.

===South Carolina===
On February 13, 2008, Representative Chip Huggins (R) introduced House Bill 4687 to the South Carolina State Legislature. If enacted, this legislation would make ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A Schedule I controlled substances in that state. On April 10, 2008, the bill passed in the House (ayes: 101, nays: 4). The bill later died with the dissolution of the 2007-2008 legislative session.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus"/&gt;

===South Dakota===
In February 2009, Representatives voted was 67-2 in favour of [http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2009/Bill.aspx?Bill=1090 House Bill 1090] which proposed adding ''Salvia divinorum'' to South Dakota's controlled substances list. "I'd like to have the drug off the street by the end of February," said Rep. Chuck Turbiville (R-Deadwood), the bill's prime sponsor.

Rep. Larry Lucas (D-Mission), amended the bill to give judges more discretion in sentencing. The Lucas amendment made possession of less than 2 ounces a misdemeanor, while 2 ounces or more would be a felony. Rep. Lance Russell (R-Hot Springs), said the Lucas amendment would penalize only for possession and wouldn't provide any penalty for distribution. Rep. Rich Engels (D-Hartford) said that flaw can be further addressed when the Senate next considers the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMercer20090203|Mercer 2009-02-03 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, it was reported that the South Dakota Legislature had given final approval, with the House voting 61-7 to accept changes the Senate had made in the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKSFY20090304|KSFY Television 2009-03-04 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The bill went into effect immediately after it was signed by Gov.

===Tennessee===
Tennessee has passed a law (SB3247/HB2909/TCA 39-17-452) that makes knowingly possessing, producing, manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to produce, manufacture, or distribute the active chemical ingredient in the [[hallucinogenic]] plant ''Salvia divinorum'' a Class A [[misdemeanor]].&lt;ref name="Burchett2006" /&gt; The law was to originally make it a felony, but it was [[law|amended]]. The Senate Bill was sponsored by Senator [[Tim Burchett]] (R-Knoxville). It was signed into law on May 19, 2006 and went into effect on July 1, 2006. Tim Burchett stated, "We have enough problems with illegal drugs as it is without people promoting getting high from some glorified weed that's been brought up from Mexico.

===Texas===
On March 3, 2007, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110527055805/http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/dist56/anderson.htm Representative Charles "Doc" Anderson] (R-Waco) filed [http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=80R&amp;Bill=HB2347 House Bill 2347] which proposed the addition of salvinorin A and ''Salvia divinorum'' to Penalty Group 2 of the Texas Controlled Substances Act. On March 28, 2007, the Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence held a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110527055904/http://www.house.state.tx.us/fx/av/committee80/70328p09.ram video recorded public hearing], 56 minutes 30 seconds into which HB2347 was raised.

Also in that month, on March 9, 2007, House Bill 3784, was introduced by Representative Tan Parker (R). That bill sought to add salvinorin A and ''Salvia divinorum'' to Penalty Group 3 of the Texas Controlled Substances Act.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus"/&gt;

Concurrently to Representative Anderson's proposed House bill, and on the same day as Representative Parker's House bill, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110525142019/http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/senate/members/dist30/dist30.htm Senator Craig Estes] (R) filed [http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=80R&amp;Bill=SB1796 Senate Bill 1796] on March 9, 2007. In contrast to the more restrictive House bills, the Senate bill simply proposed an age restriction—prohibiting the sale of ''Salvia divinorum'' to persons younger than 18 years of age.

Both House bills failed to make it out of committee. None of the bills were passed into law before the legislative session ended, although SB1796 bill did pass in the Senate by a voice vote of 31-0.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus"/&gt;

Representative Anderson resubmitted his proposal as [http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=81R&amp;Bill=HB126 House Bill 126] on November 10, 2008.&lt;ref name=DWC20081123&gt;[[#refDWC20081123|DRCNet 2008-11-23 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted in the Waco Tribune-Herald as saying, "This substance is dangerous, incapacitating and serves no medical use whatsoever", and "If somebody is getting behind the wheel of a car or other situations where they could injure people, we need to make folks aware of it and start to control the access."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWoods20081111|Woods 2008-11-11 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As happened previously in 2007, concurrently to Representative Anderson's re-proposed House bill, Senator Craig Estes filed [http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=81R&amp;Bill=SB257 Senate Bill 257], also on November 10, 2008.

KSL's Utah news channel broadcast a story on November 27, 2006 warning its viewers about what it called "this dangerous herb".&lt;ref name="Dujanovic20061127"&gt;[[#refDujanovic20061127|Dujanovic 2006-11-27 (US Media).]]&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, on November 28, 2006, the same channel reported House Representative [[Paul Ray]]'s "immediate response" with proposed legislation to ban ''Salvia divinorum'' in the State of Utah, quoting him as saying, - "It was upsetting to see we have a drug of that strength that's legal." and "We're basically going to make it illegal to possess or sell. Period."&lt;ref name="Dujanovic20061128"&gt;[[#refDujanovic20061128|Dujanovic 2006-11-28 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ray's bill (HB190) proposed Schedule I classification.&lt;ref name=Ray2006&gt;[[#refRay2006|Ray 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2006, KSL editorial director Duane Cardall published a stance against ''Salvia divinorum'' on behalf of the news station as a whole. Cardall's piece closes: "In KSL's view, the legislature should take action to control the sale of ''Salvia divinorum'' before the illicit use of the accessible hallucinogen spreads. That wasn't done in a timely way with Meth, and now we have a devastating epidemic. Preemptive action now with 'Sally D' would likely spare countless families the horror of losing a loved one to the relentless tentacles of drug abuse."&lt;ref name="Cardall20061128"&gt;[[#refCardall20061212|Cardall 2006-12-12 (US Media).]]&lt;/ref&gt;

KSL news stories and editorials generally support on-line comments from its registered readers. In this case, feedback was overwhelmingly in disagreement with the editorial line.

The House Representatives voted unanimously in favor of the bill however. On February 22, 2007, the bill status was 'House/ passed 3rd reading' (Yeas - 68, Nays - 0).&lt;ref name=Ray2006 /&gt; But the bill did not get enacted during its legislative session and was instead sent to the House file for defeated bills on February 28, 2007.

The bill was scheduled to be re-introduced by Representative Paul Ray in a Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Interim Committee meeting scheduled for September 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refUtahState2007|Utah State 2007]], agenda item 5 (September 19).&lt;/ref&gt; On October 17, 2007, the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper reported that the proposal had been set aside. Representative Ray said that federal regulators had alerted him that they were close to reaching their own classification for ''Salvia divinorum''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refErin20071017|Erin 2007-10-17 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, Ray re-filed the proposed legislation on January 9, 2008 for consideration in the general legislative session. The 2008 bill was filed as Utah H.B. 260.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRay2008|Ray 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; This did not get enacted during its legislative session either.

In the 2009 Legislative session, Ray proposed the bill for a third time as [http://le.utah.gov/~2009/htmdoc/hbillhtm/hb0277.htm H.B. 277]. In a report supporting the 2009 bill, the local ABC news station described Ray as a former undercover narcotics officer who has been on a one-man crusade for three years at the capitol, trying to raise enough awareness to get his bill passed. "I’ve been trying for three years to make them aware," said Ray, "Most are waiting to see what the federal government is going to do.'' [...] ''We’ll hold committee hearings during the summer and I’ll bring this issue to the table again'' [...] ''This substance has absolutely no medical use whatsoever. It’s only used to get a cheap high." The news report closed by saying that Ray knew that it may take a while to get the attention of policy makers who spent most of the 2009 session rewriting some of the toughest liquor laws in America.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDuPre20090313|Du Pre 2009-03-13 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In 2006 alcohol- and tobacco-related contributions amounted to the fourth largest industry contributions towards Representative Paul Ray's political campaigns.&lt;ref name="MiSP2006"/&gt;|group=nb}}

===Virginia===
As of July 1, 2008, ''Salvia divinorum'' is illegal in Virginia.

After a first failed attempt to outlaw ''Salvia divinorum'', Delegate John O'Bannon introduced the bill which ultimately became law, HB21.&lt;ref name="Robinson20070927"&gt;[[#refRobinson20070927|Robinson 2007-09-27 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OBannon2007&gt;[[#refOBannon2007|O'Bannon 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2008, the ''Washington Times'' quoted O'Bannon as saying - "It is the opiate equivalent of LSD, and it usually causes [[bad trip]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcLaughlin20080116|McLaughlin 2008-01-16 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other references suggest, however, that, while unpleasant experiences can occur, so called "bad trips" are the exception rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBaggott2004|Baggott 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalence made with LSD is also inaccurate. ''Salvia divinorum'' is a selective κ (kappa) opioid receptor agonist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPrisinzano2006|Prisinzano 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[opiate]] incorrectly implies a derivative of opium. [[Virginians Against Drug Violence]] opposed the bill on the grounds that banning the drug would increase interest in using it.

The bill unanimously passed the house on January 16, 2008 and passed the Virginia State Senate unanimously on February 18, 2008.&lt;ref name=Beard20080304&gt;[[#refBeard20080304|Beard 2008-03-04 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bill had been slightly altered between the two versions. It originally listed both ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorum A (sic) as additions to Virginia's Schedule I classification. The version passed by the Senate (Yeas - 40, Nays - 0) had corrected the spelling of the active constituent salvinorin A, and did not list the plant ''Salvia divinorum''.&lt;ref name=OBannon2007/&gt;  It was signed into Law on March 2, 2008, and the law became effective on July 1, 2008.[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?081+sum+hb21]

The news story&lt;ref name="Beard20080304"/&gt; suggested that the galvanizing incident in the overall movement to ban salvia was the suicide in January 2006 of 17-year-old, [[Brett’s law|Brett Chidester]]. Kathy Chidester, Brett’s mother, is convinced it was salvia that made her son depressed, and is actively advocating for salvia criminalization. In a phone interview, Delegate O’Bannon said that Mrs. Chidester wrote him a letter to support the proposed salvia ban in Virginia. The interviewing journalist mentioned the seeming lack of connection between Brett's suicide and ''Salvia divinorum'', to which O'Bannon reportedly snapped - "That’s not what his mother thinks".&lt;ref name=Beard20080304/&gt;

The report went on to say that according to Laura Bechtel of [http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/Internet/brpc/ Virginia's Blue Ridge Poison Center], there had only been eleven calls about salvia in the past four years, only four of which were people who had actually ingested, the other seven being callers just seeking information. This was out of a total of 148,650 calls received by the center during in that period. "As far as I know," Bechtel said, "we haven’t had any cases that needed medical attention."&lt;ref name=Beard20080304/&gt;

===Wisconsin===
On Wednesday, March 3, 2010, Governor Doyle signed [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000928/http://www.law.wisc.edu/rcid/legislativeaction/09act141.pdf 2009 Wisconsin Act 141] into law, making Wisconsin the 19th state to regulate the sale of ''Salvia divinorum''. The law states that retailers who distribute salvinorin A to minors with the intent that it be consumed can be fined up to $10,000.

On February 15, 2007, the day after a Fox TV local news story on salvia had aired in Milwaukee,&lt;ref name="Sanchick20070214"&gt;[[#refSanchick20070214|Sanchick 2007-02-14 (US Media).]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin state lawmaker  [http://www.legis.state.wi.us/leginfo/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Assembly&amp;district=22 Sheldon Wasserman], also a licensed physician, spoke to Fox news in a follow-up report about his plans to introduce legislation to make salvinorin a Schedule I controlled substance. In the interview, he said - "it came to me as a complete... something totally new... I was kinda shocked" and went on to claim - "there is no medical purpose for this product, it is completely for getting high, getting stoned, and it is something that should not be out there and available".&lt;ref name="Sanchick20070215"&gt;[[#refSanchick20070215|Sanchick 2007-02-15 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2007, the Wisconsin State Journal newspaper ran a front page headline cover story about salvia, reporting that Representative Wasserman had recently begun seeking sponsors for a bill that would ban the manufacture and sale of ''Salvia divinorum'' for consumption in Wisconsin, with a penalty of up to $10,000. Wasserman was reported as saying - "This bill is all about protecting our children", and "I want to stop the ''Salvia divinorum'' dealers who are pushing young people to experiment with a potentially dangerous substance."&lt;ref name="Martell20070618"&gt;[[#refMartell20070618|Martell 2007-06-18 (US Media).]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 2007, Representatives Sheldon Wasserman (D), David Cullen (D), John Townsend (R), Mike Sheridan (D), Alvin Ott (R), Jake Hines (R), and Terese Berceau (D) introduced [http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2007/data/AB-477.pdf Assembly Bill 477] to the Wisconsin State Legislature. If passed, this bill would prohibit manufacturing, distributing, or delivering the active chemical ingredient in the plant ''Salvia divinorum'' (salvinorin A) with the intent that it be consumed by a person.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus" /&gt;
Bill 477 died in session in early 2008.

Assembly Bill 186, created in April 2009, passed through three votes and as of February 17, 2010, returned to the Assembly successfully.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/AB186hst.html&lt;/ref&gt;  A summary of the bill: {{quote|This bill prohibits manufacturing, distributing, or delivering salvinorin A, a psychotropic ingredient in the plant Salvia divinorum, with the intent that it be consumed by a person. However, the prohibition does not apply to manufacturing a form of salvinorin A that is recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a homeopathic drug and that may be obtained from a retail store without a prescription, or to distributing or delivering such a form of salvinorin A to a person who is 18 years of age or older. The penalty for violating the prohibition is a fine not to exceed $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/AB-186.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}} AB 186 was signed into law by Wisconsin governor Jim Doyle on March 3, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wqow.com/Global/story.asp?S=12079251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wyoming===
On February 13, 2006, Representative Stephen Watt (R) proposed adding ''Salvia divinorum'' to Wyoming's list of Schedule I controlled substances (House Bill 0049). The bill died without coming up for a vote.

'''Oxford University Labour Club''' ('''OULC''') was founded in 1919{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=195}} to promote [[democratic socialism]] and is today the home of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of social democracy at [[Oxford University]]. OULC is the largest university Labour club in the country and has a particular reputation as an active campaigning force.

The club caters for any students who are interested in the ideals of the labour movement whether members of the Labour Party or entirely new to politics. [[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Stewart Wood]], special adviser to consecutive Labour Party leaders [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Ed Miliband]], said that 'OULC is held up as an exemplar of what needs to be done.' During his visit to Oxford in July 2009 the Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] was reported as having praised OULC's 'brilliant contribution to progressive politics in the University, the city and the country.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website | url=http://www.cherwell.org/2009/08/10/prime-minister-visits-labour-club/ | title=Prime Minister visits Labour Club | work=[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] | date=10 August 2009 | first=Nicky | last=Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was instrumental in returning [[Andrew Smith (politician)|Andrew Smith]] to Parliament for [[Oxford East]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]] with a 4.1% swing to Labour, the largest in England outside London.

Throughout the year it hosts a range of speaker, social, discussion, and campaigning events, as well as producing a termly magazine called [[Look Left (OULC)|Look Left]]. Signature events include the annual [[Barbara Castle]] Memorial Lecture and [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] Memorial Dinner.

In 2016, some officers of the Oxford University Labour Club resigned citing allegations of anti-Semitism in the club. This resulted in the national Labour party officially investigating the club for anti-Semitism. In March 2018, the OULC released a statement calling for ‘greater action to root out antisemitism’ from the national Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website | url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2018/03/28/oulc-joins-other-university-labour-clubs-with-antisemitism-statement/ | title=OULC joins other University Labour Clubs with antisemitism statement | work=[[The Oxford Student]] | date=28 March 2018 | first=Charlie | last=Willis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===David Lewis and the early 1930s===
When [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]] came to Oxford, the Labour Club was a tame organisation adhering to Christian activism, or the not-quite-so-scrappy-socialist theories of people such as [[R. H. Tawney]] and his book ''The Acquisitive Society''. David's modified [[Bundism|Jewish Labour Bundist]] interpretation of Marxism, that Cameron Smith labels "Parliamentary Marxism," ignited the renewed interest in the club after the disappointment with [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s second [[Labour Government 1929–1931|Labour government]].{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=187}}

The Oxford newspaper ''[[Isis magazine|The Isis]]'' noted Lewis' leadership ability at this early stage in his career in their 7 February 1934 issue: "The energy of these University Socialists is almost unbelievable.  If the Socialist movement as a whole is anything like as active as they are, then a socialist victory at the next election is inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | title=[Article name unknown] | newspaper=[[The Isis Magazine|The Isis]] | date=7 February 1934 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1934, British fascist [[William Joyce]], ([[Lord Haw Haw]]), visited Oxford.  Lewis and future [[Ontario New Democratic Party|Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] leader [[Ted Jolliffe]], organised a noisy protest against the fascist, by simply planting Labour Club members in the dance hall that Joyce was speaking in, and causing a commotion, as groups of two and three left making much noise on the creaking wooden floors.  The speech was foiled. Afterwards, the [[British Union of Fascists|Blackshirts]] contingent had a street battle in Oxford with members of the Labour Club and the townsfolk.{{sfn|Smith|1989|pp=194–195}}

Lewis prevented the communists from really making inroads at Oxford during his time there. He increased the Labour Club's membership by three-quarters, from 484 members in December 1932 to over 850 members by the time he left, while the October club never rose above 300 members.{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=196}} Ted Jolliffe stated "there was a difference between his speeches at the [[Oxford Union|[Oxford] Union]] and his speeches at the Labour Club.  His speeches at the Union had more humour in them; the atmosphere was entirely different. But his speeches at the Labour Club were deadly serious.... His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else's, I think, explains the failure of the Communists to make headway there."{{sfn|Smith|1989|loc=p. 196, [[Ted Jolliffe]] in an interview with the author}} In 1935, the Soviet controlled [[Comintern]]'s [[Comintern#Last World Congress and Dissolution|Seventh Congress]], called for a united left response to fascism, called the [[popular front]].  The communist October Club used this call, for a popular front, as a pretext to have a union between themselves and the Labour Club.{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=196}}  Under Lewis' leadership, the club was able to easily defeat a motion by the October Club, as only 20 OULC members voted for the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | title=[Article name unknown] | newspaper=The Isis | date=29 May 1935 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lewis returned to Canada in the summer of 1935, there really wasn't anyone to replace him, to keep the communists at bay{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=197}} as ''The Isis'' noted: "The Labour may have rejected fusion [with the October Club] but the matter is not yet settled. An interesting thing is the dearth of what are technically known as 'promising people' in the ranks of the Labour Club.  For years the Labour Club has been turning out a Geoffrey Wilson, a Frank Hardie, a John Cripps, a David Lewis, each year: but this [coming] year there seems to be no figures as outstanding as these."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | title=[Article name unknown] | newspaper=The Isis | date=5 June 1935 | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist takeover===
Since there was not a strong Labour leader to take over from Lewis after he graduated and left in the summer of 1935, the Labour Club amended its constitution to remove impediments to fusion with the communist October Club in December 1935.  Shortly thereafter the two clubs joined together forming a "popular front". The club's membership peaked before the war at between 1000 and 1200 members depending on whose numbers were used, which was approximately a fifth of all of Oxford's 5023 students. Of the club's total membership, the Communists made up approximately less than 200 members.{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=197}}{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=554}}

===Anti-semitism inquiry===
The national Labour Party appointed [[Janet Royall]], to head an inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism within the Club made in February 2016. The then-current Co-Chair and another officer resigned from the Club, alleging they were disturbed by the discrimination and anti-Semitism they alleged was inherent in the Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-35602993 |title=Ed Miliband cancels Oxford talk in 'anti-Semitism' row |authors=&lt;!-- no by-line; staff writer --&gt; |date=18 February 2016 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/02/ed-miliband-postpones-oxford-talk-after-anti-semitism-claims |last=Zeffman |first=Henry |title=Ed Miliband postpones Oxford talk after anti-semitism claims |date=17 February 2016 |website=[[New Statesman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Sandy | last=Rashty | date=28 February 2016 | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/153906/labour-launches-new-probe-claims-antisemitism-oxford-student-club | title=Labour launches new probe into claims of antisemitism at Oxford student club | website=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 European Union Referendum===
After successfully campaigning for the re-election of Andrew Smith as Member of Parliament for Oxford East, with an increased majority, in the 2015 General Election, and increasing the number of Labour councillors on Oxford City Council in the 2016 local elections, OULC campaigned hard during the European Union referendum. At the Michaelmas term 2015 General Meeting, OULC voted overwhelmingly to endorse UK membership of the European Union and to actively campaign in favour of the UK's continued membership of the European Union in the coming referendum campaign. This involved campaign stalls, door knocking and rallies. OULC did however host Graham Stringer MP who gave the Labour case for 'Brexit', during an address in Wadham college in Trinity term. This was in the same term that OULC hosted Chuka Umunna MP, Anneliese Dodds MEP, Andrew Smith MP and Alan Johnson MP, the leader of the Labour IN campaign, for signature 'remain' campaign events throughout Oxford.

==Constitution and organisation==
OULC is run by an elected Executive Committee, as established under the OULC Constitution. The Constitution can be changed by a two-thirds majority at any OULC General Meeting, Termly General Meeting (TGM), or Extraordinary General Meeting; at which its members can also pass policy in the form of motions (such as submissions to the Labour Party's Policy Review), hear reports from the executive and elect (at the TGM) the new Executive.

Under the most recent version of the OULC Constitution (as of Trinity Term 2016), the head of the Executive is the two Co-Chairs. One Co-Chair position must at all times be held by someone who 'self-identifies partly or wholly as a woman or [[transfeminine]]'[13], and two other positions on the Executive at every TGM, must be reserved for those who self-identify partly or wholly as a woman or [[transfeminine]]. The positions so reserved rotate around the Executive. If no one who self-identifies partly or wholly as a woman or [[transfeminine]] stands for such a position, the incoming Co-Chairs must produce a report to be made public, detailing what they will do to enhance the position of those who so self-identify within the Club. This also applies if the only two people standing for Co-Chair are men.

At the General Meeting in Trinity Term 2016, the Club also re-established its long-forgotten alumni network. Upon receiving permission from Lord Attlee, the grandson of Clement Attlee, the former Labour Prime Minister, the alumni network was named 'The Attlee Association', in the former Prime Minister's honour.

==Events==

OULC has hosted a range of speakers from the Labour movement, including a number of high-profile politicians. In Trinity term 2009, OULC hosted the then current [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]], [[David Miliband]]. He commented "I recently met with the OULC members and was impressed. [They] can help Labour be at the cutting edge."

OULC holds regular informal meetings to discuss policy. This provides its members with an opportunity to engage in serious political debate. An October 2008 review of party political events by the ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' commented that OULC is 'an active political party as opposed to a social gathering. Their meetings are informal, and last year they were visited by a number of prominent left wing politicians.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website | url=http://www.cherwell.org/2008/10/24/get-into-politics/ | title=Get into... politics | work=Cherwell | first=Sian | last=Cox-Brooker | date=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OULC also runs campaigns. The club plays a role in the efforts to keep Oxford East Labour and contributed significantly to the election effort in July 2009 where Labour gained four seats on the county council, the most successful Labour result in the county. In its report on the election victory, the ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' cited the club's then co-chair, Jacob Turner, as saying that he felt the result was a consequence of "a very great effort from the local party including Labour Club members. We've been going out, meeting people, and asking them not to vote for us, but just how our councillors can help them. We've built up a relationship with residents which is ultimately expressed in voting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cherwell.org/2009/06/06/oxford-stays-with-labour/ | title=Oxford stays with Labour | first=Mark | last=Dayan | date=6 June 2009 | work=Cherwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the run up to the 2010 General Election the club regularly turned out 20 campaigners every Sunday. This made a huge contribution to Oxford East's position of having the highest voter contact rate of anywhere in the country (more than Wales, Scotland and the North-East put together). In 2012, the club was instrumental in Labour winning its first Student Ward in the city in over two decades. When possible the club sends members to other towns to campaign, including Reading, Slough, Southampton and even Edinburgh.

OULC holds a number of social events including a fresher's dinner in Michaelmas Term and a barbecue or picnic in Trinity term. OULC also hosts an annual dinner, the [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] Memorial Dinner, in the fifth week of Hilary term. The dinner commemorates the contribution and life of John Smith, the former Labour party leader, who died suddenly in 1994. Recent speakers at this event have included [[Neil Kinnock]] and [[Margaret Beckett]].

==Involvement in Labour politics==

===Labour Students===
OULC is affiliated with [[Labour Students]], and former OULC members have held a number of positions there.
In February 2011, OULC disaffliated from Labour Students for a one-year period as a protest over the way the organisation was run. In February 2012, OULC voted by 20 to 4 to rejoin Labour Students citing the progress made by the leadership of the organisation in improving accountability and democracy.

===Other===
OULC also has links with other socialist organisations, trade unions, and Labour Party groups, including the Oxford District, Reading and Slough Labour Parties.

== Broader political involvement ==

===Oxford University Student Union===
Since the establishment of the [[Oxford University Student Union]] (OUSU) in the early 1970s, OULC has maintained a presence. There have been many Labour presidents, starting with [[John Grogan (UK politician)|John Grogan]] in the early 1980s, and OULC candidates have in recent years been successful in the 1998 ([[Anneliese Dodds]]), 1999 (Kirsty McNeill), 2004 (Emma Norris), 2005 (Alan Strickland) and 2006 (Martin McCluskey) elections. Whilst the Club no longer runs official candidates, OUSU's executive committee and delegate body has also had a Labour presence.

===National Union of Students===
[[Stephen Twigg]] was National President of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] and an OULC member in the early 1990s.

===Local government===
Six current or former members of OULC currently sit on Oxford City Council, and one is a County Councillor in Oxfordshire. As of the 2016 Oxford City Council Elections, Dan Iley-Wiliamson, OULC Membership and Alumni Officer at the time, was elected as a councillor for the Holywell ward, serving most city centre University colleges.

===Parliament===
At the 2005 General Election, five recent former OULC members stood for election as Labour candidates.

In parliament former OULC members include John Grogan, Ed Balls (although also a member of the Oxford University Conservative Association whilst at Oxford), Ed and David Miliband, and in the European Parliament, [[Richard Corbett]] and Mary Honeyball.

'''Parliamentary copyright''' was first created in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. Prior to this legislation being passed, what is now covered by Parliamentary [[copyright]] was [[Crown copyright]].

Parliamentary copyright was created with a lifespan of 50 years, the same as that for published Crown copyright materials. The 1988 Act defines it as covering, "Where a work is made by or under the direction or control of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] or the [[House of Lords]]..."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1692">A '''pretrial services report''' is a document used by a [[judicial officer]], typically a [[magistrate]], in making decisions, e.g., about [[bail]]. In 2016, federal officers prepared 88,248 pretrial services reports, 97 percent of which were pre-bail reports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/pretrial-services-judicial-business-2016&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the report must be prepared within a very limited timeframe due to the deadlines for making bail decisions.

To gather information for the report, the officer interviews the defendant. The report will contain defendant case information, such as residence, family ties, employment history, financial resources, health (including mental health and substance abuse histories), and criminal history. The officer then performs a criminal record check, pursues investigative leads, and verifies information which the defendant has provided, such as address, employment, assets, and citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=35|journal=San Diego L. Rev.|number=993|date=1998|title=Pretrial Detention in the Ninth Circuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of this information, the report will assess the defendant's likelihood of appearing for court and the level of danger he poses to the community. The last section of the report recommends for the release or detention of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The revalidation of the federal pretrial services risk assessment (PTRA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4842">In the United States, '''a private attorney general''' is an informal term for a private attorney who brings a [[lawsuit]] considered to be in the [[public interest]], i.e., benefiting the general public and not just the [[plaintiff]], on behalf of a citizen or group of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|390|400|1968|name=Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.|pin=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The earliest known use by a court in the United States is by Judge Frank in ''Associated Industries of New York State, Inc. v. Ickes'', 134 F.2d 694 (2d Cir. 1943).&lt;/ref&gt; The attorney may, at the equitable discretion of the court, be entitled to recover [[attorney's fee]]s if he or she prevails. The rationale behind this principle is to provide extra incentive to private attorneys to pursue suits that may be of benefit to society at large.

==Examples of application==
Many [[civil right]]s statutes rely on private attorneys general for their enforcement. In ''[[Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.|Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|390|400|1968|name=Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.}} 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest cases construing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that "A public accommodations suit is thus private in form only. When a plaintiff brings an action . . . he cannot recover [[damages]]. If he obtains an [[injunction]], he does so not for himself alone but also as a 'private attorney general,' vindicating a policy that Congress considered of the highest priority."  The [[United States Congress]] has also passed laws with "private attorney general" provisions that provide for the enforcement of laws prohibiting [[employment discrimination]], [[police brutality]], and [[water pollution]].  Under the [[Clean Water Act]], for example, "any citizen" may bring suit against an individual or a company that is a source of [[water pollution]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Another example of the "private attorney general" provisions is the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO).  RICO allows average citizens (private attorneys general) to sue those organizations that commit mail and wire fraud as part of their criminal enterprise.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} To date, there are over 60 federal statutes{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that encourage private enforcement by allowing prevailing plaintiffs to collect attorney's fees.

Attorneys who function as a private attorney general do so without compensation. The statutes permitting a plaintiff to recover attorneys' fees have been held not to apply when the plaintiff is an attorney.

While there is such a thing as a private attorney general act, it should be stated that there is no such thing as a private non-attorney citizen being a "private attorney general" for all purposes.  The term applies only to the exercise of one's ability to pursue certain specific kinds of legal actions which are statutorily authorized.  It does not create the ability to call one's self a "private attorney general".

==Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act==
The U.S. Congress codified the private attorney general principle into law with the enactment of [[Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976]], {{UnitedStatesCode|42|1988}}.  The Senate Report on this statute stated that The Senate Committee on the Judiciary wanted to level the playing field so that private [[citizen]]s, who might have little or no money, could still serve as "private attorneys general" and afford to bring actions, even against state or local bodies, to enforce the civil rights laws. The Committee acknowledged that, "[i]f private citizens are to be able to assert their civil rights, and if those who violate the Nation's fundamental laws are not to proceed with impunity, then citizens must have the opportunity to recover what it costs them to vindicate these rights in court."  Where a plaintiff wins his or her lawsuit and is considered the "prevailing party," § 1988 acts to shift fees, including expert witness fees [at least in certain types of civil rights actions, under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, even if not in § 1983 actions], and to make those who acted as private attorneys general whole again, thus encouraging the enforcement of the civil rights laws.  The Senate reported that it intended fee awards to be "adequate to attract competent counsel" to represent client with civil rights grievances. S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p.&amp;nbsp;6 (1976).  The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the act to provide for the payment of a "reasonable attorney's fee" based on the fair market value of the legal services.

'''ROBIC''' is an Intellectual Property firm in Montreal, Québec, Canada.

==History==

The firm was founded in 1892 as the patent agency MARION &amp; MARION by the Marion brothers, both of whom were engineers. Raymond A. Robic joined the firm in 1917. The ROBIC name found its way onto the firm’s letterhead in 1932 and under the leadership and vision of the late Raymond A. Robic, author, teacher and inventor.

In 1970, the law firm of LEGER ROBIC RICHARD was formed to provide specialized legal services primarily in the field of Intellectual Property (IP) and for more than thirty years, ROBIC has diversified its practice to include Business Law and commercial litigation. This fully integrated firm is now known as ROBIC, LLP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1800">The '''Rivers and Harbors Bill''' was a bill passed by Congress in 1846 to provide $500,000 to improve rivers and harbors. When the Senate passed the Rivers and Harbors Bill 34 to 16 on July 24, 1846, opponents lobbied for a presidential veto.&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Borneman, ''Polk: The Man Who Transformed the Presidency and America'' (2009) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; It was vetoed by President [[James K. Polk]] on August 3. The bill would have provided for federally funded internal improvements on small harbors, many of them on the [[Great Lakes]]. Polk believed that this was unconstitutional because the bill unfairly favored particular areas, including that which had no foreign trade.

Polk believed that these problems were local and not national. Polk feared that passing the Rivers and Harbors Bill would encourage legislators to compete for favors for their home districts, a type of [[political corruption]] that would spell doom to the [[Republicanism in the United States|virtue of the republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Yonatan Eyal, ''The Young America movement and the transformation of the Democratic Party'' (2007) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard he followed his hero, [[Andrew Jackson]], who authored the [[Maysville Road veto]] in 1830 on similar grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Eaton Byrnes, ''James K. Polk: a biographical companion'' (2001) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Clay]] and his [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], by contrast, supported the bill because they believed the national government had a responsibility to promote trade commerce and economic modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holt, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party'' (1999), 232–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory'''&lt;ref name="commissionname"/&gt; is a [[Royal Commission]] established in 2016 by the [[Australian Government]] pursuant to the ''[[Royal Commissions Act 1902]]'' to inquire into and report upon failings in the child protection and [[juvenile detention in the Northern Territory|youth detention systems]] of the [[Government of the Northern Territory]]. The establishment of the commission followed revelations broadcast on 25 July 2016 by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]] ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' program which showed abuse of juveniles held in the [[Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]].

[[Letters Patent]] for the Royal Commission were issued on 28 July 2016 and reissued on 1 August appointing joint Commissioners [[The Honourable]] [[Margaret White (judge)|Margaret White]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep=,|AO}} and [[Mick Gooda]].&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunter|first1=Fergus|title=NT juvenile detention royal commissioner Brian Martin resigns days after appointment|url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/nt-juvenile-detention-royal-commissioner-brian-martin-resigns-days-after-appointment-20160801-gqi4iv.html|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax|date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="letters patent 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ag.gov.au/About/RoyalCommissions/Documents/Letters-Patent-child-detention-NT.pdf |id=Register of Patents No. 51, Page 54 |date=1 August 2016 |title=Letters Patent |publisher=[[Australian Government]] |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report for the Royal Commission was tabled to the Australian Parliament on 17 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://childdetentionnt.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/Report.aspx|accessdate=18 July 2018|title=Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory: Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{see also|Juvenile detention in the Northern Territory}}
[[File:Mick Gooda 2015.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mick Gooda]], one of the two co-commissioners alongside [[Margaret White (judge)|Margaret White]].]]
On 25 July 2016, the ABC ''Four Corners'' investigative program aired an episode titled "[[Australia's Shame]]". The program featured youth held in the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre in Darwin. The following morning, Prime Minister Turnbull announced that there would be a Royal Commission into the Northern Territory juvenile detention system.&lt;ref name="royalcommission-afr"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Riordan|first1=Primrose|title=Malcolm Turnbull to call royal commission into NT child 'torture'|url=http://www.afr.com/news/politics/malcolm-turnbull-to-call-royal-commission-into-nt-child-torture-20160725-gqdkyh|website=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="royalcommission-news.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malcolm Turnbull plans royal commission into NT youth centres after damning Four Corners report|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/politics/malcolm-turnbull-plans-inquiry-into-nt-youth-centres-after-damming-four-corners-report/news-story/ba6f23eb99af65af0c24083c54ba408c|website=[[News.com.au]]|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turnbull stated on [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]] that the Royal Commission would be set up "as soon as possible" and the relevant parties would make moves "very quickly". He further stated that "Like all Australians, we are shocked by the report, by that evidence on ''Four Corners'' last night. We have moved swiftly to get to the bottom of it. We need to get all the facts out as quickly as we can. We need to expose the cultural problems, the administrative problems that allowed this type of mistreatment to occur."&lt;ref name="royalcommission-huffpo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butler|first1=Josh|title=Turnbull Announces Royal Commission Into Horror Abuse In NT Youth Detention|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/07/25/turnbull-announces-royal-commission-into-horror-nt-youth-detenti/|website=[[The Huffington Post]])|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned about whether or not the Northern Territory government itself should be investigated, Turnbull pressed that "the important thing is to get to the bottom of what happened at Don Dale."&lt;ref name="royalcommission-smh"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunter|first1=Fergus|title=Malcolm Turnbull calls royal commission into youth abuse at Northern Territory's Don Dale detention center|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/prime-minister-malcolm-turnbull-calls-royal-commission-into-youth-detention-abuse-at-don-dale-detention-centre-20160725-gqdm7x.html|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 2016, Turnbull named [[The Honourable]] [[Brian Ross Martin]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep=,|AO|QC}}, a former Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory]], as commissioner to conduct the inquiry and announced the terms of reference.&lt;ref name=Age280716&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Age]] |date=28 July 2016 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/prime-minister-malcolm-turnbull-broadens-northern-territory-abuse-inquiry-20160728-gqg10s.html |title=Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull broadens Northern Territory abuse inquiry |accessdate=29 July 2016 |author1=Kenny, Mark |author2=Koziol, Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="letters patent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turnbull"&gt;{{cite press release|last=Turnbull |first=Malcolm |author-link=Malcolm Turnbull |date=28 July 2016 |title=Royal Commission into the Child Protection and Youth Detention Systems of the Government of the Northern Territory |url=https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2016-07-28/royal-commission-child-protection-and-youth-detention-systems-northern-territory |location=Canberra |publisher=Australian Government |access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin resigned as commissioner four days after being appointed due to community and political pressure over his appointment, saying that "rightly or wrongly, in this role I would not have the full confidence of sections of the Indigenous community which has a vital interest in this inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-01/brian-martin-stands-down-from-royal-commission/7677400|title=Royal commissioner resigns four days after being appointed by PM|date=1 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]] [[George Brandis]] appointed the replacement  joint Commissioners [[The Honourable]] [[Margaret White (judge)|Margaret White]] and [[Mick Gooda]] that same day.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunter|first1=Fergus|title=NT juvenile detention royal commissioner Brian Martin resigns days after appointment|url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/nt-juvenile-detention-royal-commissioner-brian-martin-resigns-days-after-appointment-20160801-gqi4iv.html|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax|date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brandis stated that the royal commission would examine the period since the Northern Territory ''Youth Justice Act'' came into operation in 2006 and focus on why two reports into the youth justice system — including one relating to the Don Dale Centre — were not sufficiently followed up. The two reports are the ''Review of the Northern Territory Youth Detention System Report'' of January 2015 and the ''Report of the Office of the Children's Commissioner of the Northern Territory about services at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre'' of August 2015.&lt;ref name="letters patent"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Documents/Letters-Patent.pdf |title=Letters patent |work=[[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] |publisher=[[Australian Government]] |date=28 July 2016 |access-date=28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gywnne|first1=Colleen|title=OWN INITIATIVE  INVESTIGATION REPORT SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES AT THE DON DALE YOUTH DETENTION CENTRE|url=http://www.childrenscommissioner.nt.gov.au/publications/Childrens%20Commissioner%20DDYDC%20-%20Report%20to%20Minister%20170915.pdf|date=20 August 2015|website=The Children's Commissioner Northern Territory|access-date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms of reference==
On 28 July 2016, [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Peter Cosgrove]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep=,|AK|MC}} issued Commonwealth [[Letters Patent]] appointing Martin as commissioner and the commission's [[terms of reference]]. The commissioner was directed to examine "...failings in the child protection and youth detention systems of the Government of the Northern Territory; the effectiveness of any oversight mechanisms and safeguards to ensure the treatment of detainees was appropriate; cultural and management issues that may exist within the Northern Territory youth detention system; whether the treatment of detainees breached laws or the detainees’ human rights; and whether more should have been done by the Government of the Northern Territory to take appropriate measures to prevent the reoccurrence of inappropriate treatment."&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;

Despite the Northern Territory having its own government, the Territory is officially administered under the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Commonwealth Letters Patent covered its jurisdiction.

The executive of the [[Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory]] said that Turnbull undermined the royal commission by permitting [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory|Chief Minister]] [[Adam Giles]], who had ultimate responsibility for the events at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre, to have a say in drawing up the terms of reference. Peak Aboriginal organisations, including the [[Northern Land Council|Northern]] and [[Central Land Council]]s, AMSANT, the [[Australian Human Rights Commission|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner]] and legal groups, were also critical of Martin's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Age]] |date=29 July 2016 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/aboriginal-groups-push-back-against-the-royal-commission-brian-ross-martin-20160729-gqgrbg.html |title=Aboriginal groups push back against the royal commission, Brian Ross Martin |accessdate=30 July 2016 |author1=Damien Murphy |author2=Fergus Hunter }}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal Opposition said they were not consulted in the drawing up of the terms of reference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Age]] |date=29 July 2016 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/george-brandis-defends-nt-abuse-royal-commission-amid-consultation-hostilities-20160729-gqgf1m.html |title=Turnbull, Brandis defend NT abuse royal commission amid consultation hostilities |accessdate=30 July 2016 |author1=Fergus Hunter |author2= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for the appointment of two Indigenous co-commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Age]] |date=30 July 2016 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bill-shorten-calls-for-changes-to-nt-juvenile-justice-royal-commission-20160730-gqha0h.html |title=Bill Shorten calls for changes to NT juvenile justice royal commission |accessdate=31 July 2016 |author1=Damien Murphy |author2= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the resignation of Martin on 1 August 2016, [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Peter Cosgrove]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep=,|AK|MC}} issued Commonwealth [[Letters Patent]] appointing White and Gooda as joint Commissioners and the Commission's [[terms of reference]]. The Commissioners have been directed to examine "...failings in the child protection and youth detention systems of the Government of the Northern Territory; the effectiveness of any oversight mechanisms and safeguards to ensure the treatment of detainees was appropriate; cultural and management issues that may exist within the Northern Territory youth detention system; whether the treatment of detainees breached laws or the detainees’ human rights; and whether more should have been done by the Government of the Northern Territory to take appropriate measures to prevent the reoccurrence of inappropriate treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2016-08-01/appointments-royal-commission-child-protection-and-youth-detention-systems-northern|title=Appointments to the Royal Commission into the Child Protection and Youth Detention Systems of the Northern Territory|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|date=1 August 2016|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the failure of SBB's plans to strengthen the profitability and financial independence of its Cargo division by selling stakes to other international railway operators, SBB Cargo changed to an alternative solution. A new railway undertaking called SBB Cargo International was founded in partnership with intermodal transport operator [[Hupac]]. The new company focuses on block and intermodal trains on the European North-South corridor between [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. The shareholders in the new company are SBB Cargo (75%) and Hupac (25%), with further partners possible in the future. The aim is to achieve cost leadership in the [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] segment by optimising resources on selected routes and halving structural costs. The new company’s customers will primarily comprise intermodal operators, who will account for about 80% of the planned total sales of CHF 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/sbb-and-hupac-to-form-trans-alpine-freight-operator.html

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5465">The '''Plan for the Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids''' ('''SCATANA''') is an emergency preparedness plan of the [[United States]] which prescribes the joint action to be taken by appropriate elements of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[Federal Aviation Administration]], and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the interest of national security in order to effectively control air traffic and air navigation aids under emergency conditions.&lt;ref name=DOD_1975&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/MCO%20P3720.1C.pdf |title=Security Control Of Air Traffic And Air Navigation Aids (SCATANA) |author=[[United States Air Force]], [[United States Army]], [[United States Navy]] |date=25 June 1976 |accessdate=May 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312135223/http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/MCO%20P3720.1C.pdf|archivedate=March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/AIM/Chap5/aim0506.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801124631/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/Chap5/aim0506.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-01 |work=Aeronautical Information Manual |title=§5-6-1-g Special Security Instructions |publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Known versions of the plan are dated June 1971 and August 1975. The plan implements parts of the [[Federal Aviation Act of 1958]], the [[Communications Act of 1934]], and [[Executive Order 11490]] of October 28, 1969 (amended by [[Executive Order 11921]] on June 11, 1976).&lt;ref name=DOD_1975/&gt;

A similar plan by the same name existed in [[Canada]] for many years before its replacement with that country's '''Emergency Security Control of Air Traffic (ESCAT) Plan''' on October 9, 2002.&lt;ref name=Canada_ESCAT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/RegServ/Affairs/carac/NPAs/ANS/Gaz2-oct02R.htm |title=Regulations Amending the Canadian Aviation Regulations (Parts I, VI and VIII) |author=[[Canada Gazette]] |date=October 9, 2002 |accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. plan has been implemented once (other than tests) since its inception, and even then, it was a modified version. On September 11, 2001, the codeword was broadcast ordering that all U.S. air traffic be grounded, after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leader Focus&amp;nbsp;— SCATANA|url=http://www.kenkemp.com/leaderfocus/LFNOV18_01.htm|date=November 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in that instance, the emergency plan was only partially implemented as the Defense Department left command and control of the air traffic system with the [[FAA]] and intentionally allowed all [[radio navigation|radio navigational aids]] to remain in operation to aid in the process of controlling and landing the thousands of planes which were aloft in domestic airspace.&lt;ref name=eberhart_testimony&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49429-2004Jun17_5.html |title=Transcript: 9/11 Commission|date=June 17, 2004 |quote=So our SCATANA said, "Leave the nav aids on." Our SCATANA said, "FAA, you still control the traffic that's flying." Our SCATANA said, "Law enforcement and Flight For Life can continue to fly." We don't want to ground them during this terrible tragedy. And then procedures for getting waivers to fly.

The [[9/11 Commission Report]] never refers to SCATANA directly, but it does discuss this unprecedented order and commends the [[air traffic controllers]] who carried it out.&lt;ref name="911commission"&gt;[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf 9/11 Commission Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

While several people have been credited with issuing the SCATANA order for a national ground stop, the 9/11 Commission credits FAA National Operations Manager [[Ben Sliney]] with effectively issuing the directive. At 9:42 am on the morning of September 11, 2001, after the [[Air Traffic Control System Command Center]] learned from news reports that a plane ([[American Airlines Flight 77]]) had crashed into the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], Sliney "ordered all FAA facilities to instruct all aircraft to land at the nearest airport"&lt;ref name=911commission /&gt; (of sufficient [[runway]] length).

The Canadian federal government enacted [[Operation Yellow Ribbon]] to handle the diversion of most US-bound international civilian flights to Canada. In total, 255 aircraft were diverted to 17 different airports across Canada. Some international civilian airline flights bound for the United States were instead diverted to other countries (including Mexico) or were ordered to turn around and return to their point of origin.

'''Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories''', {{law report|26|Cal. 3d|588}} (1980), was a landmark [[products liability]] decision of the [[Supreme Court of California]] which pioneered the [[doctrine]] of [[market share liability]].  

== Background ==
The [[plaintiff]] in ''Sindell'' was a young woman who developed [[cancer]] as a result of her mother's use of the drug [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) during [[pregnancy]]. A large number of companies had manufactured DES around the time the plaintiff's mother used the drug. Since the drug was a [[fungible]] product and many years had passed, it was impossible for the plaintiff to identify the manufacturer(s) of the particular DES pills her mother had actually consumed.

== Decision ==
In a 4-3 majority decision by Associate Justice [[Stanley Mosk]], the court decided to impose a new kind of [[public liability|liability]], known as market share liability.  The doctrine evolved from a line of negligence and strict products liability opinions (most of which had been decided by the Supreme Court of California) that were being adopted as the majority rule in many U.S. states. The essential components of the theory are as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# All defendants named in the suit are ''potential'' tortfeasors (that is, they did produce the harmful product at issue at some point in time)
# The product involved is ''fungible''
# The plaintiff cannot identify ''which defendant'' produced the fungible product which harmed ''her'' in particular, through no fault of her own
# A ''substantial share'' of the manufacturers who produced the product during the relevant time period are named as defendants in the action&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If these requirements are met, a rebuttable presumption arises in favor of the plaintiff; if she can prove actual damages, then a court may order each defendant to pay a percentage of such damages equal to its share of the market for the product at the time the product was used.  A manufacturer may rebut the presumption and reduce its market share damages to zero by showing that its product could not have possibly injured the plaintiff (for example, by demonstrating that it did not manufacture the product during the time period relevant for that particular plaintiff).

Mosk later explained in an [[oral history]] interview that the court got the idea for market share liability from the ''[[Fordham Law Review]]'' comment cited extensively in the ''Sindell'' opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Hon. Stanley Mosk, [http://archives.cdn.sos.ca.gov/oral-history/pdf/mosk.pdf Oral History Interview] (Berkeley: California State Archives Regional Oral History Office, 1998), 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
Associate Justice [[Frank K. Richardson]] wrote a dissent in which he accused the majority of [[judicial activism]] and argued that the judiciary should defer to the legislature, whose role it was to craft an appropriate solution to the problems presented by the unique nature of DES.

==Problems of doctrine==
Courts after ''Sindell'' have refused to apply the market share doctrine to products other than drugs such as DES. The argument centers on the fact that a product must be fungible to hold all producers equally liable for any harm. If the product was not fungible, then different production methods or gross negligence in manufacturing might imply that some manufacturers were actually more culpable than others, yet they would only be required to pay up to their share of the market.
The time period over which the harm occurred is also an issue: in ''[[Skipworth v. Lead Industries Association]]'' 690 A.2d 169 (Pa. 1997), a 1997 [[Pennsylvania]] case, the plaintiffs complained of the use of [[lead-based paint]] in their house and brought suit against [[Lead Industries Association]]. The court refused to apply the '''market share''' theory because the house had stood for over a century and many manufacturers of lead-based paint had since gone out of business, while others named in the suit had not existed at the time the house was painted. The court also noted that lead-based paint was not a fungible product and therefore, some of the manufacturers may not have been responsible for Skipworth's injuries.

{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Related topics}}
'''Sovereignty''' is the full right and power of a governing body over itself, without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a [[substantive]] term designating supreme [[authority]] over some [[polity]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title=sovereignty (politics)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557065/sovereignty |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a basic principle underlying the dominant [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian model]] of [[Sovereign state|state foundation]].

==Different approaches==

The concepts of sovereignty have been discussed throughout history, and are still actively debated.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Núñez|first1=Jorge Emilio|title=About the Impossibility of Absolute State Sovereignty|journal=International Journal for the Semiotics of Law|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11196-013-9333-x|doi=10.1007/s11196-013-9333-x|volume=27|pages=645–664}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Núñez|first1=Jorge Emilio|title=About the Impossibility of Absolute State Sovereignty: The Middle Ages|journal=International Journal for the Semiotics of Law|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11196-014-9379-4|doi=10.1007/s11196-014-9379-4|volume=28|pages=235–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its definition, concept, and application has changed throughout, especially during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The current notion of [[sovereign state|state sovereignty]] contains four aspects consisting of territory, population, authority and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biersteker|first1=Thomas|last2=Weber|first2=Cynthia |title=State Sovereignty as Social Construct|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy97O2Eon0gC|series=Cambridge Studies in International Relations|volume=46|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=9780521565998}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Stephen D. Krasner]], the term could also be understood in four different ways: 
* domestic sovereignty – actual control over a state exercised by an authority organized within this state,&lt;ref name=Krasner&gt;{{cite book|pages=6–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISqwQIBQff4C&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7|title=Problematic Sovereignty: Contested Rules and Political Possibilities|isbn=9780231121798|author1=Krasner|first1=Professor Stephen D.|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* interdependence sovereignty – actual control of movement across state's borders, assuming the borders exist,&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt;
* international legal sovereignty – formal recognition by other sovereign states,&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt;
* [[Westphalian sovereignty]] – lack of other authority over state other than the domestic authority (examples of such other authorities could be a non-domestic church, a non-domestic political organization, or any other external agent).&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt;

Often, these four aspects all appear together, but this is not necessarily the case – they are not affected by one another, and there are historical examples of states that were non-sovereign in one aspect while at the same time being sovereign in another of these aspects.&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt; According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], another fundamental feature of sovereignty is that it is a claim that must be recognised by others if it is to have any meaning: {{cquote|Sovereignty is more than anything else a matter of legitimacy [...that] requires reciprocal recognition. Sovereignty is a hypothetical trade, in which two potentially conflicting sides, respecting de facto realities of power, exchange such recognitions as their least costly strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel|title=World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vGr7kRsXBkC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822334422|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

===Classical===
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] jurist [[Ulpian]] observed that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Or46AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=ulpian+sovereignty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yLziOgc30p&amp;sig=M8UwaBN0HZMBwqfdmI3Cz9HBk3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pE6kVJ6GEMe3oQSAq4L4Dg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ulpian%20sovereignty&amp;f=false|title=Sovereignty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The people transferred all their ''[[imperium]]'' and power to the [[Roman emperor|Emperor]]. Cum lege regia, quae de imperio eius lata est, populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et potestatem conferat (Digest I.4.1)
* The emperor is not bound by the laws. Princeps legibus solutus est (Digest I.3.31)
* A decision by the emperor has the force of a statute. Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem. (Digest I.4.1)

Ulpian was expressing the idea that the Emperor exercised a rather absolute form of sovereignty, that originated in the people, although he did not use the term expressly.

===Medieval===
Ulpian's statements were known in [[medieval Europe]], but sovereignty was an important concept in medieval times.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Medieval monarchs were ''not'' sovereign, at least not strongly so, because they were constrained by, and shared power with, their [[feudalism|feudal]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Furthermore, both were strongly constrained by custom.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Sovereignty existed during the Medieval period as the ''[[de jure]]'' rights of nobility and royalty, and in the ''de facto'' capability of individuals to make their own choices in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tititudorancea.com/z/sovereignty_07.htm|title=Sovereignty|website=www.tititudorancea.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around c. 1380–1400, the issue of feminine sovereignty was addressed in Geoffrey Chaucer's [[Middle English]] collection of ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', specifically in ''[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaucer's tale of the Wife of Bath.|url=http://www.dhushara.com/book/renewal/bath.htm|accessdate=10 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221200100/http://www.dhushara.com/book/renewal/bath.htm|archivedate=21 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later English [[Arthurian]] romance, ''The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell'' (c. 1450),&lt;ref name="Sir-Gawaine"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell|url=http://www.lone-star.net/mall/literature/gawain.htm|accessdate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses many of the same elements of the Wife of Bath's tale, yet changes the setting to the court of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The story revolves around the knight [[Sir Gawain]] granting to Dame Ragnell, his new bride, what is purported to be wanted most by women: sovereignty.

{{quote|We desire most from men,&lt;br /&gt;
From men both lund and poor,&lt;br /&gt;
To have sovereignty without lies.&lt;br /&gt;
For where we have sovereignty, all is ours,&lt;br /&gt;
Though a knight be ever so fierce,&lt;br /&gt;
And ever win mastery.&lt;br /&gt;

Over such a sir.&lt;br /&gt;
Such is our purpose.|sign=The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell (c. 1450)|source=&lt;ref name="Sir-Gawaine"/&gt;}}

===Reformation===

Sovereignty reemerged as a concept in the late 16th century, a time when civil wars had created a craving for stronger central authority, when monarchs had begun to gather power onto their own hands at the expense of the nobility, and the modern [[nation state]] was emerging. [[Jean Bodin]], partly in reaction to the chaos of the [[French wars of religion]], presented theories of sovereignty calling for strong central authority in the form of [[absolute monarchy]]. In his 1576 treatise ''[[Jean Bodin#Les Six livres de la R.C3.A9publique|Les Six Livres de la République]]'' ("Six Books of the Republic") Bodin argued that it is inherent in the nature of the [[State (politics)|state]] that sovereignty must be:&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

* Absolute: On this point he said that the sovereign must be hedged in with obligations and conditions, must be able to legislate without his (or its) subjects' consent, must not be bound by the laws of his predecessors, and could not, because it is illogical, be bound by his own laws.
* Perpetual: Not temporarily delegated as to a strong leader in an emergency or to a state employee such as a [[magistrate]]. He held that sovereignty must be perpetual because anyone with the power to enforce a time limit on the governing power must be above the governing power, which would be impossible if the governing power is absolute.

Bodin rejected the notion of transference of sovereignty from people to the ruler (also known as ''the sovereign''); natural law and divine law confer upon the sovereign the right to rule. And the sovereign is not above divine law or natural law. He is above (''ie.'' not bound by) only [[positive law]], that is, laws made by humans. He emphasized that a sovereign is bound to observe certain basic rules derived from the divine law, the law of nature or reason, and the law that is common to all nations (jus gentium), as well as the fundamental laws of the state that determine who is the sovereign, who succeeds to sovereignty, and what limits the sovereign power. Thus, Bodin’s sovereign was restricted by the constitutional law of the state and by the higher law that was considered as binding upon every human being.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The fact that the sovereign must obey divine and natural law imposes ethical constraints on him. Bodin also held that the ''lois royales'', the fundamental laws of the French monarchy which regulated matters such as succession, are natural laws and are binding on the French sovereign.

Despite his commitment to absolutism, Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in practice be carried out. He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to, it is advisable for him, as a practical expedient, to convene a [[senate]] from whom he can obtain advice, to delegate some power to magistrates for the practical administration of the law, and to use the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] as a means of communicating with the people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bodin believed that “the most divine, most excellent, and the state form most proper to royalty is governed partly aristocratically and partly democratically”.&lt;ref&gt;Bodin, Six livres, 6:254 (VI:vi).&lt;/ref&gt;

With his doctrine that sovereignty is conferred by divine law, Bodin predefined the scope of the [[divine right of kings]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
&lt;!--Bodin: "''Sovereignty is a Republic's absolute and perpetual power ''" Sovereignty is [[absolute]], thus indivisible, but not without any limits: it exercises itself only in the [[public]] sphere, not in the [[Private sector|private]] sphere. It is perpetual, because it does not expire with its holder (as ''auctoritas'' does). In other words, sovereignty is no one's property: by essence, it is inalienable. --&gt;

===Age of Enlightenment===
During the Age of Enlightenment, the idea of sovereignty gained both legal and moral force as the main Western description of the meaning and power of a State. In particular, the "[[Social contract]]" as a mechanism for establishing sovereignty was suggested and, by 1800, widely accepted, especially in the new [[United States]] and [[France]], though also in Great Britain to a lesser extent.

[[Thomas Hobbes]], in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) arrived a conception of sovereignty similar to Bodin's, which had just achieved legal status in the "[[Peace of Westphalia]]", but for different reasons. He created the first modern version of the social contract (or contractarian) theory, arguing that to overcome the "nasty, brutish and short" quality of life without the cooperation of other human beings, people must join in a "commonwealth" and submit to a "Soveraigne{{sic}} Power" that is able to compel them to act in the common good. This expediency argument attracted many of the early proponents of sovereignty. Hobbes strengthened the definition of sovereignty beyond either Westphalian or Bodin's, by saying that it must be:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

* Absolute: because conditions could only be imposed on a sovereign if there were some outside arbitrator to determine when he had violated them, in which case the sovereign would not be the final authority.
* Indivisible: The sovereign is the only final authority in his territory; he does not share final authority with any other entity. Hobbes held this to be true because otherwise there would be no way of resolving a disagreement between the multiple authorities.

Hobbes' hypothesis—that the ruler's sovereignty is contracted to him by the people in return for his maintaining their physical safety—led him to conclude that if and when the ruler fails, the people recover their ability to protect themselves by forming a new contract.

Hobbes's &lt;!--characteristics--&gt;theories decisively shape the concept of sovereignty through the medium of [[social contract]] theories. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s (1712–1778) definition of [[popular sovereignty]] (with early antecedents in [[Francisco Suárez]]'s theory of the origin of power), provides that the people are the legitimate sovereign. Rousseau considered sovereignty to be inalienable; he condemned the distinction between the origin and the exercise of sovereignty, a distinction upon which [[constitutional monarchy]] or [[representative democracy]] is founded. [[John Locke]], and [[Montesquieu]] are also key figures in the unfolding of the concept of sovereignty; their views differ with Rousseau and with Hobbes on this issue of alienability.

The second book of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ''[[Du Contrat Social, ou Principes du droit politique]]'' (1762) deals with sovereignty and its rights. Sovereignty, or the general will, is inalienable, for the will cannot be transmitted; it is indivisible, since it is essentially general; it is infallible and always right, determined and limited in its power by the common interest; it acts through laws. Law is the decision of the general will in regard to some object of common interest, but though the general will is always right and desires only good, its judgment is not always enlightened, and consequently does not always see wherein the common good lies; hence the necessity of the legislator. But the legislator has, of himself, no authority; he is only a guide who drafts and proposes laws, but the people alone (that is, the sovereign or general will) has authority to make and impose them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Contract|last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/rousseau1762.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau, in the Social Contract''&lt;ref&gt;''Social Contract'', Book II, Chapter III.
&lt;/ref&gt;
argued, "the growth of the State giving the trustees of public authority more and means to abuse their power, the more the Government has to have force to contain the people, the more force the Sovereign should have in turn in order to contain the Government," with the understanding that the Sovereign is "a collective being of wonder" (Book II, Chapter I) resulting from "the general will" of the people, and that "what any man, whoever he may be, orders on his own, is not a law" (Book II, Chapter VI) – and furthermore predicated on the assumption that the people have an unbiased means by which to ascertain the general will.  Thus the legal maxim, "there is no law without a sovereign."&lt;ref name="max-seydel"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gl9JAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=%22there+is+no+law+without+a+sovereign%22+Seydel | title = A society of states: Or, Sovereignty, independence, and equality in a league of nations | author1 = Stallybrass | first1 = William Teulon Swan | year = 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and types==
{{quote box|width=30%|There exists perhaps no conception the meaning of which is more controversial than that of sovereignty. It is an indisputable fact that this conception, from the moment when it was introduced into political science until the present day, has never had a meaning which was universally agreed upon.|[[Lassa Oppenheim]] (30-03-1858 – 07-10-1919)|an authority on international law&lt;ref&gt;[[Lassa Oppenheim]], International Law 66 (Sir Arnold D. McNair ed., 4th ed. 1928)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Absoluteness===
An important factor of sovereignty is its degree of [[Absolute monarchy|absoluteness]].&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A sovereign power has absolute sovereignty when it is not restricted by a constitution, by the laws of its predecessors, or by [[Custom (law)|custom]], and no areas of law or policy are reserved as being outside its control. [[International law]]; policies and actions of neighboring states; cooperation and respect of the populace; means of enforcement; and resources to enact policy are factors that might limit sovereignty. For example, parents are not guaranteed the right to decide some matters in the upbringing of their children independent of societal regulation, and municipalities do not have unlimited jurisdiction in local matters, thus neither parents nor municipalities have absolute sovereignty. Theorists have diverged over the desirability of increased absoluteness.

===Exclusivity===
A key element of sovereignty in a legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of [[jurisdiction]]. Specifically, the degree to which decisions made by a sovereign entity might be contradicted by another authority.  Along these lines, the German sociologist [[Max Weber]] proposed that sovereignty is a community's monopoly on the legitimate use of force; and thus any group claiming the same right must either be brought under the yoke of the sovereign, proven illegitimate, or otherwise contested and defeated for sovereignty to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Kenneth. Foundations of comparative politics: democracies of the modern world. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; International law, competing branches of government, and authorities reserved for subordinate entities (such as [[federated state]]s or republics) represent legal infringements on exclusivity. Social institutions such as religious bodies, corporations, and competing political parties might represent ''de facto'' infringements on exclusivity.

===''De jure'' and ''de facto''===
''[[De jure]]'', or legal, sovereignty concerns the expressed and institutionally recognised right to exercise control over a territory. ''[[De facto]]'', or actual, sovereignty is concerned with whether control in fact exists. Cooperation and respect of the populace; control of resources in, or moved into, an area; means of enforcement and security; and ability to carry out various functions of state all represent measures of ''de facto'' sovereignty. When control is practiced predominantly by military or police force it is considered ''coercive sovereignty''.

====Sovereignty and independence====
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
State sovereignty is sometimes viewed synonymously with [[independence]], however, sovereignty can be transferred as a legal right whereas independence cannot.&lt;ref name="talmon"/&gt; A state can achieve ''de facto'' independence long after acquiring sovereignty, such as in the case of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="talmon"/&gt; Additionally, independence can also be suspended when an entire region becomes subject to an occupation such as when [[Iraq]] had been overrun by the forces to take part in the [[Iraq War of 2003]], Iraq had not been annexed by any country, so its sovereignty during this period was not contested by any state including those present on the territory. Alternatively, independence can be lost completely when sovereignty itself becomes the subject of dispute. The pre-World War II administrations of [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]] maintained an exile existence (and considerable international recognition) whilst their territories were annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and governed locally by their pro-Soviet functionaries. When in 1991 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia re-enacted independence, it was done so on the basis of continuity directly from the pre-Soviet republics.&lt;ref name="talmon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Talmon|first=Stefan|title=Recognition of Governments in International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scc8EboiJX8C&amp;pg=PA50|series=Oxford Monographs in International Law Series|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198265733|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mälksoo|first=Lauri|title=Illegal Annexation and State Continuity: The Case of the Incorporation of the Baltic States by the USSR|year=2003|publisher=M. Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9041121773|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5w6AQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another complicated sovereignty scenario can arise when regime itself is the subject of dispute. In the case of [[Poland]], the [[History of Poland (1945–89)|People's Republic of Poland]] which governed Poland from 1945 to 1989 is now seen to have been an illegal entity by the modern Polish administration. The post-1989 Polish state claims direct continuity from the [[Second Polish Republic]] which ended in 1939. For other reasons however, Poland maintains its communist-era outline as opposed to its pre-World War II shape which included areas now in [[Belarus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Ukraine]] but did not include some of its western regions that were then in [[Germany]].

At the opposite end of the scale, there is no dispute regarding the self-governance of certain self-proclaimed states such as [[Republic of Abkhazia]], [[Republic of South Ossetia]] or the [[Republic of Kosovo]] (see [[List of states with limited recognition]]) since their governments neither answer to a bigger state, nor is their governance subjected to supervision. The sovereignty (i.e. legal right to govern) however, is disputed in all three cases as the first two entities are claimed by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the third by [[Serbia]].

===Internal===
Internal sovereignty is the relationship between a sovereign power and the political community. A central concern is [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]]: by what right does a government exercise authority? Claims of legitimacy might refer to the [[divine right of kings]] or to a [[social contract]] (i.e. [[popular sovereignty]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

With Sovereignty meaning holding supreme, independent authority over a region or state, Internal Sovereignty refers to the internal affairs of the state and the location of supreme power within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|work=pg. 92|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=25 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224011743/http://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|archivedate=24 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A state that has internal sovereignty is one with a government that has been elected by the people and has the popular legitimacy.  Internal sovereignty examines the internal affairs of a state and how it operates.  It is important to have strong internal sovereignty in relation to keeping order and peace.  When you have weak internal sovereignty, organisations such as rebel groups will undermine the authority and disrupt the peace.  The presence of a strong authority allows you to keep agreement and enforce sanctions for the violation of laws.  The ability for leadership to prevent these violations is a key variable in determining internal sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolford,  Rider|first=Scott, Toby|title=War, Peace, and Internal Sovereignty|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~wolfordm/implementation2.pdf|work=pg.1|accessdate=19 June 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of internal sovereignty can cause war in one of two ways: first, undermining the value of agreement by allowing costly violations; and second, requiring such large subsidies for implementation that they render war cheaper than peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolford, Rider|first=Scott, Toby|title=War, Peace, and Internal Sovereignty|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~wolfordm/implementation2.pdf|work=pg.3|accessdate=19 June 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leadership needs to be able to promise members, especially those like armies, police forces, or paramilitaries will abide by agreements.  The presence of strong internal sovereignty allows a state to deter opposition groups in exchange for bargaining.  It has been said that a more decentralized authority would be more efficient in keeping peace because the deal must please not only the leadership but also the opposition group.  While the operations and affairs within a state are relative to the level of sovereignty within that state, there is still an argument between who should hold the authority in a sovereign state.

This argument between who should hold the authority within a sovereign state is called the traditional doctrine of public sovereignty.  This discussion is between an internal sovereign or an authority of public sovereignty.  An internal sovereign is a political body that possesses ultimate, final and independent authority; one whose decisions are binding upon all citizens, groups and institutions in society. Early thinkers believe sovereignty should be vested in the hands of a single person, a monarch.  They believed the overriding merit of vesting sovereignty in a single individual was that sovereignty would therefore be indivisible; it would be expressed in a single voice that could claim final authority.  An example of an internal sovereign or monarch is Louis XIV of France during the seventeenth century;  Louis XIV claimed that he was the state.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected monarchical rule in favor of the other type of authority within a sovereign state, public sovereignty.  Public Sovereignty is the belief that ultimate authority is vested in the people themselves, expressed in the idea of the general will.  This means that the power is elected and supported by its members, the authority has a central goal of the good of the people in mind.  The idea of public sovereignty has often been the basis for modern democratic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|work=pg. 93|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=21 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224011743/http://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|archivedate=24 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern internal sovereignty====

Within the modern governmental system, internal sovereignty is usually found in states that have public sovereignty and rarely found within a state controlled by an internal sovereign.  A form of government that is a little different from both is the UK parliament system.  From 1790 to 1859 it was argued that sovereignty in the UK was vested neither in the Crown nor in the people but in the "Monarch in Parliament".  This is the origin of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and is usually seen as the fundamental principle of the British constitution.  With these principles of parliamentary sovereignty majority control can gain access to unlimited constitutional authority, creating what has been called "elective dictatorship" or "modern autocracy".  Public sovereignty in modern governments is a lot more common with examples like the USA, Canada, Australia and India where government is divided into different levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory|work=pgs. 94–95|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External===
{{See also|Sovereign state#Recognition}}
External sovereignty concerns the relationship between a sovereign power and other states. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] uses the following criterion when deciding under what conditions other states recognise a political entity as having sovereignty over some territory;
{{quote box|width=30%|"Sovereignty." A government which exercises de facto administrative control over a country and is not subordinate to any other government in that country or a foreign sovereign state.|(''The Arantzazu Mendi'', [1939] A.C. 256)|Stroud's Judicial Dictionary}}

External sovereignty is connected with questions of international law – such as: when, if ever, is [[Foreign intervention|intervention]] by one country into another's territory permissible?

Following the [[Thirty Years' War]], a European religious conflict that embroiled much of the continent, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 established the notion of territorial sovereignty as a norm of [[non-intervention|noninterference in the affairs of other nations]], so-called [[Westphalian sovereignty]], even though the actual treaty itself reaffirmed the multiple levels of sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire. This resulted as a natural extension of the older principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (Whose realm, his religion), leaving the Roman Catholic Church with little ability to interfere with the internal affairs of many European states.  It is a myth, however, that the Treaties of Westphalia created a new European order of equal sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Osiander, "Sovereignty, International Relations, and the Westphalian Myth", ''[[International Organization]]'' Vol. 55 No. 2 (Spring 2001), pp. 251–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international law]], sovereignty means that a government possesses full control over affairs within a territorial or geographical area or limit. Determining whether a specific entity is sovereign is not an exact science, but often a matter of diplomatic dispute. There is usually an expectation that both ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' sovereignty rest in the same organisation at the place and time of concern. Foreign governments use varied criteria and political considerations when deciding whether or not to recognise the sovereignty of a state over a territory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Membership in the [[United Nations]] requires that "[t]he admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Chart, Article 2|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml|accessdate=4 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208031716/https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml|archivedate=8 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sovereignty may be recognized even when the sovereign body possesses no territory or its territory is under partial or total occupation by another power. The [[Holy See]] was in this position between the annexation in 1870 of the [[Papal States]] by Italy and the signing of the [[Lateran Treaties]] in 1929, a 59-year period during which it was recognised as sovereign by many (mostly Roman Catholic) states despite possessing no territory – a situation resolved when the Lateran Treaties granted the Holy See sovereignty over the [[Vatican City]]. Another case, ''[[sui generis]]'', {{Citation needed span|text=though often contested,|date=October 2012}} is the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], the third sovereign entity inside Italian territory (after [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City State]]) and the second inside the Italian capital (since in 1869 the Palazzo di Malta and the Villa Malta receive [[extraterritorial]] rights, in this way becoming the only "sovereign" territorial possessions of the modern Order), which is the last existing heir to one of several once militarily significant, [[crusader state]]s of sovereign [[Military order (society)|military order]]s. In 1607 its Grand masters were also made [[Reichsfürst]] (princes of the Holy Roman Empire) by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting them seats in the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]], at the time the closest permanent equivalent to a UN-type general assembly; confirmed 1620). These sovereign rights were never deposed, only the territories were lost. 100 modern states still maintain full diplomatic relations with the order&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-relations/862/sovereign-order-of-malta-bilateral-relations/?lang=en Bilateral diplomatic relations of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203180316/http://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-relations/862/sovereign-order-of-malta-bilateral-relations/?lang=en |date=3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now ''de facto'' "the most prestigious service club"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}), and the UN awarded it observer status.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES48265"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-48-265 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=48 |resolution_number=265 |accessdate=10 September 2007|title=Observer status for the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in the General Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government-in-exile|governments-in-exile]] of many European states (for instance, Norway, Netherlands or [[Czechoslovakia]]) during the [[Second World War]] were regarded as sovereign despite their territories being under foreign occupation; their governance resumed as soon as the occupation had ended. The government of [[Kuwait]] was in a similar situation ''vis-à-vis'' the [[Iraq]]i occupation of its country during 1990–1991.&lt;ref name='nolan'&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolan|first=Cathal J.|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMJ8KP8i3v0C&amp;pg=PA1559|volume=Volume 4|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1559}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government of [[Republic of China]] was recognized as sovereign over [[Greater China|China]] from 1911 to 1971 despite that its [[mainland China]] territory became occupied by Communist Chinese forces since 1949. In 1971 it lost [[China and the United Nations|UN recognition]] to [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]]-led People's Republic of China and its [[political status of Taiwan|sovereign and political status as a state became disputed]] and it lost its ability to use "China" as its name and therefore became commonly known as [[Taiwan]].

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross#Legal status|International Committee of the Red Cross]] is commonly mistaken to be sovereign. It has been granted various degrees of special privileges and legal [[Immunity from prosecution|immunities]] in many countries,{{Which|date=November 2010}} that in cases like Switzerland are considerable,&lt;ref&gt;By formal agreement between the Swiss government and the ICRC, Switzerland grants full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand Switzerland [http://www.udiregelverk.no/~/media/Images/Rettskilder/Visa%20Code/Visa%20Code%20vedlegg%2010%20a.ashx does not recognize ICRC issued passports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510112534/http://www.udiregelverk.no/~/media/Images/Rettskilder/Visa%20Code/Visa%20Code%20vedlegg%2010%20a.ashx |date=10 May 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee is a private organisation governed by Swiss law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/who-we-are/overview-who-we-are.htm|title=About the International Committee of the Red Cross|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared and pooled===
Just as the office of [[head of state]] can be vested jointly in several persons within a state, the sovereign jurisdiction over a single political territory can be shared jointly by two or more consenting powers, notably in the form of a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Likewise the member states of international organizations may voluntarily bind themselves by treaty to a supranational organization, such as a [[continental union]]. In the case of the [[Member state of the European Union#Sovereignty|European Union members states this is called "pooled sovereignty"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9248.00096/abstract|title=The European Union: Pooled Sovereignty, Divided Accountability | doi=10.1111/1467-9248.00096 | volume=45|journal=Political Studies|pages=559–578|first1=John|last1=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNaughton|first1=Neil|title=Understanding British and European political issues : a guide for A2 politics studies|date=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719062454|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMrD6RRoZkQC&amp;pg=RA1-PT152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nation-states ===
A community of people who claim the right of [[self-determination]] based on a common ethnicity, history and culture might seek to establish sovereignty over a region, thus creating a [[nation-state]]. Such nations are sometimes recognised as [[autonomous area]]s rather than as fully sovereign, independent states.

===Federations===
In a [[federal republic|federal]] [[system of government]], ''sovereignty'' also refers to powers which a constituent state or republic possesses independently of the national government. In a [[confederation]] constituent entities retain the right to withdraw from the national body, but in a federation{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} member states or republics do not hold that right.{{dubious|date=March 2012}}

Different interpretations of [[states' rights|state sovereignty]] in the [[United States|United States of America]], as it related to the expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[fugitive slave laws]], led to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. Depending on the particular issue, sometimes both northern and southern states justified their political positions by appealing to state sovereignty. Fearing that slavery would be threatened by results of the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]], eleven slave states declared their independence from the federal Union and formed a new [[Confederate States of America|confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James M. McPherson|McPherson, James]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', (1988) pp. 40, 195, 214, 241&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government rejected the [[secession in the United States|secessions]] as rebellion, declaring that secession from the Union by an individual state was [[unconstitutional]], as the states were part of an indissolvable federation. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Acquisition==
{{Main article|Acquisition of sovereignty}}

A number of modes of acquisition of sovereignty are presently or have historically been recognised by international law as lawful methods by which a state may acquire sovereignty over territory. The classification of these modes originally derived from Roman property law and from the 15th and 16th century with the development of international law. The modes are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malanczuk|first=Peter|title=Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4doebHRhGT8C&amp;pg=PA147|series=International politics/Public international law|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415111201|pages=147–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cession''' is the transfer of territory from one state to another usually by means of treaty;
* '''Occupation''' is the acquisition of territory that belongs to no state, or [[terra nullius]];
* '''Prescription''' is the effective control of territory of another acquiescing state;
* '''Operations of nature''' is the acquisition of territory through natural processes like river accretion or volcanism;
* '''Creation''' is the process by which new land is reclaimed from the sea such as in the Netherlands.
* '''Adjudication''' and
* '''Conquest'''

==Justifications==
There exist vastly differing views on the moral basis of sovereignty. A fundamental polarity is between theories that assert that sovereignty is vested directly in the sovereigns by divine or natural right and theories that assert it originates from the people. In the latter case there is a further division into those that assert that the people transfer their sovereignty to the sovereign (Hobbes), and those that assert that the people retain their sovereignty (Rousseau).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

During the brief period of [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] in Europe, the [[divine right of kings]] was an important competing justification for the exercise of sovereignty. The [[Mandate of Heaven]] had some similar implications in China.

A republic is a form of government in which the people, or some significant portion of them, retain sovereignty over the government and where offices of state are not granted through heritage.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748), Bk. II, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A common modern definition of a republic is a government having a [[head of state]] who is not a monarch.&lt;ref name="WordNet"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=republic |journal=WordNet 3.0 |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=20 March 2009 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/republic |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Democracy is based on the concept of ''[[popular sovereignty]]''. In a [[direct democracy]] the public plays an active role in shaping and deciding policy. [[Representative democracy]] permits a transfer of the exercise of sovereignty from the people to a [[legislature|legislative body]] or an executive (or to some combination of legislature, executive and [[Judiciary]]). Many representative democracies provide limited direct democracy through [[referendum]], [[initiative]], and [[recall election|recall]].

[[Parliamentary sovereignty]] refers to a representative democracy where the parliament is ultimately sovereign and not the executive power nor the judiciary.

==Views==
* [[Classical liberalism|Classical liberals]] such as [[John Stuart Mill#Liberty|Stuart Mill]] consider every individual as sovereign.
* [[political Realism|Realists]] view sovereignty as being untouchable and as guaranteed to legitimate nation-states.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* [[Rationalism (politics)|Rationalists]] see sovereignty similarly to realists. However, rationalism states that the sovereignty of a nation-state may be violated in extreme circumstances, such as human rights abuses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalists]] believe that sovereignty is outdated and an unnecessary obstacle to achieving peace, in line with their belief of a 'global community'. In the light of the abuse of power by sovereign states such as Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Soviet Union, they argue that human beings are not necessarily protected by the state whose citizens they are, and that the respect for state sovereignty on which the UN Charter is founded is an obstacle to humanitarian intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Heuser: "Sovereignty, self-determination and security: new world orders in the 20th century", in Sohail Hashmi (ed.): ''State Sovereignty: Change and Persistence in International Relations'' (Philadelphia: Pennsylvania University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anarchists and some [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] deny the sovereignty of states and governments. Anarchists often argue for a specific individual kind of sovereignty, such as the [[Anarch (sovereign individual)|Anarch as a sovereign individual]]. [[Salvador Dalí]], for instance, talked of "anarcho-monarchist" (as usual for him, tongue in cheek); [[Antonin Artaud]] of ''[[Elagabalus|Heliogabalus]]: Or, The Crowned Anarchist''; [[Max Stirner]] of ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]''; [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] of a kind of "antisovereignty". Therefore, anarchists join a classical conception of the individual as sovereign of himself, which forms the basis of [[political consciousness]]. The unified consciousness is sovereignty over one's own body, as [[Nietzsche]] demonstrated (see also [[Pierre Klossowski]]'s book on ''Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle''). ''See also [[sovereignty of the individual]] and [[self-ownership]]''.
* [[Imperialism|Imperialists]] hold a view of sovereignty where power rightfully exists with those states that hold the greatest ability to impose the will of said state, by force or threat of force, over the populace of other states with weaker military or political will. They effectively deny the sovereignty of the individual in deference to either the 'good' of the whole, or to [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

According to Matteo Laruffa "sovereignty resides in every public action and policy as the exercise of executive powers by institutions open to the participation of citizens to the decision-making processes"&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Laruffa, "The European Integration and National Interests: from an intergovernmental model to a Constitutional Agreement"(Hungarian Academy of Social Sciences, Budapest, 3 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to rule of law==
Another topic is whether [[rule of law|the law is held to be sovereign]], that is, whether it is above political or other interference. Sovereign law constitutes a true state of law, meaning the [[letter of the law]] (if constitutionally correct) is applicable and enforceable, even when against the political will of the nation, as long as not formally changed following the constitutional procedure. Strictly speaking, any deviation from this principle constitutes a revolution or a coup d'état, regardless of the intentions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

'''Talcott Parsons''' (December 13, 1902 – May 8, 1979) was an American sociologist of the [[Sociology#Classical theory|classical tradition]], best known for his [[social action theory]] and [[structural functionalism]]. Parsons is considered one of the most influential figures in sociology in the 20th century.{{sfn|Turner|2015|page=3-6}} After earning a PhD in economics, he served on the faculty at [[Harvard University]] from 1927 to 1929. In 1930, he was among the first professors in its new sociology department.&lt;ref name=Soc101/&gt;

Based on empirical data, Parsons' social action theory was the first broad, systematic, and generalizable theory of [[social system]]s developed in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Dillon|2013|page=158-159}} Some of Parsons' largest contributions to sociology in the English-speaking world were his translations of [[Max Weber]]'s work and his analyses of works by Weber, [[Émile Durkheim]], and [[Vilfredo Pareto]]. Their work heavily influenced Parsons' view and was the foundation for his social action theory. Parsons viewed voluntaristic action through the lens of the cultural values and social structures that constrain choices and ultimately determine all social actions, as opposed to actions that are determined based on internal psychological processes.{{sfn|Dillon|2013|page=158-159}}

Although Parsons is generally considered a [[structural functionalist]], towards the end of his career, in 1975, he published an article that stated that "functional" and "structural functionalist" were inappropriate ways to describe the character of his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Talcott|last=Parsons|chapter=The Present Status of 'Structural-Functional' Theory in Sociology|title=Social Systems and The Evolution of Action Theory|location=New York|publisher=The Free Press|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s, a new generation of sociologists criticized Parsons' theories as socially conservative and his writings as unnecessarily complex. Sociology courses have placed less emphasis on his theories than at the peak of his popularity (from the 1940s to the 1970s). However, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in his ideas.&lt;ref name=Soc101&gt;{{cite|chapter=Chapter Four: Talcott Parsons and Robert Merton, Functionalism and Modernization|title=Introduction to Sociological Theory: Theorists, Concepts, and their Applicability to the Twenty-First Century|last=Dillon|first=Michele|publisher=Wiley|orig-year=2009|year=2013|isbn=9781118471906|page=156-157|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZEDwaIthpkC&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=%22Introduction%20to%20Sociological%20Theory%22%20%22talcott%20parsons%22%20%22criticized%20for%20his%22&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons was a strong advocate for the professionalization of sociology and its expansion in American academia. He was elected president of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1949 and served as its secretary from 1960 to 1965.

== Early life ==
He was born on December 13, 1902 in [[Colorado Springs]]. He was the son of Edward Smith Parsons (1863–1943) and Mary Augusta Ingersoll (1863–1949). His father had attended [[Yale Divinity School]], was ordained as a [[Congregationalist]] minister, and served first as a minister for a pioneer community in [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]], [[Colorado]]. At the time of Parsons' birth, his father was a professor in English and vice-president at [[Colorado College]]. During his Congregational ministry in Greeley, Edward had become sympathetic to the [[Social Gospel]] movement but tended to view it from a higher theological position and was hostile to the ideology of [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Parsons, "A Christian Critique of Socialism." ''Andover Review'' XI. 1889. pp. 597–611.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, both he and Talcott would be familiar with the theology of [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. The father would later become the president of [[Marietta College]] in [[Ohio]].

Parsons' family is one of the oldest families in American history. His ancestors were some of the first to arrive from [[England]] in the first half of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Parsons (2004). "Some remarks on Talcott Parsons's family". In: ''Journal The American Sociologist''. Vol 35, Nr 3, Sept 2004. pp. 4–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The family's heritage had two separate and independently-developed Parsons lines, both to the early days of American history deeper into British history. On his father's side, the family could be traced back to the Parsons of [[York, Maine|York]], [[Maine]].

On his mother's side, the Ingersoll line was connected with Edwards and from Edwards on would be a new, independent Parsons line because Edwards' eldest daughter, Sarah, married Elihu Parsons on June 11, 1750.

== Education ==
===Amherst College===
As an undergraduate, Parsons studied biology, sociology and philosophy at [[Amherst College]] and received his B.A. in 1924. Amherst College had become the Parsons' family college by tradition; his father and his uncle Frank had attended it, as had his elder brother, Charles Edward. Initially, Parsons was attracted to a career in medicine, as he was inspired by his elder brother so he studied a great deal of biology and spent a summer working at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Oceanographic Institution]] at [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]].

Parsons' biology professors at Amherst were [[Otto C. Glaser]] and Henry Plough. Gently mocked as "Little Talcott, the gilded cherub," Parsons became one of the student leaders at Amherst. Parsons also took courses with Walton Hamilton and the philosopher [[Clarence Edwin Ayres]], both known as "institutional economists." They exposed him to literature by authors such as [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[John Dewey]], and [[William Graham Sumner]]. Parsons also took a course with George Brown in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] and a course in modern German philosophy with Otto Manthey-Zorn, who was a great interpreter of Kant. Parsons showed from early on, a great interest in the topic of [[philosophy]], which most likely was an echo of his father's great interest in [[theology]] in which tradition he had been profoundly socialized, a position unlike with his professors'.

Two term papers that Parsons wrote as a student for Clarence E. Ayres's class in Philosophy III at Amherst have survived. They are referred to as the Amherst Papers and have been of strong interest to Parsons scholars. The first was written on December 19, 1922, "The Theory of Human Behavior in its Individual and Social Aspects."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Theory of Human Behavior in its Individual and Social Aspects." ''The American Sociologist'' Vol.27.no.4. Winter 1996. pp.13-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The second was written on March 27, 1923, "A Behavioristic Conception of the Nature of Morals."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "A Behavioristic Concept of the Nature of Morals." ''The American Sociologist'' Vol.27.no.4. Winter 1996. pp. 24–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The papers reveal Parsons' early interest in social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, "Beyond the Myth of "Radical Breaks" in Talcott Parsons's Theory: An Analysis of the Amherst Papers." ''The American Sociologist. Winter 1996. Volume 27. no.4. pp. 48–54.''&lt;/ref&gt; The Amherst Papers also reveal that Parsons did not agree with his professors since he wrote in his Amherst papers that technological development and moral progress are two structurally-independent empirical processes.

===London School of Economics===
After Amherst, he studied at the [[London School of Economics]] for a year, where he was exposed to the work of [[R. H. Tawney]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]], and [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]. During his days at LSE, he made friends with [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], [[Meyer Fortes]], and [[Raymond Firth]], who all participated in the Malinowski seminar. Also, he made a close personal friendship with Arthur and [[Eveline M. Burns]].

At LSE he met a young American girl in the students' common room called Helen Bancroft Walker whom he married on April 30, 1927. The couple had three children: Anne, [[Charles Parsons (philosopher)|Charles]], and Susan and eventually four grandchildren. Walker's father was born in [[Canada]] but had moved to the [[Boston]] area and later become an [[American citizen]].

===University of Heidelberg===
In June, Parsons went on to the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he received his Ph.D. in sociology and economics in 1927. At Heidelberg, he worked with [[Alfred Weber]], [[Max Weber]]'s brother; [[Edgar Salin]], his dissertation adviser; Emil Lederer; and [[Karl Mannheim]]. He was examined on Kant's "[[Critique of Pure Reason]]" by the philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stingl ''Between Discursivity and Sensus Communis: Kant, Kantianism and the Social Media Theory of Talcott Parsons''. Inaugural-Dissertation, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität, edited for publication, OPUS Erlangen-Nürnberg University Press, 2008.
*  Alexander I. Stingl '' Anthropos' Scaffoldings: Studies in the Coevolution of Sociology, Biology, Medicine, and Philosophy. (with a foreword by Sal Restivo)'' forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt; At Heidelberg, Parsons was also examined by Willy Andreas on the French Revolution. Parsons wrote his [[Dr. Phil.]] thesis on ''The Concept of Capitalism in the Recent German Literature'', with his main focus on the work of [[Werner Sombart]] and Weber. It was clear from his discussion that he rejected Sombart's quasi-idealistic views and supported Weber's attempt to strike a balance between [[historicism]], [[idealism]] and [[Neo-Kantism]].

The most crucial encounter for Parsons at Heidelberg was his encounter with the work of Max Weber about whom he had never heard before. Weber became tremendously important for Parsons because his upbringing with a liberal but strongly-religious father had made the question of the role of culture and religion in the basic processes of world history a persistent puzzle in his mind. Weber was the first scholar who truly provided Parsons with a compelling theoretical "answer" to the question so Parsons became totally absorbed in the reading of Weber.

Parsons decided to translate Weber's work into English and approached [[Marianne Weber]], Weber's widow. Parsons would eventually translate several of Weber's works to English.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Circumstances of My Encounter with Max Weber" in Robert K. Merton &amp; Matilda White Riley (eds.) ''Sociological Traditions from Generation to Generation.'' Norwood, NJ.: Ablex, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uta Gerhardt, "Much More than a Mere Translation Talcott Parsons' Translation into English of Max Weber's Protestantische Ethik und der Geist der Kapitalismus: An Essay in Intellectual History." ''The Canadian Journal of Sociology.'' Vol.32. No.1. Winter 2007. pp. 41–62.&lt;/ref&gt; His time in Heidelberg had him invited by Marianne Weber to "sociological teas," which were study group meetings that she held in the library room of her and Max's old apartment. One scholar that Parsons met at Heidelberg who shared his enthusiasm for Weber was Alexander von Schelting. Parsons later wrote a review article on von Schelting's book on Weber.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Review of Max Webers Wissenschaftslehre, by Alexander von Schelting," ''American Sociological Review'' vol.1. 1936: 675–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Parsons read extensively in religious literature, especially works focusing on the sociology of religion. One scholar who became especially important for Parsons was Ernst D. Troeltsch (1865–1923). Parsons also read widely on [[Calvinism]]. His reading included the work of Emile Doumerque,&lt;ref&gt;Emile Doumerque, ''Jean Calvin: Les hommes et les choses de son temps,'' 7 volumes. Lausanne, 1899–1927.&lt;/ref&gt; Eugéne Choisy, and Henri Hauser.

==Early academic career==
===Harvard===
====Economics Department====
In 1927, after a year of teaching at Amherst (1926–1927), Parsons entered Harvard, as an instructor in the Economics Department,&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Mason, "The Harvard Department of Economics from the Beginning to World War II." ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 97. 1982. pp. 383–433.&lt;/ref&gt; where he followed F.W. Taussig's lectures on tags economist [[Alfred Marshall]] and became friends with the economist historian [[Edwin Gay]], the founder of [[Harvard Business School]]. Parsons also became a close associate of [[Joseph Schumpeter]] and followed his course General Economics. Parsons was generally at odds with some of the trends in Harvard's department which then went in a highly-technical and a mathematical direction. Parsons looked for other options at Harvard and gave courses in "Social Ethics" and in the "Sociology of Religion." Although Parsons entered Harvard through the Economics Department, he never wanted to be an economist. All of his activities and his basic intellectual interest propelled him toward [[sociology]], but no Sociology Department existed in his first years at Harvard. However, Harvard was working toward establishing one and Parsons prepared in various ways in writing and teaching obligations so he was ready to join it when it was finally established. Despite oral tradition, Parsons was never "forced" out of the Economics Department, but his exit was voluntary and deliberate.

====Harvard Sociology Department====
The chance for a shift to [[sociology]] came in 1930, when Harvard's first Sociology Department was created{{sfn|Dillon|2013|page=157}} under Russian scholar [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. Sorokin, who had fled the [[Russian Revolution]] from [[Russia]] to the United States in 1923, was given the opportunity to establish the department. Parsons became one of the new department's two instructors, along with Carl Joslyn. Parsons established close ties with [[biochemist]] and sociologist [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson]], who took personal interest in Parsons' career at Harvard. Parsons became part of L.J. Henderson's famous Pareto study group in which some of the most important intellectuals at Harvard participated, including [[Crane Brinton]], [[George C. Homans]], and [[Charles P. Curtis]]. Parsons wrote an article on Pareto's theory&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Pareto's Central Analytical Scheme." In Talcott Parsons, ''The Early Essays'' Edited C. Camic. Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and later explained that he had adopted the concept of "social system" from reading Pareto. Parsons also made strong connections with two other influential intellectuals with whom he corresponded for years: economist [[Frank H. Knight]] and Chester I. Barnard, one of the most dynamic businessmen of the US. The relationship between Parsons and Sorokin quickly ran sour. A pattern of personal tensions was aggravated by Sorokin's deep dislike for American civilisation, which he regarded as a sensate culture that was in decline. Sorokin's writings became increasingly anti-scientistic in his later years, widening the gulf between his work and Parsons' and turning the increasingly-positivisitic American sociology community against him. Sorokin also tended to belittle all sociology tendencies that differed from his own writings, and by 1934, Sorokin was quite unpopular at Harvard.

Some of Parsons' students in the first years of the new department of Sociology were people like Robin Williams, Jr., [[Robert K. Merton]], Kingsley Davis, Wilbert Moore, Edward C. Devereux, Logan Wilson, Nicholas Demereth, John Riley, Jr., and Mathilda White Riley. Later cohorts of students had with Harry Johnson, Bernard Barber, Marion Levy and [[Jesse R. Pitts]]. Parsons established, at the students' request, a little, informal study group which met year after year in Adams' house. Toward the end of Parsons' career, German systems theorist [[Niklas Luhmann]] also attended his lectures.

In 1932, Parsons bought his famous farmhouse in [[New Hampshire]] for $2500 in a wooded area near the small town of [[Acworth, New Hampshire|Acworth]], but Parsons often, in his writing, referred to it as "the farmhouse in [[Alstead, New Hampshire|Alstead]]." The farmhouse was not big and impressive; indeed, it was a very humble structure with almost no modern utilities. The farmhouse still became central to Parsons' life, and many of his most important works were written in its peace and quiet.

In the spring of 1933, Susan Kingsbury, a pioneer of women's rights in America, wrote to Parsons and offered him a position at [[Bryn Mawr College]]; however, Parsons declined the offer because, as he wrote to Kingsbury, "neither salary nor rank is really definitely above what I enjoy here."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Susan Kingsbury, April 15, 1933. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the academic year of 1939-1940 Parsons and Schumpeter conducted an informal faculty seminar at Harvard, which met in Emerson Hall and discussed the concept of [[rationality]]. Among the participants in the seminary were D.V. McGranahan, [[Abram Bergson]], [[Wassily Leontief]], [[Gottfried Haberler]], and [[Paul Sweezy]]. Schumpeter contributed with the essay "Rationality in Economics" to the seminar, and Parsons submitted the paper "The Role of Rationality in Social Action" for a general discussion.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Loring Allen, ''Opening Doors: The Life and Work of Joseph Schumpeter Vol 2: America.'' New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1991. p. 98. An edited version of Schumpeter's paper to the seminary was published in ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft.'' Vol.140. no.4. December 1984: 577–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Schumpeter suggested to Parsons that they should write or edit a book together on rationality, but the project never materialized.

===Neoclassical economics vs. institutionalists===
In the prevailing discussion between [[neoclassical economics]] and the [[institutional economics|institutionalists]], which was one of the conflicts that prevailed within the field of economics in the 1920s and early 1930s, Parsons attempted to walk a very fine line. He was very critical about neoclassical theory, an attitude that prevailed all the way through his life and is reflected in his critique of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]]. He was opposed to the utilitarian bias within the neoclassical approach and could not embrace them fully. However, he agreed partly on their theoretical and methodological style of approach, which should be distinguished from its substance. He was thus unable to accept the institutionalist solution. In an interview in 1975, Parsons would recall a conversation with Schumpeter on the institutionalist methodological position: "An economist like Schumpeter, by contrast, would absolutely have none of that. I remember talking to him about the problem and .. I think Schumpeter was right. If economics had gone that way [like the institutionalists] it would have had to become a primarily empirical discipline, largely descriptive, and without theoretical focus. That's the way the 'institutionalists' went, and of course [[Wesley Mitchell|Mitchell]] was affiliated with that movement."&lt;ref name="Martin U. Martel 1975"&gt;Martin U. Martel, ''Dialogues with Parsons.'' Transcript, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Nazism===
Parsons returned to Germany in the summer of 1930 and became a direct eyewitness to the feverish atmosphere in [[Weimar Germany]] during which the [[Nazi Party]] rose to power. Parsons would receive constant reports about the rise of [[Nazism]] through his friend, [[Edward Y. Hartshorne]], who was travelling there. Parsons began, in the late 1930s, to warn the American public about the Nazi threat, but he had little success, as a poll showed that 91% of the country opposed the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Science Monitor'', May 25, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the US thought also that the country should have stayed out of the [[First World War]] and that the Nazis were, regardless of what they did in Germany or even Europe, no threat to the US. Many Americans even sympathized with Germany, as many had ancestry from there, and the latter both was strongly anticommunist and had gotten itself out of the [[Great Depression]] while the US was still suffering from it.

One of the first articles that Parsons wrote was "New Dark Age Seen If Nazis Should Win." Parsons became one of the key initiators of the Harvard Defense Committee, aimed at rallying the American public against the Nazis. Parsons' voice would sound again and again over [[Boston]]'s local radio stations, and he also spoke against Nazism during a dramatic meeting at Harvard, which disturbed by antiwar activists. Together with graduate student [[Charles O. Porter]], Parsons would rally graduate students at Harvard for the war effort. (Porter would later become a Democratic US Representative for Oregon.) During the war, Parsons conducted a special study group at Harvard, which analyzed what its members considered the causes of Nazism, and the topic's leading experts participated.

==Second World War==
In the spring of 1941, a discussion group on [[Japan]] began to meet at Harvard. The group's five core members were Parsons, [[John K. Fairbank]], [[Edwin O. Reischauer]], William M. McGovern, and Marion Levy, Jr. A few others would also occasionally join the group, including Ai-Li Sung (also known as Ai-Li Sung Chin) and Edward Y. Hartshorne. The group rose out of a strong desire to understand the country whose power in the East had grown tremendously and had allied itself with Germany), but as Levy frankly admitted, "Reischauer was the only one who knew anything about Japan."&lt;ref&gt;Telephone conversations between William Buxton and Marion Levy, April 14 and May 19, 2000. In William Buxton and William J. Buxton and Lawrence T. Nichols, "Talcott Parsons and the "Far East" at Harvard, 1941-48: Comparative Institutions and National Policy." ''American Sociologist,'' Summer 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons, however, was eager to learn more about it and was "concerned with general implications."

Shortly after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], Parsons wrote in a letter to [[Arthur Upham Pope]] (1881–1969) that the importance of studies of Japan certainly had intensified.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Arthur U. Pope, December 1941. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Parsons worked on arranging a major study of occupied countries with Bartholomew Landheer of the [[Netherlands]] Information Office in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons and Bartholomew Landheer, "Memorandum of a Proposed Sociological Study of Social Consequences of Conquest and Occupation in Certain European Countries." Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons had mobilized Georges Gurvitch, [[Conrad Arnsberg]], Dr. Safranek and [[Theodore Abel]] to participate,&lt;ref&gt;Uta Gerhardt, ''Talcott Parsons: An Intellectual Biography.'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; but it never materialized for lack of funding. In early 1942, Parsons unsuccessfully approached Hartshorne, who had joined the Psychology Division of the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) in Washington to interest his agency in the research project. In February 1943, Parsons became the deputy director of Harvard School of Overseas Administration, which educated administrators to "run" the occupied territories in Germany and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The task of finding relevant literature on both Europe and Asia was mindboggling and occupied a fair amount of Parsons' time. One scholar Parsons came to know was [[Karl August Wittfogel]] and discussed Weber. On China, Parsons received fundamental information from Chinese scholar Ai-Li Sung Chin and her husband, Robert Chin. Another Chinese scholar Parsons worked closely with there period was Hsiao-Tung Fei (or Fei Xiaotong) (1910–2005), who had studied at the London School of Economics and was an expert on the social structure of the Chinese village.

===Intellectual exchanges===
Parsons met [[Alfred Schutz]] (or Schütz) during the rationality seminar, which he conducted, together with Schumpeter, at Harvard in the spring of 1940. Schutz has been close to [[Edmund Husserl]] and was deeply embedded in his phenomenological philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schutz's phenomenology is not a simple "copy" of Husserl but was close: Helmuth R. Wagner, "The Limitation of Phenomenology: Alfred Schutz's critical dialogue with Edmund Husserl." ''Husserl Studies'' Vol.1. No.1. December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Schutz was born in [[Vienna]] but moved to the US in 1939, and for years, he worked on the project of developing a [[phenomenological sociology]], primarily based on an attempt to find some point between Husserl's method and Weber's sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schutz, ''Der sinnhafte Aufbau der Sociale Welt: eine Einleitung in die verstehende Soziology.'' Wien: J. Springer, 1932. The work appeared in English under the title: Alfred Schutz, ''The Phenomenology of the Social World.'' Northwestern University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons had asked Schutz to give a presentation at the rationality seminar, which he did on April 13, 1940, and Parsons and Schutz had lunched together afterward. Schutz was fascinated with Parsons' theory, which he regarded as the state-of-the-art social theory, and wrote an evaluation of Parsons' theory that he kindly asked Parsons to comment. That led to a short but intensive correspondence, which generally revealed that the gap between Schutz's sociologized phenomenology and Parsons concept of voluntaristic action was far too great.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Grathoff (ed.) ''The Correspondence between Alfred Schutz and Talcott Parsons: The Theory of Social Action.'' Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1978 (German version, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; From Parsons' point of view, Schutz's position was too speculative and subjectivist that tended to reduce social processes to the articulation of a Lebenswelt consciousness. For Parsons, the defining edge of human life was action as a catalyst for historical change, and it was essential for sociology, as a science, to pay strong attention to the subjective element of action, but it should never become completely absorbed in it since the purpose of a science was to explain causal relationships, by covering laws or by other types of explanatory devices. Schutz's basic argument was that sociology cannot ground itself and that [[epistemology]] was not a luxury but a necessity for the social scientist. Parsons agreed but stressed the pragmatic need to demarcate science and philosophy and insisted moreover that the grounding of a conceptual scheme for empirical theory construction cannot aim at absolute solutions but need to take a sensible stock-taking of the epistemological balance at each point in time. However, the two men shared many basic assumptions about the nature of social theory, which has kept the debate simmering ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Bennetta Jules-Rosette, "Talcott Parsons and the Phenomenological Tradition in Sociology: An Unresolved Debate." ''Human Studies, vol.3. 1980. pp. 311–330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew M. Chew, "The Theoretical Quandary of Subjectivity: An Intellectual Historical Note on the Action Theories of Talcott Parsons and Alfred Schutz." ''Review of European Studies. Vol.1, No.1, June 2009.''&lt;/ref&gt; By request from Ilse Schutz, after her husband's death, Parsons gave, on July 23, 1971, permission to publish the correspondence between him and Schutz. Parsons also wrote "A 1974 Retrospective Perspective" to the correspondence, which characterized his position as a "Kantian point of view" and found that Schutz's strong dependence on Husserl's "phenomenological reduction" would make it very difficult to reach the kind of "conceptual scheme," which Parsons found essential for theory-building in social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "A 1974 Retrospective Perspective." in Richard Grathoff (ed.) ''The Correspondence of Alfred Schutz and Talcott Parsons: The Theory of Social Action.'' Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1978. pp. 115–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1940 and 1944, Parsons and [[Eric Voegelin]] (or Vögelin) (1901–1985) exchanged their intellectual views through correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Buxton and David Rehorick, "The Place of Max Weber in the Post-Structure Writings of Talcott Parsons" in A. Javier Treviño (ed.) ''Talcott Parsons Today: His Theory and Legacy in Contemporary Sociology.'' Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LeQuire|first1=Peter Brickey|last2=Silver|first2=Daniel|title=Critical Naïveté?

An Italian translation of the correspondence was published as an appendix in Emmanuele Morandi, ''La società accaduta: tracce di una 'nuova' scienza sociale in Eric Voegelin.'' Milano: FrancoAngeli, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons had probably met Voegelin in 1938 and 1939, when Voegelin held a temporary instructor appointment at Harvard. The bouncing point for their conversation was Parsons' manuscript on [[anti-Semitism]]  and other materials that he had sent to Voegelin. Discussion touched on the nature of [[capitalism]], the rise of the West, and the origin of Nazism. The key to the discussion was the implication of Weber's interpretation of [[Protestant ethics]] and the impact of [[Calvinism]] on modern history. Although the two scholars agreed on many fundamental characteristics about Calvinism, their understanding of its historical impact was quite different. Generally, Voegelin regarded Calvinism as essentially a dangerous totalitarian [[ideology]]; Parsons argued that its current features were temporary and that the functional implications of its long-term, emerging [[value-l system]] had revolutionary and not only "negative" impact on the general rise of the institutions of modernity.

The two scholars also discussed Parsons' debate with Schütz and especially why Parsons had ended his encounter with Schutz. Parsons found that Schutz, rather than attempting to build social science theory, tended to get consumed in philosophical detours. Parsons wrote to Voegelin: "Possibly one of my troubles in my discussion with Schuetz lies in the fact that by cultural heritage I am a Calvinist. I do not want to be a philosopher – I shy away from the philosophical problems underlying my scientific work. By the same token I don't think he wants to be a scientist as I understand the term until he has settled all the underlying philosophical difficulties. If the physicists of the 17th century had been Schuetzes there might well have been no [[Newtonian system]]."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons to Eric Voegelin, October 19, 1941. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, [[Stuart C. Dodd]] published a major work, ''Dimensions of society'',&lt;ref&gt;Stuart C. Dodd, ''Dimensions of Society: A Quantitative Systematics for the Social Sciences.'' New York: Macmillan, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; which attempted to build a general theory of society on the foundation of a mathematical and quantitative systematization of social sciences. Dodd advanced a particular approach, known as a "S-theory." Parsons discussed Dodd's theoretical outline in a review article the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Review of Dimensions of Society: A Quantitative Systematics for the Social Sciences by Stuart Carter Dodd." ''American Sociological Review'' Vol.7. No.5. October 1942. pp. 709–714.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons acknowledged Dodd's contribution to be an exceedingly formidable work but argued against its premises as a general paradigm for the social sciences. Parsons generally argued that Dodd's "S-theory," which included the so-called "social distance" scheme of Bogardus, was unable to construct a sufficiently sensitive and systematized theoretical matrix, compared with the "traditional" approach, which has developed around the lines of Weber, Pareto, Émile Durkheim, [[Sigmund Freud]], [[W. I. Thomas|William Isaac Thomas]], and other important agents of an action-system approach with a more clear dialogue with the cultural and motivational dimensions of human interaction.

In April 1944, Parsons participated in a conference, "On Germany after the War," of psychoanalytical oriented psychiatrists and a few social scientists analyze the causes of Nazism and to discuss the principles for the coming occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Uta Gerhardt, ''Talcott Parsons: An Intellectual Biography.'' Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the conference, Parsons opposed what he found to be Lawrence S. Kubie's reductionism. Kubie was a psychoanalyst, who strongly argued that the German national character was completely "destructive" and that it would be necessary for a special agency of the [[United Nations]] to control the German educational system directly. Parsons and many others at the conference were strongly opposed to Kubie's idea. Parsons argued that it would fail and suggested that Kubie was viewing the question of German's reorientation "too exclusively in psychiatric terms." Parsons was also against the extremely harsh [[Morgenthau Plan]], published in September 1944. After the conference, Parsons wrote an article, "The Problem of Controlled Institutional Change," against the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Problem of Controlled Institutional Change: An Essay in Applied Social Science." ''Psychiatry.'' Vol.8. 1945. pp. 79–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons participated as part-time adviser to the Foreign Economic Administration Agency between March and October 1945 to discuss postwar reparations and deindustrialization.&lt;ref&gt;Uta Gerhardt, "Introduction: Talcott Parsons's Sociology of National Socialism." In Uta Gerhardt, ''Talcott Parsons on National Socialism.'' New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1993. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a further discussion of his influence on the postwar situation and policies on Germany, see Uta Gerhardt, "Talcott Parsons and the Transformation from Totalitarianism to Democracy in the end of World War II." ''European Sociological Review,'' Vol.12. 1996. pp.303-325. For further discussion, see Uta Gerhardt, "Talcott Parsons und die Re-Education-Politik der amerikanischen Besatzungsmacht. ''Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Soziologie,'' Jg.24. Heft.4. 1998. pp. 121–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1945.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter P|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterP.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taking charge at Harvard===
Parsons' situation at Harvard University changed significantly in early 1944, when he received a good offer from [[Northwestern University]]. Harvard reacted to the offer from Northwestern by appointing Parsons as the chairman of the department, promoting him to the rank of full professor and accepting the process of reorganization, which could lead to the establishment of the new department of Social Relations. Parsons' letter to Dean [[Paul Buck]], on April 3, 1944, reveals the high point of this moment.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Dean Paul Buck, April 3, 1944. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the new development at Harvard, Parsons chose to decline an offer from [[William Langer]] to join the [[Office of Strategic Services]], the predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Langer proposed for Parsons to follow the [[American army]] in its march into Germany and to function as a political adviser to the administration of the occupied territories. Late in 1944, under the auspices of the Cambridge Community Council, Parsons directed a project together with Elizabeth Schlesinger. They investigated ethnic and racial tensions in the [[Boston]] area between students from [[Radcliffe College]] and [[Wellesley College]]. This study was a reaction to the upsurge of [[anti-Semicism]] in the Boston area, which began in late 1943 and continued into 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Uta Gerhardt, "A World from Brave to New: Talcott Parsons and the War Effort at Harvard University." ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'' Vol.15 (3), 257–289, Summer 1999. p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of November 1946, the Social Research Council (SSRC) asked Parsons to write a comprehensive report of the topic of how the social sciences could contribute to the understanding of the modern world. The background was a controversy over whether the social sciences should be incorporated into the National Science Foundation.

Parsons' report was in form of a large memorandum, "Social Science: A Basic National Resource," became available in July 1948 and remains a powerful historical statement about how he saw the role of modern social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Social Science: A Basic National Resource." In Samuel Z. Klauser &amp; Victor M. Lidz (eds.) ''The Nationalization of the Social Sciences.'' Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
===Russian Research Center===
Parsons became a member of the Executive Committee of the new Russian Research Center at Harvard in 1948, which had Parsons' close friend and colleague, [[Clyde Kluckhohn]], as its director. Parsons went to [[Allied-occupied Germany]] in the summer of 1948, was a contact person for the RRC, and was interested in the Russian refugees who were stranded in Germany. He happened to interview in Germany a few members of the Vlasov Army, a [[Russian Liberation Army]] that had collaborated with the Germans during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, "The Political Orientation of Talcott Parsons: The Second World War and its Aftermath." In Roland Robertson &amp; [[Bryan S. Turner (sociologist)|Bryan S. Turner]] (eds.) ''Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity.'' London: Sage Publications, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was named after [[Andrey Vlasov]], a Soviet general captured by the Germans in June 1942. The Vlasov movement's ideology was a hybrid of elements and has been called "communism without Stalin," but in the [[Prague Manifesto]] (1944), it had moved toward the framework of a constitutional liberal state.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Andreyev, ''Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Movement: Soviet reality and émigré theories.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany in the summer of 1948 Parsons wrote several letters to Kluckhohn to report on his investigations.

===Anticommunism===
Parsons' fight against [[communism]] was a natural extension of his fight against [[fascism]] in the 1930s and the 1940s. For Parsons, communism and fascism were two aspects of the same problem; his posthumous article "A Tentative Outline of American Values" was published in 1989&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "A Tentative Outline of American Values" in Roland Robertson &amp; [[Bryan S. Turner (sociologist)|Bryan S. Turner]] (eds.) ''Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity.''London: Sage Publication, 1991. "A Tentative Outline of the American Value System" was written in 1959 or 1960 and can be seen as a kind of prelude of Parsons' long-term interest in writing a major work about American society and was an attempt to facilitate the theoretical fundament of the concept of the "societal community," which represented the I-factor (the integrative function) of the social system and the extreme importance in the fact that Parsons regarded it as the epicenter (or the logical "starting-point") of the general process of differentiation in and of society.&lt;/ref&gt; and called both collectivistic types "empirical finalism," which he believed was a secular "mirror" of religious types of "salvationalism". In contrast, Parsons highlighted that American values generally were based on the principle of "instrumental activism," which he believed was the outcome of Puritanism as a historical process. It representing what Parsons called "worldly [[asceticism]]" and represented the absolute opposite principle of empirical finalism. One can thus understand Parsons' statement late in life that the greatest threat to humanity is every type of "[[fundamentalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Some Theoretical Considerations on the Nature and Trends of Change of Ethnicity" in Talcott Parsons, ''Social Systems and the Evolution of Action Theory'' New York: The Free Press, 1977, originally published 1975, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; By the term ''empirical finalism'', he implied the type of claim assessed by cultural and ideological actors about the correct or "final" ends of particular patterns of value orientation in the actual historical world (such as the notion of "a truly just society"), which was absolutist and "indisputable" in its manner of declaration and in its function as a belief system. For example, the [[Jacobins]]' behavior during the [[French Revolution]] would be a typical example. Parsons' rejection of communist and fascist totalitarianism was theoretically and intellectually an integral part of his theory of world history, and he tended to regard the European [[Reformation]] as the most crucial event in "modern" world history. Like Weber,&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism'' Roxbury Publishing Company, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; he tended to highlight the crucial impact of Calvinist religiosity in the socio-political and socio-economic processes that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, "Are there Cultural Limits to Inclusion? An Analysis of the Relation Between Culture and Social Evolution in Talcott Parsons' Theory." In Gabriele Pollini &amp; Giuseppe Sciortino (eds). ''Parsons' The Structure of Social Action and Contemporary Debates.'' Milano, Italy: FrancoAngeli, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained it reached its most radical form in England in the 17th century and gave in effect birth to the special cultural mode, which has characterized the American value system and history ever since. The Calvinist faith system, authoritarian in the beginning, eventually released in its accidental long-term institutional effects a fundamental democratic revolution in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Eric Voegelin, May 13, 1941. Talcott Parsons collection, Harvard University Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons maintained that the revolution was steadily unfolding, as part of his interpenetration of Puritan values in the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;See among others: Talcott Parsons, "Religious and Economic Symbolism in the Western World." ''Sociological Inquiry.'' Vol.49. (1) 1979. pp. 1–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American exceptionalism===
Parsons defended [[American exceptionalism]] and argued that because of a variety of historical circumstances, the impact of the Reformation had reached a certain intensity in [[British history]]. Puritan, essentially Calvinist, value patterns had become institutionalized in the Britain's internal situation. The outcome was that Puritan radicalism was reflected in the religious radicalism of the Puritan sects, in the poetry of [[John Milton]], in the [[English Civil War]], and in the process leading to the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. It was the radical fling of the [[Puritan Revolution]] that provided settlers in early 17th-century [[Colonial America]], and the Puritans who settled in America represented radical views on individuality, [[egalitarianism]], skepticism to state power, and the zeal of the religious calling. The settlers established something unique in the world that was under the religious zeal of Calvinist values.

Therefore, a new kind of nation was born, the character of which became clear by the time of the [[American Revolution]] and in the [[US constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, ''American Society: A Theory of Societal Community.'' Paradigm Publishers, 2007. See the chapter on American history.&lt;/ref&gt; And its dynamics later were studied by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1961. Originally published in 1835–1840.&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution was failed attempt to copy the American model. Although America has changed in its social composition since 1787, Parsons maintained that it preserves the basic revolutionary Calvinist value pattern. That has been further revealed in the pluralist and highly individualized America, with its thick, network-oriented [[civil society]], which is of crucial importance to its success and the factors have provided it with its historical lead in the industrialized process.

Parsons maintained has continued to place it in the leading position in the world but as a historical process and not in "the nature of thing." Parsons viewed the "highly special feature of the modern Western social world" as "dependent on the peculiar circumstances of its history, and not the necessary universal result of social development as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Sociological Reflections on the United States in Relation to the European War" (1941). In Uta Gerhardt (ed.) ''Talcott Parsons on National Socialism.'' New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1993. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defender of modernity===
In contrast to some "radicals," Parsons was a defender of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Leon|last=Mayhew|title=In defence of Modernity: Talcott Parsons and the Utilitarian Tradition|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=89|issue=6|date=May 1984|page=1273–1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that modern civilization, with its technology and its constantly evolving institutions, was ultimately strong, vibrant, and essentially progressive. He acknowledged that the future had no inherent guarantees, but as sociologists Robert Holton and [[Bryan S. Turner (sociologist)|Bryan Turner]] said that Parsons was not nostalgic&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite|last1=Turner|first1=Bryan S.|last2=Holton|first2=Robert J.|chapter=Against nostalgia: Talcott Parsons and a sociology for the modern world|editors=B.S. Turner and R.J. Holton|title=Talcott Parsons on Economy and Society|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|year=2015|origyear=1986|isbn=9781317652267}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he did not believe in the past as a lost "golden age" but that he maintained that modernity generally had improved conditions, admittedly often in troublesome and painful ways but usually positively. He had faith in humanity's potential but not naïvely. When asked at the Brown Seminary in 1973 if he was optimistic about the future, he answered, "Oh, I think I'm basically optimistic about the human prospects in the long run." Parsons pointed out that he was student at Heidelberg at the height of the vogue of [[Oswald Spengler]], the author of ''[[The Decline of the West]]'', "and he didn't give the West more than 50 years of continuing vitality after the time he wrote.... Well, its more than 50 years later now, and I don't think the West has just simply declined. He was wrong in thinking it was the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|chapter=A Seminar with Talcott Parsons at Brown University: My Life and Wor, March, 1973|editors=L.S. Moss and A. Savchenko|title=Talcott Parsons: Economist Sociologist of the 20th Century|location=Malden, MA|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard Department of Social Relations===
At Harvard, Parsons was instrumental in forming the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Department of Social Relations]], an interdisciplinary venture among sociology, anthropology, and psychology. The new department was officially created in January 1946 with him as the chairman and with prominent figures at the faculty, such as Stouffer, Kluckhohn, [[Henry Murray]] and [[Gordon Allport]]. An appointment for Hartshorne was considered but he was killed in Germany by an unknown gunman as he driving on the highway. His position went instead to [[George C. Homans]]. The new department was galvanized by Parsons idea of creating a theoretical and institutional base for a unified social science. Parsons also became strongly interested in [[systems theory]] and [[cybernetics]] and began to adopt their basic ideas and concepts to the realm of social science, especially the work of [[Norbert Wiener]] (1894–1964) had his attention.

Some of the students who arrived at the Department of Social Relations in the years after the Second World War were David Aberle, Gardner Lindzey, [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[David G. Hays]], Benton Johnson, Marian Johnson, Kaspar Naegele, James Olds, Albert Cohen, Norman Birnbaum, [[Robin Murphy Williams]], Jackson Toby, [[Robert N. Bellah]], Joseph Kahl, [[Joseph Berger (sociologist)|Joseph Berger]], Morris Zelditch, [[Renee Fox]], Tom O'Dea, [[Ezra Vogel]], [[Clifford Geertz]], Joseph Elder, Theodore Mills, Mark Field, [[Edward Laumann]], and Francis Sutton.

[[Renee Fox]], who arrived at Harvard in 1949, would become a very close friend of the Parsons family. Joseph Berger, who also arrived at Harvard in 1949 after finishing his B.A. from [[Brooklyn College]], would become Parsons' research assistant from 1952 to 1953 and would get involved in his research projects with Robert F. Bales.

According to Parsons' own account, it was during his conversations with [[Elton Mayo]] (1880–1949) that he realized it was necessary for him to take a serious look at the work of Freud. In the fall of 1938, Parsons began to offer a series of non-credit evening courses on Freud. As time passed, Parsons developed a strong interest in [[psychoanalysis]]. He volunteered to participate in nontherapeutic training at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute, where he began a didactic analysis with [[Grete L. Bibring|Dr. Grete Bibring]] in September 1946. Insight into psychoanalysis is significantly reflected in his later work, especially reflected in ''The Social System'' and his general writing on psychological issues and on the theory of socialization. That influence was also to some extent apparent in his empirical analysis of fascism during the war. Also, [[Wolfgang Köhler]]'s study of the mentality of apes and [[Kurt Koffka]]'s ideas of [[Gestalt psychology]] had Parsons's attention as well.

===''The Social System'' and ''Toward a General Theory of Action''===
During the late 1940s and the early 1950s, he worked very hard on producing some major theoretical statements. In 1951, Parsons published two major theoretical works, ''The Social System''&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, ''The Social System.'' New York: The Free Press, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Toward a General Theory of Action.''&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons &amp; Edward Shils (eds.) ''Toward a General Theory of Action.'' Cambridge, Mass.: [[Harvard University Press]], 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter work, which was coauthored with [[Edward Tolman]], Edward Shils and several others, was the outcome of the so-called Carnegie Seminar, which had taken place in the period of September 1949 and January 1950. The former work was Parsons' first major attempt to present his basic outline of a general theory of society since ''[[The Structure of Social Action]]'' (1937). He discusses the basic methodological and metatheoretical principles for such a theory. He attempts to present a general social system theory that is built systematically from most basic premises and so he featured the idea of an interaction situation based on need-dispositions and facilitated through the basic concepts of cognitive, cathectic, and evaluative orientation. The work also became known for introducing his famous pattern variables, which in reality represented choices distributed along a ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' vs. ''[[Gesellschaft]]'' axis.

However, the details of how Parsons thought about the outline of the social system went through a rapid series of changes in the following years but the basics remained. During the early 1950s, the idea of the AGIL model took place in Parsons's mind gradually. According to Parsons, its key idea was sparked during his work with Bales on motivational processes in small groups.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, Robert F. Bales &amp; Edward A. Shils (eds.) ''Working Papers in The Theory of Action.'' New York: The Free Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons carried the idea into the major work that he co-authored with a student, [[Neil Smelser]], which was published in 1956 as ''Economy and Society''.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons &amp; Neil J. Smelser, ''Economy and Society.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Within this work, the first rudimentary model of the AGIL scheme was presented. It reorganized the basic concepts of the pattern variables in a new way and presented the solution within a system-theoretical approach by using the idea of a cybernetic hierarchy as an organizing principle. The real innovation in the model was the concept of the "latent function" or the pattern maintenance function, which became the crucial key to the whole cybernetic hierarchy.

During its theoretical development, Parsons showed a persistent interest in [[Symbolic anthropology|symbolism]]. An important statement is Parsons' "The theory of symbolism in relation to action."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The theory of symbolism in relation to action." In Talcott Parsons, Robert F. Bales &amp; Edward A. Shils, ''Working Papers in the Theory of Action.'' New York: The Free Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; The article was stimulated by a series of informal discussion group meetings, which Parsons and several other colleagues in the spring of 1951 had conducted with philosopher and semiotician [[Charles W. Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Morris, ''Signs, Language and Behavior.'' New York: Prentice-Hall, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in symbolism went hand in hand with his interest in Freud's theory and "The Superego and the Theory of Social Systems," written in May 1951 for a meeting of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. The paper can be regarded as the main statement of his own interpretation of Freud&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Superego and the Theory of Social Systems." In Talcott Parsons, Robert F. Bales &amp; Edward A. Shils, ''Working Papers in the Theory of Action.'' New York: The Free Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; but also as a statement of how Parsons tried to use Freud's pattern of symbolization to structure the theory of social system and eventually to codify the cybernetic hierarchy of the AGIL system within the parameter of a system of symbolic differentiation. His discussion of Freud also contains several layers of criticism that reveal that Parsons's use of Freud was selective, rather than orthodox. In particular, he claimed that Freud that "introduced an unreal separation between the superego and the ego."

===Subscriber to systems theory===
Parsons was an early subscriber to systems theory. Parsons had early been fascinated by the writing of [[Walter B. Cannon]] and his concept of [[homeostasis]]&lt;ref&gt;Walter B. Cannon, ''The Wisdom of the Body.'' New York: Norton, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of the writings of French physiologist [[Claude Bernard]].&lt;ref&gt;Claude Bernard, ''An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine.'' New York: Dover, 1957. First published in French in 1865.&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in systems theory had been further stimulated by his contract with LJ Henderson. Parsons called the concept of "system" for an indispensable master concept in the work of building theoretical paradigms for social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Present Status of "Structural-Functional" Theory in Sociology." In Talcott Parsons, ''Social Systems and the Evolution of Action Theory.'' New York: The Free Press, 1977. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 to 1957, Parsons participated in an ongoing Conference on System Theory under the chairmanship of [[Roy R. Grinker, Sr.]], in Chicago.

Parsons came into contact with several prominent intellectuals of the time and was particularly impressed by the ideas of social insect biologist [[Alfred Emerson]]. Parsons was especially compelled by Emerson's idea that in the sociocultural world, the functional equivalent of the gene was that of the "symbol." Parsons also participated in two of the meetings of the famous [[Macy Conferences]] on systems theory
and on issues that are now classified as [[cognitive science]], which took place in New York from 1946 to 1953 and included scientists like [[John von Neumann]]. Parsons read widely on systems theory at the time, especially works of [[Norbert Wiener]]&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Wiener, ''Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in Man and the Machine.''Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Ross Ashby]]&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Ashby, ''Design for a Brain.'' Chapman &amp; Hall, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; who also were part of the core participants in the conferences. Around the same time, Parsons also benefited from conversations with political scientist [[Karl Deutsch]] on systems theory. In one conference, the Fourth Conference of the problems of [[consciousness]] in March 1953 at Princeton and sponsored by the Macy Foundation, Parsons would give a presentation on "Conscious and Symbolic Processes" and embark in an intensive group discussion which included exchange with child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;Harold A. Abramson (ed.) ''Problems of Consciousness: Transactions of the Fourth Conference, March 29,30 and 31, 1953, Princeton, NJ.'' New York: Corlies, Macy &amp; Company, Inc, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the other participants were Mary A.B. Brazier, [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]], [[Nathaniel Kleitman]], [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Zilboorg]]. Parsons would defend the thesis that [[consciousness]] was essentially a social action phenomenon, not primarily a "biological" one. During the conference, Parsons criticized Piaget for not sufficiently separating cultural factors from a physiologistic concept of "energy."

===McCarthy era===
During the [[McCarthy era]], on April 1, 1952, [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the Director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]], received a personal letter from an informant who reported on communist activities at Harvard. During a later interview, the informant claimed that "Parsons... was probably the leader of an inner group" of communist sympathizers at Harvard. The informant reported that the old department under Sorokin had been conservative and had "loyal Americans of good character" but that the new Department of Social Relations had turned into a decisive left-wing place as a result of "Parsons's manipulations and machinations." Hoover granted, on October 27, 1952 authorization to the Boston FBI to initiate a security-type investigation on Parsons. In February 1954, a colleague, Stouffer, wrote to Parsons, in [[England]] to inform him that Stouffer had been denied access to classified documents and that part of the stated reason was that Stouffer knew Communists, including Parsons, "who was a member of the Communist Party."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Samuel Stouffer to Talcott Parsons, February 5, 1954. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons immediately wrote an [[affidavit]] in defense of Stouffer, and he also defended himself against the charges that were in the affidavit: "This allegation is so preposterous that I cannot understand how any reasonable person could come to the conclusion that I was a member of the Communist Party or ever had been."&lt;ref&gt;Affidavit of February 23, 1954, from Talcott Parsons: Before the Eastern Industrial Personnel Security Board: Matter of Samuel Stouffer." Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; In a personal letter to Stouffer, Parsons wrote, "I will fight for you against this evil with everything there is in me: I am in it with you to the death." The charges against Parsons resulted in Parsons being unable to participate in a [[UNESCO]] conference, and it was not until January 1955 that he was acquitted of the charges.

===''Family, Socialization and Interaction Process''===
Since the late 1930s, Parsons had continued to show great interest in [[psychology]] and in [[psychoanalysis]]. In the academic year of 1955-1956, he taught a seminar at [[Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute]] entitled "Sociology and Psychoanalysis." In 1956, he published a major work, ''Family, Socialization and Interaction Process'',&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons et al., ''Family, Socialization and Interaction Process.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; which explored the way in which psychology and psychoanalysis bounce into the theories of [[motivation]] and [[socialization]], as well into the question of kinship, which for Parsons established the fundamental axis for that subsystem he later would call "the social community."

It contained articles written by Parsons and articles written in collaboration with [[Robert F. Bales]], [[James Olds]], [[Morris Zelditch, Jr.]], and [[Philip E. Slater]]. The work included a theory of [[personality psychology|personality]] as well as studies of role differentiation. The strongest intellectual stimuli that Parsons most likely got then was from brain researcher [[James Olds]], one of the founders of [[neuroscience]] and whose 1955 book learning and motivation was strongly influenced from his conversations with Parsons.&lt;ref&gt;James Olds, ''The Growth and Structure of Motives.'' Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas in the book had been submitted by Parsons in an intellectual [[brainstorming|brainstorm]] in an informal "work group," which he had organized with part of [[Joseph Berger (sociologist)|Joseph Berger]], William Caudill, Frank E. Jones, Kaspar D. Naegele, Theodore M. Mills, Bengt G. Rundblad, and others. Albert J. Reiss from [[Vanderbilt University]] had submitted his critical commentary.

In the mid-1950s, Parsons also had extensive discussions with Olds about the motivational structure of psychosomatic problems, and Parsons's concept of psychosomatic problems at the time was strongly influence by readings and direct conversations with [[Franz Alexander]] (a psychoanalyst (originally associated with Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute) who was a pioneer of psychosomatic medicine), Grinker and [[John Spiegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to James Olds of March 21, 1956. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, [[François Bourricaud]] was preparing a reader of some of Parsons' work for a French audience, and Parsons who wrote a preface for the book "Au lecteur français" (''To the French Reader''); it also went over Bourricaud's introduction very carefully. In his correspondence with Bourricaud, Parsons insisted that he did not necessarily treat values as the only let alone "the primary empirical reference point" of the action system since so many other factors were also involved in the actual historical pattern of an action situation.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Francois Bourricaud, February 7, 1955. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences===
Parsons spent 1957 to 1958 at the Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in [[Palo Alto, California]], where he, for the first time in his life, met [[Kenneth Burke]]; his flamboyant, explosive temperament made a great impression on Parsons, and they two men became close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Doubt, "The Untold Friendship of Kenneth Burke and Talcott Parsons." ''The Social Science Journal'' Vol.34. No.4. 1997. pp. 527–537.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons explained in a letter the impression Burke had left on him: "The big thing to me is that Burke more than anyone else has helped me to fill a major gap in my own theoretical interests, in the field of the analysis of expressive symbolism."

Another scholar whom Parsons met at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences at Palo Alto was [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], the "dean of American anthropologists." Kroeber, who had received his Ph.D. at Columbia and who worked with the [[Arapaho Indians]], was about 81 when he met Parsons. Parsons had the greatest admiration of Kroeber and called him "my favorite elder statesman."

In Palo Alto, Kroeber suggested to Parsons to write a joint statement together to clarify the distinction between cultural and social systems, then was the subject of endless debates. In October 1958, Parsons and Kroeber published their joint statement in a short article, "The Concept of Culture and the Social System," which became highly influential.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred L. Kroeber and Talcott Parsons, "The Concept of Culture and the Social System." ''American Sociological Review,'' Vol.23. No.5. 1958. pp. 582–583.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons and Kroeber declared that it is important both to keep a clear distinction between the two concepts and to avoid a methodology by which either would be reduced to the other.

==Later career==
===Public conferences===
In 1955 to 1956, a group of faculty members at [[Cornell University]] met regularly and discussed Parsons' writings. The next academic year, a series of seven widely attended public seminars followed and culminated in a session at which he answered his critics. The discussions in the seminars were summed up in a book edited by [[Max Black]], ''The Social Theories of Talcott Parsons: A Critical Examination''. It included an essay by Parsons, "The Point of View of the Author."&lt;ref&gt;Max Black (ed.) ''The Social Theories of Talcott Parsons: A Critical Examination.'' Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1961. The original edition was published by Prentice-Hall, [[Englewood Cliffs]], [[New Jersey]], in 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholars included in the volume were Edward C. Devereux, Jr., Robin M. Williams, Jr., Chandler Morse, Alfred L. Baldwin, [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], Henry A. Landsberger, [[William Foote Whyte]], Black, and Andrew Hacker. The contributions converted many angles including personality theory, organizational theory, and various methodological discussions. Parsons' essay is particularly notable because it and another essay, "Pattern Variables Revisited,"&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Pattern Variables Revisited: A Response to Robert Dubin." ''American Sociological Review,'' Vol.25. no.4. August 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; both represented he most full-scale accounts of the basic elements of his theoretical strategy and the general principles behind his approach to theory-building when they were published in 1960.

One essay also included, in metatheoretical terms, a criticism of the theoretical foundations for the so-called [[conflict theory]], however.

===Criticism of theories===
From the late 1950s to the student rebellion in the 1960s and its aftermath, Parsons's theory was criticized by some scholars and intellectuals of the left, who claimed that Parsons's theory was inherently conservative, if not reactionary. Gouldner even claimed that Parsons had been an opponent of the [[New Deal]].

Parsons's theory was further regarded as unable to reflect social change, human suffering, poverty, deprivation, and conflict. [[Theda Skocpol]] thought that the [[apartheid]] system in [[South Africa]] was the ultimate proof that Parsons's theory was "wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Theda Skocpol, ''States and Social Revolution.'' London: Cambridge University Press, 1979. p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Parsons's idea of the individual was seen as "oversocialized," "repressive," or subjugated in normative "conformity." In addition, [[Jürgen Habermas]]&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, "Talcott Parsons: Problems of Theory Construction." ''Sociological Inquiry.'' vol.51. no.3-4. 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; and countless others were of the belief that Parsons' systems theory and his action theory were inherently opposed and mutually hostile and that Parsons's system theory was especially "mechanical," "positivistic," "anti-individualistic," "anti-voluntaristic," and "de-humanizing" by the sheer nature of its intrinsic theoretical context.

By the same token, his evolutionary theory was regarded as "uni-linear," "mechanical," "biologistic," an ode to world system status quo, or simply an ill-concealed instruction manual for "the capitalist [[nation-state]]."

The first manifestations of that branch of criticism would be intellectuals like [[Lewis Coser]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Coser, ''The Function of Social Conflict.'' New York: The Free Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralf Dahrendorf]],&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Dahrendorf, "Out of Utopia." ''American Journal of Sociology'' vol.64. No.2. 1958. pp.115-124. See also Ralf Dahrendorf, ''Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society.'' London: Routledge and Kegan, 1959. (German original, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt; David Lockwood,&lt;ref&gt;David Lockwood,"Some Remarks on the Social System." ''British Journal of Sociology'' vol.7. no.2. 1958. pp. 115–124. See also David Lockwood, "Social Integration and System Integration." In G.K. Zollschan &amp; W. Hirsh (ed.) ''Exploration in Social Change.'' London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; John Rex,&lt;ref&gt;John Rex, ''Problems in Sociological Theory.'' London, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; [[C.W. Mills]],&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Mills, ''The Sociological imagination.'' London: Oxford University Press, 1976. (originally 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Bottomore]]&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bottomore, "Out of this world." ''New York Review of Books'' November 6, 1969. pp. 34–39.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Gouldner]]&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Gouldner, ''The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology.'' London: Heineman, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; among other.

===Democrat supporter===
Parsons supported [[John F. Kennedy]] on November 8, 1960; from 1923, with one exception, Parsons voted for Democrats all his life.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Kaalhauge Nielsen, "The Political Orientation of Talcott Parsons: The Second World War and its Aftermath." In Roland Robertson and [[Bryan S. Turner (sociologist)|Bryan S. Turner]] (ed.) ''Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity.'' London: Sage Publications, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed the Kennedy election widely in his correspondence at the time. Parsons was especially interested in the symbolic implications involved in the fact of Kennedy's [[Catholic]] background for the implications for the United States as an integral community. (It was the only time a Catholic became President of the United States.)

In a letter to Robert N. Bellah, he wrote, "I am sure you have been greatly intrigued by the involvement of the religious issue in our election."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Robert N. Bellah, November 25, 1960. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons, who described himself as a "Stevenson Democrat," was especially enthusiastic that his favored politician, [[Adlai Stevenson II]], had been appointed [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]]. Parsons had supported Stevenson in both 1952 and 1956 and was greatly disappointed that Stevenson twice lost heavily both times.

===Modernization theory influence===
In the early 1960s, it became obvious that his ideas had a great impact on much of the theories of [[modernization]] at the time. His influence was very extensive but at the same time, the concrete adoption of his theory was often quite selective, half-hearted, superficial, and eventually confused. Many modernization theorists never used the full power of Parsons' theory but concentrated on some formalist formula, which often was taken out of the context that had the deeper meaning with which Parsons originally introduced them.

In works by [[Gabriel A. Almond]] and [[James Smoot Coleman|James S. Coleman]], [[Karl W. Deutsch]], [[S.N. Eisenstadt]], [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], [[David E. Apter]], [[Lucian Pye|Lucian W. Pye]], [[Sidney Verba]], and [[Chalmers Johnson]], and others, Parsons' influence is clear.

Indeed, it was the intensive influence of Parsons' ideas in [[political sociology]] that originally got scholar William Buxton interested in his work.&lt;ref&gt;William Buxton, ''Talcott Parsons and the Capitalist Nation-State.'' University of Toronto Press, 1985. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[David Easton]] would claim that in the history of [[political science]], the two scholars who had made any serious attempt to construct a general theory for political science on the issue of political support were Easton and Parsons.&lt;ref&gt;David Easton, "Theoretical Approaches to Political Support." ''Canadian Journal of Political Science,'' IX, no.3. September 1976. p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interest in religion===
One of the scholars with whom he corresponded extensively with during his lifetime and whose opinion he highly valued was [[Robert N. Bellah]]. Parsons's discussion with Bellah would cover a wide range of topics, including the theology of [[Paul Tillich]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Robert N. Bellah to Talcott Parsons, March 23, 1959. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence would continue when Bellah, in the early fall of 1960, went to Japan to study [[Japanese religion]] and ideology. In August 1960, Parsons sent Bellah a draft of his paper on "The Religious Background of the American Value System" to ask for his commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Robert N. Bellah, August 19, 1960. Talcott Parsons Collection, Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to Bellah of September 30, 1960, Parsons discussed his reading of [[Perry Miller]]'s ''An Errand into the Wilderness''.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Miller, ''Errand into the Wilderness.'' Harvard University Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons wrote that Miller's discussion of the role of [[Calvinism]] "in the early [[New England theology]]... is a first rate and fit beautifully with the broad position I have taken."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Robert N. Bellah, September 30, 1960. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was a literary Harvard historian whose books such as ''The New England Mind''&lt;ref&gt;Perry Miller, ''The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century.'' Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; established new standards for the writing of American cultural and religious history. Miller remained one of Parsons' most favoured historians throughout his life. Indeed, religion had always a special place in Parsons' heart, but his son, in an interview, maintained that he that his father was probably not really "religious."

Throughout his life, Parsons interacted with a broad range of intellectuals and others who took a deep interest in religious belief systems, doctrines, and institutions. One notable person who interacted with Parsons was Marie Augusta Neal, a nun of the [[Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur]] who sent Parsons a huge number of her manuscripts and invited him to conferences and intellectual events in her [[Catholic Church]]. Neal received her Ph.D. from Harvard under Parsons's supervision in 1963, and she would eventually become professor and then chair of sociology at [[Emmanuel College (Massachusetts)|Emmanuel College]] in [[Boston]]. She was very enthusiastic about the [[Second Vatican Council]] and became known for the National Sisters Survey, which aimed at improving women's position in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3438012853/neal-sister-marie-augusta.html|title=Neal, (Sister) Marie Augusta - Dictionary definition of Neal, (Sister) Marie Augusta - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Riesman===
Parsons and Winston White cowrote an article, "The Link Between Character and Society," which was published in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons and Winston White, "The Link Between Character and Society." In Seymour Martin Lipset and [[Leo Lowenthal]] (ed.) ''Culture and Social Character.'' New York: The Free Press, 1961. Also reprinted in Talcott Parsons, ''Social Structure and Personality.'' New York: [[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]], 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a critical discussion of [[David Riesman]]'s ''[[The Lonely Crowd]],''&lt;ref&gt;David Riesman, [[Nathan Glazer]] and [[Reuel Denney]], ''The Lonely Crowd.'' New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; which had been published a decade earlier and had turned into an unexpected bestseller,  reaching 1 million sold copies in 1977. Riesman was a prominent member of the American academic left, influenced by [[Erich Fromm]] and the [[Frankfurt School]]. In reality, Riesman's book was an academic attempt to give credit to the concept of "[[mass society]]" and especially to the idea of an America suffocated in [[social conformity]]. Riesman had essentially argued that at the emerging of highly advanced [[capitalism]], the America basic value system and its socializing roles had change from an "inner-directed" toward an "other-directed" pattern of value-orientation. Parsons and White challenged Riesman's idea and argued that there had been no change away from an inner-directed personality structure. The said that Riesman's "other-directness" looked like a caricature of [[Charles Cooley]]'s [[looking-glass self]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Cooley, ''Human Nature and the Social Order.'' New York: Scribner's, 1902. pp. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; and they argued that the framework of "[[New institutional economics|institutional individualism]]" as the basic code-structure of America's normative system had essentially not changed. What had happen, however, was that the industrialized process and its increased pattern of societal differentiation had changed the family's generalized symbolic function in society and had allowed for a greater permissiveness in the way the child related to his parents. Parsons and White argued that was not the prelude to greater "otherdirectness" but a more complicated way by which inner-directed pattern situated itself in the social environment.

===Political power and social influence===
1963 was a notable year in Parsons's theoretical development because it was the year when he published two important articles: one on [[political power]]&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "On the Concept of Political Power." ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 107 (1963). Reprinted in Talcott Parsons, ''Politics and Social Structure.'' New York: Free Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; and one on the concept of [[social influence]].&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "On the Concept of Influence." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'' Spring 1963. Reprinted in Talcott Parsons, ''Sociological Theory and Modern Society.'' New York: The Free Press, 1967. Also published in Talcott Parsons, ''Politics and Social Structure.'' New York: The Free Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The two articles represented Parsons's first published attempt to work out the idea of Generalized Symbolic Media as an integral part of the exchange processes within the AGIL system. It was a theoretical development, which Parsons had worked on ever since the publication of ''Economy and Society'' (1956). The prime model for the generalized symbolic media was [[money]] and Parsons was reflecting on the question whether the functional characteristics of money represented an exclusive uniqueness of the [[economic system]] or whether it was possible to identify other generalized symbolic media in other subsystems as well. Although each medium had unique characteristics, Parsons claimed that power (for the [[political system]]) and [[social influence|influence]] (for the societal community) had institutional functions, which essentially was structurally similar to the general systemic function of money. Using [[Roman Jakobson]]'s idea of "code" and "message," Parsons divided the components of the media into a question of value-principle versus coordination standards for the "code-structure" and the question of factor versus product control within those social process which carried the "message" components. While "utility" could be regarded as the value-principle for the [[economy]] (medium: money), "effectiveness" was the value-principle for the political system (by [[political power]]) and [[social solidarity]] for the societal community (by [[social influence]]). Parsons would eventually chose the concept of value-commitment as the generalized symbolic medium for the fiduciary system with [[integrity]] as the value principle.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "On the Concept of Value-Commitment." ''Sociological Inquiry'' 38. No.2. Spring 1968. pp. 135–160. Reprinted in Talcott Parsons, ''Politics and Social Structure.'' New York: The Free Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contacts with other scholars===
In August 1963, Parsons got a new research assistant, [[Victor Lidz]], who would become an important collaborator and colleague. In 1964, Parsons flew to Heidelberg to celebrate the 100th birthday of Weber and discuss Weber's work with Habermas, [[Herbert Marcuse]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Stammler (ed.), ''Max Weber and Sociology Today.'' New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons delivered his paper "Evaluation and Objectivity in Social Science: An Interpretation of Max Weber's Contribution."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Evaluation and Objectivity in Social Science: An Interpretation of Max Weber's Contribution." in Talcott Parsons, ''Sociological Theory and Modern Society.''New York: Free Press, 1967. pp. 79–101. (Originally delivered at the Weber Centennial, April 1964, Heidelberg.)&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting became in reality a clash between pro-Weberian scholars and the Frankfurt School. Before leaving for Germany, Parsons discussed the upcoming meeting with [[Reinhard Bendix]] and commented, "I am afraid I will be something of a Daniel in the Lion's den."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Reinhard Bendix, April 6, 1964. Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Bendix wrote back and told Parsons that Marcuse sounded very much like [[Christoph Steding]], a [[Nazi philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Reinhard Bendix to Talcott Parsons, April 6, 1964. Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons conducted a persistent correspondence with noted scholar [[Benjamin Nelson]],&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of Nelson, see Donald A. Nielsen, "Rationalization, Transformations of Consciousness and Intercivilizational Encounters: Reflections on Benjamin Nelson's Sociology of Civilizations." ''International Sociology,'' Vol. 16. no. 3. September 2001: 406-420.&lt;/ref&gt; And he shared a common interest in the rise and the destiny of [[civilizations]] until Nelson's death in 1977. The two scholars also shared a common enthusiasm for the work of Weber and would generally agree on the main interpretative approach to the study of Weber. Nelson had participated in the Weber Centennial in Heidelberg.

===Opposition to Frankfurt School===
Nelson got into a violent argument with [[Herbert Marcuse]] and accused him of tarnishing Weber.&lt;ref&gt;For Nelson's written critique of Marcuse, see "Discussion of Industrialization and Capitalism by Herbert Marcuse." In Otto Stammer (ed.) ''Max Weber and Sociology Today.'' New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1971. (Originally in German in 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; In reading the written version of Nelson's contribution to the Weber Centennial, Parsons wrote, "I cannot let the occasion pass without a word of congratulations which is strong enough so that if it were concert I should shout bravo."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Benjamin Nelson, February 13, 1967. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; In several letters, Nelson would keep Parsons informed of the often-turbulent leftist environment of Marcuse.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Benjamin Nelson to Talcott Parsons, September 18, 1967. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter of September 1967, Nelson would tell Parsons how much he enjoyed reading Parsons' essay on "Kinship and the associational Aspect of Social Structure."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Benjamin Nelson to Talcott Parsons, September 15, 1967. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, one of the scholars on whose work Parsons and Nelson would share internal commentaries was Habermas.

Parsons was opposed to the [[Vietnam War]] but was still disturbed by what he considered the anti-intellectual tendency in the student rebellion: serious debate often was substituted by handy slogans by communists [[Karl Marx]], [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Fidel Castro]].

===Ethnicity, kinship, and diffuse solidarity===
Parsons had for years corresponded with his former graduate student [[David M. Schneider]], who had taught at the [[University of California Berkeley]] until the latter, in 1960, accepted a position as professor in anthropology at the [[University of Chicago]]. Schneider had received his Ph.D. at Harvard in Social Anthropology in 1949 and had become a leading expert in the American kinship system. Schneider, in 1968, published ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account''&lt;ref&gt;David M. Schneider, ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account'' Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; that became a classic within the field, and he had sent Parsons a copy of the copyedited manuscript before its publication. Parsons was highly appreciative of Schneider's work, which became in many ways a crucial turing point in his own attempt to understand the fundamental elements of the American kinship system, a key to understanding the factor of [[ethnicity]] and especially building the theoretical foundation of his concept of the societal community, which, by the beginning of the early 1970s, had become a strong priority in the number of theoretical projects of his own intellectual life.

Parsons borrowed the term "diffuse enduring solidarity" from Schneider, as a major concept for his own considerations on the theoretical construction of the concept of the societal community. In the spring of 1968, Parsons and Schneider had discussed [[Clifford Geertz]]'s article on religion as a cultural system&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, "Religion as a cultural system" in Clifford Geertz, ''The Interpretation of Cultures.'' New York: Basic Books, 1973. pp. 87–125. Originally published in 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; on which Parsons wrote a review.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Comment on 'Religion as a Cultural System' by Clifford Geertz". in Donald R. Cutler (ed.) ''The Religious Situation, 1968.'' Boston: Beason,1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons, who was a close friend of Geertz, was puzzled over Geertz's article. In a letter to Schneider, Parsons spoke about "the rather sharp strictures on what he [Geertz] calls the extremely narrow intellectual tradition with special reference to Weber, but also to Durkheim. My basic point is in this respect, he greatly overstated his case seeming to argue that this intellectual tradition was by now irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to David Schneider, April 25, 1968. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider wrote back to Parsons, "So much, so often, as I read Cliff's stuff I cannot get a clear consistent picture of just what the religious system consist in instead only how it is said to work."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from David M. Schneider to Talcott Parsons, April 28, 1968. Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter of July 1968 to Gene Tanke of the [[University of California Press]], Parsons offered a critical note on the state of psychoanalytical theory and wrote: "The use of psychoanalytical theory in interpretation of social and historical subject matter is somewhat hazardous enterprise, and a good deal of nonsense has been written in the name of such attempts."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Gene Tanke, the University of California Press, July 25, 1968. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1969, Parsons was approached by the prestigious ''Encyclopedia of the History of Idea'' about writing an entrance in the encyclopedia on the topic of the "Sociology of Knowledge." Parsons accepted and wrote one of his most powerful essays, "The Sociology of Knowledge and the History of Ideas,"&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Sociology of Knowledge and the History of Ideas." In Helmut Staubmann (ed.)''Action Theory: Methodological Studies.'' LIT Verlag, Wien, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 or 1970. Parsons discussed how the [[sociology of knowledge]], as a modern intellectual discipline, had emerged from the dynamics of [[European intellectual history]] and had reached a kind of cutting point in the philosophy of Kant and further explored by [[Hegel]] but reached its first "classical" formulation in the writing of Mannheim,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mannheim, ''Ideology and Utopia.'' New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1936 [1929].&lt;/ref&gt; whose brilliance Parsons acknowledged but disagreed with his [[German historicism]] for its antipositivistic epistemology; that was largely rejected in the more positivistic world of American social science. For various reasons, the editors of the encyclopedia turned down Parsons' essay, which did not fit the general format of their volume. The essay was not published until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lidz, "Talcott Parsons' "Sociology of Knowledge: Introductory Comments." In Helmut Staubmann (ed.) ''Action Theory: Methodological Studies.'' LIT verlag, Wien 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons had several conversations with [[Daniel Bell]] on a "[[post-industrial society]]," some of which were conducted over lunch at William James Hall. After reading an early version of Bell's ''[[magnum opus]]'', "The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society," Parsons wrote a letter to Bell, dated November 30, 1971, to offer his criticism. Among his many critical points, Parsons stressed especially that Bell's discussion of technology tended to "separate off culture" and treat the two categories "as what I would call culture minus the cognitive component."

Parsons' interest in the role of ethnicity and religion in the genesis of social solidarity within the local community heavily influenced another of his early 1960s graduate students, [[Edward Laumann]]. As a student, Laumann was interested in the role of social network structure in shaping community-level solidarity. Combining Parsons' interest in the role of ethnicity in shaping local community solidarity with [[W. Lloyd Warner]]'s structural approach to social class, Laumann argued that ethnicity, religion, and perceived social class all play a large role in structuring community social networks.&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Laumann. (1965). "Subjective Social Distance and Urban Occupational Stratification." ''American Journal of Sociology,'' 71:26-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward O Laumann. (1973). ''Bonds of Pluralism: The Form and Substance of Urban Social Networks.'' New York: Wiley Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Laumann, Richard Senter. (1976). "Subjective Social Distance, Occupational Stratification, and Forms of Status and Class Consciousness: A Cross-national Replication and Extension." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 81:1304–1338.&lt;/ref&gt; Laumann's work found that community networks are highly partitioned along lines of ethnicity, religion, and occupational social status. It also highlighted the tension individuals experience between their preference to associate with people who are like them ([[homophily]]) and their simultaneous desire to affiliate with higher-status others. Later, at the beginning of his career at the [[University of Chicago]], Laumann would argue that how the impulses are resolved by individuals forms the basis of corporate or competitive [[class consciousness]] within a given community.&lt;ref name="Laumann, Edward O. 2006"&gt;Laumann, Edward O. (2006). "A 45-year retrospective on doing networks." ''Connections'' 27:65-90.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to demonstrating how community solidarity can be conceptualized as a [[social network]] and the role of ethnicity, religion, and class in shaping such networks, Laumann's dissertation became one of the first examples of the use of population-based surveys in the collection of [[social network analysis|social network]] data, and thus a precursor to decades of egocentric social network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Linton C. ''The Development of Social Network Analysis.'' Vancouver: Empirical Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons thus played an important role in shaping social network analysis's early interest in homophily and the use of egocentric network data to assess group- and community-level social network structures.

===Systems theory on biological and social systems===
In his later years, Parsons became increasingly interested in working out the higher conceptual parameters of the human condition, which was in part what led him toward rethinking questions of cultural and social evolution and the "nature" of telic systems, the latter which he especially discussed with Bellah, Lidz, Fox, Willy de Craemer and others. Parsons became increasingly interested in clarifying the relationship between biological and social theory. Parsons was the initiator of the first Daedalus conference on "Some Relations between Biological and Social Theory," sponsored by the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Parsons wrote a memorandum dated September 16, 1971 in which he spelled out the intellectual framework for the conference. As Parsons explained in the memo, the basic goal of the conference was to establish a conceptual fundament for a theory of [[living systems]]. The first conference was held on January 7, 1972. Among the participants beside Parsons and Lidz were [[Ernst Mayr]], [[Seymour Kety]], [[Gerald Holton]], [[A. Hunter Dupree]], and [[William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr.]]. A second Daedalus Conference on Living Systems was held on March 1–2, 1974 and included [[Edward O. Wilson]], who was about to publish his famous work on [[sociobiology]]. Other new participants were John T. Bonner, [[Karl H. Pribram]], Eric Lennenberg and [[Stephen J. Gould]].

===Sociology of law===
Parsons began in the fall of 1972 to conduct a seminar on "Law and Sociology" with [[Lon L. Fuller]], who was well known for his ''The Morality of Law'' (1964). The seminar and his conversations with Fuller stimulated Parsons to write one of his most influential articles, "Law as an Intellectual Stepchild."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Law as an Intellectual Stepchild" ''Sociological Inquiry'' Vol.47. Nos 3-4, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons discuses [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]'s ''Law in Modern Society'' (1976). Another indication of Parsons' interest in law was reflected in his students, such as [[John Akula]], who wrote his dissertation in sociology, ''Law and the Development of Citizenship'' (1973). In September 1972, Parsons participated in a conference in [[Salzburg]] on "The Social Consequences of Modernization in Socialist Countries." Among the other participants were [[Alex Inkeles]], Ezra Vogel, and [[Ralf Dahrendorf]].

===Criticism of Bendix===
In 1972, Parsons wrote two review articles to discuss the work of Bendix, which provide a clear statement on Parsons' approach to the study of Weber. Bendix had become well known for his interpretations of Weber. In the first review article, Parsons analyzed the immigrant Bendix's ''Embattled Reason'',&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Embattled Reason: Essays on Social Knowledge.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; and he praised its attempt to defend the basic values of [[cognitive rationality]], which he unconditionally shared, and he agreed with Bendix that the question of cognitive rationality was primarily a cultural issue, not a category that could be reduced from biologial, economic, and social factors. However, Parsons criticized how Bendix had proceeded, who he felt especially had misrepresented the work of Freud and Durkheim. Parsons found that the misrepresentation was how Bendix tended to conceive the question of systematic theorizing, under the concept of "reductionism."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, ''Review essay: Embattled Reason: Essays on Social Knowledge, by Reinhard Bendix''. ''The American Journal of Sociology,'' Vol.77. no.4. January 1972. pp. 766-768.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons further found that Bendix approach suffered from a "conspicuous hostility" to the idea of [[evolution]]. Although Parsons assessed that Weber rejected the linear evolutionary approaches of Marx and [[Herbert Spencer]], Weber may not have rejected the question of evolution as a generalized question.

In a second article, a review of Bendix and [[Guenther Roth]]'s ''Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber'',&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Bendix and Guenther Roth, ''Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber.'' University of California Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons continued his line of criticism. Parsons was especially concerned with a statement by Bendix that claimed Weber believed Marx's notion that ideas were "the epiphenomena of the organization of production." Parsons strongly rejected that interpretation: "I should contend that certainly the intellectual "mature" Weber never was an "hypothetical" Marxist."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Review of Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber, by Reinhard Bendix and Guenther Roth." ''Contemporary Sociology,'' Vol.1.no.3. May 1972. pp. 200–203.&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere behind the attitudes of Bendix, Parsons detected a discomfort for the former to move out of an "idiographic" mode of theorizing.

===Study of US university===
In 1973, Parsons published ''The American University'', which he had authored with Gerald M. Platt.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons and Gerald M. Platt, ''The American University.'' Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea had originally emerged when Martin Meyerson and Stephen Graubard of the American Academy of the Art and Sciences, in 1969, asked Parsons to undertake a monographic study of the American university system. The work on the book went on for years until it was finished in June 1972.

From a theoretical point of view, the book had several functions. It substantiated Parsons' concept of the educational revolution, a crucial component in his theory of the rise of the modern world. What was equally intellectually compelling, however, was Parsons' discussion of "the cognitive complex," aimed at explaining how cognitive rationality and learning operated as an interpenetrative zone on the level of the general action-system in society. In retrospect, the categories of the cognitive complex are a theoretical foundation to understand what has been called the modern knowledge-based society.

==Retirement==
He officially retired from Harvard in 1973 but continued his writing, teaching, and other activities in the same rapid pace as before. Parsons also continued his extensive correspondence with a wide group of colleagues and intellectuals. He taught at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Rutgers University]], the University of Chicago, and the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. At Parsons' retirement banquet, on May 18, 1973, Robert K. Merton was asked to preside, while John Riley, Bernard Barber, Jesse Pitts, Neil J. Smelser and John Akula were asked to share their experiences of the man with the audience.

===Brown seminars===
One scholar who became important in Parsons' later years was professor [[Martin U. Martel]], of Brown University. They had made contact in the early 1970s at a discussion of an article that Martel had written about Parsons' work.&lt;ref&gt;Martin U. Martel, "Academentia Praecox: The Scope of Parsons' Multi-systemic Language Rebellion." In Herman Turk and Richard L. Simpson (eds.) ''Institutions and Social Exchange: The Sociologies of Talcott Parsons and George C. Homans.'' Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1971. pp. 175–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Martel arranged a series of seminars at Brown University in 1973 to 1974, and Parsons spoke about his life and work and answered questions from students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;A Seminar with Talcott Parsons at Brown University: "My Life and Work," March 10, 1973. In Laurence S. Moss and Andrew Savchenko (ed.) ''Talcott Parsons: Economic Sociologist of the 20th Century.'' Blackwell, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the participants at the seminars were Martel, Robert M. Marsh, Dietrich Rueschemeyer, C. Parker Wolf, Albert F. Wessen, A. Hunter Dupree, Philip L. Quinn, Adrian Hayes and Mark A. Shields. In February to May 1974, Parsons also gave the Culver Lectures at Brown and spoke on "The Evolution of Society." The lectures and were videotaped.

===Refinement of AGIL model===
Late in life, Parsons began to work out a new level of the AGIL model, which he called "A Paradigm of the Human Condition."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "A Paradigm of the Human Condition" in Talcott Parsons, ''Action Theory and the Human Condition.'' New York: Free Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The new level of the AGIL model crystallized in the summer of 1974. He worked out the ideas of the new paradigm with a variety of people but especially Lidz, Fox and Harold Bershady. The new metaparadigm featured the environment of the general action system, which included the physical system, the biological system, and what Parsons called the telic system. The telic system represents the sphere of ultimate values in a sheer metaphysical sense. Parsons also worked toward a more comprehensive understanding of the code-structure of social systems&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Action, Symbols and Cybernetic Control." in Ino Rossi (ed.) ''Structural Sociology.'' New York: [[Columbia University Press]], 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the logic of the cybernetic pattern of control facilitating the AGIL model. He wrote a bulk of notes: two being "Thoughts on the Linking of Systems" and "Money and Time."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to Adrian Hayes, March 20, 1979. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; He had also extensive discussions with Larry Brownstein and Adrian Hayes on the possibility of a mathematical formalization of Parsons' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Adrian Hayes to Talcott Parsons, March 28, 1975. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sick role theory===
Parsons had worked intensively with questions of [[medical sociology]], the medical profession, [[psychiatry]], [[psychosomatic]] problems, and the questions of [[health]] and [[illness]]. Most of all Parsons had become known for his concept of "the [[Sick role]]." The last field of social research was an issue that Parsons constantly developed through elaboration and self-criticism. Parsons participated at the World Congress of Sociology in [[Toronto]] in August 1974 at which he presented a paper, "The Sick Role Revisited: A Response to Critics and an Updating in Terms of the Theory of Action," which was published under a slightly different title, "The Sick Role and the Role of the Physician Reconsidered," in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Sick Role and the Role of the Physician Reconsidered." ''Millbank Memorial Fund Quarterly'' vol.53.no.3. Summer 1975. pp. 257–278.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, Parsons highlighted that his concept of "sick role" never was meant to be confined to "deviant behavior," but "its negative valuation should not be forgotten." It was also important to keep a certain focus on the "motivatedness" of illness since there always is a factor of unconscious motivation in the therapeutic aspects of the sick role.

===Criticism of broken covenant theory===
In 1975, Bellah published ''The Broken Covenant''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert N. Bellah, ''The Broken Covenant: American Civil Religion in Time of Trial.'' New York: Seabury Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Bellah referred was the sermon delivered by [[John Winthrop]] (1587–1649) to his flock on the ship ''Arbella'' on the evening of the landing in [[Massachusetts Bay]] in 1630. Winthrop declared that the Puritan colonists' emigration to the [[New World]] was part of a covenant, a special pact with God, to create a holy community and noted: "For we must consider that we shall be a city on the hill. The eyes of all people are upon us." Parsons disagreed strongly with Bellah's analysis and insisted that the covenant was not broken. Parsons later used much of his influential article, "Law as an Intellectual Stepchild,"&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Law as an Intellectual Stepchild" in Harry M. Johnson (ed.) ''System and Legal Process'' San Francisco, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss Bellah's position.

Parsons thought that Bellah trivialized the tensions of individual interests and society's interests by reducing them to "[[capitalism]];" Bellah, in his characterization of the negative aspects of American society, was compelled by a charismatic-based optimalism [[moral absolutism]].

===Symbolic interactionism===
In 1975, Parsons responded to an article by [[Jonathan H. Turner]], "Parsons as a Symbolic Interactionist: A Comparison of Action and Interaction theory."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Turner, "Parsons as a symbolic interactionist: A Comparison of Action and Interaction theory."''Sociological Inquiry'' Vol.44. no.4. 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons acknowledged that [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]] and [[symbolic interactionism]] should not be regarded as two separate, antagonistic positions but have overlapping structures of conceptualization.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Comment on 'Parsons as a Symbolic Interactionist' by Jonathan Turner.''Sociological Inquiry.'' Vol.45. no.1. 1975. pp. 62–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons regarded symbolic interactionism and the theory of [[George Herbert Mead]] as valuable contributions to action theory that specify certain aspects of the theory of the personality of the individual. Parsons, however, criticized the symbolic interactionism of [[Herbert Blumer]] since Blumer's theory had no end to the openness of action. Parsons regarded Blumer as the mirror image of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]],&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, ''Structural Anthropology'', Garden City, New York, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; who tended to stress the quasi-determined nature of macro-structural systems. Action theory, Parsons maintained, represented a middle ground between both extremes.

===Review of Piaget===
In 1976, Parsons was asked to contribute to a volume to celebrate the 80th birthday of [[Jean Piaget]]. Parsons contributed with an essay, "A Few Considerations on the Place of Rationality in Modern Culture and Society." Parsons characterized Piaget as the most eminent contributor to cognitive theory in the 20th century. However, he also argued that the future study of [[cognition]] had to go beyond its narrow encounter with [[psychology]] to aim at a higher understanding of how cognition as a human intellectual force was entangled in the processes of social and cultural institutionalization.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "A Few Considerations on the Place of Rationality in Modern Culture and Society." ''Revue européenne des sciences sociales.'' Tome XIV, No.38-39, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, when [[James Grier Miller]] published his famous work ''Living Systems'',&lt;ref&gt;James Grier Miller, ''Living Systems.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons was approached by ''Contemporary Sociology'' to write a review article on Miller's work. Parsons had already complained in a letter to [[A. Hunter Dupree]]&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Talcott Parsons to A. Hunter Dupree, January 10, 1979. Talcott Parsons Collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; that American intellectual life suffered from a deep-seated tradition of [[empiricism]] and saw Miller's book the latest confirmation of that tradition. In his review, "Concrete Systems and "Abstracted Systems,"&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Review Essay: Concrete Systems and Abstracted Systems." ''Contemporary Sociology'' Vol.8, No.5, 1979. pp. 696–705.&lt;/ref&gt; he generally praised the herculean task behind Miller's work but criticized Miller for getting caught in the effort of hierarchize concrete systems but underplay the importance of structural categories in [[theory building]]. Parsons also complained about Miller's lack of any clear distinction between cultural and non-cultural systems.

===Lectures in Japan===
Japan had long been a keen interest in Parsons' work. As early as 1958, a Japanese translation of ''Economy and Society'' appeared. Also, ''The Structure of Social Action'' was translated into Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Buxton, "Talcott Parsons and Japan in the 1970s." ''The American Sociologist'' Summer 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Social System'' was translated into Japanese by Tsutomu Sato in 1974. Indeed, Ryozo Takeda had, as early as 1952 in his ''Shakaigaku no Kozo ("The Framework of Sociology")'' introduced Japanese scholars to some of Parsons' ideas. Parsons had visited Japan for the first time in 1972 and he gave a lecture on November 25 to the Japanese Sociological Association, "Some Reflections on Post-Industrial Society" that was published in ''The Japanese Sociological Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Some Reflections on Post-Industrial Society." ''The Japanese Sociological Review.'' 24, 2. September 1973. pp.103-109.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Parsons participated in an international symposium on "New Problems of Advanced Societies," held in [[Tokyo]], and he wrote short articles written that appeared in the proceedings of the symposium.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Problem of Balancing Rational Efficiency with Communal Solidarity in Modern Society" in ''International Symposium on New Problems of Advanced Society.'' Tokyo: Japan Economic Research Institute, 1973. pp. 9–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Nature and Extent of Changes in Value Systems of Modern Societies." ''International Symposium on New Problems of Advanced Society.'' Tokyo: Japan Economic Research Institute, 1973. pp. 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Tominaga, born in 1931, a leading figure in Japanese sociology and a professor at the [[University of Tokyo]], was asked by Lidz to contribute to a two-volume collection of essays to honor Parsons. Tominaga wrote an essays on the industrial growth model of Japan and used Parsons' AGIL model.&lt;ref&gt;Ken'ichi Tominaga, "Growth, Development, and Structural Change of the Social System." in Jan J. Loubser, Rainer V. Baum, Andrew Effrat and Victor M. Lidz (eds.) ''Explorations in General Theory in Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons.'' Vol.2. New York: The Free Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Professor Washio Kurata, the new dean of the Faculty of Sociology of [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] wrote to Parsons and invited him to visit Japan during the 1978-1979 academic year. In early spring, Parsons accepted the invitation, and on October 20, 1978 Parsons arrived at the [[Osaka International Airport|Osaka Airport]], accompanied by his wife, and was greeted royally by a large entourage.

Parsons began weekly lectures at Kwansei's sociology department from October 23 to December 15. Parsons gave his first public lecture to a huge mass of undergraduates, "The Development of Contemporary Sociology." Professor Hideichiro Nakano served as an interpreter.

On November 17–18, when the Sengari Seminar House was opened, Parsons was invited as the key speaker at the event and gave two lectures, "On the Crisis of Modern Society"&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "On the Crisis of Modern Society." Transcript of the public lecture given a Sengari House, Kwansei Gakuin University, November 17, 1978. Copy in Talcott Parsons collection, Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Modern Society and Religion."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Modern Society and Religion." Transcript of the public lecture given a Sengari House, Kwansei Gakuin University, November 18, 1978. Copy in Talcott Parsons collection, Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Present were Tominaga, Mutsundo Atarashi, Kazuo Muto, and Hideichiro Nakano.

On November 25, lectures at [[Kobe]] University were organized by Hiroshi Mannari. Parsons lectured on organization theory to the faculty and the graduate students from the Departments of Economics, Management and Sociology. Also, faculty members from [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]] Universities were present. A text was published the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "An Approach to the Theory of Organizations" ''Organizational Science.'' Vol.13. no.1. April 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30 to December 1, Parsons participated in a Tsukuba University Conference in Tokyo; Parsons spoke on "Enter the New Society: The Problem of the Relationship of Work and Leisure in Relation to Economic and Cultural Values."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Enter the New Society: The Problem of the Relationship of Work and Leisure in Relation to Economic and Cultural Values." Transcript of the public lecture given at the Tsukuba Conference, Tsukuba University, December 1, 1978. Copy in Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, Parsons gave a lecture at Kyoto University on "A Sociologist Looks at Contemporary U.S. Society."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "A Sociologist Looks at Contemporary U.S. Society." Transcript of the lecture given at the Kyoto University, December 5, 1978. Copy in Talcott Parsons collection. Harvard University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a special lecture at Osaka on December 12, Parsons spoke, at the suggestion of Tominaga, on "Social System Theory and Organization Theory" to the Japanese Sociological Association. Earlier that day, Parsons had a discussion with Tominaga at Iwanami Shoten, which was published in a journal ''SHISO''.

On December 14, Kwansei Gakuin University granted Parsons an honorary doctor degree. Some of his lectures would be collected into a volume by Kurata and published in 1983. The Parsons flew back to the US in mid-December 1978.

As a sign of friendship Hideichiro Nakano sent Parsons a [[Buddha]] mask. Parsons had especially been captivated by certain aspects of [[Zen Buddhism]]. He told his friends that after his experience in Japan, he was going to reconsider certain aspects of his interpretation of the origins of modern civilizations.

==Death==
In [[Munich]] on a trip to Germany, where he was celebrating the 50th anniversary of his degree at Heidelberg. The day before, he had given a lecture of [[social class]] to an audience of German intellectuals, including Habermas, [[Niklas Luhmann]] and [[Wolfgang Schluchter]].

==Work==
Parsons produced a general theoretical system for the analysis of [[society]], which he called "theory of action," based on the methodological and epistemological principle of "analytical realism" and on the ontological assumption of "voluntaristic action."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, ''The Structure of Social Action.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons' concept of analytical realism can be regarded as a kind of compromise between [[nominalist]] and [[philosophical realism|realist]] views on the nature of reality and human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer C. Baum and Victor Lidz, "Introduction to Meta-Theory" in Jan J. Loubser et al. (eds.) ''Explorations in General Theory in Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons.'' Volume One. New York: The Free Press, 1976. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons believed that objective reality can be related to only by a particular encounter of such reality and that general intellectual understanding is feasible through conceptual schemes and theories. Interaction with objective reality on an intellectual level should always be understood as an approach. Parsons often explained the meaning of analytical realism by quoting a statement by Henderson: "A fact is a statement about experience in terms of a conceptual scheme."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "On Building Social System Theory: A Personal History" in Talcott Parsons, ''Social Systems and the Evolution of Action Theory.'' New York: The Free Press, 1977. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, Parsons maintained that his inspiration regarding analytical realism had been [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]&lt;ref&gt;For the complex relationship between Parsons' action theory and Whitehead's philosophy, see Thomas J. Fararo, "On the Foundations of the Theory of Action in Whitehead and Parsons" in Jan J. Loubser et al. (ed.) ''Explorations in General Theory in Social Science.'' New York: The Free Press, 1976. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; although he might have gotten the idea much earlier. It is important for Parsons' "analytical realism" to insist on the reference to an objective reality since he repeatedly highlighted that his concept of "analytical realism" was very different from the "fictionalism" of Hans Vaihiger (Hans Vaihinger):&lt;ref&gt;Hans Vaihiger, ''The Philosophy of "As If."'' trans. C.K. Cohen. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;  "We must start with the assertion that all knowledge which purports to be valid in anything like the scientific sense presumes both the reality of object known and of a knower. I think we can go beyond that and say that there must be a community of knowers who are able to communicate with each other. Without such a presupposition it would seem difficult to avoid the pitfall of [[solipsism]]. The so-called natural sciences do not, however, impute the "status of knowing subjects" to the objects with which they deal."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "On theory and metatheory." ''Humboldt Journal of Social Relations.'' 7:1 - Fall/Winter 1979–1980. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Structure of Social Action''===
''[[The Structure of Social Action]]'' (SSA), Parsons' most famous work, took form piece by piece. Its central figure was Weber, and the other key figures in the discussion were added, little by little, as the central idea took form. One important work that helped Parsons' central argument in was, in 1932, unexpectedly found: [[Élie Halévy]]'s ''La formation du radicalisme philosophique''(1901–1904); he read the three-volume work in French. Parsons explained, "Well, Halévy was just a different world... and helped me to really get in to many clarifications of the assumptions distinctive to the main line of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[utilitarianism|utilitarian thought]]; assumptions about the 'natural identity of interest', and so on. I still think it is one of the true masterpieces in intellectual history."&lt;ref name="Martin U. Martel 1975"/&gt; Parsons first achieved significant recognition with the publication of ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937), his first grand synthesis, combining the ideas of Durkheim, Weber, Pareto, and others.

===Action theory===
Parsons' action theory can be characterized as an attempt to maintain the scientific rigour of positivism while acknowledging the necessity of the "subjective dimension" of human action incorporated in hermeneutic types of sociological theories. It is cardinal in Parsons' general theoretical and methodological view that human action must be understood in conjunction with the motivational component of the human act. Social science must consider the question of ends, purpose, and ideals in its analysis of human action. Parsons' strong reaction to behavioristic theory as well as to sheer materialistic approaches derives from the attempt of the theoretical positions to eliminate ends, purpose, and ideals as factors of analysis. Parsons, in his term papers at Amherst, was already criticizing attempts to reduce human life to psychological, biological, or materialist forces. What was essential in human life, Parsons maintained, was how the factor of [[culture]] was codified. Culture, however, was to Parsons an independent variable in that it could not be "deducted" from any other factor of the social system. That methodological intention is given the most elaborate presentation in ''The Structure of Social Action,'' which was Parsons' first basic discussion of the methodological foundation of the social sciences.

Some of the themes in ''The Structure of Social Action'' had been presented in a compelling essay two years earlier in "The Place of Ultimate Values in Sociological Theory."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Place of Ultimate Values in Sociological Theory." In Talcott Parsons, ''The Early Essays.'' Edited by Charles Camic. Chicago &amp; London: The University of Chicago, 1991. (The essay was originally published in 1935.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations to cybernetics and system theory===
Parsons developed his ideas during a period when systems theory and cybernetics were very much on the front burner of social and behavioral science. In using systems thinking, he postulated that the relevant systems treated in social and behavioral science were "open:" they were embedded in an environment with other systems. For social and behavioral science, the largest system is "the action system," the interrelated behaviors of human beings, embedded in a physical-organic environment.&lt;ref&gt;A good summary of the "action frame of reference" as it developed over time is found in Leonard Mayhew's introduction to his anthology of Parsons' major essays, Mayhew, Leonard (1982) "Introduction" in Talcott Parsons, ''Talcott Parsons on institutions and social evolution'', pp: 1–62. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Parsons developed his theory, it became increasingly bound to the fields of cybernetics and system theory but also to Emerson's concept of homeostasis&lt;ref&gt;Alfred E. Emerson, "Homeostasis and comparison of systems" in Roy R. Grinker (ed.) ''Toward a Unified Theory of Human Behavior: An Introduction to General Systems Theory.''New York: Basic Books, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ernst Mayr]]'s concept of "teleonomic processes."&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr, "Teleological and teleonomic: A New Analysis." pp. 78–104 in Marx Wartofsky (ed.) ''Method and Metaphysics: Methodological and Historical Essays in the Natural and Social Sciences.'' Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; On the metatheoretical level, Parson attempted to balance psychologist phenomenology and idealism on the one hand and pure types of what Parsons called the utilitarian-positivistic complex, on the other hand.

The theory includes a general theory of [[social evolution]] and a concrete interpretation of the major drives of world history. In Parsons' theory of history and evolution, the constitutive-cognitive symbolization of the cybernetic hierarchy of action-systemic levels has, in principle, the same function as genetic information in DNA's control of biological evolution, but that factor of metasystemic control does not "determine" any outcome but defines the orientational boundaries of the real pathfinder, which is action itself. Parsons compares the constitutive level of society with [[Noam Chomsky]]'s concept of "[[deep structure]]."

As Parsons wrote, "The deep structures do not as such articulate any sentences which could convey coherent meaning. The surface structures constitute the level at which this occurs. The connecting link between them is a set of rules of transformation, to use Chomsky's own phase."&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "Action, Symbol, and Cybernetic Control." In Ino Rossi (ed.) ''Structural Sociology'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1982. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The transformative processes and entities are generally, at least on one level of empirical analysis, performed or actualized by myths and religions,&lt;ref&gt;Roland Robertson, "The Central Significance of 'religion' in Social Theory: Parsons as an epical theorist." In Roland Robertson and [[Bryan S. Turner (sociologist)|Bryan S. Turner]] (ed.) ''Talcott Parsons: Theorist of Modernity'' London: Sage Publications, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; but philosophies, art systems, or even semiotic consumer behavior can, in principle, perform that function.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lidz, "Religion and Cybernetic Concepts in the Theory of Action." ''Sociological Analysis.'' vol.43.no.4.1982. pp. 287–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unified concept of social science===
Parsons' theory reflects a vision of a unified concept of social science and indeed of [[living systems]]&lt;ref&gt;Parsons discussed the concept of living systems many times in later life both in publications as well in his correspondence with Dupree, Lidz, Martel, and others. An important discussion of living system is in "Concrete Systems and Abstracted" Systems: Review article of Living Systems by James Grier Miller." ''Contemporary Sociology'' Vol.8. no.5. Sep. 1979. pp. 696–705.&lt;/ref&gt; in general. His approach differs in essence from Niklas Luhmann's theory because Parsons rejects the idea that systems can be autopoietic, short of the actual action system of individual actors. Systems have immanent capacities but only as an outcome of the institutionalized processes of action-systems, which, in the final analysis, is the historical effort of individual actors. While Luhmann became caught up in sheer systemic immanence, Parsons insisted that the question of autocatalytic and homeostatic processes and the question about the actor as the ultimate "first mover" on the other hand was not mutually exclusive. Homeostatic processes might be necessary if and when they occur but action is necessitating.

It is only that perspective of the ultimate reference in action that Parsons' dictum (that higher-order cybernetic systems in history will tend to control social forms that are organized on the lower levels of the cybernetic hierarchy) should be understood. For Parsons, the highest levels of the cybernetic hierarchy as far as the general action level is concerned is what Parsons calls the constitutive part of the cultural system (the L of the L). However, within the interactional processes of the system, attention should be paid especially to the cultural-expressivistic axis (the L-G line in the AGIL). By the term "constitutive," Parsons generally referred to very highly codified cultural values especially religious elements (but other interpretation of the term "constitutive" is possible).&lt;ref&gt;The complete structure of Parsons AGIL system was scattered around in dozens of his works and not presented in any handy form. However, the most elementary key elements was presented in Chapter 2 in Talcott Parsons and Gerald M. Platt, ''The American University'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1973. To understand the AGIL system, one needs to understand that it functions (in a sense) on three major levels: the highest level is the paradigm of the human condition, the next mediative level is what he calls the general action-system and the third level is the social system. (All three levels are active in any empirical social object at any time). Another important point is that Parsons, in a sense, operates with two cultural systems: there is the cultural system of the general action level and the so-called fiduciary system as the L-function of the social system. Common sense associates both systems with the idea of "culture." However, Parsons' separation of "culture" into the two distinct levels of conceptual analysis is fundamental.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural systems have an independent status from that of the normative and orientational pattern of the social system; neither system cannot be reduced to the other. For example, the question of the "cultural capital" of a social system as a sheer historical entity (in its function as a "fiduciary system"), is not identical to the higher cultural values of that system; that is, the cultural system is embodied with a metastructural logic that cannot be reduced to any given social system or cannot be viewed as a materialist (or behavioralist) deduction from the "necessities" of the social system (or from the "necessities" of its economy).&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth Staubmann, "Culture as a Subsystem of Action: Talcott Parsons and Cultural Sociology." Presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Atlanta, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Within that context, culture would have an independent power of transition, not only as factors of actual sociocultural units (like [[Western civilization]]) but also how original cultural bases would tend to "universalize" through interpenetration and spread over large numbers of social systems as with [[Classical Greece]] and [[Ancient Israel]], where the original social bases had died but the cultural system survived as an independently "working" cultural pattern, as in the case of [[Greek philosophy]] or in the case of [[Christianity]], as a modified derivation from its origins in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, ''Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives.'' Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parsons and Habermas===
The difference between Parsons and [[Jürgen Habermas]] lies essentially in how Habermas uses Parsons' theory to establish the basic propositions of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Theory of Communicative Action'' Volume 2. ''Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason.'' Boston: Beacon, 1987. (Original, Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas takes the division between Parsons' separation between the "outer" and the "inner" dimensions of the social system and labels them "system" (outer dimension (A-G)) and "lifeworld" (inner dimension (I-L)). The problem with this model from Parsons' point of view is a) that conflict within the social system can in reality emerge from any relational point and not simply from the system-lifeworld dichotomy, and b) by relating the system-lifeworld model to some kind of "liberation"-epic, Habermas produces the Utopian notion that the potentiality of conflict within the social system has some kind of "final solution," which produces a misleading concept of the nature of systemic conflict.

===General theory===
It is important to highlight that Parsons distinguished two "meanings" or modes of the term "general theory." He sometimes wrote about general theory as aspects of theoretical concerns of social sciences whose focus is on the most "constitutive" elements of cognitive concern for the basic theoretical systematization of a given field. Parsons would include the basic conceptual scheme for the given field, including its highest order of theoretical relations and naturally also the necessary specification of this system's axiomatic, epistemological, and methodological foundations from the point of view of logical implications.&lt;ref&gt;The issues were generally those that Parsons discussed in his first major work: Talcott Parsons, ''The Structure of Social Action.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For another discussion of such questions, see Rainer C. Baum and Victor Lidz, "Introduction to Meta-Theory" In Jan Loubser et al. (eds.) ''Explorations in General Theory in the Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons.'' New York: The Free Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; All the elements would signify the quest for a general theory on the highest level of theoretical concern.

However, general theory could also refer to a more fully/operational system whose implications of the conceptual scheme were "spelled out" on lower levels of cognitive structuralization, levels standing closer to a perceived "empirical object." In his speech to the American Sociological Society in 1947, he spoke of five levels:&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, "The Prospects of Sociological Theory." (1948). In Talcott Parsons, ''Essays in Sociological Theory.'' New York: The Free Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The General Theory level, which took form primarily as a theory of social systems.
# The theory of motivation of social behavior, which especially addressed questions of the dynamics of the social system and naturally presupposed theories of motivation, personality and socialization.
# The theoretical bases of systematic comparative analysis of social structure, which would involve a study of concrete cultures in concrete systems on various levels of generalization.
# Special theories around particular empirical problem areas.
# The "fitting" of the theories to specific empirical research techniques, such as statistics, and survey techniques.

During his life, he would work on developing all five fields of theoretical concerns but pay special attention to the development on the highest "constitutive" level, as the rest of the building would stand or fall on the solidity of the highest level.&lt;ref&gt;For one discussion of his efforts, see Jan J. Loubser, "General Introduction" in Jan Loubser et al. (eds.) ''Explorations in General Theory in the Social Science: Essays in Honor of Talcott Parsons.'' New York: The Free Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite myths, Parsons never thought that modern societies exist in some kind of perfect harmony with their norms or that most modern societies were necessarily characterized by some high level of consensus or a "happy" institutional integration. Parsons highlighted that is almost logically impossible that there can be any "perfect fit" or perfect consensus in the basic normative structure of complex modern societies because the basic value pattern of modern societies is generally differentiated in such a way that some of the basic normative categories exist in inherent or at least potential conflict with each other. For example, freedom and equality are generally viewed as fundamental and non-negotiable values of modern societies. Each represents a kind of ultimate imperative about what the higher values of humanity. However, as Parsons emphasizes, no simple answer on the priority of freedom or equality or any simple solution on how they possibly can be mediated, if at all. Therefore, all modern societies are faced with the inherent conflict prevailing between the two values, and there is no "eternal solution" as such. There cannot be any perfect match between motivational pattern, normative solutions, and the prevailing value pattern in any modern society. Parsons also maintained that the "dispute" between "left" and "right" has something to do with the fact that they both defend ultimately "justified" human values (or ideals), which alone is indispensable as values but are always in an endless conflictual position to each other.

Parsons always maintained that the integration of the normative pattern in society is generally problematic and that the level of integration that is reached in principle is always far from harmonious and perfect. If some "harmonious pattern" emerges, it is related to specific historical circumstances but is not a general law of the social systems.

===AGIL Paradigm===
The heuristic scheme that Parsons used to analyze systems and subsystems is called the "[[AGIL Paradigm]]" or the "AGIL scheme."&lt;ref&gt;P. McNeill, C. Townley, ''Fundamentals of Sociology,'' (Hutchinson Educational, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; To survive or maintain equilibrium with respect to its environment, any system must to some degree adapt to that environment (adaptation), attain its goals (goal attainment), integrate its components (integration), and maintain its latent pattern (latency pattern Maintenance), a sort of cultural template. The concepts can be abbreviated as AGIL and are called the system's functional imperatives. It is important to understand that Parsons AGIL model is an analytical scheme for the sake of theoretical "production," but it is not any simple "copy" or any direct historical "summary" of empirical reality. Also, the scheme itself does not explain "anything," just as the [[periodical table]] nothing by itself in the natural sciences. The AGIL scheme is a tool for explanations and is no better than the quality of the theories and explanation by which it is processed.

In the case of the analysis of a social action system, the AGIL Paradigm, according to Parsons, yields four interrelated and interpenetrating subsystems: the behavioral systems of its members (A), the personality systems of those members (G), the social system (as such) (I), and the cultural system of that society (L). To analyze a society as a social system (the I subsystem of action), people are posited to enact roles associated with positions. The positions and roles become differentiated to some extent and, in a modern society, are associated with things such as occupational, political, judicial, and educational roles.

Considering the interrelation of these specialized roles as well as functionally differentiated collectivities (like firms and political parties), a society can be analyzed as a complex system of interrelated functional subsystems:

The pure AGIL model for all living systems:
* (A) Adaptation.
* (G) Goal Attainment.
* (I) Integration.
* (L) Latency (pattern maintenance).

The Social System Level:
* The economy — social adaptation to its action and non-action environmental systems
* The polity — collective goal attainment
* The societal community — the integration of its diverse social components
* The fiduciary system — processes that function to reproduce historical culture in its "direct" social embeddedness.

The General Action Level:
* The behavioral organism (or system), in later versions, the foci for generalized "intelligence."
* The personality system.
* The social system.
* The cultural system. (See cultural level).

The cultural level:
* Cognitive symbolization.
* Expressive symbolization.
* Evaluative symbolization. (Sometimes called: moral-evaluative symbolization).
* Constitutive symbolization.

The Generalized Symbolic media:

Social System level:
* (A) Economic system: Money.
* (G) Political system: Political power.
* (I) The Societal Community: Influence.
* (L) The Fiduciary system (cultural tradition): Value-commitment.

Parsons elaborated upon the idea that each of these systems also developed some specialized symbolic mechanisms of interaction analogous to money in the economy, like influence in the social community. Various processes of "interchange" among the subsystems of the social system were postulated.

Parsons' use of social systems analysis based on the AGIL scheme was established in his work ''Economy and Society'' (with N. Smelser, 1956) and has prevailed in all his work ever since. However, the AGIL system existed only in a "rudimentary" form in the beginning and was gradually elaborated and expanded in the decades which followed. A brief introduction to Parsons' AGIL scheme can be found in Chapter 2 of ''The American University'' (with G. Platt, 1973). There is, however, no single place in his writing in which the total AGIL system is visually displayed or explained: the complete system have to be reconstructed from multiple places in his writing. The system displayed in "The American University" has only the most basic elements and should not be mistaken for the whole system.

===Social evolutionism===
Parsons contributed to [[social evolutionism]] and [[neoevolutionism]]. He divided evolution into four sub-processes:
# differentiation, which creates functional subsystems of the main system, as discussed above;
# adaptation, in which those systems evolve into more efficient versions;
# inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems; 
# generalization of values, increasing the legitimization of the increasingly-complex system.

Furthermore, Parsons explored the sub-processes within three stages of evolution:
# primitive,
# archaic and
# modern

Parsons viewed Western civilisation as the pinnacle of modern societies and the United States as the one that is most dynamically developed.

Parsons' late work focused on a new theoretical synthesis around four functions that he claimed are common to all systems of action, from the behavioral to the cultural, and a set of symbolic media that enables communication across them. His attempt to structure the world of action according to a scheme that focused on order was unacceptable for American sociologists, who were retreating from the grand pretensions of the 1960s to a more empirical, grounded approach.

===Pattern variables===
Parsons asserted that there are not two dimensions to societies: instrumental and expressive but that there are qualitative differences between kinds of social interaction.

He observed that people can have personalized and formally-detached relationships, based on the roles that they play. The ''pattern variables'' are what he called the characteristics that are associated with each kind of interaction.

An interaction can be characterized by one of the identifiers of each contrastive pair:
* affectivity – affective neutrality
* self-orientation – collectivity-orientation
* universalism – particularism
* ascription – achievement
* specificity – diffusity

==Legacy==
From the 1940s to the 1970s, Parsons was one of the most famous and most influential but also most controversial sociologists in the world, particularly in the US.&lt;ref name=Soc101/&gt; His later works were met with criticism and were generally dismissed in the 1970s by the view that his theories were too abstract, inaccessible, and socially conservative.&lt;ref name=Soc101/&gt;&lt;ref name=tg&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/17/improbable-research-dense-obscure-writing|title=Improbable research: measuring the fog of prose|first=Marc|last=Abrahams|date=17 January 2011|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, interest has increased in Parsons' ideas and especially often-overlooked later works.{{sfn|Turner|Holton|2015|page=3-6}} Attempts to revive his thinking have been made by Parsonsian sociologists and social scientists like [[Jeffrey Alexander]], [[Bryan S. Turner (sociologist)|Bryan Turner]], [[Richard Münch (sociologist)|Richard Münch]], and [[Roland Robertson]], and [[Uta Gerhardt]] has written about Parsons from a biographical and historical perspective. In addition to the United States, the key centers of interest in Parsons today are Germany, Japan, [[Italy]], and the [[United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Parsons had a seminal influence and early mentorship of many American and international scholars, such as [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], [[Alain Touraine]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], and Habermas.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} His best-known pupil was Merton.&lt;ref name=Soc101/&gt;

'''''The Philanthropist''''' is a quarterly [[academic journal]] devoted to the legal, management and accounting issues facing charitable and not-for-profit organizations in Canada.  It was founded as an occasional publication of the Trusts and Estates Section of the Canadian Bar Association - Ontario (now the [http://www.oba.org Ontario Bar Association]) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1972.  Its first Editor was [[Bertha Wilson]], later a judge of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].  For a time during the 1980s it was an official publication of the Canadian Centre for Philanthropy (now [http://www.imaginecanada.ca Imagine Canada]).  It derives its funding from the Agora Foundation in Toronto.  The Ontario Law Reform Commission's Report on the Law of Charities (1996) called it "informed rather than learned".  Its content is overseen by a volunteer Editorial Board drawn from the charitable sector, law, accounting and academia.  As of May 2009 the current and archived content is available electronically at no charge.

'''The Transport Act 2000''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It provided for a number of measures regarding transport in [[Great Britain]], most notably, the first major change in the structure of the privatised railway system established under the [[Railways Act 1993]]. 

==Railways==
The [[Director of Passenger Rail Franchising]] and the [[British Railways Board]] were both abolished and their functions transferred to the [[Strategic Rail Authority]].

The Act provides the framework for the railway byelaws.&lt;ref&gt;GOV.UK, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/railway-byelaws&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviation==
The Act laid down the framework for the creation of a [[public-private partnership]] (effectively privatisation) of [[National Air Traffic Services]].

==Highways==
Part III of the Act introduced the concept of the Road User Charge or Road User Charging schemes, and workplace parking [[tax|levys]]. This enabled various [[road pricing]] schemes, such as the [[London congestion charge]] and extension of the [[Dartford Crossing]] tolls. The Act also enabled the creation of [[Home zone]]s.

}}The '''United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime''' ('''UNTOC''') is a 2000 United Nations-sponsored [[multilateral treaty]] against [[transnational organized crime]]. The Convention was adopted by a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 15 November 2000. It is also called the '''Palermo Convention''', and its three supplementary protocols (the [[Palermo Protocols]]) are:&lt;ref name=convention&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME AND THE PROTOCOLS THERETO|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf|publisher=UNITED NATIONS OFFICE ON DRUGS AND CRIME|accessdate=16 July 2011|page=V|format=PDF|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]].
*[[Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air]].
*[[Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms]].

All four of these instruments contain elements of the current international law on [[human trafficking]], [[arms trafficking]] and [[money laundering]]. The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) acts as custodian of the UNTOC and its protocols.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The Convention came into force on 29 September 2003. As of 19 September 2017, it has 189 parties,&lt;ref&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-12&amp;chapter=18&amp;clang=_en UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime: Treaty status]&lt;/ref&gt; which includes 184 [[member states of the United Nations|United Nations member states]], the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], [[Niue]], the [[State of Palestine]], and the [[European Union]].

The '''United States Senate Special Committee on Aging''' was initially established in 1961 as a temporary committee; it became a permanent [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee in 1977. As a special committee, it has no legislative authority, but it studies issues related to older Americans, particularly [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Aging Committee |work=U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging |url=http://aging.senate.gov/about.cfm |accessdate=October 14, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131201407/http://aging.senate.gov/about.cfm |archivedate=January 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], the committee was studying health care insurance coverage for elderly American citizens. The committee conducts oversight of the Medicare program, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and the [[Older Americans Act]]. Some of the issues that have been examined by the committee include unacceptable conditions in [[nursing home]]s, protection from [[Ageism|age discrimination]], and pricing practices for [[prescription drug]]s.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]], Section 1 of the United States Constitution sets forth the eligibility requirements for serving as President of the United States:

{{quote|No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.&lt;ref name="frwebgate.access.gpo.gov"&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_documents&amp;docid=f:sd011.105.pdf The U.S. Constitution With Declaration of Independence, US Government Printing Office]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution]] also sets constraints on who may be elected to the Presidency:

{{quote|No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.&lt;ref name="frwebgate.access.gpo.gov"&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_documents&amp;docid=f:sd011.105.pdf The U.S. Constitution With Declaration of Independence, US Government Printing Office]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The controversy arising from [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories over Barack Obama's citizenship and eligibility for the presidency]] prompted a number of Republican state and federal legislators to propose legislation aimed at requiring future presidential candidates to release copies of their birth certificates. The Hawaii State legislature went in the opposite direction, to limit the lengths that proponents can go in pursuit of this issue, as the pursuits have drained resources from the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0510/Hawaiis_birther_bill.html|title=Hawaii's 'birther bill'|last=Smith|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Smith (journalist)|date=May 13, 2010|publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal initiatives==

===Electoral College===
Activists lobbied members of Congress to reject the Electoral College vote and block Obama's election as president in its sitting on January 8, 2009, to certify and tally the results of the election. Two Republican members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], [[John Linder]] and [[Ron Paul]], were heavily lobbied by activists who believed that the two lawmakers would be more willing than other members of Congress to raise objections to Obama's confirmation.&lt;ref name="Weigel-GOP"/&gt; The lobbying was unsuccessful and Congress unanimously declared Obama to be the winner of the election.&lt;ref name="Abrams-Congress"&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress Declares Obama the Next President|first=Jim|last=Abrams|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2008603247_apelectoralvotes.html|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=Seattle Times|location=[[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]|date=2009-01-08|accessdate=2010-06-12|quote=In centuries-old tradition, Congress confirms Obama as the next president}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth certificate===
{{redirect|H.R. 1503|the star|Beta Caeli}}
{{wikisource|H.R. 1503 (2009)}}In March 2009, Representative [[Bill Posey]], a newly elected Republican from [[Florida's 15th congressional district]], introduced a bill, H.R. 1503, in the U.S. House of Representatives. Had this bill been enacted into law, it would have amended the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] of 1971 to require candidates for the Presidency "to include with the [campaign] committee's statement of organization a copy of the candidate's birth certificate" plus supporting documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|work=Politico.com
|date=March 13, 2009|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bill did not initially have any co-sponsors and was introduced without the Republican leadership being informed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|first=Mark|last=Preston
|title=Republican wants WH candidates to prove citizenship

|work=Political Ticker blog
|publisher=CNN|date=March 13, 2009|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Florida Today]]'', the newspaper serving his constituency, commented that the bill "stems from fringe opponents of President Barack Obama who, during the 2008 election campaign, questioned whether Obama was born in Hawaii," but added that Posey's office "does not question Obama's citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kim Eun Kyung|title=Posey to president hopefuls: Prove it|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/mar/16/posey-president-hopefuls-prove-it/|work=[[Florida Today]]|date=March 14, 2009|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Posey explained his motivation as being to "prevent something like this [controversy] from happening in the future" by requiring "the birth certificate up front and take [the issue] off the table". His initiative was strongly criticized by Florida Democrats, who accused Posey of trying to "fan the rumors on the extreme fringe of the Republican Party" and "pandering to the right wing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Posey's bill gained the support of twelve Republican co-sponsors - Representatives [[John Carter (Texas)|John R. Carter]], [[Kenny Marchant]], [[Louie Gohmert]], [[John Culberson]], [[Randy Neugebauer]], [[Mike Conaway]] and [[Ted Poe]] (all from Texas), Rep. [[John B. T.

===Hawaii statehood===

On July 27, 2009, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of Hawaii's statehood.

In reaction to the proposed legislation, ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' referred to it as a "nutty birther bill" that would make Arizona seem to be a place where "any crackpot whim can be enshrined in law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/2010/04/21/20100421wed2-21.html|title=Lawmakers, bury the 'birther bill'|work=Editorial|publisher=Arizona Republic|date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona Republican State Representative Cecil Ash, who supported the bill, appeared on CNN's ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'' to discuss the bill. Ash stated that he believed President Obama was an American citizen, but there has been "a lot of controversy over the issue". Cooper then likened the people who believe there is a birth certificate controversy to people who believe the moon is made of cheese and asked Ash if he knew the moon was not made of cheese without investigation. Ash responded in the affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1004/21/acd.01.html|title=Birthers Reemerge; Will Ash Cloud Threat Continue?|work=Anderson Cooper|publisher=CNN|date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/22/anderson-cooper-confronts_n_547766.html|title=Anderson Cooper Confronts Birther Legislator|work=Jason Linkins|publisher=Huffington Post|date=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missouri===

====Constitutional amendment====

Fifteen Republican members of the [[Missouri House of Representatives]] sponsored an [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] to the [[Missouri Constitution]] in March 2009 that would require "candidates who are required by the Constitution of the United States to be natural born citizens" to provide a birth certificate to the [[Missouri Secretary of State]] to confirm their eligibility. A certificate of live birth would not be accepted. Failure to comply would result in the candidate being deemed ineligible to stand. The only political offices to be affected would be the President and Vice President, which are the only two positions for which there is a specific constitutional citizenship requirement. The proposed amendment is part of a "voter's bill of rights", which would serve "as a defense against corruption, fraud, and tyranny". Political commentators interpreted the proposal as being "aimed at advancing the claims of the fringe movement that doubts President Barack Obama's eligibility to serve as president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Smith|title=Missouri Republicans push birth certificate questions to oppose 'tyranny'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0309/Missouri_Republicans_push_birth_certificate_questions_to_oppose_tyranny.html|work=Politico.com|date=March 4, 2009|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills091/biltxt/intro/HJR0034I.htm|title=House Joint Resolution No. 34, 95th General Assembly|publisher=Missouri House of Representatives|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed amendment, House Joint Resolution No. 34, was subsequently withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House Joint Resolution No. 34|url=http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills091/biltxt/intro/HJR0034I.htm|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also unsuccessfully approached Oklahoma Republican Senators [[Tom Coburn]] and [[James Inhofe]] to persuade them to mount a challenge to Obama's confirmation by Congress.&lt;ref name="Weigel-GOP"&gt;{{cite news|title=GOP Senators Give Hope to Anti-Obama Activists|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/24362/gop-senators-letters-give-anti-obama-activists-hope|first=David|last=Weigel|work=Washington Independent|date=January 8, 2009|accessdate=January 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117002638/http://washingtonindependent.com/24362/gop-senators-letters-give-anti-obama-activists-hope#|archive-date=2009-01-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bill, House Bill 1329, was criticized by ''[[The Norman Transcript]]'' newspaper as "an outright attempt to embarrass President Barack Obama whose own citizenship was questioned, mostly by those pajama guerrillas [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]] on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oklahoma's department of frivolous|url=http://www.normantranscript.com/opinion/local_story_073011056|work=The Norman Transcript|location=Norman, Oklahoma|date=February 14, 2009|accessdate=February 14, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bill gained a 23–20 vote in favor, but failed to meet the 25-vote threshold required to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill to require citizenship proof fails|url=http://www.edmondsun.com/statenews/x519243650/Bill-to-require-citizenship-proof-fails|work=The Edmond Sun|agency=Associated Press|date=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, similar legislation was reintroduced in the Oklahoma state senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Birther debate alive across U.S.|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49444.html|first=Andy|last=Bar|work=Politico|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania===
Legislation introduced in April 2011 by state Representative [[Daryl Metcalfe]] would require candidates for president and vice president to provide proof of citizenship to qualify for a spot on the state ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Local reps support birth certificate bill|url=http://www.ldnews.com/news/ci_17847778|date=April 14, 2011|first=John|last=Latimer|publisher=[[Lebanon Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tennessee===
In Tennessee, four Republican [[Tennessee House of Representatives|state Representatives]]—[[Stacey Campfield]], [[Glen Casada]], [[Frank S. Niceley]] and [[Eric H. Swafford]]—announced in February 2009 that they would be joining a legal action to force Obama to release his birth certificate and prove his citizenship. Casada, the Tennessee House Republican caucus chairman, said that he believes Obama has further proof of eligibility, and would like him to make it available: "Yes, people may say, you're just chasing some conspiracy theory  ... [but] it's a simple act on his part to just do, and we're done—move on." The alternative newspaper ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' described Swafford as joining a "wacky legal action" and quoted Tennessee house Democrat Larry Miller as saying: "What is the mentality of these kind of people who continuously make these kind of goofy statements? It's embarrassing." Attorney Orly Taitz of California said she planned to file the suit, representing the Defend Our Freedoms Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Theo|last=Emery|title=Four Tennessee legislators want Obama to prove citizenship|work=[[The Tennessean]]|location=Nashville|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090213/NEWS02/902130368/1009/NEWS02

Legislation proposed in January 2011 would require anyone running for elected office to furnish a birth certificate before being declared an eligible candidate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Birther bills flood state houses across USA, somehow avoiding Colorado

In January 2016, two Democratic legislators proposed barring the Secretary of State from placing on the ballot any presidential or vice-presidential candidate who was not a natural-born citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/31029457/tennessee-dems-want-eligibility-check-on-presidential-ballot|title=Tennessee Dems want eligibility check on presidential ballot|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 22, 2016|work=[[WRCB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===
On November 16, 2010, Texas state representative [[Leo Berman]] introduced legislation requiring any candidate for president or vice president running in Texas to submit to the [[Texas Secretary of State]] an "original birth certificate indicating that the person is a natural-born United States citizen." In introducing the bill, Berman said that the "bill is necessary because we have a president whom the American people don't know whether he was born in Kenya or some other place." If signed into law, the bill would take effect September 1, 2011, about 6 months ahead of the Texas presidential primaries for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lubbockonline.com/local-news/2010-11-17/birth-certificate-bill-filed-presidential-candidates|date=November 17, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-28 | title=State representatives file birth certificate bill filed for presidential candidates|author1=Enrique Rangel|author2=Terry Greenberg|publisher=Lubbock Avalanche Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By inserting the word "original" into the bill, Berman addressed concerns by conspiracy theorists that other bills that do not contain that word are "flawed". His bill would therefore specifically disallow the use of the [[#Release of birth certificate and its rejection by conspiracy theorists|reproduced certificate that Obama has used since June 2008]] as evidence. The legality of such a bill is unknown, as reproduced certificates are generally accepted by government agencies as proof of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/weigel/archive/2010/11/17/texas-republican-files-birther-bill.aspx|title=Texas Republican Files Birther Bill|publisher=Slate|first=David|last=Weigel|date=November 17, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. Fricosu''''', 841 F.Supp.2d 1232 (D. Col 2012), is a [[federal law#United States|federal]] [[criminal law|criminal]] [[legal case|case]] in [[Colorado]] that addressed whether a person can be compelled to reveal his or her [[encryption]] [[passphrase]] or password, despite the [[U.S. Constitution]]'s [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protection against [[self-incrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19669803 |title=Password case reframes Fifth Amendment rights in context of digital world |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |date=January 4, 2012 |first=John |last=Ingold }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, 2012, judge [[Robert E. Blackburn]] held that under the [[All Writs Act]], Fricosu is required to produce an unencrypted hard drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/01/decrypt.pdf | work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fricosu's attorney claimed it was possible she did not remember the password. A month later, Fricosu's ex-husband handed the police a list of potential passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_20080656 | work=Wired | first=John | last=Ingold | title=Feds unlock suspect's computer without her help}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the passwords worked, rendering the self-incrimination issue moot.

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] filed an [[amicus brief]] in support of Fricosu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/node/58527|title=EFF's Amicus Brief in Support of Fricosu|date=2011-07-08|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/18615/eff_fights_forced_decryption_with_fifth_for_fricosu|title=EFF fights forced file decryption with Fifth, for Fricosu|last=Jennings|first=Richi|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fricosu subsequently entered a plea agreement in 2013, meaning that the question of a defendant's right to resist mandatory decryption will not be addressed by a higher court until such time as a future case addressing the same issue arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9185030390462236515&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|title=US v.
