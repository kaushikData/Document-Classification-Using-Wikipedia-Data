'''Advanced Package Tool''', or '''APT''', is a [[free software]] [[Front and back ends|user interface]] that works with [[Library (computing)|core libraries]] to handle the installation and removal of software on [[Debian]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and other [[Linux distribution]]s.&lt;ref name=manpage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get|title=apt-get(8) - Linux man page|publisher=linux.die.net|accessdate=2008-05-12|last=|first=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516191248/http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get|archivedate=16 May 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; APT simplifies the process of managing software on [[Unix-like]] computer systems by automating the retrieval, configuration and installation of [[Package (package management system)|software packages]], either from precompiled files or by [[compiling]] source code.&lt;ref name=manpage /&gt;

== Usage ==
Apt is a collection of tools distributed in a package named ''apt''.  A significant part of apt is defined in a [[C++]] library of functions; apt also includes command-line programs for dealing with packages, which use the library.  Three such programs are &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;apt-cache&lt;/code&gt;. They are commonly used in examples of apt because they are simple and ubiquitous. The &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; package is of "''important''" priority in all current Debian releases, and is therefore installed in a default Debian installation.  Apt can be considered a [[Front and back ends|front-end]] to &lt;code&gt;[[dpkg]]&lt;/code&gt;, friendlier than the older &lt;code&gt;[[dselect]]&lt;/code&gt; front-end.  While &lt;code&gt;dpkg&lt;/code&gt; performs actions on individual packages, apt tools manage relations (especially dependencies) between them, as well as sourcing and management of higher-level versioning decisions (release tracking and version pinning).

APT is often hailed as one of Debian's best features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An apt-get primer |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/40745 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5p6i2iySC?url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/40745 |archivedate=2010-04-19 |first=Bruce |last=Byfield |date=2004-12-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the archives: the best distros of 2000|url=http://www.tuxradar.com/content/archives-best-distros-2000|publisher=Tux Radar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Migrating to Debian |url=http://www.linux.ie/lists/pipermail/cork/2004-January/003744.html |first=David |last=Dorgan |publisher=linux.ie |date=2004-01-19 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5p6ikqQPs?url=http://www.linux.ie/lists/pipermail/cork/2004-January/003744.html |archivedate=2010-04-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile Linux development with Familiar and a minimal Debian|url=http://www.vieka.com/mobiletux/debian.htm|publisher=Mobile Tux}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Debian developers attribute to the strict quality controls in Debian's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/talks/why_debian/talk.html|title=Why Debian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/|title=Debian policy manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major feature in APT is the way it calls dpkg — it does [[topological sorting]] of the list of packages to be installed or removed and calls dpkg in the best possible sequence. In some cases, it utilizes the &lt;tt&gt;--force&lt;/tt&gt; options in dpkg. However, it only does this when it is unable to calculate how to avoid the reason dpkg requires the action to be forced.

=== Installing software ===
The user indicates one or more packages to be installed. Each package name is phrased as just the name portion of the package, not a fully qualified filename (for instance, in a Debian system, libc6 would be the argument provided, not &lt;tt&gt;libc6_1.9.6-2.deb&lt;/tt&gt;). Notably, apt automatically gets and installs packages upon which the indicated package depends (if necessary).  This was an original distinguishing characteristic of apt-based package management systems, as it avoided installation failure due to missing dependencies, a type of [[dependency hell]].

Another such distinction is remote repository retrieval of packages.  apt uses location configuration file (&lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/tt&gt;) to locate the desired packages, which might be available on the network or a removable storage medium, for example, and retrieve them, and also obtain information about available (but not installed) packages.

apt provides other command options to override decisions made by apt-get's conflict resolution system.  One option is to force a particular version of a package.  This can downgrade a package and render dependent software inoperable, so the user must be careful.

Finally, the &lt;tt&gt;apt_preferences&lt;/tt&gt; mechanism allows the user to create an alternative installation policy for individual packages.

The user can specify packages by [[POSIX]] regular expression.

APT searches its cached list of packages and lists the dependencies that must be installed or updated.

APT retrieves, configures and installs the dependencies automatically.

[[dpkg trigger|Triggers]] are the treatment of deferred actions.

=== Update, upgrade and dist-upgrade ===

Usage modes of apt and apt-get that facilitate updating installed packages include:

* '''update''' is used to resynchronize the '''package index''' files from their sources. The lists of available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, when using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and scans the &lt;tt&gt;Packages.gz&lt;/tt&gt; files, so that information about new and updated packages is available.
* '''upgrade''' is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/tt&gt;. Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version.
* '''dist-upgrade''', in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt-get has a "smart" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. The &lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/tt&gt; file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get|title=Linux Man pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[aptitude (software)|aptitude]] has a smarter dist-upgrade feature called full-upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=39379|title=Discussion on dist-upgrade vs. full-upgrade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Configuration and files==
&lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt&lt;/tt&gt; has the apt configuration folders and files.

''apt-config'' is the APT Configuration Query program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debianadmin.com/manpages/aptconfigmanpage.htm|title=Apt-Config&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;code&gt;apt-config dump&lt;/code&gt; shows the configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debianadmin.com/query-apt-configuration-using-apt-config.html|title=Query APT Configuration Using apt-config - Debian Admin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Files ===
* &lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList&lt;/ref&gt;: Locations to fetch packages from.
* &lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list.d/&lt;/tt&gt;: Additional source list fragments.
* &lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/apt.conf&lt;/tt&gt;: APT configuration file.
* &lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/&lt;/tt&gt;: APT configuration file fragments.
* &lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/preferences&lt;/tt&gt;: version preferences file. This is where you would specify "[[APT Pinning|pinning]]", i.e. a preference to get certain packages from a separate source or from a different version of a distribution.
* &lt;tt&gt;/var/cache/apt/archives/&lt;/tt&gt;: storage area for retrieved package files.
* &lt;tt&gt;/var/cache/apt/archives/partial/&lt;/tt&gt;: storage area for package files in transit.
* &lt;tt&gt;/var/lib/apt/lists/&lt;/tt&gt;: storage area for state information for each package resource specified in &lt;tt&gt;sources.list&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/&lt;/tt&gt;: storage area for state information in transit.

== Sources ==
APT relies on the concept of [[Software repository|repositories]] in order to find software and resolve dependencies. For apt, a repository is a directory containing packages along with an index file. This can be specified as a networked or CDROM location.  The Debian project keeps a central repository of over 25,000 software packages ready for download and installation.

Any number of additional repositories can be added to APT's ''sources.list'' configuration file (&lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/tt&gt;) and then be queried by APT. Graphical front-ends often allow modifying &lt;tt&gt;sources.list&lt;/tt&gt; more simply (apt-setup). Once a package repository has been specified (like during the system installation), packages in that repository can be installed without specifying a source and will be kept up-to-date automatically.

In addition to network repositories, [[Compact Disc|compact discs]] and other storage media (USB keydrive, hard disks...) can be used as well, using apt-cdrom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/man/man8/apt-cdrom.8.html|title=apt-cdrom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; or adding &lt;tt&gt;file:/&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=''i.e. Deb file:/mnt/install stable main contrib. non-free''|mode=cs1|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the source list file. Apt-cdrom can specify a different folder than a cd-rom, using the &lt;tt&gt;-d&lt;/tt&gt; option (i.e. a hard disk or a USB keydrive). The Debian CDs available for download contain Debian repositories. This allows non-networked machines to be upgraded. Also one can use apt-zip.

Problems may appear when several sources offer the same package(s). Systems that have such possibly conflicting sources can use APT pinning to control which sources should be preferred.

== APT pinning ==
The ''APT pinning'' feature allows administrators to force APT to choose particular versions of packages which may be available in different versions from different repositories. This allows administrators to ensure that packages are not upgraded to versions which may conflict with other packages on the system, or that have not been sufficiently tested for unwelcome changes.

In order to do this, the ''pins'' in APT's ''preferences'' file (&lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt/preferences&lt;/tt&gt;) must be modified,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences | title = Apt Pinning | publisher = Debian Wiki | accessdate = 2006-09-19 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061004194955/http://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences| archivedate= 4 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; although graphical front-ends often make pinning simpler.

== Front-ends ==
[[Image:Synaptic Package Manager.png|thumb|300px|[[Synaptic Package Manager]] is one of the front-ends available for APT]]
Several other [[front and back ends|front-ends]] to APT exist, which provide more advanced installation functions and more intuitive interfaces. These include:
* ''[[Synaptic (software)|Synaptic]]'', a [[GTK+]] [[graphical user interface]] 
* ''[[Ubuntu Software Center]]'', a [[GTK+]] [[graphical user interface]] developed by the Ubuntu project
* ''[[aptitude (software)|aptitude]]'', a console client with [[Command-line interface|CLI]] and [[ncurses]]-based [[Text-based user interface|TUI]] interfaces
* ''[[KPackage]]'', part of [[KDE]]
* ''[[Adept Package Manager]]'', a graphical user interface for [[KDE]] (deb, rpm, bsd)
* ''[[PackageKit]]'', a [[freedesktop.org]] frontend.
* ''GDebi'', a GTK+-based tool sponsored for Ubuntu. (There is also a Qt version, available in the Ubuntu repositories a gdebi-kde.)
* ''apt-cdrom'', a way to add a new CDROM to APT's list of available sources.lists (list of available repositories). It is necessary to use apt-cdrom to add CDs to the APT system, it cannot be done by hand.
* ''apt-zip'', a way to use apt with [[removable media]], specifically [[USB flash drive]]s.
* ''[[aptURL]]'', an Ubuntu software package that enables end-user applications to install with a single-click.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AptUrl|title=AptURL|work=Ubuntu Wiki|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cafelinux.org/OzOs/node/3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210140615/http://cafelinux.org/OzOs/node/3|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-02-10|title=OzOS &amp;#124; apt:foo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Cydia]]'', a package manager for [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken iOS]] based on APT (ported to iOS as part of the Telesphoreo project).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jurick |first= David |authorlink= |title= iPhone Hacks: Pushing the iPhone and iPod touch Beyond Their Limits |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=i-gABmh50v8C |accessdate= January 18, 2013 |year= 2009 |publisher= O'Reilly Media, Inc. |location= |isbn= 9780596516642 |page= 20 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.linuxinsider.com/rsstory/62209.html |title= Android, Schmandroid: Linux on the iPhone |first= Richard |last= Adhikari |date= March 20, 2008 |work= |publisher= LinuxInsider |accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''gnome-apt'', a GTK+/[[GNOME]]-widget-based graphical front-end. Developed by [[Havoc Pennington]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ColExJoEq1UC&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;ots=tWE7w7A6Mt&amp;dq=Havoc%20Pennington%20-1976%20-wikipedia%20-patent&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q=Havoc%20Pennington%20-1976%20-wikipedia%20-patent&amp;f=false The Evolution of Debian Package Management Systems], By Glenn Mullikin, AUUGN, Dec 2001, Page 50, ''gnome-apt was written by Havoc Pennington''&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Muon Discover (previous Muon Software Center)'', a Qt-based graphical user interface
* ''Hildon Application Manager (Maemo Application)'', a [[Maemo]] front-end
* ''apticron'', a service designed to be run via [[cron]] to email notices of pending updates to a sysadmin.
* ''APT Daemon'', a front-end that runs as a [[Daemon (software)|service]] to allow users to install software through [[PolicyKit]] and is in turn the framework used by [[Ubuntu Software Center]] (along with the [[Linux Mint#Software developed by Linux Mint|Linux Mint Software Manager]]).

APT front-ends can:
* Search for new packages.
* Upgrade packages.
* Install or remove packages.
* Upgrade the whole system to a new release.

APT front-ends can list the dependencies of packages being installed or upgraded, ask the administrator if packages recommended or suggested by newly installed packages should be installed too, automatically install dependencies and perform other operations on the system such as removing obsolete files and packages.

== History ==
The original effort that led to the apt-get program was the [[dselect]] replacement project known by its codename ''deity''.&lt;ref name = "d-u 1997-04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/1997/04/msg00786.html|title=Deity Mailing List, 1997-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was commissioned by Brian White, the Debian Release Manager at the time. The very first functional version of apt-get was called dpkg-get and was only intended to be a test program for the core library functions that would underpin the new UI.&lt;ref name = "deity 1998-03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.debian.org/deity/1998/03/msg00013.html|title=Deity Mailing List, 1998-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the original development of APT was done on IRC, so records have been lost. The 'Deity Creation Team' mailing list archives include only the major highlights.

The Deity name was abandoned as the official name for the project due to concerns over the religious nature of the name. The APT name was eventually decided after considerable internal and public discussion. Ultimately the name was proposed on IRC, accepted and then finalized on the mailing lists.&lt;ref name = "deity 1998-03 106"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.debian.org/deity/1998/03/msg00106.html|title=Deity Mailing List, 1998-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APT was introduced in 1998 and original test builds were circulated on IRC. The first Debian version that included it was Debian 2.1, released on 9 March 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = A Brief History of Debian | url = http://debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ch-detailed.en.html#s4.1 | publisher = Debian.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end the original goal of the Deity project of replacing the [[dselect]] user interface (UI) was a failure. Work on the UI portion of the project was abandoned (the UI directories were removed from the [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] system) after the first public release of apt-get. The response to APT as a dselect method and a command line utility was so great and positive that all development efforts focused on maintaining and improving the tool. It was not until much later that several independent people built UIs on top of libapt-pkg.

Eventually, a new team picked up the project, began to build new features and released version 0.6 of APT which introduced the Secure APT feature, using strong [[GNU Privacy Guard|cryptographic]] [[Digital signature|signing]] to authenticate the package repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt|title=Secure APT|publisher=Debian Wiki|accessdate=2006-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==

APT was originally designed as a front-end for [[dpkg]] to work with Debian's &lt;tt&gt;[[deb (file format)|.deb]]&lt;/tt&gt; packages. A version of APT modified to also work with the [[RPM Package Manager]] system was released as [[APT-RPM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apt-rpm.org/about.shtml|title=APT-RPM|publisher=apt-rpm.org|accessdate=2008-05-12|last=|first=
|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421014529/http://apt-rpm.org/about.shtml|archivedate=21 April 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fink]] project has ported APT to [[Mac OS X]] for some of its own package management tasks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finkproject.org/about.php|title=Fink - About|publisher=www.finkproject.org|accessdate=2008-05-12|last=|first=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511210043/http://www.finkproject.org/about.php|archivedate=11 May 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and APT is also available in [[OpenSolaris]].

== apt-file ==
'''apt-file''' is a command, packaged separately from APT, to find which package includes a specific file, or to list all files included in a package on remote repositories&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2015/10/13/inspect-extract-contents-debian-packages/&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''''' is a book by the Scottish [[Empiricism|empiricist]] [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]], published in English in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Hume |first=David |author-link= David Hume|year=1748 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding |edition= 1 |publisher= A. Millar |publication-date=1748 |publication-place=London  |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LB4VAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22David%20Hume%22&amp;pg=PR6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=28 June 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; It was a revision of an earlier effort, Hume's ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', published anonymously in London in 1739&amp;ndash;40. Hume was disappointed with the reception of the ''Treatise'', which "fell dead-born from the press,"&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David (1776), ''My Own Life'', Appendix A of [[Ernest Campbell Mossner]], ''The Life of David Hume'', University of Texas Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; as he put it, and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work.

The end product of his labours was the ''Enquiry''. The ''Enquiry'' dispensed with much of the material from the ''Treatise'', in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects. For example, Hume's views on [[personal identity]] do not appear. However, more vital propositions, such as Hume's argument for the role of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] in a theory of knowledge, are retained.

This book has proven highly influential, both in the years that would immediately follow and today. [[Immanuel Kant]] points to it as the book which woke him from his self-described "dogmatic slumber."&lt;ref&gt;I. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] "[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]"&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Enquiry'' is widely regarded as a classic in [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophical]] literature.

==Summary==
The argument of the ''Enquiry'' proceeds by a series of incremental steps, separated into chapters which logically succeed one another. After expounding his [[epistemology]], Hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics.

===Empirical epistemology===

====1. ''Of the different species of philosophy''====

In the first section of the Enquiry, Hume provides a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole. For Hume, philosophy can be split into two general parts: natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature (or, as he calls it, "moral philosophy"). The latter investigates both actions and thoughts. He emphasizes in this section, by way of warning, that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion. However, he insists, precision helps art and craft of all kinds, including the craft of philosophy.

====2. ''Of the origin of ideas''====

Next, Hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas. By "impressions", he means sensations, while by "ideas", he means memories and imaginings. According to Hume, the difference between the two is that ideas are less ''vivacious'' than impressions. For example, the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression (or sensation) of actually eating one. Writing within the tradition of [[empiricism]], he argues that impressions are the source of all ideas.

Hume accepts that ideas may be either the product of mere sensation, or of the imagination working in conjunction with sensation.&lt;ref&gt;In Locke's terminology, this was known as the division between ''simple and complex'' ideas of sense.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, the creative faculty makes use of (at least) four mental operations which produce imaginings out of sense-impressions. These operations are ''compounding'' (or the addition of one idea onto another, such as a horn on a horse to create a [[unicorn]]); ''transposing'' (or the substitution of one part of a thing with the part from another, such as with the body of a man upon a horse to make a [[centaur]]); ''augmenting'' (as with the case of a [[giant (mythology)|giant]], whose size has been augmented); and ''diminishing'' (as with [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputians]], whose size has been diminished). (Hume 1974:317) In a later chapter, he also mentions the operations of ''mixing'', ''separating'', and ''dividing''. (Hume 1974:340) [[File:Missing blue shade.svg|thumb|Fig. 1. The Missing Shade of Blue]]

However, Hume admits that there is one objection to his account: the problem of ''"[[The Missing Shade of Blue]]"''. In this thought-experiment, he asks us to imagine a man who has experienced every shade of blue except for one (see Fig. 1). He predicts that this man will be able to divine the color of this particular shade of blue, despite the fact that he has never experienced it. This seems to pose a serious problem for the empirical account, though Hume brushes it aside as an exceptional case by stating that one may experience a novel idea that itself is derived from combinations of previous impressions. (Hume 1974:319)

====3. ''Of the association of ideas''====

In this chapter, Hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences, as in trains of thought. He explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas: ''resemblance'', ''contiguity'' in space-time, and ''cause-and-effect''. He argues that there must be some ''universal principle'' that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas. However, he does not immediately show what this principle might be. (Hume 1974:320-321)

====4. ''Sceptical doubts concerning the operations of the understanding (in two parts)''====

In the first part, Hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either "relations of ideas" or "matters of fact", which is roughly the [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|distinction]] between [[logical truth|analytic]] and [[fact|synthetic propositions]]. The former, he tells the reader, are proved by demonstration, while the latter are given through experience. (Hume 1974:322) In explaining how matters of fact are entirely a product of experience, he dismisses the notion that they may be arrived at through ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning. For Hume, every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily—they are entirely distinct from one another. (Hume 1974:324)

In part two, Hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world:

::"When it is asked, ''What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact?'' the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, ''What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation?'' it may be replied in one word, ''experience''. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and ask, ''What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience?'' this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication." (Hume 1974:328)

He shows how a satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration (since "it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change") nor experience (since that would be a [[circular argument]]). (Hume 1974:330-332) Here he is describing what would become known as the [[problem of induction]].

====5. ''Sceptical solution of these doubts (in two parts)''====

For Hume, we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of ''habit or custom'', which human nature forces us to take seriously. This is also, presumably, the "principle" that organizes the connections between ideas. Indeed, one of the many famous passages of the ''Enquiry'' is on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom. In Section XII, ''Of the academical or sceptical philosophy'', Hume will argue, 

::''"The great subverter of Pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of skepticism is action, and employment, and the occupations of common life. These principles may flourish and triumph in the schools; where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impossible, to refute them. But as soon as they leave the shade, and by the presence of the real objects, which actuate our passions and sentiments, are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature, they vanish like smoke, and leave the most determined skeptic in the same condition as other mortals."'' (Hume 1974:425)

In the second part, he provides an account of beliefs. He explains that the difference between belief and fiction is that the former produces a certain feeling of confidence which the latter doesn't. (Hume 1974:340)

====6. ''Of probability''====

This short chapter begins with the notions of probability and chance. For him, "probability" means a ''higher chance'' of occurring, and brings about a higher degree of subjective expectation in the viewer. By "chance", he means all those particular comprehensible events which the viewer considers possible in accord with their experience. However, further experience takes these equal chances, and forces the imagination to observe that certain chances arise more frequently than others. These gentle forces upon the imagination cause the viewer to have strong beliefs in outcomes. This effect may be understood as another case of ''custom or habit'' taking past experience and using it to predict the future. (Hume 1974:346-348)

===Applied epistemology===

====1. ''Of the idea of necessary connection (in two parts)''====

[[File:Nicolas Malebranche.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Nicolas Malebranche]], one of Hume's philosophical opponents]]

By "necessary connection", Hume means the power or force which necessarily ties one idea to another. He rejects the notion that any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of some sense of the power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone. (Hume 1974:355-356) He also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere [[Occasionalism|occasions of the will of some god(s)]], a view associated with the philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche]]. (Hume 1974:356-359)

Having dispensed with these alternative explanations, he identifies the source of our knowledge of necessary connections as arising out of ''observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances''. In this way, people know of necessity through rigorous custom or habit, and not from any immediate knowledge of the powers of the will. (Hume 1974:361)

====2. ''Of liberty and necessity (in two parts)''====

Here Hume tackles the problem of how [[liberty]] may be reconciled with [[metaphysical necessity]] (otherwise known as a [[compatibilist]] formulation of [[free will]]). Hume believes that all disputes on the subject have been merely verbal arguments—that is to say, arguments which are based on a lack of prior agreement on definitions. He first shows that it is clear that most events are deterministic, but human actions are more controversial. However, he thinks that these too occur out of necessity since an outside observer can see the same regularity that he would in a purely physical system. To show the compatibility of necessity and liberty, Hume defines liberty as the ability to act on the basis of one's will e.g. the capacity to will one's actions but not to will one's will. He then shows (quite briefly) how determinism and free will are compatible notions, and have no bad consequences on ethics or moral life.

====3. ''Of the reason of animals (comparable to man)''====

Hume insists that the conclusions of the Enquiry will be very powerful if they can be shown to apply to animals and not just humans. He believed that animals were able to infer the relation between cause and effect in the same way that humans do: through learned expectations. (Hume 1974:384) He also notes that this "inferential" ability that animals have is not through reason, but custom alone. Hume concludes that there is an innate faculty of instincts which both beasts and humans share, namely, the ability to reason experimentally (through custom). Nevertheless, he admits, humans and animals differ in mental faculties in a number of ways, including: differences in memory and attention, inferential abilities, ability to make deductions in a long chain, ability to grasp ideas more or less clearly, the human capacity to worry about conflating unrelated circumstances, a sagely prudence which arrests generalizations, a capacity for a greater inner library of analogies to reason with, an ability to detach oneself and scrap one's own biases, and an ability to converse through language (and thus gain from the experience of others' testimonies). (Hume 1974:385, footnote 17.)

====4. ''Of miracles (in two parts)''====
{{Main article|Of Miracles}}
The next topic which Hume strives to give treatment is that of the reliability of human testimony, and of the role that [[social epistemology|testimony plays a part in epistemology]]. This was not an idle concern for Hume. Depending on its outcome, the entire treatment would give the epistemologist a degree of certitude in the treatment of miracles.

True to his empirical thesis, Hume tells the reader that, though testimony does have some force, it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses. That said, he provides some reasons why we may have a basis for trust in the testimony of persons: because a) human memory can be relatively tenacious; and b) because people are inclined to tell the truth, and ashamed of telling falsities. Needless to say, these reasons are only to be trusted to the extent that they conform to experience. (Hume 1974:389)

And there are a number of reasons to be skeptical of human testimony, also based on experience. If a) testimonies conflict one another, b) there are a small number of witnesses, c) the speaker has no integrity, d) the speaker is overly hesitant or bold, or e) the speaker is known to have motives for lying, then the epistemologist has reason to be skeptical of the speaker's claims. (Hume 1974:390)

There is one final criterion that Hume thinks gives us warrant to doubt any given testimony, and that is f) if the propositions being communicated are miraculous. Hume understands a miracle to be any event which contradicts the laws of nature. He argues that the laws of nature have an overwhelming body of evidence behind them, and are so well demonstrated to everyone's experience, that any deviation from those laws necessarily flies in the face of all evidence. (Hume 1974:391-392)

Moreover, he stresses that talk of the miraculous has no surface validity, for four reasons. First, he explains that in all of history there has never been a miracle which was attested to by a wide body of disinterested experts. Second, he notes that human beings delight in a sense of wonder, and this provides a villain with an opportunity to manipulate others. Third, he thinks that those who hold onto the miraculous have tended towards barbarism. Finally, since testimonies tend to conflict with one another when it comes to the miraculous—that is, one man's religious miracle may be contradicted by another man's miracle—any testimony relating to the fantastic is self-denunciating. (Hume 1974:393-398)

Still, Hume takes care to warn that historians are generally to be trusted with confidence, so long as their reports on facts are extensive and uniform. However, he seems to suggest that historians are as fallible at interpreting the facts as the rest of humanity. Thus, if every historian were to claim that there was a solar eclipse in the year 1600, then though we might at first naively regard that as in violation of natural laws, we'd come to accept it as a fact. But if every historian were to assert that Queen Elizabeth was observed walking around happy and healthy after her funeral, and then interpreted that to mean that they had risen from the dead, then we'd have reason to appeal to natural laws in order to dispute their interpretation. (Hume 1974:400-402)

====5. ''Of a particular providence and of a future state''====

Hume continues his application of epistemology to theology by an extended discussion on heaven and hell. The brunt of this chapter allegedly narrates the opinions, not of Hume, but of one of Hume's anonymous friends, who again presents them in an imagined speech by the philosopher [[Epicurus]]. His friend argues that, though it is possible to [[abductive reasoning|trace a cause from an effect]], it is not possible to infer unseen effects from a cause thus traced. The friend insists, then, that even though we might postulate that there is a first cause behind all things—God—we can't infer anything about the afterlife, because we don't know anything of the afterlife from experience, and we can't infer it from the existence of God. (Hume 1974:408)

Hume offers his friend an objection: if we see an unfinished building, then can't we infer that it has been created by humans with certain intentions, and that it will be finished in the future? His friend concurs, but indicates that there is a relevant disanalogy that we can't pretend to know the contents of the mind of God, while we can know the designs of other humans. Hume seems essentially persuaded by his friend's reasoning. (Hume 1974:412-414)

====6. ''Of the academical or skeptical philosophy (in three parts)''====

The first section of the last chapter is well organized as an outline of various skeptical arguments. The treatment includes the arguments of atheism, Cartesian skepticism, "light" skepticism, and rationalist critiques of empiricism. Hume shows that even light skepticism leads to crushing doubts about the world which - while they ultimately are philosophically justifiable - may only be combated through the non-philosophical adherence to custom or habit. He ends the section with his own reservations towards Cartesian and Lockean epistemologies.

In the second section he returns to the topic of hard skepticism by sharply denouncing it.

::"For here is the chief and most confounding objection to ''excessive'' skepticism, that no durable good can ever result from it; while it remains in its full force and vigor. We need only ask such a skeptic, ''What his meaning is? And what he proposes by all these curious researches?'' He is immediately at a loss, and knows not what to answer... a Pyrrhonian cannot expect, that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind: or if it had, that its influence would be beneficial to society. On the contrary, he must acknowledge, if he will acknowledge anything, that all human life must perish, were his principles universally and steadily to prevail." (Hume 1974:426)

He concludes the volume by setting out the limits of knowledge once and for all. "''When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, ''Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?'' No. ''Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?'' No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.''"&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D., ''Enquiries concerning Human Understanding and concerning the Principles of Morals'' Reprinted from 1777 edition, Third Edition, L. A. Selby-Bigge (ed.), Clarendon Press, Oxford, Sect. XII, Part III, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques and rejoinders==
The criteria Hume lists in his examination of the validity of human testimony are roughly upheld in modern social psychology, under the rubric of the communication-persuasion paradigm. Supporting literature includes: the work of [[social impact theory]], which discusses persuasion in part through the number of persons engaging in influence; as well as studies made on the relative influence of communicator [[credibility]] in different kinds of persuasion; and examinations of the [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]]worthiness of the speaker.

The "custom" view of learning can in many ways be likened to [[associationist]] psychology. This point of view has been subject to severe criticism in the research of the 20th century. Still, testing on the subject has been somewhat divided. Testing on certain animals like cats have concluded that they do not possess any faculty which allow their minds to grasp an insight into cause and effect. However, it has been shown that some animals, like chimpanzees, were able to generate creative plans of action to achieve their goals, and thus would seem to have a causal insight which transcends mere custom.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Wolfgang.

'''BEdita''' is an open source [[web application framework|web development framework]] that features a [[Content Management System]] (CMS) out-of-the-box.

Current version is ''3.1.5'', released on 5 March 2012 under [[Affero General Public License]] version 3.&lt;br/&gt;
A preview and "unstable" version is also available: ''3.2.beta populus'', released on 5 March 2012 under the same GPL license.

BEdita is built upon the PHP development framework [[CakePHP]].

== Features ==

BEdita is both a [[content management system]] and a [[web application framework|web development framework]].

In the words of the authors, BEdita is a "modular framework that features a back-end Content Management System out-of-the-box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BEdita – Semantic Content Management Framework | author = Official website | url = http://bedita.com/what-is-bedita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bedita as a Framework ===

[[File:BElogo-SCMF.png|frame|left|alt=BEdita SCMF logo|BEdita is a Semantic Content Management Framework.]]
BEdita is built upon the well-known PHP development framework [[CakePHP]]: as a framework itself, BEdita actually extends CakePHP adding many features through more controllers and helpers and the [[Smarty (template engine)|Smarty]] templating engine. It also combines some presentation technologies, such as JQuery, with the aim to supply a set of ready to use tools.

From CakePHP BEdita derives the [[Model–view–controller]] paradigm: the multi-tier architecture assures the separation of data modelling, data flow/control and its visual presentation.
Inside BEdita every information is stored in an object oriented manner. Upon this abstraction, the developer can build as many custom relations as needed by the project.

=== Bedita as a CMS ===

[[File:Homebedita 980px.png|thumb|alt=Screenshot of the dashboard|480px|right|BEdita: a screenshot of the dashboard]]
BEdita is also a complete [[content management system]], since it already comes with a multi-language back office application, able to manage several kinds of data: the CMS presents a number of modules, each related to a type of content.
It is able to handle documents, multimedia objects and galleries, events, news, address books, blogs, bibliographies, newsletters and more out of the box.

All this content is managed in multiple languages, [[Geotagging|geo-localized]] and organized through different strategies: hierarchic tree, custom categories and [[Tag (metadata)|''tags'']].

== Releases ==

=== A brief history ===
For major release 3, BEdita has been rewritten from the ground up: all the previous versions were not publicly available under an open source license.

The very first public release of a version 3 "beta" took place in May 2009.
On 17 November 2009 a stable version of BEdita – 3.0 codename Betula – was released under [[Affero General Public License]] version 3, freely downloadable on the official web site [http://www.bedita.com www.bedita.com] and some common [[open-source software|open-source]] online networks ([[Sourceforge]], [[Freshmeat]] or [[Ohloh]]).

BEdita was created and is currently developed by two Italian companies, [http://www.channelweb.it ChannelWeb srl] and [http://www.chialab.it Chialab srl].

'''Behaviorism''' (or '''behaviourism''') is a systematic approach to understanding the behavior of humans and other animals. It assumes that all behaviors are either [[reflex]]es produced by a response to certain stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment, together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli.  Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of inheritance in determining behavior, they focus primarily on environmental factors.
 
Behaviorism combines elements of philosophy, methodology, and psychological theory. It emerged in the late nineteenth century as a reaction to [[depth psychology]] and other traditional forms of psychology, which often had difficulty making predictions that could be tested experimentally. The earliest derivatives of Behaviorism can be traced back to the late 19th century where [[Edward Thorndike]] pioneered the [[law of effect]], a process that involved strengthening behavior through the use of [[reinforcement]].

During the first half of the twentieth century, [[John B. Watson]] devised [[methodological behaviorism]], which rejected [[introspection|introspective methods]] and sought to understand behavior by only measuring observable behaviors and events. It was not until the 1930s that [[B. F. Skinner]] suggested that private events—including thoughts and feelings—should be subjected to the same controlling variables as observable behavior, which became the basis for his philosophy called "[[radical behaviorism]]."&lt;ref name=RadicalBehaviorismCAB&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.behavior.org/item.php?id=154|title=Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy and the Science|author=Chiesa, Mecca|publisher=Authors Cooperative, Inc.|isbn=0962331147|pages=1–241|date=1994|accessdate=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904195958/http://www.behavior.org/item.php?id=154|archive-date=2017-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13668250902845244|title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: Dispelling the myths|author1=Dillenburger, Karola|author2=Keenan, Mickey|lastauthoramp=yes|journal=Journal of Intellectual and Developmental Disability|volume=34|issue=2|pages=193–195|date=2009|accessdate=2014-12-24|doi=10.1080/13668250902845244|pmid=19404840}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Watson and [[Ivan Pavlov]] investigated the stimulus-response procedures of [[classical conditioning]], Skinner assessed the controlling nature of consequences and also its potential effect on the [[Stimulus control|antecedents (or discriminative stimuli) that strengthens behavior]]; the technique became known as [[operant conditioning]].

Skinner's radical behaviorism has been highly successful experimentally, revealing new phenomena with new methods, but Skinner’s dismissal of theory limited its development.  Theoretical behaviorism&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, John (2014) The New Behaviorism (2nd edition)  Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press.  &lt;/ref&gt; recognized that a historical system, an organism, has a state as well as sensitivity to stimuli and the ability to emit responses.  Indeed, Skinner himself acknowledged the possibility of what he called “latent” responses in humans, even though he neglected to extend this idea to rats and pigeons&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. Theoretical behaviorism. Philosophy and Behavior. (45) in press.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Latent responses constitute a repertoire, from which operant reinforcement can select.  

The application of radical behaviorism—known as [[applied behavior analysis]]—is used in a variety of settings, including, for example, [[organizational behavior management]], to the treatment of mental disorders, such as [[autism]] and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=JABA1968&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1310980|title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis|author1=Baer, Donald M.|author2=Wolf, Montrose M.|author3=Risley, Todd R.|work=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=1|issue=1|date=1968|pmid=16795165|pages=91–7|doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA-Handbook-BehaviorAnalysis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4311509.aspx|title=APA Handbook of Behavior Analysis|editor=Madden, Gregory J.|date=2013|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA-BehaviorAnalysis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/bar/index.aspx?tab=1|title=Behavior Analysis: Research and Practice|editor=Crone-Todd, Darlene|date=2015|accessdate=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, while behaviorism and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] schools of psychological thought may not agree theoretically, they have complemented each other in [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavior therapies]], which have demonstrated utility in treating certain pathologies, including simple [[phobia]]s, [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], and [[mood disorders]].

==Varieties&lt;!--'Methodological behaviorism' redirects here--&gt;==
There is no universally agreed-upon classification, but some titles given to the various branches of behaviorism include:
* '''Methodological behaviorism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: [[John B. Watson|Watson]]'s behaviorism states that only public events (behaviors of an individual) can be objectively observed, and that therefore private events (thoughts and feelings) should be ignored.&lt;ref name=RadicalBehaviorismCAB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skinner1976&gt;{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=BF |title=About Behaviorism |year=1976 |publisher=Random House, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-394-71618-3 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/About_Behaviorism.html?id=K7WKkwPzNqsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; It also became the basis for the early approach [[behavior modification]] in the 1970s and early 1980s.
* [[Radical behaviorism]]: [[B. F. Skinner]]'s behaviorism theorizes that processes within the organism should be acknowledged, particularly the presence of private events (such as thoughts and feelings), and suggests that environmental variables also control these internal events just as they control observable behaviors. Radical behaviorism forms the core philosophy behind [[applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]]. [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] used many of radical behaviorism's ideas in his study of knowledge and language.&lt;ref name=Skinner1976/&gt;
* [[Teleological behaviorism]]: Post-Skinnerian, purposive, close to [[microeconomics]]. Focuses on objective observation as opposed to cognitive processes.
* [[Psychological behaviorism]]: As proposed by [[Arthur W. Staats]], unlike the previous behaviorisms of Skinner, Hull, and Tolman, was based upon a program of human research involving various types of human behavior. Psychological behaviorism introduces new principles of human learning. Humans learn not only by the animal learning principles but also by special human learning principles. Those principles involve human's uniquely huge learning ability. Humans learn repertoires that enable them to learn other things. Human learning is thus cumulative. No other animal demonstrates that ability, making the human species unique.
* [[Interbehaviorism]]: Founded by [[Jacob Robert Kantor]] before Skinner's writings.

Two subtypes are:
* [[Clark L. Hull|Hullian]] and post-Hullian: theoretical, group data, not dynamic, physiological
* Purposive: [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s behavioristic anticipation of cognitive psychology

===Radical behaviorism===
{{main article|Radical behaviorism}}
B. F. Skinner proposed radical behaviorism as the conceptual underpinning of the [[experimental analysis of behavior]]. This view differs from other approaches to behavioral research in various ways but, most notably here, it contrasts with methodological behaviorism in accepting feelings, states of mind and introspection as behaviors subject to scientific investigation. Like methodological behaviorism it rejects the reflex as a model of all behavior, and it defends the science of behavior as complementary to but independent of physiology. Radical behaviorism overlaps considerably with other western philosophical positions such as American pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moxley |first=R.A. |year=2004 |title=Pragmatic selectionism: The philosophy of behavior analysis |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=108–25 |url=http://www.baojournal.com |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental and conceptual innovations==
This essentially philosophical position gained strength from the success of Skinner's early experimental work with rats and pigeons, summarized in his books ''The Behavior of Organisms''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Skinner |first=B.F. |authorlink= B.F. Skinner |title=[[The Behavior of Organisms]] |publisher=Copley Pub Group |year=1991 |page=473 |isbn=0-87411-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Schedules of Reinforcement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cheney, Carl D. |author2=Ferster, Charles B. |title=Schedules of Reinforcement (B.F. Skinner Reprint Series) |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |location=Acton, MA |year=1997 |page=758 |isbn=0-87411-828-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance was his concept of the operant response, of which the canonical example was the rat's lever-press. In contrast with the idea of a physiological or reflex response, an operant is a class of structurally distinct but functionally equivalent responses. For example, while a rat might press a lever with its left paw or its right paw or its tail, all of these responses operate on the world in the same way and have a common consequence. Operants are often thought of as species of responses, where the individuals differ but the class coheres in its function-shared consequences with operants and reproductive success with species. This is a clear distinction between Skinner's theory and [[S–R theory]].

Skinner's empirical work expanded on earlier research on [[trial-and-error]] learning by researchers such as Thorndike and Guthrie with both conceptual reformulations—Thorndike's notion of a stimulus–response "association" or "connection" was abandoned; and methodological ones—the use of the "free operant", so called because the animal was now permitted to respond at its own rate rather than in a series of trials determined by the experimenter procedures. With this method, Skinner carried out substantial experimental work on the effects of different schedules and rates of reinforcement on the rates of operant responses made by rats and pigeons. He achieved remarkable success in training animals to perform unexpected responses, to emit large numbers of responses, and to demonstrate many empirical regularities at the purely behavioral level. This lent some credibility to his conceptual analysis. It is largely his conceptual analysis that made his work much more rigorous than his peers', a point which can be seen clearly in his seminal work ''Are Theories of Learning Necessary?'' in which he criticizes what he viewed to be theoretical weaknesses then common in the study of psychology. An important descendant of the experimental analysis of behavior is the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |year=2001 |title=A short history of the Society for the Quantitative Analysis of Behavior |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=275–9 |url=http://www.baojournal.com |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thornbury |first1= Scott|title=The Lexical Approach: A journey without maps|journal=Modern English Teacher|date=1998|volume=7 | issue = 4 |pages= 7–13| url= http://nebula.wsimg.com/9129eed8a13130f4ee92cf2c3ce5b13e?AccessKeyId=186A535D1BA4FC995A73&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to language==
As Skinner turned from experimental work to concentrate on the philosophical underpinnings of a science of behavior, his attention turned to human language with his 1957 book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Verbal Behavior |location=Acton, Massachusetts |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |year=1957 |isbn= 1-58390-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other language-related publications;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Skinner |first=B.F. |year=1969 |title=An operant analysis of problem-solving |pages=133–57}}; chapter in {{cite book |last= Skinner| first= B.F. |year=1969 |title=Contingencies of reinforcement: a theoretical analysis |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |isbn=0-13-171728-6 |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verbal Behavior'' laid out a vocabulary and theory for functional analysis of verbal behavior, and was strongly criticized in a review by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Language |issue=1 |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm |year=1959 |pages=26–58 |author1=Chomsky, Noam |authorlink1=Noam Chomsky |doi=10.2307/411334 |volume=35 |jstor=411334 |author2=Skinner, B.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia M.|year=2013 |title= Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher= SAGE Publications| isbn= 9781483315324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner did not respond in detail but claimed that Chomsky failed to understand his ideas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Skinner| first= B.F. |title=I Have Been Misunderstood. |journal=Center Magazine |year=1972 |issue= March–April |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the disagreements between the two and the theories involved have been further discussed.&lt;ref name=MacCorquodale1970&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacCorquodale |first=K. |year=1970 |title=On Chomsky's Review of Skinner's VERBAL BEHAVIOR |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=83–99 |url=https://www.behavior.org/computer-modeling/maccorquodale/maccorquodale2.cfm |accessdate=2008-01-10 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83 |pmc=1333660 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106061500/http://www.behavior.org/computer-modeling/maccorquodale/maccorquodale2.cfm |archive-date=2009-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2103585"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stemmer| first= N. |title=Skinner's verbal behavior, Chomsky's review, and mentalism |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=307–15 |year=1990 |pmid=2103585 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1990.54-307 |pmc=1323000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Innateness hypothesis|Innateness theory]] is opposed to behaviorist theory which claims that language is a set of habits that can be acquired by means of conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Thornbury| first1= Scott| title= An A-Z of ELT|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan|location=Oxford|isbn=1405070633|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglas Brown |first1= H| title= Principles of Language Learning and Teaching|date=2000|publisher=Longman/Pearson Education|location=White Plains |isbn= 0-13-017816-0| pages= 8–9| edition= Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, the behaviorist account is a process which would be too slow to explain a phenomenon as complicated as language learning. What was important for a behaviorist's analysis of human behavior was not [[language acquisition]] so much as the interaction between language and overt behavior. In an essay republished in his 1969 book ''Contingencies of Reinforcement'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Skinner| first= B.F. |year=1969 |title=Contingencies of reinforcement: a theoretical analysis |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |isbn=0-13-171728-6 |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner took the view that humans could construct linguistic stimuli that would then acquire control over their behavior in the same way that external stimuli could. The possibility of such "instructional control" over behavior meant that contingencies of reinforcement would not always produce the same effects on human behavior as they reliably do in other animals. The focus of a radical behaviorist analysis of human behavior therefore shifted to an attempt to understand the interaction between instructional control and contingency control, and also to understand the behavioral processes that determine what instructions are constructed and what control they acquire over behavior. Recently, a new line of behavioral research on language was started under the name of [[relational frame theory]].

==Education==
{{see also|Philosophy of education#Realism}}
Behaviourism focuses on one particular view of learning: a change in external behaviour achieved through using reinforcement and repetition ([[Rote learning]]) to shape behavior of learners. Skinner found that behaviors could be shaped when the use of reinforcement was implemented. Desired behavior is rewarded, while the undesired behavior is not rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.learning-theories.com/behaviorism.html|title=Behaviorism - Learning Theories|date=2007-01-31|work=Learning Theories|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating behaviorism into the classroom allowed educators to assist their students in excelling both academically and personally. In the field of language learning, this type of teaching was called the [[audio-lingual method]], characterised by the whole class using choral chanting of key phrases, dialogues and immediate correction.

Within the behaviourist view of learning, the "teacher" is the dominant person in the classroom and takes complete control, evaluation of learning comes from the teacher who decides what is right or wrong. The learner does not have any opportunity for evaluation or reflection within the learning process, they are simply told what is right or wrong.
The conceptualization of learning using this approach could be considered "superficial" as the focus is on external changes in behaviour i.e. not interested in the internal processes of learning leading to behaviour change and has no place for the emotions involved the process.

==Operant conditioning==
{{main article|Operant conditioning}}
[[Operant conditioning]] was developed by [[B.F. Skinner]] in 1937 and deals with the [[behaviour modification|modification of "voluntary behaviour"]] or operant behaviour. Operant behavior operates on the environment and is maintained by its consequences. [[Reinforcement]] and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]], the core tools of operant conditioning, are either positive (delivered following a response), or negative (withdrawn following a response).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.learning-theories.com/operant-conditioning-skinner.html|title=Classical and Operant Conditioning - Behaviorist Theories|date=2015-06-19|work=Learning Theories|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner created the ''Skinner Box'' or [[operant conditioning chamber]] to test the effects of operant conditioning principles on rats. From this study, he discovered that the rats learned very effectively if they were rewarded frequently. Skinner also found that he could shape the rats' behavior through the use of rewards, which could, in turn, be applied to human learning as well.

==Classical conditioning==
{{main article|Classical conditioning}}
Although [[operant conditioning]] plays the largest role in discussions of behavioral mechanisms, [[classical conditioning]] (or Pavlovian conditioning or respondent conditioning) is also an important behavior-analytic process that need not refer to mental or other internal processes. Pavlov's experiments with dogs provide the most familiar example of the classical conditioning procedure.  In simple conditioning, the dog was presented with a stimulus such as a light or a sound, and then food was placed in the dog's mouth.  After a few repetitions of this sequence, the light or sound by itself caused the dog to salivate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivan Pavlov|url=http://www.ivanpavlov.com/|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered.

[[John B. Watson|Watson]]'s "Behaviourist Manifesto" has three aspects that deserve special recognition: one is that psychology should be purely objective, with any interpretation of conscious experience being removed, thus leading to psychology as the "science of behaviour"; the second one is that the goals of psychology should be to predict and control behaviour (as opposed to describe and explain conscious mental states; the third one is that there is no notable distinction between human and non-human behaviour. Following Darwin's theory of evolution, this would simply mean that human behaviour is just a more complex version in respect to behaviour displayed by other species.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gross, Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
{{main|Logical behaviorism}}
Behaviorism is a psychological movement that can be contrasted with [[philosophy of mind]]. The basic premise of ''radical behaviorism'' is that the study of behavior should be a [[natural science]], such as [[chemistry]] or [[physics]], without any reference to hypothetical inner states of organisms as causes for their behavior. Less radical varieties are unconcerned with philosophical positions on internal, mental and subjective experience. Behaviorism takes a functional view of behavior. According to [[Edmund Fantino]] and colleagues: "Behavior analysis has much to offer the study of phenomena normally dominated by cognitive and social psychologists. We hope that successful application of behavioral theory and methodology will not only shed light on central problems in judgment and choice but will also generate greater appreciation of the behavioral approach."&lt;ref name=Fantino2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fantino, E. |author2=Stolarz-Fantino, S. |author3=Navarro, A.  |year=2003 |title=Logical fallacies: A behavioral approach to reasoning |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/4/1/109.html |accessdate=2008-01-10 |at=p.116 (pp.109–117)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorist sentiments are not uncommon within [[philosophy of language]] and [[analytic philosophy]]. It is sometimes argued that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] defended a [[Logical behaviorism|logical behaviorist]] position&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=behaviorism |title=Behaviorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., the ''[[Philosophical Investigations#Wittgenstein's beetle|beetle in a box]]'' argument). In [[logical positivism]] (as held, e.g., by [[Rudolf Carnap]]&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; and [[Carl Hempel]]),&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;  the meaning of psychological statements are their verification conditions, which consist of performed overt behavior. [[W. V. O. Quine]] made use of a type of behaviorism,&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;  influenced by some of Skinner's ideas, in his own work on language. Quine's work in semantics differed substantially from the empiricist semantics of Carnap which he attempted to create an alternative to, couching his semantic theory in references to physical objects rather than sensations. [[Gilbert Ryle]] defended a distinct strain of philosophical behaviorism, sketched in his book ''The Concept of Mind''.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;  Ryle's central claim was that instances of dualism frequently represented "[[category mistake]]s", and hence that they were really misunderstandings of the use of ordinary language. [[Daniel Dennett]] likewise acknowledges himself to be a type of behaviorist,&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/msgisno.htm |title=The Message is: There is no Medium |last=Dennett |first=D.C. |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |accessdate=2008-01-10 |publisher=Tufts University| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111100055/http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/msgisno.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he offers extensive criticism of radical behaviorism and refutes Skinner's rejection of the value of intentional idioms and the possibility of free will.&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Dennett |year=1981 |title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-54037-7 |lccn=78013723 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC&amp;pg=PA53 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|This is Dennett's main point in "Skinner Skinned." Dennett argues that there is a crucial difference between explaining and explaining away… If our explanation of apparently rational behavior turns out to be extremely simple, we may want to say that the behavior was not really rational after all. But if the explanation is very complex and intricate, we may want to say not that the behavior is not rational, but that we now have a better understanding of what rationality consists in. (Compare: if we find out how a computer program solves problems in linear algebra, we don't say it's not really solving them, we just say we know how it does it. On the other hand, in cases like [[Joseph Weizenbaum|Weizenbaum's]] [[ELIZA]] program, the explanation of how the computer carries on a conversation is so simple that the right thing to say seems to be that the machine isn't really carrying on a conversation, it's just a trick.)|Curtis Brown|Philosophy of Mind|"Behaviorism: Skinner and Dennett"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behaviorism: Skinner and Dennett |year=2001 |work=Philosophy of Mind |first=Curtis |last=Brown |publisher=Trinity University |location=San Antonio, TX |url=http://www.trinity.edu/cbrown/mind/behaviorism.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
===Molecular versus molar behaviorism===
Skinner's view of behavior is most often characterized as a "molecular" view of behavior; that is, behavior can be decomposed into atomistic parts or molecules. This view is inconsistent with Skinner's complete description of behavior as delineated in other works, including his 1981 article "Selection by Consequences".&lt;ref name=Skinner1981&gt;{{Cite journal |date=31 July 1981 |author=Skinner, B.F |title=Selection by Consequences |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4507 |pages=501–4 |doi=10.1126/science.7244649 |url=http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2010 |pmid=7244649 |bibcode=1981Sci...213..501S |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230825/http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner proposed that a complete account of behavior requires understanding of selection history at three levels: [[biology]] (the [[natural selection]] or [[phylogeny]] of the animal); behavior (the reinforcement history or ontogeny of the behavioral repertoire of the animal); and for some species, [[culture]] (the cultural practices of the social group to which the animal belongs). This whole organism then interacts with its environment. Molecular behaviorists use notions from [[melioration theory]], [[hyperbolic discounting|negative power function discounting]] or additive versions of negative power function discounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fantino, E. |title=Delay-reduction theory—the case for temporal context: comment on Grace and Savastano (2000) |journal=J Exp Psychol Gen |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=444–6 |year=2000 |pmid=11142857 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.129.4.444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molar behaviorists, such as [[Howard Rachlin]], [[Richard Herrnstein]], and William Baum, argue that behavior cannot be understood by focusing on events in the moment. That is, they argue that behavior is best understood as the ultimate product of an organism's history and that molecular behaviorists are committing a fallacy by inventing fictitious proximal causes for behavior. Molar behaviorists argue that standard molecular constructs, such as "associative strength", are better replaced by molar variables such as [[rate of reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baum, W.M. |year=2003 |title=The molar view of behavior and its usefulness in behavior analysis |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |pages=78–81 |url=http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=abstract&amp;id=206927 |accessdate=2008-01-10 |doi=10.1037/h0100009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904101644/http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=abstract&amp;id=206927 |archive-date=2009-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a molar behaviorist would describe "loving someone" as a pattern of [[love|loving behavior]] over time; there is no isolated, proximal cause of loving behavior, only a history of behaviors (of which the current behavior might be an example) that can be summarized as "love".

===21st-century behavior analysis===
{{Advert|section|date=March 2015}}
The early term [[behavior modification]] has been obsolete since the 1990s as it currently refers to the brief revival of methodological behaviorism in the 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=JABA1994&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1297814|title=The significance and future of functional analysis methodologies|author=Mace, F.

The independent development of behaviour analysis outside the US also continues to develop, In terms of motivation, there remains strong interest in the variety of human motivational behaviour factors, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kellaway|first1=Lucy|title=My team gets more excited by loo roll than business budgets: Work problems answered|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a06bab2a-8ab7-11e4-8e24-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3sEMws3TI|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=7 January 2015|location=London|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eyres|first1=Harry|title=Peaks in a trough year: The Slow Lane|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ec975ad6-e9cb-11de-ae43-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fec975ad6-e9cb-11de-ae43-00144feab49a.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DPeaks%2Bin%2Ba%2Btrough%2BEYRES&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=19 December 2009|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Stefan|title=Keep up motivation levels through long summer days|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DKeep%2Bup%2Bmotivation%2Blevels%2Bstern&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app#axzz3sEMws3TI|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=5 August 2008|location=London|page=12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122232423/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F8e995bca-6284-11dd-9a1e-000077b07658.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3DKeep%2Bup%2Bmotivation%2Blevels%2Bstern&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app#axzz3sEMws3TI|archive-date=2015-11-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Skapinker|first1=Michael|title=Human capitalism: Does treating workers well help business too?

The interests among behavior analysts today are wide-ranging, as a review of the 30 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within ABAI indicates. Such interests include everything from developmental disabilities and autism, to cultural psychology, clinical psychology, verbal behavior, [[Organizational Behavior Management]] (OBM; behavior analytic I–O psychology). OBM has developed a particularly strong following within behavior analysis, as evidenced by the formation of the OBM Network and the influential ''Journal of Organizational Behavior Management'' (JOBM; recently rated the 3rd highest impact journal in applied psychology by ISI JOBM rating).

Applications of behavioral technology, also known as applied behavior analysis or ABA, have been particularly well established in the area of developmental disabilities since the 1960s.  Treatment of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders has grown especially rapidly since the mid-1990s.  This demand for services encouraged the formation of a professional credentialing program administered by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc. (BACB) and accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies.  As of early 2012, there are over 300 BACB approved course sequences offered by about 200 colleges and universities worldwide preparing students for this credential and approximately 11,000 BACB certificants, most working in the United States.  The Association of Professional Behavior Analysts was formed in 2008 to meet the needs of these ABA professionals.

Modern [[behavior analysis]] has also witnessed a massive resurgence in research and applications related to language and cognition, with the development of [[relational frame theory]] (RFT; described as a "Post-Skinnerian account of language and cognition").&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Roche, B. (2001) Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition. Kluwer Academic: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; RFT also forms the empirical basis for the highly successful and data-driven [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT). In fact, researchers and practitioners in RFT/ACT have become sufficiently prominent that they have formed their own specialized organization that is highly behaviorally oriented, known as the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] (ACBS). 

Some of the current prominent behavior analytic journals include the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'' (JABA), the ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'' (JEAB) JEAB website, the ''Journal of Organizational Behavior Management'' (JOBM), ''Behavior and Social Issues'' (BSI), as well as ''[[the Psychological Record]]''. Currently, the US has 14 ABAI accredited MA and PhD programs for comprehensive study in behavior analysis.

==Behavior analysis and culture==
Cultural analysis has always been at the philosophical core of radical behaviorism from the early days (as seen in Skinner's ''[[Walden Two]]'', ''Science &amp; Human Behavior'', ''Beyond Freedom &amp; Dignity'', and ''About Behaviorism'').

During the 1980s, behavior analysts, most notably Sigrid Glenn, had a productive interchange with cultural anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]] (the most notable proponent of "cultural materialism") regarding interdisciplinary work. Very recently, behavior analysts have produced a set of basic exploratory experiments in an effort toward this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ward |first=Todd A. |last2=Eastman |first2= Raymond |last3=Ninness |first3=Chris |year=2009 |title=An Experimental Analysis of Cultural Materialism: The Effects of Various Modes of Production on Resource Sharing |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/view/1950/2185 |journal=Behavior and Social Issues |volume=18 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.5210/bsi.v18i1.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorism is also frequently used in [[game development]], although this application is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gamification, Behaviorism and Bullsh$!|author=Jon Radoff|year=2011|journal=Radoff.com|url=http://radoff.com/blog/2011/08/09/gamification-behaviorism-bullshit/|access-date=2011-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003003247/http://radoff.com/blog/2011/08/09/gamification-behaviorism-bullshit/|archive-date=2011-10-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior informatics and behavior computing ==
With the fast growth of big behavioral data and applications, behavior analysis is ubiquitous. Understanding behavior from the informatics and computing perspective becomes increasingly critical for in-depth understanding of what, why and how behaviors are formed, interact, evolve, change and affect business and decision. [[Behavior informatics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Longbing|date=|year=2010|title=In-depth Behavior Understanding and Use: the Behavior Informatics Approach|url=|journal=Information Science|volume=180|issue=17|pages=3067–3085|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2010.03.025|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Longbing|last2=Joachims|first2=Thorsten|date=|year=2014|title=Behavior Informatics: A New Perspective.|url=|journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems|volume=29|issue=4|pages=62–80|doi=10.1109/mis.2014.60|pmid=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[behavior computing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behavior Computing: Modeling, Analysis, Mining and Decision|last=Cao|first=Longbing|last2=Yu|first2=Philip (eds)|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4471-2969-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behavior and Social Computing|last=Cao|first=Longbing|last2=Motoda|first2=Hiroshi|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=978-3-319-04047-9|location=|pages=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; deeply explore behavior intelligence and behavior insights from the informatics and computing perspectives.

== Criticisms and limitations ==
{{See also|Cognitive psychology|Cognitive neuroscience}}
In the second half of the 20th century, behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a result of the [[cognitive revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, N. (2005). Mind and Machine: Ethical and Epistemological Implications for Research. Thompson Rivers University, B.C., Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldrop, M.M. (2002). ''The Dream Machine: JCR Licklider and the revolution that made computing personal''. New York: Penguin Books. (pp. 139–40).&lt;/ref&gt; This shift was due to methodological behaviorism being highly criticized for not examining mental processes, and this led to the development of the [[cognitive therapy]] movement.
In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:
* [[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 1959 | title = Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior | url = | journal = Language | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 26–58 | doi = 10.2307/411334 }}
Chomsky N. Preface to the reprint of A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior. In: Jakobovits L.A, Miron M.S, editors. Readings in the psychology of language. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of psychological thought. [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] spent years developing the concept of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. The effective result was more of a framework conceptualization of mental functions with their counterparts in computers (memory, storage, retrieval, etc.)
* Formal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as [[George Mandler]]'s Center for Human Information Processing in 1964. Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mandler|first=George|title=Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution|year=2002|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|volume=38|pages=339–353|doi=10.1002/jhbs.10066|pmid=12404267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of cognitive psychology, behaviorist critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. [[Cognitive neuroscience]], however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.

'''Benjamin Paul Blood''' (November 21, 1832 – January 15, 1919) was an [[American philosopher]] and [[poet]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Amsterdam, New York]]. His father, John Blood, was a prosperous landowner. Blood was known as an intelligent man but an unfocused one. He described himself: &lt;blockquote&gt;I was born here in Amsterdam. My father was a land holder of 700 acres [2.8 km²] here, adjoining the city on both sides of the river, and lived, as I now live, in a large brick house on the south bank of the Mohawk visible as you enter Amsterdam from the east. I was his only child, and went a good deal my own way. I ran to machinery, by fancy; patented among other devices a swathing reaper which is very successful. I was of loose and wandering ways. And was a successful gambler through the Tweed regime -- made 'bar'ls' of money, and threw it away. I was a fancy gymnast also, and have had some heavy fights, notable one of forty minutes with Ed. Mullett, whom I left senseless. This was mere fancy. I never lifted an angry hand against man, woman or child -- all fun -- for me. ....I do farming in a way, but am much idle. I have been a sort of pet of the city, and think I should be missed. In a large vote taken by one of the daily papers here a month or so ago as to who were the 12 leading citizens, I was 6th in the 12, and sole in my class. So you see, if Sparta has many a worthier son, I am still boss in the department I prefer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blood did indeed patent a swathing reaper,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/patents/US234651?printsec=abstract&amp;dq=reaper+b.+blood#v=onepage&amp;q=reaper%20b.%20blood&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; along with other patents, and wrote prolifically, but the larger portion of his writing consisted of letters, either to local newspapers or to friends such as [[James Hutchison Stirling]], [[Alfred Tennyson]] and [[William James]] (the above quote was from a letter to James). [[H. M. Kallen]] wrote of Blood:&lt;blockquote&gt;He was born in 1832 and lived for eighty-six years. During that time he wrote much, but unsystematically. His favorite form of publication was letters to newspapers, mainly local newspapers with a small circulation. These letters dealt with an astonishing diversity of subjects, from local petty politics or the tricks of spiritualist mediums to principles of industry and finance and profundities of metaphysics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Early books included ''The Philosophy of Justice Between God and Man'' (1851) and ''Optimism: The Lesson of Ages'' (1860), a Christian mystical vision of the pursuit of happiness from Blood's distinctly American perspective. During his lifetime he was best known for his poetry, which included ''The Bride of the Iconoclast'', ''Justice'',and ''The Colonnades''.  According to Christopher Nelson, Blood was a direct influence on William James' ''The Varieties of Religious Experience'' &lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Christopher. ''The Artificial Mystic State of Mind: WJ, Benjamin Paul Blood, and the Nitrous-Oxide Variety of Religious Experience." "Streams of William James''. The William James Society. Volume 4, Issue 3 (Fall 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; as well on James's concept of [[Sciousness]], prime reality consciousness without a sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Bricklin, Jonathan, Ed., Sciousness, Guilford, CT: Eirini Press&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing the [[anesthetic]] [[nitrous oxide]] during a dental operation, Blood concluded that the gas had opened his mind to new ideas and continued experimenting with it. In 1874, he published a 37-page pamphlet, ''The Anesthetic Revelation and the Gist of Philosophy''.

He married twice; to Mary Sayles, and following her death, to Harriet Lefferts. He had six children from the first marriage, and a daughter from the second.

Blood died in Amsterdam, New York. His final work, ''Pluriverse'', was published posthumously.

The Missionaries of the '''Company of Mary''' is a [[missionary]] [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] within the [[Catholic Church]]. The community was founded by [[Saint]] [[Louis de Montfort]] in 1705 with the recruitment of his first missionary disciple, Mathurin Rangeard. The congregation is made up of [[presbyter|priests]] and [[Lay brother|brothers]] who serve both in the native lands and in other countries. The Montfortian Family comprises three groups: the Company of Mary, the [[Daughters of Wisdom]] and the [[Brothers of Christian Instruction of St Gabriel|Brothers of Saint Gabriel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montfort.org.uk/montspir/index.html Montfortian Spirituality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027222026/http://www.montfort.org.uk/montspir/index.html |date=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As early as 1700 Montfort had conceived the idea of founding a society of missionaries. Five months after his [[ordination]], in November 1700, Montfort wrote: "I am continually asking in my prayers for a poor and small company of good priests to preach [[Parochial mission (Catholicism)|missions]] and [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]]s under the standard and protection of the Blessed Virgin".&lt;ref name=Bemelmans&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09749d.htm Bemelmans, John. "Missionaries of the Company of Mary." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 22 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1713 he went to [[Paris]] with a view to recruit members for his community. The director of the seminary Du St-Esprit promised to send him such young priests as would feel called to do missionary work. During the intervals between his missions Montfort wrote the Rule of the Company of Mary though no official membership would develop before his death.  After de Montfort  died in 1716, two young priests and occasional collaborators, Father Adrien Vatel and Father Rene Mulot continued his mission.  From 1718-1781 the "Mulotins", although few in number, gave over 430 missions throughout western France, most of which lasted a month.&lt;ref name=Bemelmans/&gt;

After the [[French Revolution]] Montfort's community was reorganised by Father Gabriel Deshayes, elected [[superior general]] in 1821. He received from [[Pope Leo XII]] a brief of praise for the Company of Mary and for the [[Daughters of Wisdom]], which had also been formed by de Montfort with the help of [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Marie Louise Trichet]]. Father Dalin who was superior general from 1837-1855, obtained canonical approbation of both congregations. Hitherto the missionaries had but one residence, the mother-house at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre]] (where de Montfort and Trichet are buried) in the [[Pays de la Loire]]  [[Regions of France|region]]. During Dalin's administration as general, several establishments were made in France. Under his successor, Father Denis (1855-1877) the community accepted the direction of a [[seminary]] at [[Pontchâteau]] in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nantes|Diocese of Nantes]], from where priests were sent to [[Haiti]], the Company's first attempt at foreign missions.&lt;ref name=Bemelmans/&gt;

The [[anti-clerical]] sentiment which arose in the French government in the late 19th century, resulted in the enacting of the [[Jules Ferry laws]] which led to many religious congregations which operated schools to leave France. The Montfortian novices took refuge in the [[Netherlands]], where a novitiate and a scholasticate were established. In 1883, a school was also begun at [[Schimmert]]. That same year saw the establishment of the first house in [[Canada]]. The [[beatification]] of de Montfort, in 1888, gave a new stimulus to the company's expansion. A novitiate and a scholasticate were founded near [[Ottawa]] (1890); a mission school at [[Papineauville, Quebec]] (1900) and missions in [[Denmark]]. In 1901 the Company took charge of what was then the [[Apostolic vicariate]] of Nyassa Land ([[Malawi]]) where the congregation ministers to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09749d.htm 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia: Company of Mary]&lt;/ref&gt;
The 20th century witnessed the expansion of the Company throughout the world, and its members now serve on every continent.

==Mission and charism==
The mission of the Company of Mary is expressed in the Congregation's Constitutions as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our Mission in the Church consists in revealing the mystery of salvation to those who do not yet know it, and in helping those who have already heard the Good News to rediscover and deepen this mystery by a renewed consciousness of the meaning of their baptismal commitment."
"The Marian character of the Company is an essential possession of our Congregation. Mary is not present in the life of the missionaries in some accidental fashion: devotion toward her is an integral part of their spiritual life and apostolate. The 'total consecration' to Jesus through Mary is the most outstanding mark of the Marian character of our inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://montfort.org/content/index2.php?action=section&amp;lang=EN&amp;section=4 Generalate website: Who we are]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vows==

As members of a [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] Montfortians embrace the [[evangelical counsels]], taking the three traditional [[religious vows]] of poverty, chastity and obedience. Poverty means that all possessions are held in common and that no member may accumulate wealth. Chastity means more than abstaining from sexual activity and its purpose is to make the religious totally available for service; it is also a sign that only [[God]] can completely fill the human heart. For a member of a religious congregation, obedience is not slavishly doing what one is told by the superior but being attentive to God’s will by prayerfully listening to the voice of the person in charge. Ultimately, these vows are lived out within a community and bolstered by a relationship with God.

==Religious Formation==

===Enquiry and discernment===

As part of this discernment process it is normal for interested parties to spend weekends, or even longer, in a Montfortian community. During this time the members of the Congregation share what it is like to be a [[presbyter|priest]], religious brother or [[Religious Sister|sister]]. The young people are also strongly encouraged to attend [[Mass (Liturgy)|Mass]] as often as possible and to regularly spend time in [[prayer]] in order to better discern their vocation.

===Postulancy===

This period which lasts between six months to a year, and postulants live in a community on a full-time basis. This postulancy is devoted to learning more deeply about what it means to follow [[Christ]] as a future Montfort. It is normal for the postulant to study [[French language|French]] if he has no, or limited, knowledge of the language.

===Novitiate===

Once the candidate knows the Montfortian way of life, he is admitted into the novitiate preparing himself to take the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  The novitiate year is crucial, for it is then that the novices&lt;blockquote&gt;“…better understand their divine vocation, and indeed one which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and suitability are tested.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P25.HTM Code of Canon Law 646]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Thus, the novices are given the opportunity for longer periods of [[prayer]] and spiritual reading as well as silence in order to reflect on the vocation [[God]] is offering and nature of their response. The spiritual development of the novice is of particular focus, especially through [[spiritual direction]]. During the novitiate the history and Constitutions of the Congregation are studied in depth.

A simple profession is made at the end of the novitiate and the person officially becomes a member of the Congregation for &lt;blockquote&gt;“By religious profession, members assume the observance of the three evangelical counsels by public vow, are consecrated to God through the ministry of the Church, and are incorporated into the institute with the rights and duties defined by law.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Code of Canon Law 654]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As part of the ceremony, the new member is clothed in the Montfortian [[Religious habit|habit]] which consists of a fold-over black [[cassock]], cord from which hang a 15 decade set of [[rosary beads]].

===Post Novitiate===

Post novitiate is where the newly professed religious deepens his commitment as a member of the Montfortians and decides whether or not to make a lifelong commitment to vowed life. For those with a vocation to be a [[Lay brother|brother]] suitable training is pursued in his particular field of interest. It is normal for a brother to make his perpetual profession to the Congregation after 3 or 4 years. The Company of Mary asserts that&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Brothers in particular enrich the Mission with their talents as builders especially, as agriculturists, secretaries, leaders in catechesis and in liturgy: services that they continue to offer with the help of the computer and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://montfort.org/content/index2.php?action=section&amp;lang=EN&amp;section=19 Generalate website: Fathers and Brothers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those called to [[Holy Orders]] study for a degree in [[theology]], taking courses in [[philosophy]] if they have no experience of that discipline. At the end of this period of formation, which, according to Canon Law, may last between 3 and 6 years&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Code of Canon Law 655]&lt;/ref&gt; perpetual profession (final vows) is made and ordination to the [[diaconate]] follows and then to the [[presbyterate]] between six months and a year later. In exceptional circumstances, temporary vows may be extended beyond the 6-year period, but for no more than 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 657.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
As with all [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]]s in the [[Latin Church|Latin]] branch of the [[Catholic Church]], the Montfortians are led by a superior general who is assisted by his council. The general calls a general chapter according to the constitutions of the Company and it is this convocation (composed of elected members from around the world) which sets goals, establishes provinces and sets policy. There are provinces, vice-provinces and delegations each of which is led by a provincial (or someone similar) elected by those members who have taken final vows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15219">The '''[[contralateral]] organization of the [[forebrain]]''' ([[Latin]]: contra ‚against‘; latus ‚side‘, lateral ‚sided‘) is the property that the [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]s of the [[cerebrum]] and the [[thalamus]] represent mainly the contralateral side of the body. Consequently, the left side of the forebrain mostly represents the right side of the body and the right side of the brain represents mostly the left side of the body. The contralateral organization involves both, executive and sensory functions (e.g., a left-sided [[brain lesion]] may cause a right-sided [[hemiplegia]]). The contralateral organization is present in all [[vertebrates]] but in no [[invertebrate]]. According to current theories, the forebrain is twisted about the long axis of the body, so that not only the left and right sides, but also dorsal and ventral sides are interchanged (see below).

== Anatomy ==

[[File:Gray690.png|thumb|left|160px|Some afferent decussations.]]
[[File:Gray680.png|thumb|160px|Pyramidal decussations.]]
[[Anatomically]], the contralateral organization is manifested by major '''[[decussation]]s''' (latin: the [[Latin]] notation for [[10|ten]], 'deca', is an [[uppercase]] 'X') and [[Optic chiasma|chiasma]]s (after the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[uppercase]] letter 'Χ', [[Chi (letter)|chi]]). A decussation denotes a crossing of bundles of [[axonal]] fibres inside the [[central nervous system]]. As a result of such decussations, the [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent connections]] of the cerebrum to the [[basal ganglia]], the [[cerebellum]] and the [[spinal chord|spine]] are crossed, and the [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] connections from the spine, the cerebellum and the [[pons]] to the thalamus are crossed.&lt;ref name="Nieuwenhuys1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nieuwenhuys|first1=R.|last2=Donkelaar|first2=H.J.|last3=Nicholson|first3=C.|last4=Smeets|first4=W.J.A.J.|last5=Wicht|first5=H.|title=The central nervous system of vertebrates.|date=1998|publisher=Springer|location=New York|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540560135}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, motor, [[somatosensory]], [[auditory system|auditory]], and visual primary regions in the forebrain represent predominantly the contralateral side of the body.

Two of the [[cranial nerves]] show chiasmas: the [[optic tract]] (nerve II) which originates from the eyes and inserts on the [[optic tectum]] of the [[midbrain]], and the [[trochlear nerve]] (nerve IV) which originates in the ventral midbrain and innervates one of the six muscles that rotate the eye ([[superior oblique muscle]]).

=== The contralateral organization is incomplete ===

Although the forebrain of all vertebrates shows a contralateral organization, this contralaterality is by no means complete. Some of these exceptions are worth to mention:
* [[Olfaction]] (smelling sense): Each [[Olfactory bulb|olfactory lobe]] connects to the ipsilateral centers of the frontal cerebrum.
* In [[chondrichthyans]] ([[sharks]] and [[skate (fish)|skate]]s) the thalamus does not retrieve a branch from the optic tract but only from the contralateral [[optic tectum]], so that the optic path [[decussates]] twice and the forebrain represents the ipsilateral eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luiten|first1=P.G.M.|title=Two visual pathways to the telencephalon in the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum).

* In large brains, some functions tend to be strongly [[lateralization of brain function|lateralized]]. E.g., the [[language]] regions ([[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]) are in the left side in most humans.
* Most [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] connections of the forebrain have bilateral components, especially outside the primary sensory and motor regions. As a result, a hemiplegia that is acquired at very young age can be completely compensated over time.

== Theories ==

According to current understanding, the contralateral organization is due to an '''axial twist''' (see below). A number of alternative proposals have been published earlier,&lt;ref name="Vulliemoz"&gt;{{

=== Visual map theory by Cajal ===

According to this theory, the function of the optic chiasm is to repair the retinal field image on the visual cortex. The pupil in the vertebrates’ eyes inverts the image on the retina, so that the visual periphery projects to the medial side of the retina. By the chiasmatic crossing, the visual periphery is again on the outside, if one assumes that the retinal map is faithfully maintained throughout the optic tract.

The theory has a number of weaknesses.&lt;ref name="Lussanet2012"&gt;{{

As a result, the retinal map show the visual periphery on the medial side. However, the central point of the theory was exactly to obtain a faithful visual map with the medial field projecting to the medial sides of the visual cortex.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Twist theories ===

Two twist theories have been proposed independently, the '''axial twist theory''' by de Marc Lussanet and Jan Osse&lt;ref name="Lussanet2012" /&gt; and the '''somatic twist theory''' by [[Marcel Kinsbourne]].&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne13"&gt;{{

==== Axial twist theory ====

[[File:AxialTwistDevelopment.png|thumb|alt=caption|Schema of the developmental twist according to the axial twist theory. A,B: The early embryo turns onto its left side; B,C: Symmetry is retained by a further left turn in the anterior head region and a compensating right turn in the rest of the body. D,E: Growth of the optic tract leading to the optic chiasm. Colors refer to early embryo: Red=right side, blue=left side, black=dorsal, white=ventral]]

The '''Axial Twist Theory''' was designed to explain how the pattern of contralateral organization, decussations and chiasms develops, and why this pattern is evolutionary stable.&lt;ref name="Lussanet2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lussanet2015"&gt;{{

PMID=25528610|
url=https://peerj.com/preprints/432v3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary stability is truly remarkable, given that there are no known exceptions throughout the 500 million years of vertebrate evolution. According to the theory, the contralateral organization develops as follows. The early embryo is turned onto its left side, such that its left is turned to the yolk and its right is turned away from the yolk. This asymmetric orientation is compensated by asymmetric growth to regain superficial bilateral symmetry. The anterior head region turns to the left, as shown in the schema. The forebrain is not a superficial structure, but it is so intimately associated with superficial body structures that it turns along with the anterior head. These structures will later form the eyes, nostrils and mouth.

The body behind the head compensates the asymmetric body orientation in the opposite direction, by turning to the right (see schema). Due to these oppositely directed compensations of the anterior head and the rest of the body, the animal becomes twisted.

The Optic tract grows from the retina to the optic tectum, as dorsal and ventral are inverted in the anterior head region, the tracts grow at first to the ventral side to meet in the midline to form a chiasma. Since the opic tectum lies on the dorsal midbrain, each tract then continues dorsally to the contralateral optic tectum.

The heart and bowels are internal organs with no strong integration in external body structures, so there is no evolutionary pressure to make them turn also. Rather, these organs retain their original asymmetric orientation in the body.

==== Somatic twist theory ====

The idea of a somatic twist was inspired by the [[inversion (evolutionary biology)|dorsoventral inversion hypothesis]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=A. Francis |title=Why are the great motor and sensory tracts of the central nervous system crossed? |journal=The Dublin Journal of Medical Science|date=1907 |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.1007/BF02972358 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02972358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne78"&gt;{{

first=M.|
last=Kinsbourne|
title=Asymmetrical function of the brain|
publisher=Cambridge University Press|
location=Cambridge|
page=5|
year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was worked out by [[Marcel Kinsbourne]].&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne13" /&gt;

According to the dorsoventral inversion hypothesis, an ancestral [[deuterostome]] turned on its back. As a result, vertebrates have a dorsal nervous system whereas [[protostomes]] have a ventral one. According to the somatic twist hypothesis, not the entire animal turned on its back but just the ″somatic″ part, i.e., everything behind the eyes, mouth and nostrils, including the forebrain.

==== Comparing Inversion, Somatic twist and Axial twist ====

The three theories are closely related. The '''Somatic twist''' hypothesis was proposed as an improvement to the '''Inversion''' hypothesis, and thus has a much wider explanatory power than its predecessor. It not only explains the inversion of the body but additionally the contralateral forebrain. The '''Axial twist''' theory was defined independently of the other two. In addition to the inverted body and the contralateral forebrain it explains why the heart and bowels are asymmetric. Moreover, it is the only of the three that is supported by evidence from embryological growth.&lt;ref name="lussanet2015" /&gt;

== Evolution ==

A remarkable property of the contralateral organization is that it is present in every vertebrate. Even the most distant clades [[agnathans]] possess an optic chiasm,&lt;ref name="Nieuwenhuys1998" /&gt; and even the skull impressions of early vertebrates from the [[Ordovician]] show the presence of an optic chiasm:&lt;ref name="Janvier96" &gt;{{

last=Janvier|
title=Early vertebrates|
publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford University Press|
location=New York|
isbn=0198540477|
year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; this idea was worked out by Kinsbourne.&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne13"/&gt; 
There is molecular evidence for the inversion hypothesis in almost all groups of deuterostomes. It is not known, however, what exactly was the selective pressure that caused the inversion. Twisting and asymmetric development are well known from other deuterostomians such as [[Hemichordata]], [[Echinodermata]], [[Cephalochordata]] and [[Tunicata]]. Turning in the side or upside-down also occurs frequently in these clades.

== Developmental malformations ==

In [[holoprosencephaly]] the hemispheres of the cerebrum or part of it are not aligned on the left and right side but on the frontal and  occipital side of the skull, and usually remains very small. According to the axial twist hypothesis, this represents an extreme case of [[Yakovlevian torque]],&lt;ref name="Toga"&gt;{{

may occur when the cerebrum does not turn during early embryology.

Cephalopagus or janiceps twins are [[conjoined twin]]s which are born with two faces, one on either side of the head. These twins have two brains and two spinal chords, but these are located on the left and the right side of the body.&lt;ref name="Viggiano02"&gt;{{

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born on 15 December 1923, at [[Crowthorne]] in [[Berkshire]], Dyson is the son of the English composer [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]], who was later knighted. His mother had a law degree, and after Dyson was born she worked as a social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/quarkpark_dyson.php |title=The Scientist as Rebel |access-date=5 December 2017}} Wild River Review Interview by Joy E. Stocke&lt;/ref&gt; Although not known to be related to the early 20th-century astronomer [[Frank Watson Dyson]], as a small boy Dyson was aware of him and has credited the popularity of an astronomer sharing his surname with helping to spark his own interest in science.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson. From Eros to Gaia 1992 p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five he calculated the number of atoms in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |medium=Video |title=Greatest Mysteries of the Cold War: America's Interplanetary Spaceship (Project Orion) |publisher=BBC Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he showed an interest in large numbers and in the solar system, and was strongly influenced by the book ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' by [[Eric Temple Bell]].&lt;ref name=wired20140331 /&gt; Politically, Dyson says he was "brought up as a socialist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ghodsee | first = Kristen | year = 2015 | title = The Left Side of History: World War II and the Unfulfilled Promise of Communism in Eastern Europe | location = Durham, NC | publisher = Duke University Press | page = 5 | isbn = 978-0-822-35823-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1936 to 1941, Dyson was a Scholar at [[Winchester College]], where his father was Director of Music. At age 17 he studied mathematics with [[G.H. Hardy]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (where he won a scholarship at age 15) and at age 19 was assigned to war work in the [[Operations research#Second World War|Operational Research Section]] (ORS) of the Royal Air Force's [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]],&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=Freeman|title=A Failure of Intelligence|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/406789/a-failure-of-intelligence/|website=MIT Technology Review Magazine|publisher=MIT Technology Review|access-date=20 October 2013|date=1 November 2006|quote=Prominent physicist Freeman Dyson recalls the time he spent developing analytical methods to help the British Royal Air Force bomb German targets during World War II.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed analytical methods to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; After the war, Dyson was readmitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;''Fractals in Physics: Essays in Honour of Benoit B. Mandelbrot : Proceedings of the International Conference Honouring Benoit B. Mandelbrot on His 65th Birthday, Vence, France, 1–4 October 1989'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in mathematics.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeman Dyson|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/dyson/|website=Institute for Advanced Study, School of Natural Sciences|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1946 to 1949, he was a [[Fellow]] of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who resigned his professorship in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (10 Nov 2011) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/what-can-you-really-know/?pagination=false "What Can You Really Know"], [[New York Review of Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Dyson published two papers in [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Approximation to Algebraic Numbers by Rationals," Acta Mathematica (Uppsala), 89, 1947, pp. 225–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"On Simultaneous Diophantine Approximations," Proceedings of the London
Mathematical Society, Series 2, 49, 1947, pp. 409–420.&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and colleagues describe him as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends find refreshing but his intellectual opponents find exasperating. "I have the sense that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice", [[Steven Weinberg]] said of him. His friend, the neurologist and author [[Oliver Sacks]], said: "A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life."&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dawidoff |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=magazine |title=The Civil Heretic |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|reason=How does the following pertain to character?|date=November 2013}}

===Career in the United States===
On [[G. I. Taylor]]'s advise and recommendation, Dyson moved to the United States in 1947 as a Commonwealth Fellow to earn a physics doctorate with [[Hans Bethe]] at [[Cornell University]] (1947–48).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |interviewer=Finn Aaserud |title=Freeman Dyson |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4585 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |location=Princeton, New Jersey |date=17 December 1986 |work=Oral History Interviews }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = QED and the Men Who Made It|last = Schweber|first = Silvan S.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Princeton, NJ|pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=61n5dE7FJQgC&amp;pg=492 392ff]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week, however, he had made the acquaintance of [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlaPLvETBug|title = Freeman Dyson: A 'Rebel' Without a Ph.D|last = |first = |date = 11 June 2015|language = |at = Event at 1:17 |publisher = Quanta Magazine|access-date = 20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budding English physicist recognized the brilliance of the flamboyant American, and attached himself as quickly as possible. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (1948–49), before returning to England (1949–51), where he was a research fellow at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |publisher=The American Institute of Physics |access-date=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017131442/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson never got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree.

In 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two then-current formulations of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED): [[Richard Feynman]]'s diagrams and the operator method developed by [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The radiation theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman|journal=Phys.

He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool, but a physical theory, and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the [[renormalization]] problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Oppenheimer rewarded Dyson with a lifetime appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study, "for proving me wrong", in Oppenheimer's words.&lt;ref name="Dyson, F.J. 1979"/&gt;

Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the [[Dyson series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The S matrix in quantum electrodynamics|journal=[[Phys. Rev.]]|volume=75|pages=1736–1755|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.1736|issue=11|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75.1736D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this paper that inspired [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]] to derive his celebrated [[Ward–Takahashi identity#The Ward identity|Ward identity]].&lt;ref name="qeid-jw-1950"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J. C. Ward|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=78|page=182|year=1950|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..182W |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.78.182|title=An Identity in Quantum Electrodynamics|issue=2 }}. [Note: this Ward letter opens with "It has been recently proven by Dyson&amp;nbsp;..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Dyson joined the faculty at Cornell as a physics professor, although still lacking a doctorate, and in 1953, he received a permanent post at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he has now lived for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; In 1957, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States and renounced his [[British nationality law|British nationality]]. One reason he gave decades later is that his children born in the United States had not been recognized as British subjects.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abjure" /&gt;

From 1957 to 1961, he worked on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], which proposed the possibility of space-flight using [[nuclear pulse propulsion]]. A prototype was demonstrated using [[Explosive material|conventional explosives]], but the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|Partial Test Ban Treaty]], in which Dyson was involved and supported, permitted only [[underground nuclear weapons testing]], so the project was abandoned.

In 1958, he led the design team for the [[TRIGA]], a small, inherently safe [[nuclear reactor]] used throughout the world in hospitals and universities for the production of [[Isotopes in medicine|medical isotopes]].

A seminal paper by Dyson came in 1966, when, together with Andrew Lenard and independently of [[Elliott H. Lieb]] and [[Walter Thirring]], he proved rigorously that the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] plays the main role in the stability of bulk matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson, A. Lenard|journal=[[J. Math. Phys.]]|volume=8|issue=3|pages=423–434|year=1967|doi=10.1063/1.1705209|title=Stability of Matter.

In [[condensed matter physics]], Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the [[Ising model]] in 1 dimension and [[spin wave]]s.&lt;ref name=SelectedPapers&gt;F. J. Dyson, E. H. Lieb, ''Selected papers by Freeman Dyson'', AMS (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and [[Random matrix|random matrices]].&lt;ref name="SelectedPapers" /&gt; There is an interesting story involving random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture|pair correlation conjecture]] concerning the distribution of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. He showed his formula to the mathematician [[Atle Selberg]] who said it looked like something in [[mathematical physics]] and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the [[pair correlation function]] of the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]], which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the [[distribution of primes]] 2,3,5,7,11,&amp;nbsp; ... and the energy levels in the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[heavy elements]] such as [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Derbyshire]], ''[[Prime Obsession]]'', 2004, {{ISBN|0309085497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1979, Dyson worked with the [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities|Institute for Energy Analysis]] on [[Climatology|climate studies]]. This group, under the direction of [[Alvin Weinberg]], pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, he worked on climate studies conducted by the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] defense advisory group.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|access-date=2011-12-19|title=InterViews Freeman Dyson|date=2004-07-23|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035534/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Dyson joined the board of the [[Solar Electric Light Fund]]. {{As of|2003}} he was president of the [[Space Studies Institute]], the space research organization founded by [[Gerard K.

Dyson has won numerous scientific awards but never a [[Nobel Prize]]. Nobel physics laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] has said that the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel committee]] has "fleeced" Dyson, but Dyson himself remarked in 2009, "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years. That wasn't my style."&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; Dyson is a regular contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.

In 2012, he published (with [[William H. Press]]) a fundamental new result about the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] in [[PNAS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/16/1206569109.full.pdf+html "Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent"].

===Family===
With his first wife, the Swiss mathematician [[Verena Huber-Dyson]], Dyson had two children, [[Esther Dyson|Esther]] and [[George Dyson (science historian)|George]]. In 1958, he married Imme Jung, a [[Masters athletics (track and field)|masters runner]], and they had four more children, Dorothy, Mia, Rebecca, and Emily Dyson.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson's eldest daughter, Esther, is a digital technology consultant and investor; she has been called "the most influential woman in all the computer world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26858383 |title=Esther Dyson: Breaking through tech's glass ceiling|last=McKelvey|first=Tara|date=27 May 2014|access-date=11 February 2017|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son George is a [[history of science|historian of science]],&lt;ref&gt;See excerpt from [http://www.edge.org/documents/digerati/Dyson.html Digerati: Encounters with the Cyber Elite] by John Brockman (HardWired Books, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; one of whose books is ''[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)#note-0|Project Orion]]: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965''.

==Concepts==

===Biotechnology and genetic engineering===
{{quote|My book ''[[The Sun, the Genome and the Internet|The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet]]'' (1999) describes a vision of green technology enriching villages all over the world and halting the migration from villages to megacities. The three components of the vision are all essential: the sun to provide energy where it is needed, the genome to provide plants that can convert sunlight into chemical fuels cheaply and efficiently, the Internet to end the intellectual and economic isolation of rural populations. With all three components in place, every village in Africa could enjoy its fair share of the blessings of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.

Dyson cheerfully admits his record as a prophet is mixed, but "it is better to be wrong than to be vague."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1999) ''The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet''&lt;/ref&gt;

"To answer the world's material needs, technology has to be not only beautiful but also cheap."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Greening of the Galaxy" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Origin of Life''===
Dyson favors the dual origin concept: Life first formed cells, then enzymes, and finally, much later, genes. This was first propounded by the Russian [[Alexander Oparin]].&lt;ref&gt;Oparin, A. I. ''The Origin of Life'', Moscow Worker publisher, 1924 (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] developed the same theory independently.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of Life'', J.B.S.Haldane, The Rationalist Annual, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson has simplified things by saying simply that life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. He regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process, because of the biochemistry. Current cells contain [[adenosine triphosphate]] or ATP and [[adenosine 5'-monophosphate]] or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposes that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication were invented accidentally because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggests that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]]'s experiment and produced RNA.

Unfortunately there is no direct evidence for the dual origin concept, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these "little city economies" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''Origins of Life,,. Second Edition'', Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dyson rings.PNG|thumb|Artist's concept of Dyson rings, forming a stable [[Dyson Sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson swarm]], or "Dyson sphere"]]

===Dyson sphere===
{{Main|Dyson sphere}}
{{quote|One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |title=Freeman Dyson: Imagine … |interviewer=Monte Davis |date=October 1978 |work=[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]] |access-date=2006-12-17 |deadurl=usurped |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981207065016/http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |archivedate=1998-12-07 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1960, Dyson wrote a short paper for the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', titled "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation| doi=10.1126/science.131.3414.1667| journal=Science| volume= 131| pages= 1667–1668| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| date=3 June 1960| issue=3414| pmid=17780673| bibcode= 1960Sci...131.1667D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he theorized that a technologically advanced [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilization]] might completely surround its native star with artificial structures in order to maximize the capture of the star's available energy. Eventually, the civilization would completely enclose the star, intercepting [[electromagnetic radiation]] with wavelengths from visible light downwards and radiating waste heat outwards as [[infrared]] radiation. Therefore, one method of [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|searching for extraterrestrial civilizations]] would be to look for large objects radiating in the infrared range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Dyson conceived that such structures would be clouds of [[asteroid]]-sized [[space habitat]]s, though [[science fiction]] writers have preferred a solid structure: either way, such an artifact is often called a [[Dyson sphere]], although Dyson used the term "shell". Dyson says that he used the term "artificial biosphere" in the article meaning a habitat, not a shape.&lt;ref&gt;20 minutes into [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=350379535220823176&amp;q=genome a video]&lt;/ref&gt; The general concept of such an energy-transferring shell had been advanced decades earlier by author [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his 1937 novel ''[[Star Maker]]'', a source that Dyson has credited publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Living Through Four Revolutions |first = Freeman | last = Dyson | event = Perimeter Institute Public Lecture Series | location = Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | date = 1 June 2011 | url = https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/living-through-four-revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 211, "Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere. In fact, I took the idea from Olaf Stapledon, one of their own colleagues"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson tree===
{{Main|Dyson tree}}

Dyson has also proposed the creation of a ''Dyson tree'', a [[genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] plant capable of growing on a [[comet]]. He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a breathable atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer [[Solar System]].

{{quote|Plants could grow greenhouses ... just as turtles grow shells and polar bears grow fur and polyps build coral reefs in tropical seas. These plants could keep warm by the light from a distant Sun and conserve the oxygen that they produce by photosynthesis. The greenhouse would consist of a thick skin providing thermal insulation, with small transparent windows to admit sunlight. Outside the skin would be an array of simple lenses, focusing sunlight through the windows into the interior ... Groups of greenhouses could grow together to form extended habitats for other species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish&gt;Dyson, FJ, "Warm-blooded plants and freeze-dried fish: the future of space exploration.

===Space colonies===
{{quote|I've done some historical research on the costs of the Mayflower's voyage, and on the Mormons' emigration to Utah, and I think it's possible to go into space on a much smaller scale. A cost on the order of $40,000 per person [1978 dollars, $143,254 in 2013 dollars] would be the target to shoot for; in terms of real wages, that would make it comparable to the colonization of America. Unless it's brought down to that level it's not really interesting to me, because otherwise it would be a luxury that only governments could afford.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

Dyson has been interested in space travel since he was a child, reading such [[science fiction]] classics as [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Star Maker]]''. As a young man, he worked for [[General Atomics]] on the nuclear-powered [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion]] spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, Saturn by 1970. He's been unhappy for a quarter-century about how the government conducts space travel:
{{quote|The problem is, of course, that they can't afford to fail. The rules of the game are that you don't take a chance, because if you fail, then probably your whole program gets wiped out.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

He still hopes for cheap space travel, but is resigned to waiting for private entrepreneurs to develop something new and inexpensive.

{{quote|No law of physics or biology forbids cheap travel and settlement all over the solar system and beyond. But it is impossible to predict how long this will take. Predictions of the dates of future achievements are notoriously fallible. My guess is that the era of cheap unmanned missions will be the next fifty years, and the era of cheap manned missions will start sometime late in the twenty-first century.

Any affordable program of manned exploration must be centered in biology, and its time frame tied to the time frame of biotechnology; a hundred years, roughly the time it will take us to learn to grow warm-blooded plants, is probably reasonable.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

Dyson also proposed the use of bioengineered space colonies to colonize the Kuiper Belt on the outer edge of our Solar System. He proposed that habitats could be grown from space hardened spores. The colonies could then be warmed by large reflector plant leaves that could focus the dim, distant sunlight back on the growing colony. This was illustrated by Pat Rawlings on the cover of the National Space Society's Ad Astra magazine.

===Space exploration===
{{quote|A direct search for life in Europa's ocean would today be prohibitively expensive. Impacts on Europa give us an easier way to look for evidence of life there. Every time a major impact occurs on Europa, a vast quantity of water is splashed from the ocean into the space around Jupiter. Some of the water evaporates, and some condenses into snow. Creatures living in the water far enough from the impact have a chance of being splashed intact into space and quickly freeze-dried. Therefore, an easy way to look for evidence of life in Europa's ocean is to look for freeze-dried fish in the ring of space debris orbiting Jupiter.

Freeze-dried fish orbiting Jupiter is a fanciful notion, but nature in the biological realm has a tendency to be fanciful. Nature is usually more imaginative than we are. ... To have the best chance of success, we should keep our eyes open for all possibilities.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

===Dyson's eternal intelligence===
{{Main|Dyson's eternal intelligence}}
Dyson's proposal that intelligent beings may be capable of thinking an infinite number of thoughts in an open/ expanding universe.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, [http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/dyson.txt "Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe,"] ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', Vol. 51, Issue 3 (July 1979), pp. 447-460; {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson's transform===
{{Main|Dyson's transform}}
Dyson also has some credits in pure mathematics. His concept "Dyson's transform" led to one of the most important [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] of [[Olivier Ramaré]]'s theorem that every even integer can be written as a sum of no more than six primes.

===Dyson series===
The [[Dyson series]], the formal solution of an explicitly time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] by iteration, and the corresponding Dyson time-ordering operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T\,,&lt;/math&gt; an entity of basic importance in the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], are also named after Dyson.

[[File:Freeman dyson.jpg|thumb|upright|Freeman Dyson in 2007 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] ]]

===Quantum physics and prime numbers===
Dyson and [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] discovered together an intriguing connection between quantum physics and [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture]] about the zeros of the Zeta function. The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... are described by the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = Freeman J. | year = 1962 | title = A Brownian?Motion Model for the Eigenvalues of a Random Matrix | url = | journal = J. Math. Phys. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| page = 1191 | doi = 10.1063/1.1703862 |bibcode = 1962JMP.....3.1191D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What Montgomery and Dyson discovered is that the ''[[eigenvalues]]'' of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the Zeta function. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his  [[Odlyzko–Schönhage algorithm]] to calculate many zeros. Dyson recognized this connection because of a number-theory question Montgomery asked him. Dyson had published results in [[number theory]] in 1947, while a Fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and so was able to understand Montgomery's question. If Montgomery had not been visiting the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] that week, this connection might not have been discovered.

There are in nature one, two, and three dimensional [[quasicrystals]]. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose [[Fourier transform]] is also a set of discrete points. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has done extensive computations of the Fourier transform of the nontrivial zeros of the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and they seem to form a one dimensional quasicrystal. This would in fact follow from the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, Selected papers, 1990-2014, pp. 41–42, World Scientific, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Metaphysics===
Dyson has suggested a kind of cosmic metaphysics of [[mind]]. In his book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'' he writes about three levels of mind: "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level is the level of elementary physical processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is ... constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. ... The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. ... [I]t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. If we believe in this mental component and call it God, then we can say that we are small pieces of God's mental apparatus" (p.&amp;nbsp;297).

===Climate change===
Dyson agrees that anthropogenic [[global warming]] exists. While he agrees that "[one] of the main causes of warming is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from our burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal and natural gas",&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dysonf07/dysonf07_index.html|publisher=Edge|title=Heretical Thoughts about Science and Society|date=8 August 2007|author=Freeman Dyson|access-date=2007-09-05}}dl&lt;/ref&gt; he believes that existing simulation models of climate fail to account for some important factors, and hence the results will contain too much error to reliably predict future trends:

{{quote|The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics, and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans. They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests. They do not begin to describe the real world we live in&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;}}

and, in 2009:

{{quote|What has happened in the past 10 years is that the discrepancies between what's observed and what's predicted have become much stronger. It's clear now the models are wrong, but it wasn't so clear 10 years ago.&lt;ref name=dy8&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/11/freeman_dyson_interview/ "Top boffin Freeman Dyson on climate change, interstellar travel, fusion, and more"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[The Register]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He is among signatories of a letter to the UN criticizing the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |title=Don't fight, adapt |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |dead-url=yes |access-date=19 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911074152/http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |archivedate=11 September 2016 |df=dmy }} Open Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

"[H]eretics who question the dogmas are needed&amp;nbsp; ... I am proud to be a heretic. The world always needs heretics to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies."&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;

Dyson says his views on global warming have been strongly criticized. In reply, he notes that "[m]y objections to the global warming propaganda are not so much over the technical facts, about which I do not know much, but it's rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have."&lt;ref name=e360&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090608114821/http://www.e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2151 "Freeman Dyson Takes On The Climate Establishment"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[Yale University]]'s ''Environment 360''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he endorsed the now common usage of "global warming" as synonymous with global anthropogenic climate change, referring to "measurements that transformed global warming from a vague theoretical speculation into a precise observational science."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (12 June 2008) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21494 "The Question of Global Warming"], The New York Review of Books. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has, however, argued that political efforts to reduce the causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority:

In an opinion piece in the Boston Globe of 3 Dec 2015 he wrote,

{{quote|[T]he environmental movement [has been] hijacked by a bunch of climate fanatics, who have captured the attention of the public with scare stories. ...

China and India have a simple choice to make. Either they get rich [by burning prodigious quantities of coal and causing] a major increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or they stay poor. I hope they choose to get rich. ...

The good news is that the main effect of carbon dioxide ... is to make the planet greener, [by] feeding the growth of green plants of all kinds [and] increasing the fertility of farms and fields and forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyson|first1=Freeman|title=Misunderstandings, questionable beliefs mar Paris climate talks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/12/03/freeman-dyson-misunderstandings-questionable-beliefs-mar-paris-climate-talks/vG3oBrbmcZlv2m22DTNjMP/story.html|access-date=7 December 2015|publisher=''Boston Globe''|date=3 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since originally taking interest in climate studies in the 1970s, Dyson has suggested that [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the atmosphere could be controlled by planting fast-growing trees. He calculates that it would take a trillion trees to remove all carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, "Can we control the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?", Energy, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1977, Pages 287–291. {{doi|10.1016/0360-5442(77)90033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;

In a 2014 interview, he said that "What I'm convinced of is that we don't understand climate ...  It will take a lot of very hard work before that question is settled."&lt;ref name=wired20140331&gt;

===Nuclear winter===
From his 1988 book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'', he offered some criticism of then current models predicting a devastating [[nuclear winter]] in the event of a large-scale nuclear war:

{{quote|As a scientist I want to rip the theory of nuclear winter apart, but as a human being I want to believe it.  This is one of the rare instances of a genuine conflict between the demands of science and the demands of humanity.  As a scientist, I judge the nuclear winter theory to be a sloppy piece of work, full of gaps and unjustified assumptions.  As a human being, I hope fervently that it is right.  Here is a real and uncomfortable dilemma.  What does a scientist do when science and humanity pull in opposite directions?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Freeman J. Dyson|title=Infinite in All Directions: Gifford Lectures Given at Aberdeen, Scotland April—November 1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca3OH0a4tZoC&amp;pg=PA259|access-date=8 October 2011|date=22 July 2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-072889-2|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Warfare and weapons===

At the [[British Bomber Command]], Dyson and colleagues proposed removing two gun turrets from the RAF [[Lancaster bomber]]s, to cut the catastrophic losses due to German fighters in the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Battle of Berlin]]. A Lancaster without turrets could fly {{convert|50|mph|-1|abbr=on}} faster and be much more maneuverable.

{{quote|All our advice to the commander in chief [went] through the chief of our section, who was a career civil servant. His guiding principle was to tell the commander in chief things that the commander in chief liked to hear ... To push the idea of ripping out gun turrets, against the official mythology of the gallant gunner defending his crew mates ... was not the kind of suggestion the commander in chief liked to hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Children's Crusade" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On hearing the news of the bombing of [[Hiroshima]]:

{{quote|I agreed emphatically with [[Henry Stimson]]. Once we had got ourselves into the business of bombing cities, we might as well do the job competently and get it over with. I felt better that morning than I had felt for years ... Those fellows who had built the atomic bombs obviously knew their stuff ... Later, much later, I would remember [the downside].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Blood of a Poet" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|I am convinced that to avoid nuclear war it is not sufficient to be afraid of it. It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand. And the first step in understanding is to recognize that the problem of nuclear war is basically not technical but human and historical. If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the [[Vietnam War]]. When a general said in a meeting, "I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Ethics of Defense" in ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, ''Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia'', published by the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], was obtained, with some redactions, by the [[Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability]] under the [[Freedom of Information act]] in 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Dyson, R. Gomer, S. Weinberg, S.C. Wright [http://nautilus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tactical_nukes_vietnam.pdf "Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia"] (March 1967) [declassified December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the [[Dick Cavett show]] that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because "our targets were large and theirs were small." (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.)

Dyson opposed the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]]. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 US presidential election]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described him as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]].&lt;ref name=civil /&gt; He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote a strongly supportive letter to Obama regarding his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.&lt;ref name = "29 support letter"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Broad | first = William J. | date = 8 August 2015 | title = 29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html | work = The New York Times | access-date = 9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil defence===
While teaching for a few weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defence authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]], since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) "Shelters" in ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of failure===
{{quote|You can't possibly get a good technology going without an enormous number of failures. It's a universal rule. If you look at [[bicycles]], there were thousands of weird models built and tried before they found the one that really worked. You could never design a bicycle theoretically. Even now, after we've been building them for 100 years, it's very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works – it's even difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial and error, we found out how to do it, and the error was essential.&lt;ref name=BrandInterview&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/dyson.html?pg=7&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= Interview by Stewart Brand, February 1998]. [[Wired.com]] (2009-01-04). Retrieved on January 07, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===On English academics===
{{quote|My view of the prevalence of doom-and-gloom in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] is that it is a result of the English class system.  In England there were always two sharply opposed middle classes, the academic middle class and the commercial middle class. In the nineteenth century, the academic middle class won the battle for power and status.  As a child of the academic middle class, I learned to look on the commercial middle class with loathing and contempt.  Then came the triumph of [[Margaret Thatcher]], which was also the revenge of the commercial middle class.  The academics lost their power and prestige and the business people took over. The academics never forgave Thatcher and have been gloomy ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703082513/http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 July 2007|

===Science and religion===
He is a [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational Christian]] and has attended various churches from [[Presbyterian]] to [[Roman Catholic]]. Regarding doctrinal or [[Christological]] issues, he has said, "I am neither a saint nor a theologian. To me, good works are more important than theology."&lt;ref name="edge68.html"&gt;{{cite speech |url=https://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge68.html |author= Freeman Dyson |event=Templeton Prize Lecture |title=Progress In Religion |via=[[Edge.org]] |date=15 March 2000 |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Science and religion are two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here. The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.

Trouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.&lt;ref name="edge68.html" /&gt;}}

Dyson partially disagrees with the famous remark by his fellow physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] that "With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion."&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html"&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion from the Outside |author=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19090 |date=22 June 2006 |work=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Weinberg's statement is true as far as it goes, but it is not the  whole truth. To make it the whole truth, we must add an additional clause: "And for bad people to do good things—that [also] takes religion." The main point of Christianity is that it is a religion for sinners. Jesus made that very clear. When the Pharisees asked his disciples, "Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?" he said, "I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance." Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things.&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html" /&gt;}}

While Dyson has labeled himself a Christian, he identifies himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Back to Hell |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781591608158 |author=Moses Gbenu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8aLHpyW7vEC&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=110 |quote=The cash part of this award is over $1 million.

Filmore, son of the founder of the mind-science cult, Unity. |access-date=15 February 2014 |date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Species of Origins: America's Search for a Creation Story |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9780742507654 |author1=Karl Giberson |author2=Donald A. Yerxa |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BXt7khUslccC&amp;pg=PA141 |page=141 |quote=Dyson is not a hard-nosed materialist and, in fact, criticizes his colleagues who champion that viewpoint. Officially, he calls himself an agnostic, but his writings make it clear that his agnosticism is tinged with something akin to deism. |access-date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, here is a passage from Dyson's review of ''The God of Hope and the End of the World'' from [[John Polkinghorne]]:

{{quote|I am myself a Christian, a member of a community that preserves an ancient heritage of great literature and great music, provides help and counsel to young and old when they are in trouble, educates children in moral responsibility, and worships God in its own fashion. But I find Polkinghorne's theology altogether too narrow for my taste. I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian. To me, to worship God means to recognize that mind and intelligence are woven into the fabric of our universe in a way that altogether surpasses our comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science &amp; Religion: No Ends in Sight |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/mar/28/science-religion-no-ends-in-sight/ |work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=30 July 2012|author=Freeman Dyson|date=28 March 2002|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] criticized Dyson for accepting the religious [[Templeton Prize]] in 2000; "It would be taken as an endorsement of religion by one of the world's most distinguished physicists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Bantam Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-61868-000-9|page=152|title-link=The God Delusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dyson declared in 2000 that he is a (non-denominational) Christian,&lt;ref name="edge68.html"/&gt; and he has disagreed with Dawkins on several occasions, as when he criticized Dawkins' understanding of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=John Brockman |url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/dawkins_dyson.html |title=Richard Dawkins—Freeman Dyson: an exchange |year=2007 |website=[[Edge.org]]|access-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1814">'''Georg Kühlewind''', birth name ''György Székely'' (March 6, 1924 – January 15, 2006) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] philosopher, writer, lecturer and meditation teacher, who worked from the tradition of [[Rudolf Steiner]]’s [[spiritual science]]. Setting aside his early interest in music and psychology, he pursued a successful professional career as a physical chemist. Meanwhile, he continued to deepen his spiritual practice and insights. A prolific author (most of whose works are still untranslated from German), Kühlewind spent much time traveling the world, lecturing and leading workshops and seminars in [[meditation]], [[psychology]], [[epistemology]], [[child development]], [[anthroposophy]], and [[esoteric Christianity]]. He was the author of numerous books.

The '''Georgia Guidestones''' are a [[granite]] monument erected in 1980 in [[Elbert County, Georgia|Elbert County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in the United States. A set of 10 guidelines is inscribed on the structure in eight modern languages and a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in four ancient language scripts.

The monument stands at an approximate elevation of {{Convert|750|feet}} above [[sea level]], about {{convert|90|mi|km}} east of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], {{convert|45|mi|km}} from [[Athens, Georgia]] and {{convert|9|mi|km}} north of the center of the city of [[Elberton, Georgia|Elberton]].  

One slab stands in the center, with four arranged around it. A [[Coping (architecture)|capstone]] lies on top of the five slabs, which are astronomically aligned. An additional stone tablet, which is set in the ground a short distance to the west of the structure, provides some notes on the history and purpose of the guidestones. The structure is sometimes referred to as an "American [[Stonehenge]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/set/OVERhenges.html|title=America Unhenged|work=RoadsideAmerica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument is {{convert|19|ft|3|in|m}} tall, made from six granite slabs weighing {{convert|237746|lb|kg}} in all.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/17-05/ff_guidestones?currentPage=1|title=American Stonehenge: Monumental Instructions for the Post-Apocalypse|first=Randall|last=Sullivan|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|volume=17|number=5|date=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymity of the guidestones' authors and their apparent advocacy of [[Human population planning|population control]], [[eugenics]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], have made them a target for controversy and [[conspiracy theory]]. 

==History==
In June 1979, a man using the [[pseudonym]] Robert C. Christian approached the Elberton Granite Finishing Company on behalf of "a small group of loyal Americans", and commissioned the structure. Christian explained that the stones would function as a compass, calendar and clock, and should be capable of withstanding catastrophic events. Joe Fendley of Elberton Granite assumed that Christian was "a nut" and attempted to discourage him by giving a quote several times higher than any project the company had taken, explaining that the guidestones would require additional tools and consultants. Christian accepted the quote.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt; When arranging payment, Christian explained that he represented a group which had been planning the guidestones for 20 years, and which intended to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt;

Christian delivered a scale model of the guidestones and ten pages of specifications.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt; The five-acre&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt; (2&amp;nbsp;ha) land was apparently purchased by Christian on October 1, 1979,&lt;ref&gt;[http://64.234.218.46/cgi-bin/ga_elbert_display.cgi?KEY=027%20%20%20%20018&amp; Land parcel information]{{DL|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://64.234.218.46/ga_elbert.html?parcel=027%20%20%20%20018&amp;extent=435156+1539017+437200+1541261&amp;layers=roads+parcel_sales Parcel map]{{DL|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2014}} from farm owner Wayne Mullinex.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt; Mullinex and his children were given lifetime cattle grazing rights on the guidestones site.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt; The monument was unveiled on March 22, 1980, before an audience variously described as 100&lt;ref name="Moran-2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moran|first1=Mark McGuire|last2=Sceurman| first2=Mark| title=Weird U.S.|date=2004|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=0-7607-5043-2|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 400 people.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009" /&gt; Christian later transferred ownership of the land and the guidestones to Elbert County.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt;

[[File:Georgia Guidestones vandalism.jpg|thumb|left|The stones defaced with polyurethane paint and graffiti]]

In 2008, the stones were defaced with [[polyurethane]] paint and graffiti with slogans such as "Death to the new world order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b298/DeDCaT/l_84bf2b7691aa4733ac3e013e6cd7866c.jpg|title=Defacement of the Guidestones|via=Photobucket|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine called the defacement  "the first serious act of vandalism in the guidestones' history".&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt; In September 2014, an employee of the Elbert County maintenance department contacted the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] when the stones were vandalized with graffiti including the phrase "I Am [[Isis]], goddess of love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2014-09-08/vandals-deface-mysterious-georgia-guidestones-elbert-county|title=Vandals deface mysterious Georgia Guidestones in Elbert County|author=Wayne Ford|work=Online Athens|date=8 September 2014|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear}}

==Description==
===Inscriptions===
A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eveleth|first1=Rose|title=Nobody Knows How to Interpret This Doomsday Stonehenge in Georgia|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/nobody-knows-how-to-interpret-this-doomsday-stonehenge-in-georgia-5592082/|accessdate=9 October 2017|work=Smithsonian|date=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones.&lt;!--  (see photograph of the face with the English version) --&gt; Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Traditional Chinese]], and [[Russian language|Russian]].

# Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
# Guide reproduction wisely&amp;nbsp;— improving fitness and diversity.
# Unite humanity with a living new language.
# Rule passion&amp;nbsp;— faith&amp;nbsp;— tradition&amp;nbsp;— and all things with tempered reason.

==Explanatory tablet==
[[File:Georgia Guidestones 10.jpg|thumb|An explanatory tablet is set alongside the stones]]
A few feet to the west of the monument, an additional granite ledger has been set level with the ground. This tablet identifies the structure and the languages used on it, lists various facts about the size, weight, and astronomical features of the stones, the date it was installed, and the sponsors of the project. It also speaks of a [[time capsule]] buried under the tablet, but spaces on the stone reserved for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and is to be opened have not been inscribed, so it is uncertain if the time capsule was put in place.

The complete text of the explanatory tablet is detailed below.  &lt;!--  The accompanying image shows the overall layout.--&gt;  The tablet is somewhat inconsistent with respect to punctuation, misspells the word "pseudonym", and incorrectly uses the adjective "hieroglyphic" as a plural noun. The original spelling, punctuation, and line breaks in the text have been preserved in the transcription which follows (letter case is not). At the top center of the tablet is written:

{{quote|
The Georgia Guidestones&lt;br /&gt;
Center cluster erected March 22, 1980
}}

Immediately below this is the outline of a square, inside which is written:

{{quote|
Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason
}}

Around the edges of the square are written translations to four ancient languages, one per edge. Starting from the top and proceeding clockwise, they are: [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] (in [[cuneiform]] script), [[Classical Greek]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] (in [[Egyptian hieroglyphics|hieroglyphs]]).

[[File:Georgia Guidestones 04.jpg|thumb|The guidestones' "Astronomic Features"]]

On the left side of the tablet is the following column of text:

The words appear as shown under the time capsule heading; no dates are engraved.

===Physical data===
On the right side of the tablet is the following column of text (metric conversions added):
{{quote|

===Guidestone languages===
Below the two columns of text is written the caption "GUIDESTONE LANGUAGES", with a diagram of the granite slab layout beneath it. The names of eight [[modern languages]] are inscribed along the long edges of the projecting rectangles, one per edge. Starting from due north and moving clockwise around so that the upper edge of the northeast rectangle is listed first, they are [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Hindi]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]. At the bottom center of the tablet is the following text:

{{quote|

}}

===Astronomical features===
The four outer stones are oriented to mark the limits of the 18.6 year [[Lunar standstill|lunar declination cycle]].&lt;ref name=GeorgiaMountains&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiamountains.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=156&amp;Itemid=28|title=Georgia Guidestones|work=Northeast Georgia Mountains Travel Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112220117/http://www.georgiamountains.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=156&amp;Itemid=28|archivedate=January 12, 2009|quote=The four large upright blocks pointing outward are oriented to the limits of the migration of the moon during the course of the year.|deadurl=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The center column features a hole drilled at an angle from one side to the other, through which can be seen the [[North Star]], a star whose position changes only very gradually over time. The same pillar has a slot carved through it which is aligned with the Sun's [[solstices]] and [[equinoxes]]. A {{fraction|7|8}}in (22 mm) aperture in the [[Coping (architecture)|capstone]] allows a ray of sun to pass through at noon each day, shining a beam on the center stone indicating the day of the year.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[Yoko Ono]] praised the inscribed messages  as "a stirring call to rational thinking", while ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' stated that unspecified opponents have labeled them as the "Ten Commandments of the [[Antichrist]]".&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt;

The guidestones have become a subject of interest for [[conspiracy theorists]]. One of them, an activist named [[Mark Dice]], demanded that the guidestones "be smashed into a million pieces, and then the rubble used for a construction project",&lt;ref name="Jones Elberton"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Elberton Star|title=The Georgia Guidestones: Tourist Attraction or Cult Message?|author=Gary Jones|url=http://www.elberton.com/articles/2005/05/18/news/news03.txt|date=2005-05-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421094844/http://www.elberton.com/articles/2005/05/18/news/news03.txt|archivedate=2012-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the guidestones are of "a deep [[Satanism|Satanic]] origin", and that R. C. Christian belongs to "a [[Luciferianism|Luciferian]] secret society" related to the "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]".&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009" /&gt; At the unveiling of the monument, a local minister proclaimed that he believed the monument was "for sun worshipers, for cult worship and for devil worship".&lt;ref name="Moran-2004" /&gt; Others have suggested that the stones were commissioned by the [[Rosicrucian]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Alex Jones, ''Endgame: Elite's Blueprint For Global Enslavement'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; with conspiracy theorist [[Jay Weidner]] observing that the pseudonym of the man who commissioned the stones – "R. C. Christian" – resembles [[Christian Rosenkreuz|Rose Cross Christian, or Christian Rosenkreuz]], the founder of the [[Rosicrucian Order]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009"/&gt; [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]]'s film ''Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement'' proposes that the guidestones are a harbinger of self-appointed elites who intend on exterminating most of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xQf4smeuBs | title=Endgame – Alex Jones | publisher=YouTube | date=24 December 2009 | accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely agreed-upon interpretation of the stones is that they describe the basic concepts required to rebuild a devastated civilization.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 2009" /&gt; Author [[Brad Meltzer]] notes that the stones were built in 1979 at the height of the [[Cold War]], and thus argues that they may have been intended as a message to the possible survivors of a [[nuclear war|nuclear]] [[World War III]]. The engraved suggestion to keep humanity's population below 500 million could have been made under the assumption that war had already reduced humanity below this number.&lt;ref&gt;"Apocalypse in Georgia". ''[[Brad Meltzer's Decoded]]'', episode 110 (February 3, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidestones were briefly shown and discussed in the 1986 documentary film ''[[Sherman's March (1986 film)|Sherman's March]]'', and were featured extensively in a 2012 episode of ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]'', a "Monumental Mysteries Special" featuring [[Don Wildman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelchannel.com/tv-shows/mysteries-at-the-museum/photos/monumental-mysteries Monumental Mysteries].

This is an overview of the '''[[history]] of [[theology]]''' in [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] thought and its relationship with [[Abrahamic religions]].

==Ancient Greek and Hellenistic theology ==

===Classical Greek theology ===
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Hesiod.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Hesiod]]]] --&gt;Various forms of systematic and philosophical reflection on [[Ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology]] arose in the classical period—from [[Hesiod]]'s attempts to organize the diverse materials of mythology into a unified ''[[Theogony]]'' to the more properly philosophical analysis reportedly carried out by [[Socrates]].

Influential texts include:
* [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (c. 700 BC)
* [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (c. 360 BC)
* [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' Book Lambda (c. 330 BC)

{{Main|Ancient Greek religion#Theology|l1=Ancient Greek religion, section on Theology}}

===Hellenistic theology ===
[[Image:CiceroBust.jpg|right|thumb|100px|[[Cicero]]]]
{{see also|Greek mythology#Hellenistic rationalism|l1=Greek mythology, Hellenistic rationalism|Ancient Greek religion#Theology}}
Philosophical reflection on the gods, on religion, and on the origins and governance of the Universe, flourished in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period among both Greek- and Latin-speaking thinkers.  Among the very diverse movements of Hellenistic philosophy in which theological reflection could be found were [[Skepticism]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]ism, [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Middle Platonism]], and [[Neoplatonism]].  The Skeptics were to have a larger impact on Western reasoning than the Cynics; but this would not occur until after its having been reified during the middle years of the Roman Empire when it passed into the mainstream of Western thought.

Influential texts include:
* [[Cleanthes]]' ''Hymn to Zeus'' (3rd century BC)
* [[Cicero]]'s ''[[de Natura Deorum]]'' (45 BC)
* [[Lucretius]]' ''[[On the nature of things|de Rerum Natura]]'' (1st century BC)
* [[Epictetus]]' ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Enchiridion]]'' (135)
* [[Plotinus]]' ''[[Enneads]]'' (c. 235 and after).

Hellenistic theology, which could be deemed to last until the suppression of the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Academy]] in 529 by [[Justinian I]], overlaps with early Jewish and early Christian theology (see below), and several strands of thought important particularly to early Christian thought arise within Hellenistic circles: attempts to explain the apparent caprice of the gods, [[Atheism]], the development of [[monotheism]], the idea of God as [[first cause]] or [[form of the Good]], the [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] of spirit and matter in humanity, and [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] (the release of the spirit from its material prison to a higher spiritual world) through knowledge.

==Early Jewish theology==
{{Judaism}}

===The 1st and 2nd centuries===
[[Image:Philon.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Philo]]]]Two strands of [[Jewish theology]] develop in the 1st and 2nd centuries.  On the one hand, there are those oral traditions of [[Rabbi]]nic exegesis ([[Midrash]]) and legal discussion ([[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]]) that eventually began to be written down towards the end of the 2nd century AD.

Important figures (known as [[Tannaim]]) include
* [[Hillel the Elder]] (working c. 30 BC to 10 AD)
* [[Shamai]] (c. 50 BC to 30 AD)
* [[Gamliel I]] (died c. 50)
* [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]] (1st century AD)
* [[Gamliel II]] (1st century D)
* [[Rabbi Akiva]] (c. 50 to c. 135)
* [[Simeon bar Yohai]] (2nd century AD)
* Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] (2nd century AD).

On the other hand, there is the attempt to accommodate traditional Jewish exegesis of the Jewish Scriptures and tradition with [[Greek philosophy]]—a strand of thought of which [[Philo]] (c. 20 BC to 40 AD) is the best known proponent. The destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem temple]] in 70 AD and the [[Diaspora|dispersion]] of many Jews from [[Israel]] had a profound effect on Jewish Theology.

===In the period of the Talmud ===
[[Image:V12p022a01 Talmud.jpg|left|thumb|100px|A page of [[Talmud]]]]In the centuries after its compilation, discussion and commentary upon the [[Mishnah]] flourished in Jewish academies in [[Israel]] and in [[Babylon]].  Collections of opinions from these discussions, known as [[Gemara]] were eventually edited together and placed with the Mishnah itself, in both Israel (around 350 AD – the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]) and Babylon (around 550 AD, with further editing in the two centuries that followed – the Babylonian [[Talmud]]).

Important figures (known as [[Amoraim]]) include
* Samuel of Nehardea (Shmuel) (c. 165 – c. 257)
* [[Resh Lakish]] (born c. 200)
* [[Hillel, son of Gamaliel III]] (3rd century)
* [[Abba Arika]] (Rav) (died 247)
* [[Yochanan bar Nafcha|Rabbi Yochanan]] (died c. 279)
* [[Abaye]] (278 – c. 338)
* [[Abbahu]] (died c. 320)
* [[Rav Ashi|Ashi]] (352–427)

==Early Christian theology==

===Theologies of the New Testament===
The [[New Testament]] contains evidence of some of the earliest forms of reflection upon the meanings and implications of Christian faith, mostly in the form of guidance offered to Christian congregations on how to live a life consistent with their convictions – notably in the [[paul of Tarsus|Pauline corpus]] and [[authorship of the Johannine works|Johannine corpus]].

===Patristic theology===
{{main|Patristics}}
A huge quantity of theological reflection emerged in the early centuries of the Christian church – in a wide variety of genres, in a variety of contexts, and in several languages – much of it the product of attempts to discuss how Christian faith should be lived in cultures very different from the one in which it was born.  So, for instance, a good deal of the [[Greek language]] literature can be read as an attempt to come to terms with Hellenistic culture.  The period sees the slow emergence of [[orthodoxy]] (the idea of which seems to emerge from the conflicts between [[catholic]] Christianity and [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christianity), the establishment of a [[Biblical canon]], debates about the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] (most notably between the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] in 325 and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 381), about [[Christology]] (most notably between the councils of Constantinople in 381 and  [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in 451), about the purity of the Church (for instance in the debates surrounding the [[Donatist]]s), and about [[Divine grace|grace]], [[free will]] and [[predestination]] (for instance in the debate between [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]]).

Influential texts and writers in the 2nd century include:
* The collection known as the [[Apostolic Fathers]] (mostly 2nd century)
* [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100/114 – c. 162/168)
* [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died c. 215)
* [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] (c. 130 – 202)
* Various '[[gnosticism|Gnostic]]' authors, such as [[Valentinius]] (c. 100 – c. 153) and [[Basilides]] (c. 117–138)
* Some of the texts commonly referred to as the [[New Testament apocrypha]].

Influential texts and writers between c. 200 and 325 (the [[First Council of Nicaea]]) include:
* [[Tertullian]] (c. 155–230)
* [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] (died 235)
* [[Origen]] (c. 182 – c.251)
* [[Cyprian]] (died c. 258)
* [[Arius]] (256–336)
* Other [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] texts and texts from the [[New Testament apocrypha]].
Texts from patristic authors before 325 AD are collected in the [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]].

[[Image:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]]]Influential texts and writers between 325 AD and c. 500 AD include:
* [[Athanasius]] (298–373)
* The [[Cappadocian Fathers]] (late 4th century)
* [[Ambrose]] (c. 340–397)
* [[Jerome]] (c. 347–420)
* [[Chrysostom]] (347–407)
* [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430)
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (376–444)
Texts from patristic authors after 325 AD are collected in the [[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]]. Important theological debates also surrounded the various [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Councils]] – [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] in 325, [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 381, [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] in 431 and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in 451

==Medieval Christian theology==

===Byzantine theology===
While the Western Roman Empire declined and fell, the Eastern Roman Empire, centred on Constantinople, remained standing until 1453, and was the home of a wide range of theological activity that was seen as standing in strong continuity with the theology of the Patristic period; indeed the division between Patristic and Byzantine theology would not be recognised by many Orthodox theologians and historians.

[[Image:Gregor Palamas.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Gregory Palamas]]]]

====Mystical theology====
* [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (working c. 500)
* [[Symeon the New Theologian]] (949–1022)
* [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359)

====Christological controversy after Chalcedon====
* [[Severus of Antioch]] (c. 465–518)
* [[Leontius (writer)|Leontius of Jerusalem]] (working 538–544)
* [[Maximus the Confessor]] (c. 580–682)
* [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences]]
* [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic ecclesiastical differences]]

[[Image:John-of-Damascus 01.jpg|right|thumb|100px|[[John of Damascus]]]]

====Iconoclasts and iconophiles====
* [[Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople]] (patriarch 715–730)
* [[John of Damascus]] (676–749)
* [[Theodore the Studite]] (c. 758 – c. 826)

===Western theology===

====Before the Carolingian Empire====
When the [[Roman Empire#The end of the Western Empire|Western Roman Empire fragmented]] under the impact of various 'barbarian' invasions, the Empire-wide intellectual culture that had underpinned late Patristic theology had its interconnections cut.  Theology tended to become more localised, more diverse, more fragmented.  The classically clothed Christianity preserved in Italy by men like [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] and [[Cassiodorus]] was different from the vigorous [[Franks|Frankish]] Christianity documented by [[Gregory of Tours]] which was different again from the Christianity that flourished in [[Ireland]] and [[Northumbria]] in the 7th and 8th centuries.  Throughout this period, theology tended to be a more [[monasticism|monastic]] affair, flourishing in monastic havens where the conditions and resources for theological learning could be maintained.

Important writers include:
* [[Caesarius of Arles]] (c. 468–542)
* [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] (480–524)
* [[Cassiodorus]] (c. 480 – c. 585)
* [[Pope Gregory I]] (c. 540–604)
* [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560–636)
* [[Bede]] (672–736)

====Theology in the time of Charlemagne====
Both because it made communication between different Christian centres easier, and because there was a concerted effort by its rulers to encourage educational and religious reforms and to develop greater uniformity in Christian thought and practice across their territories, the establishment of the [[Carolingian Empire]] saw an explosion of theological inquiry, and theological controversy.  Controversy flared, for instance, around 'Spanish [[Adoptionism]], around the views on predestination of [[Gottschalk (theologian)|Gottschalk]], or around the eucharistic views of [[Ratramnus]].

Important writers include:
* [[Alcuin]] (c. 735–804)
* The Spanish [[Adoptionism|Adoptionists]] [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Felix of Urgel]] and [[Elipandus]] of Toledo (late 8th century)
* [[Claudius of Turin]] (?–839)
* [[Rabanus Maurus]] (c. 780–856)
* [[Radbertus]] (c. 790–865)
* [[Ratramnus]] (died c. 868)
* [[Hincmar]] (806–882)
* [[Gottschalk (theologian)|Gottschalk]] (c. 808 – c. 867)
* [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (c. 815–877)

====Before Scholasticism====
With the division and decline of the Carolingian Empire, notable theological activity was preserved in some of the Cathedral schools that had begun to rise to prominence under it – for instance at [[Auxerre]] in the 9th century or [[Chartres]] in the 11th.  Intellectual influences from the Arabic world (including works of classical authors preserved by Islamic scholars) percolated into the Christian West via Spain, influencing such theologians as [[Gerbert of Aurillac]], who went on to become Pope Sylvester II and mentor to [[Otto III]].  (Otto was the fourth ruler of the Germanic [[Ottonian]] [[Holy Roman Empire]], successor to the Carolingian Empire).  With hindsight, one might say that a new note was struck when a controversy about the meaning of the eucharist blew up around [[Berengar of Tours]] in the 11th century: hints of a new confidence in the intellectual investigation of the faith that perhaps foreshadowed the explosion of theological argument that was to take place in the 12th century.

Notable authors include:
* [[Heiric of Auxerre]] (c. 835–887)
* [[Remigius of Auxerre]] (c. 841–908)
* [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert of Aurillac]] (c. 950–1003)
* [[Fulbert of Chartres]] (died 1028)
* [[Berengar of Tours]] (c. 999–1088)
* [[Lanfranc]] (died 1089)

====Early Scholasticism and its contemporaries====
[[Anselm of Canterbury]] is sometimes misleadingly called the 'Father of Scholasticism' because of the prominent place that reason has in his theology; instead of establishing his points by appeal to authority, he presents arguments to demonstrate why it is that the things he believes on authority must be so.  His particular approach, however, was not very influential in his time, and he kept his distance from the Cathedral Schools.  We should look instead to the production of the [[Bible gloss|gloss]] on Scripture associated with [[Anselm of Laon]], the rise to prominence of [[dialectic]] (middle subject of the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]]) in the work of Abelard, and the production by [[Peter Lombard]] of a collection of [[Sentences]] or opinions of the Church Fathers and other authorities.  Scholasticism proper can be thought of as the kind of theology that emerges when, in the Cathedral schools and their successors, the tools of [[dialectic]] are pressed into use to comment upon, explain, and develop the gloss and the sentences.

[[Image:Anselm of Canterbury.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|Anselm of Canterbury]]

Notable authors include:
* [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033/1034–1109) 
* [[Anselm of Laon]] (died 1117)
* [[Hugh of St Victor]] (1078–1151)
* [[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142)
* [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090–1153)
* [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179)
* [[Peter Lombard]] (c. 1100–1160)
* [[Joachim of Fiore]] (c. 1135–1202)

====High Scholasticism and its contemporaries====
The 13th century saw the attempted suppression of various groups perceived as heterodox, such as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] and the associated rise of the [[mendicant orders]] (notably the [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican order|Dominicans]]), in part intended as a form of orthodox alternative to the heretical groups.  Those two orders quickly became contexts for some of the most intense scholastic theology, producing such 'high scholastic' theologians as [[Alexander of Hales]] (Franciscan) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (Dominican), or the rather less obviously scholastic [[Bonaventure]] (Franciscan).  The century also saw a flourishing of [[mysticism|mystical theology]], with women such as [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]] playing a prominent role.  In addition, the century can be seen as period in which the study of natural philosophy that could anachronistically be called 'science' began once again to flourish in theological soil, in the hands of such men as [[Robert Grosseteste]] and [[Roger Bacon]].

Notable authors include:
[[Image:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Aquinas]]]]
* [[Saint Dominic]] (1170–1221)
* [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c. 1175–1253)
* [[Francis of Assisi]] (1182–1226)
* [[Alexander of Hales]] (died 1245)
* [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]] (1210–1285)
* [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294)
* [[Bonaventure]] (1221–1274)
* [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274)
* [[Angela of Foligno]] (1248–1309)

====Late Scholasticism and its contemporaries====
{{See also|Scholasticism}}
Scholastic theology continued to develop as the 13th century gave way to the fourteenth, becoming ever more complex and subtle in its distinctions and arguments.  The 14th century saw in particular the rise to dominance of the [[nominalism|nominalist]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]] theologies of men like [[William of Ockham]].  The 14th century was also a time in which movements of widely varying character worked for the reform of the institutional church, such as [[conciliarism]], [[Lollardy]] and the [[Hussite]]s.  Spiritual movements such as the [[Devotio Moderna]] also flourished.

Notable authors include:
[[Image:Domenico Beccafumi 026.jpg|right|thumb|100px|[[Catherine of Siena]]]]
* [[Meister Eckhart]] (1260–1328)
* [[Duns Scotus]] (1266–1308)
* [[Marsilius of Padua]] (1270–1342)
* [[Gottfried von Hagenau]] (c. 1270–1313)
* [[William of Ockham]] (c. 1285–1349)
* [[John Wycliffe]] (c. 1320–1384)
* [[Julian of Norwich]] (1342–1413)
* [[Geert Groote]] (1340–1384)
* [[Catherine of Siena]] (1347–1380)
* [[Jean Gerson]] (1363–1429)
* [[Jan Hus]] (c. 1369–1415)
* [[Thomas a Kempis]] (1380–1471)

==Islamic theology==
{{Islam}}
{{See also|Islamic theology|Kalam}}

===The beginnings of ''Kalam''===
{{Main|Qadr (doctrine)}}

[[Islamic theology]] or ''[[Kalam]]'', in the sense of ordered, rational reflection upon Allah and his Qur'an, is commonly held to begin at the end of the 7th century – the 1st century A.H. – with debates about divine and human freedom.

The ''[[Qadariyyah]]'' were those who defended a fairly strong view of human freedom, and included
* [[Ma'bad al-Juhani|Ma'bad ibn Khalid al-Juhani]] (died 699)
* [[Ghaylan ibn Marwan al Dimashqi]] (died 749)

'The ''Jabriyyah'' were their opponents, and included
* [[Jahm ibn Safwan (died 745)]]

===''Mu'tazilah''===
The ''Qadariyyah'' evolved into ''Mu‘tazilah'' which for some time was the dominant form of ''kalam'', imposed as official orthodoxy under the [[Abbasid]] dynasty, until the accession of [[Al-Mutawakkil]] in 847, after which it was suppressed.  For the five principal doctrines of Mutazilism, see the [[Mu'tazili#Tenets|main article]].  Prominent Mutazilite theologians include:
* [[Wasil ibn Ata]] (c. 700–748)
* [[Abu Huthail al-‘Allaf]] (c. 750–c.849)	
* Ibrahim [[al-Nazzam]] (died c. 846)
* [[al-Jahiz]] (c. 776–869)
* [[al-Jubba'i]] (died 916)
* [[al-Qadi Abdul Jabbar]] (died 1025)
* [[al-Mawardi]] (974–1058)
* [[Zamakhshari]] (died 1144)

===''Ash'aryah''===
From the late 10th century onwards, ''Mutazilite kalam'', opposition to which had hitherto been almost indistinguishable from opposition to ''kalam'' itself, found a new opponent ''within'' ''kalam'': ''[[Ash'ari]] kalam''.  ''Asharite kalam'' rose to become the dominant form of Islamic ''kalam'', and helped distinguish ''kalam'' from ''falasafa''—from philosophy (a distinction which is less clear when considering ''Mutazilite'' thought).

Prominent Asharites include:

* [[Abu l'Hasan al-Ashari]] (died 945)
* Abu Bakr [[al-Baqillani]] (died 1013)
* [[Abu'l Ma'ali al-Juwayni]] (1028–1085)
* [[Al-Ghazali]] (died 1111)
* [[Fakhr al-Din Razi]] (died 1209)

Note should also be taken of the variant of Asharism known as ''Maturidism''.  Prominent [[Maturidi]] authors include:
* [[Abu Mansur Al Maturidi]] (died 944)
* [[Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi|al-Nasafi]] (died 1114)

===''Falasafa'' (Islamic philosophy) ===
Whilst the boundaries are sometimes rather porous, scholars of Islamic thought often make a distinction between ''Falasafa'' ([[Islamic philosophy]]) and ''Kalam'' (Islamic theology).  Prominent writers normally held to stand on the Falasafa side of the divide include:
* [[Al-Kindī]] (died 873)
* [[Al-Razi]] (865–925)
* [[Al-Farabi]] (870–950)
* [[Ibn Miskawayh]] (932–1030)
* Ibn Sina (Latinised form: [[Avicenna]]) (980–1037)
* [[Ibn Hazm]] (994–1069)
* [[Ibn Bajjah]] (died 1138)
* [[Ibn Tufail]] (c. 1110–1185)
* Ibn Rushd (Latinised form: [[Averroes]]) (1126–1198)

==Renaissance "poetic theology"==
[[Renaissance platonism|Renaissance Platonists]], most notably from Florentine circles (from [[Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]], to [[Cristoforo Landino|Landino]] and [[Politian]]), appealed to "poetic theology" ([[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]]) as a mythical theology independent of Biblical revelation  and thus, too, of Christian medieval theology.  The paradigmatic "poet theologian" was [[Orpheus]], a mythical legislator capable of subduing or civilizing beast-like men with his songs. Renaissance philosophers would adopt mythical ''personae'' such as that of Orpheus to carry out their civilizing function, as philosophical mediators between "sacred" authority and the "profane" lives subject to it.  Thus, e.g., Politian would emerge as a "new Orpheus", a philosopher in poetic garb.

The Renaissance judicious appeal to [[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]] would find its historical consummation in the works of [[Giambattista Vico]], whose discussions on "poet theologians" ([[Scienza Nuova]]) echoed Renaissance counterparts both literally and allegorically.

==Reformation and Counter-Reformation Christian theology==
[[Image:Martin_Luther,_1529.jpg|thumb|100px|Martin Luther]]
The [[Renaissance]] yielded scholars the ability to read the scriptures in their original languages and this in part stimulated the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], a theological movement that [[Protestation at Speyer|protested]] the outlawing of their faith at the [[Second Diet of Speyer]]. Its main themes were [[Sola fide|Justification by faith]], the [[Sola Scriptura|Bible as the only source of Christian teaching]], and the [[Priesthood of all believers]], and. Important figures include [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]],  [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], and the [[Anabaptists]]. [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theology was developed by successors such as [[Theodore Beza|Beza]], the English [[Puritans]] and [[Francis Turretin|Turretin]]. [[Lutheranism#Summary of doctrine|Lutheran theology]] entered a [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|period]] of doctrinal unity with the adoption of the [[Book of Concord]] and preserved it through the work of theologians such as [[Martin Chemnitz|Chemnitz]] and [[Johann Gerhard|Gerhard]].

The Roman Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] spearheaded by the [[Jesuits]] under [[Ignatius Loyola]] took their theology from the decisions of the [[Council of Trent]] and developed [[Second scholasticism|Second Scholasticism]], which they pitted against [[Lutheran scholasticism|Lutheran]] and [[Reformed scholasticism]]. The overall result of the Reformation was to highlight distinctions of belief that had previously co-existed uneasily.

The [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the East, 1453, led to a significant shift of gravity to the rising state of [[Russia]], the "Third Rome". The Renaissance stimulated a program of reforms by patriarchs of prayer books. A movement called the "[[Old Believers]]" consequently resulted and influenced [[Russian Orthodox]] Theology in the direction of [[conservatism]] and [[Erastianism]].

==Modern Christian theology==
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Søren Kierkegaard]]]]
After the Reformation [[protestant]] groups continued to splinter, leading to a range of new theologies. The "[[Enthusiasts]]" were so named because of their emotional zeal. These included the [[Methodists]], the [[Quakers]] and [[Baptists]]. Another group sought to reconcile Christian faith with "Modern" ideas, sometimes causing them to reject beliefs they considered to be illogical, including the [[Nicene creed]] and [[Chalcedonian Creed]]. these included [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Universalists]]. A major issue for Protestants became the degree to which Man contributes to his salvation. The debate is often viewed as [[synergism (theology)|synergism]] versus [[monergism]], though the labels [[Calvinist]] and [[Arminian]] are more frequently used, referring to the conclusion of the [[Synod of Dort]].

The 19th century saw the rise of [[biblical criticism]], new knowledge of religious [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in other continents and above all the growth of [[science]]. This led many church men to espouse a form of [[Deism]]. This, along with concepts such as the brotherhood of man and a rejection of [[miracle]]s led to what is called "[[Liberal Christianity|Classical liberalism]]". Immensely influential in its day, classic liberalism suffered badly as a result of the two [[world wars]] and fell prey to the criticisms of [[postmodernism]].

[[Vladimir Lossky]] is a famous [[Eastern Orthodox]] theologian writing in the 20th century for the Greek church.

==Postmodern theology==
[[Postmodern theology]] seeks to respond to the challenges of post modern and deconstructionist thought, and has included the [[death of God]] movement, [[process theology]], [[feminist theology]] and [[queer theology]] and most importantly [[Neo-orthodox]] theology. [[Karl Barth]], [[Rudolf Bultmann]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] were Neo-Orthodoxy's main representatives. In particular Barth labeled his theology "dialectical theology", a reference to [[existentialism]].

The predominance of classic liberalism resulted in many [[reactionary]] movements amongst conservative believers. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] theology, [[Pentecostal]] or Renewal theology and [[fundamentalist]] theology, often combined with [[dispensationalism]], all moved from the fringe into the academy. [[Marxism]] stimulated the significant rise of [[liberation theology]]  which can be interpreted as a rejection of Academic Theology that fails to challenge [[the establishment]] and help the poor.

From the late 19th century to the early twentieth groups established themselves that derived many of their beliefs from Protestant evangelical groups but significantly differed in doctrine. These include the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Latter Day Saint]]s and others. Many of these groups use the Protestant version of the bible and typically interpret it in a fundamentalist fashion, adding, however, special prophecy or scriptures, and typically denying the trinity and the full deity of Jesus Christ.

[[Ecumenical]] theology sought to discover a common consensus on theological matters that could bring the many [[Christian denominations]] together. As a movement it was successful in helping to provide a basis for the establishment of the [[World Council of Churches]] and for some reconciliation between more established denominations. But ecumenical theology was nearly always the concern of liberal theologians, especially Protestant ones. The movement for ecumenism was opposed especially by fundamentalists and viewed as flawed by many neo-orthodox and [[confessional Lutheran]] theologians.

The pattern of challenge from a changing world, liberal response from official representatives and orthodox backlash from conservatives is found also in the history of Islam and Judaism. [[Reform Judaism]] represents a liberal interpretation as against [[Orthodox Judaism]], and moderate or [[liberal Islam]] continues to be theologically distinct from [[Islamic fundamentalism]], notably its [[Wahhabism|Wahabi]] and [[Deobandi]] Schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">In [[Christian theology]], '''interpretation of tongues''' is one of the [[spiritual gift]]s listed in [[1 Corinthians 12]]. This gift is used in conjunction with that of the [[glossolalia|gift of tongues]]—the [[supernatural]] ability to speak in a language (tongue) unknown to the speaker. The gift of interpretation is the supernatural enablement to express in an intelligible language an utterance spoken in an unknown tongue. This is not learned but imparted by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]; therefore, it should not be confused with the acquired skill of [[language interpretation]]. While [[Cessationism|cessationist]] Christians believe this miraculous [[charism]] has ceased, [[Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] Christians believe this gift continues to operate within the [[Christian Church|church]].&lt;ref name=foundations&gt;Guy P. Duffield and Nathaniel M. Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', 1983, (Los Angeles: Foursquare Media, 2008), pp. 342-343.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical description==
Much of what is known about this gift was recorded by [[St. Paul]] in [[1 Corinthians 14]]. In this passage, guidelines for the proper use of the gift of tongues were given. In order for the gift of tongues to be beneficial the edification of the church, such supernatural utterances were to be interpreted into the language of the gathered Christians. If no one among the gathered Christians possessed the gift of interpretation, then the gift of tongues was not to be publicly exercised. Those possessing the gift of tongues were encouraged to pray for the ability to interpret.&lt;ref name=foundations/&gt;

The '''Kanun''' is a set of traditional [[Albania]]n laws. The Kanun was primarily oral and only in the 20th century was it published in writing.&lt;ref name="Co22"&gt;{{cite book| last = Cook| first = Bernard| title = Europe since 1945 an encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ox_gXq2jpdYC&amp;pg=PA22| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 2001| publisher = Garland Publishing| isbn = 0-8153-4057-5| page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kanun of [[Lekë Dukagjini]] ({{lang|sq|Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit}}) was codified in the 15th century.  Six later variations eventually evolved:
*The Old Kanun ({{lang-sq|Kanun i vjetër}});
*The Kanun of [[Mirdita]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Mirditës}});
*The Kanun of [[Pukë]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Pukës}});
*The Kanun of [[Çermenikë]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Çermenikës}});
*The Kanun of Pope Julius ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Papa Zhulit}});
*The Kanun of [[Labëria]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Labërisë}});&lt;ref&gt;R. Zojzi The Code of Labëria ({{lang-sq|"Kanuni i Labërisë" Tirana}} (Institute of Folk Culture Archives&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Kanun of [[Skanderbeg]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Skënderbeut}})&lt;ref&gt;Ilia, I.F. Kanuni i Skenderbegut (1993) The Code of Skanderbeg Shkoder Publisher:Archbishop of Shkodra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Young| first = Antonia| title = Women Who Become Men Albanian Sworn Virgins| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jDgqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA732| year = 2000| publisher = Bloomsbury Academic| isbn = 978-1-85973-340-0| page = 732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as The Kanun of Arbëria ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Arbërisë}}).

The Kanun of Skanderbeg is the closest in similarity with the Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini, and the latter is usually the most known and is also regarded as a synonym of the word ''kanun''. The Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini was developed by Lekë Dukagjini, who codified the existing customary laws.&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"/&gt; It has been used mostly in northern and central [[Albania]] and surrounding areas formerly in Yugoslavia where there is a large [[ethnic Albanian]] population; [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It was first codified in the 15th century but the use of it has been outspread much earlier in time. It was used under that form until the 20th century, and revived recently after the fall of the [[History of Communist Albania|communist regime]] in the early 1990s.

==Etymology==
The term ''kanun'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "{{lang|el|κανών}}" ("canon"), meaning amongst others "pole" or "rule"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkanw%2Fn κανών], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and was transported from Greek to Arabic and then into early Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marii͡a Nikolaeva Todorova| title = Balkan Identities Nation and Memory| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4EVGvQNFD7gC&amp;pg=PA111| year = 2004| publisher = NYU Press| isbn = 978-0-8147-8279-8| page = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanun was also known by the word of ''Doke''.

== Origin ==
The practice of the oral laws that [[Lekë Dukagjini]] codified in the Kanun was suggested by [[Edith Durham]] as dating back to the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="kolor"&gt;{{cite book| last = Foyer-Merib| first = the| title = Kolor. Journal on moving communities| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SZqcmmn2YsgC&amp;pg=PA10| year = 2006| publisher = Garant| isbn = 90-441-2008-5| page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have conjectured that the Kanun may derive from ancient Illyrian tribal laws.&lt;ref&gt;Dukagjini, L., Gjecov, S., Fox, L. ''Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit''. Gjonlekaj Publishing Co., 1989. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have suggested that the Kanun has retained elements from Indo-European prehistoric eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Cancik| first1 = Hubert| last2 = Schneider| first2 = Helmuth| title = Brill's New Pauly Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. Classical Tradition| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UqE5SwAACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Brill| isbn = 90-04-14221-5| page = 92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However several stratifications can be easily observed in the code, beginning with pre-Indo-European, Indo-European, Ancient Greek, Roman, general Balkan and Osmanli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Sellers| first1 = Mortimer| last2 = Tomaszewski| first2 = Tadeusz| title = The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspective| year = 2010| publisher = Springer Verlag| isbn = 978-90-481-3748-0| page = 205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Serbian authors T. O. Oraovac&lt;ref&gt;T. O. Oraovac, Albansko pitanje i srpsko pravo, Beograd, 1913, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and S. S. Djuric, it is largely based on [[Dušan's Code]], the constitution of the [[Serbian Empire]] (enacted 1349), which at the time [[Albania under the Serbian Empire|held the whole of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilhelm-Stempin| first = Nikolaus| title = Das albanische Gewohnheitsrecht aus der Perspektive der rechtlichen Volkskunde| year = 2009| publisher = GRIN Verlag| isbn = 3-640-40128-X| page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noel Malcolm speculates that an article in Dušan's Code was an early attempt to clamp down on the self-administered customary law of the mountains, as later codified in the Kanun of Lek Dukagjin, and if so, this would be the earliest evidence that such [[customary law]]s were in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Malcolm| first = Noel| title = Kosovo A short history| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vcrWnQEACAAJ| year = 1998| publisher = New York University Press| isbn = 0-8147-5598-4| page = 54| location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the similarities the majority of scientists agree that the Code of Leke Dukagjini is not the same as Dusans Code and that such conclusions are "far-fetched". When the Turkish invaders conquered the medieval Serbian state many customary laws of social life amongst the Balkan peoples were brought back to use, this included the Albanians.&lt;ref name="The Code of Leke Dukagjini"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trnavci|first1=Professor Genc|title=Dr Genc Trnavci - The Code of Leke Dukajgini|url=http://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~hoken/Kazuhiko/2008Customarylaw.pdf|website=www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~hoken/Kazuhiko/2008Customarylaw.pdf|page=13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615120555/http://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~hoken/Kazuhiko/2008Customarylaw.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The town of Shkodra had for example, before Dušan's Code, its own customary laws and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lala|first1=Etleva|title=Women's Status in Medieval Albanian Laws|url=https://www.docdroid.net/vB0Ly5t/womens-status-in-medieval-albanian-laws.pdf.html|website=Etleva Lala, Sixth conference of the International Research Network, "Gender differences in the History of European Legal Cultures"|publisher=Solivagus, Kiel 2014|accessdate=5 February 2016}} P. 3-4 of the PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and usage ==
The Law of Lek Dukagjini (kanun) was named after a medieval prince [[Lekë Dukagjini]] of the fifteenth century who ruled in northern Albania and codified the customary laws of the highlands.&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"/&gt; The code was written down only in the 19th century by [[Shtjefën Gjeçovi]] and partially published in the ''[[Hylli i Drites]]'' periodical in 1913.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt; The full version appeared only in 1933 after Gjeçovi's death in 1926.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt; In 1989 a dual English-Albanian version was published.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author4=Shtjefën Gjeçovi |author5=Leonard Fox| last1 = Dukagjini| first1 = Lekë| last2 = Gjeçov| first2 = Shtjefën| last3 = Fox| first3 = Leonard| title = Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dZ-RAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 1989| publisher = Gjonlekaj Pub. Co| isbn = 978-0-9622141-0-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then replicated in a 1992 version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Anton Logoreci |translator=Martin Camaj  |last1 = Dukagjini| first1 = Lekë| last2 = Gjeçov| first2 = Shtjefën| last3 = Fox| first3 = Leonard| title = Code of Leke Dukagjini| url = http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/ISBNInquiry.asp?r=1&amp;IF=N&amp;EAN=9780962214103&amp;cm_mmc=Google%20Book%20Search-_-k118169-_-j14953980-_-Googe%20Book%20Search%20(non-B%26N%20Imprint)| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 1992| publisher = Gjonlekaj Publishing Company| isbn = 0-9622141-0-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the laws are attributed to Lekë Dukagjini, the laws evolved over time as a way to bring law and rule to these lands. The Kanun is divided into [[Kanun (Albania)#Content|12 sections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/yoa01/ Religion and Society in Present-Day Albania] by Antonia Young&lt;/ref&gt; and Gjeçovi's version has 1,262 articles which regulate all aspects of the mountainous life: economic organisation of the household, hospitality, brotherhood, clan, boundaries, work, marriage, land, and so on.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt; The ''[[Besa (Albanian culture)|Besa]]'' (personal honour, compare with [[Latin language|Lat.]] ''fides'') and [[Honour#Cultures of honour and cultures of law|nderi]] (family honour, [[Latin language|Lat.]] ''honor'') are of prime importance throughout the code as the cornerstone of personal and social conduct.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych115"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=115.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kanun applies to both Christian and Muslim Albanians.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt;

Some of the most controversial rules of the Kanun (in particular book 10 section 3) specify how murder is supposed to be handled, which often in the past and sometimes still now led to [[blood feud]]s that last until all the men of the two involved families are killed.&lt;ref name=spiegel_06June2014/&gt; In situations of murder tribal law stipulates the principle of ''koka për kokë'' (head for a head) where the relatives of the victim are obliged to seek ''gjakmarje'' (blood vengeance).&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"/&gt;  Women are only seen as producers of offspring and are referred to in a [[Misogyny|discriminatory manner]] and so are not considered worthy targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel_06June2014&gt;{{cite news|title='We'll Get You': An Albanian Boy's Life Ruined by Blood Feuds|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/blood-feuds-still-prevalent-in-albania-a-973498.html|accessdate=12 June 2014|work=[[Spiegel Online]]|publisher=Spiegel Online GmbH|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian name for blood feud is ''[[Gjakmarrja]]''. In some parts of the country, the Kanun resembles the Italian vendetta.&lt;ref name="kanun"&gt;{{cite news |title=Reportage : Albanie, la Bible contre la vendetta |author=Angélique Kourounis |author2=Thomas Iacobi |author3= Jean Christophe Georgoustsos|author4=Nikos Arapoglou|url=http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/religion/faut-pas-croire/4439559-reportage-albanie-la-bible-contre-la-vendetta.html |format=video|newspaper=Faut pas croire |publisher= [[Radio télévision suisse]]|location=Geneva, Switzerland|date= 17 November 2012|accessdate=25 January 2013 |language=French}} Des jeunes catholiques, soutenus par une religieuse, ont brisé la loi du silence pour combattre le « kanun », un code d'honneur ancestral qui justifie la vengeance et le meurtre.&lt;/ref&gt; These rules have resurfaced during the 1990s in Northern Albania, since people had no faith in the powerless local government and police. There are organizations that try to mediate between feuding families and try to get them to "pardon the blood" ({{lang-sq|Falja e Gjakut}}), but often the only resort is for men of age to stay in their homes, which are considered a safe refuge by the Kanuni, or flee the country. Tribal also held that thieves would need to pay fines to the relative amount that was stolen.&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanian tribes from the Dibra region (known as the "Tigers of Dibra") governed themselves according to the Law of Skanderbeg, named after a fifteenth century warrior who fought the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Gawrych36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gawrych|first=George|title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874–1913|year=2006|location=London|publisher=IB Tauris|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT94zl8ebXAhWJT7wKHYRLADEQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=law%20of%20Lek&amp;f=false|isbn=9781845112875|pages=36.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former communist leader of Albania [[Enver Hoxha]] effectively stopped the practice of Kanun with hard repression and a very strong state police. However, after the fall of communism, some communities have tried to rediscover the old traditions, but some of their parts have been lost, leading to fears of misinterpretation.

Notably, the current Albanian Penal Code does not contain any provisions from the Kanun that deal with blood feuds, and no acknowledgment of this code is made in the contemporary Albanian legal system.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In 2014 about 3,000 Albanian families were estimated to be involved in blood feuds and this since the fall of Communism has led to the deaths of 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=spiegel_06June2014/&gt;

== Pillars of the Kanun ==
The Kanun is based on four pillars:
* Honour ({{lang-sq|Nderi}})
* Hospitality ({{lang-sq|Mikpritja}})
* Right Conduct ({{lang-sq|Sjellja}})
* Kin Loyalty ({{lang-sq|Fis}})

==Kanun in literature and film==
Albanian writer [[Ismail Kadare]] evokes the Kanun several times in his books and has it as the main theme in his novel [[Broken April]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longitudebooks.com/find/p/67067/mcms.html|title=Broken April - Ismail Kadare|publisher=Longitude|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also evoques the kanun in his novel {{lang|sq|Komisioni i festës}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Komisioni i festës|last=Kadare|first=Ismail|year=1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjHIOgAACAAJ|location=Prishtinë|publisher=Rilindja}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-en|The Celebration Commission}}), where Kadare literally describes the [[Monastir massacre of 1830]] as the struggle between two empires: the Albanian Kanun with its code of ''besa'' and the Ottoman Empire itself.&lt;ref name="Co82"&gt;{{cite book| last = Colafato| first = Michele| title = Emozioni e confini per una sociologia delle relazioni etniche| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KS5NwIa3Pc0C| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 1998| publisher = Meltemi Editore srl| isbn = 88-86479-69-7| page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kadare in his [[Literary criticism|literary critique]] book {{lang|sq|Eskili, ky humbës i madh}} ({{lang-en|Aeschylus, this big loser}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kadare| first = Ismail| title = Eskili, ky humbës i madh| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1t6eLAAACAAJ| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 2006| publisher = Onufri| location = Tirana| isbn = 99943-32-63-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''loser'' refers to the great number of tragedies that were lost from [[Aeschylus]], there are evident similarities between the ''kanun'' and the [[feud|vendetta]]&lt;ref name="kanun" /&gt; customs in all the Mediterranean countries.

[[Barbara Nadel]]'s ''Deep Waters''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Nadel| first = Barbara| title = Deep Waters| url = https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Waters-Inspector-Ikmen-Mysteries/dp/0747267197| year = 2002| publisher = Headline Book Pub Limited| isbn = 0-7472-6719-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Kanun and [[Gjakmarrja]].

[[Joshua Marston]]'s 2011 film [[The Forgiveness of Blood]], a drama set in modern-day Albania, deals with the Kanun. The film relates a blood feud between two families in Northern Albania, focusing primarily on how the feud affects the children of one family.

The Kanun is referred to in season 6, episode 9 of [[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]] ("[[Blasters (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent)|Blasters]]") as the explanation for the sudden retreat of a group of Albanian assassins.

The Kanun plays a major role in the Belgian movie [[Dossier K]].

[[Elvira Dones]]'s ''Sworn Virgin''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Dones| first = Elvira| title = Sworn Virgin| url = https://www.amazon.com/Sworn-Virgin-Elvira-Dones-ebook/dp/B00IHH2NZI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400792599&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sworn+virgin| year = 2014| publisher = And Other Stories| isbn = 978-1-908276-34-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Kanun and women's practice of swearing celibacy in return to being accepted as men by all local villagers.

Belgian TV maker Tom Waes visited Albania during one of the shows in his series Reizen Waes. He was served spit roasted goat and was offered the head of the goat. According to Kanun rules, this is how they honor a guest during dinner.&lt;ref&gt;http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur%2Ben%2Bmedia/media/1.2235741&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lebensborn e.V.''' (literally: "Fount of Life") was an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-initiated, [[State (polity)|state]]-supported, registered association in [[Nazi Germany]] with the goal of raising the [[birth rate]] of "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" children of persons classified as "racially pure and healthy" based on Nazi [[racial hygiene]] and health [[ideology]]. Lebensborn provided welfare to its mostly unmarried mothers, encouraged anonymous births by unmarried women at their maternity homes, and mediated [[adoption]] of these children by likewise "racially pure and healthy" parents, particularly SS members and their families. The [[Cross of Honour of the German Mother]] was given to the women who bore the most Aryan children. Abortion was legalised by the Nazis for disabled children.

Initially set up in Germany in 1935, ''Lebensborn'' expanded into several occupied European countries with [[Germanic peoples|Germanic populations]] during the Second World War. It included the selection of "racially worthy" orphans for adoption and care for children born from Aryan women who had been in relationships with SS members. It originally excluded children born from unions between common soldiers and foreign women, because there was no proof of [[racial purity]] on both sides. During the war, many children were kidnapped from their parents and judged by "aryan" criteria for their suitability to be raised in Lebensborn homes, and fostering by German families.

At the [[Nuremberg Trials]], much direct evidence was found of the [[kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany]], across [[Greater Germany]] during the period 1939-45.

==Background==
The ''Lebensborn e. V.'' (e.V. stands for ''[[eingetragener Verein]]'' or registered association), meaning "fount of life", was founded on 12 December 1935,&lt;ref name="albanese"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albanese|first=Patrizia|title=Mothers of the Nation: Women, Families and Nationalism in Twentieth-Century Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9ivwlTAiQkC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=15 August 2011|year=2006|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-8020-9015-7|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; to counteract falling birth rates in Germany, and to promote [[Nazi eugenics]].&lt;ref name=bissell&gt;{{cite web |last=Bissell |first=Kate |title=Fountain of Life |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4080822.stm |accessdate=30 September 2011 |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=13 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in [[Munich]], the organization was partly an office within the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) responsible for certain family welfare programs, and partly a society for Nazi leaders.

On 13 September 1936, [[Heinrich Himmler]] wrote the following to members of the SS:

{{quote|The organisation "Lebensborn e.V." serves the SS leaders in the selection and adoption of qualified children. The organisation "Lebensborn e.V." is under my personal direction, is part of the Race and Settlement Central Bureau of the SS, and has the following obligations:
1. Support racially, biologically and hereditarily valuable families with many children.

2. Placement and care of racially, biologically and hereditarily valuable pregnant women, who, after thorough examination of their and the progenitor's families by the Race and Settlement Central Bureau of the SS, can be expected to produce equally valuable children.

3. Care for the children.

4. Care for the children's mothers.

It is the honorable duty of all leaders of the central bureau to become members of the organisation "Lebensborn e.V.". The application for admission must be filed prior to 23 September 1936.&lt;ref name=himmlerfounding&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Office of United States Chief of Counsel For Prosecution of Axis Criminality  |authorlink= |editor1-last=Barrett |editor1-first=Roger W. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=William E. |encyclopedia=Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression |title= |trans-title=Founding of the organization "Lebensborn e.V.", 13 September 1936 |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Nazi_Vol-V.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2011 |year=1946 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |volume=5 |location=Washington, DC |isbn= |pages=465–6 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1939, membership stood at 8,000, of which 3,500 were SS leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wernigerode.de/WRPortal/Landkreis/Buergerservice/Kreisgeschichte/Lebensborn.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329135828/http://www.wernigerode.de/WRPortal/Landkreis/Buergerservice/Kreisgeschichte/Lebensborn.htm |date=29 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Lebensborn'' office was part of ''SS Rasse und Siedlungshauptamt'' ([[SS Race and Settlement Main Office]]) until 1938, when it was transferred to ''Hauptamt Persönlicher Stab Reichsführer-SS'' (Personal Staff of the ''Reichführer''-SS), i.e. directly overseen by Himmler. Leaders of ''Lebensborn e. V.'' were ''SS-Standartenführer'' Max Sollmann and ''SS-Oberführer'' Dr. Gregor Ebner.

==Implementation==
Initially the programme served as a welfare institution for wives of SS officers; the organization ran facilities{{snd}}primarily maternity homes{{snd}}where women could give birth or get help with family matters. The programme also accepted unmarried women who were either pregnant or had already given birth and were in need of aid, provided that both the woman and the father of the child were classified as "racially valuable". About 60% of the mothers were unmarried. The program allowed them to give birth secretly away from home without [[social stigma]]. In case the mothers wanted to give up the children, the program also had orphanages and an adoption service.&lt;ref name=crossland&gt;{{cite news|last=Crossland|first=David|title=Nazi Program to Breed Master Race: Lebensborn Children Break Silence|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,446978,00.html|accessdate=15 August 2011|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=7 November 2006|location=Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; When dealing with non-SS members, parents and children were usually examined by SS doctors before admission.

The first ''Lebensborn'' home (known as 'Heim Hochland') opened in 1936, in [[Steinhöring]], a tiny village not far from Munich. The first home outside of Germany opened in [[Norway]] in 1941. Many of these facilities were established in confiscated houses and former [[nursing home]]s owned by Jews.&lt;ref name=bissell/&gt; Leaders of the [[League of German Girls]] were instructed to recruit young women with the potential to become good breeding partners for SS officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Lebensborn.htm |title= Lebensborn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Lebensborn e. V.'' established facilities in several occupied countries, its activities were concentrated around Germany, Norway and occupied [[northeastern Europe]], mainly [[Poland]]. The main focus in [[occupied Norway]] was aiding children born to Norwegian women and fathered by German soldiers. In northeastern Europe the organisation, in addition to services provided to SS members, engaged in the transfer of children, mostly orphans, to families in Germany.

''Lebensborn e. V.'' had or planned to have facilities in the following countries (some were merely field offices):
* Germany: 10
* [[Austria]]: 3
* [[Poland]] ([[General Government]]{{snd}}the occupied Polish territory and annexed lands of Poland): 6 (8 if [[Szczecin|Stettin]] and [[Połczyn-Zdrój|Bad Polzin]] are included.)&lt;ref&gt;Bydgoszcz, Kraków, Helenówek pod Łodzią, Otwock, Smoszew koło Krotoszyna, Smoszewo; 8 if you include Stettin and Połczyn-Zdrój (which became a part of Poland only after the war)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Norway]]: 9
* [[Denmark]]: 2
* [[France]]: 1 (February 1944{{snd}}August 1944){{snd}}in [[Lamorlaye]]
* [[Belgium]]: 1 (March 1943{{snd}}September 1944){{snd}}in [[Wégimont Castle|Wégimont]], in the municipality of [[Soumagne]]
* [[Netherlands]]: 1
* [[Luxembourg]]: 1

About 8,000 children were born in ''Lebensborn'' homes in Germany, and between 8,000 and 12,000 children in Norway.&lt;ref name="simonsen"&gt;Eva Simonsen: "Into the open – or hidden away? – The construction of [[war children]] as a social category in post-war Norway and Germany" In: NORDEUROPAforum (2006:2), pp. 25–49, http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2006-2/simonsen-eva-25/PDF/simonsen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere the total number of births was much lower.&lt;ref name="simonsen"/&gt; For more information about ''Lebensborn'' in Norway, see [[war children]].

In Norway the ''Lebensborn'' organisation handled approximately 250 adoptions. In most of these cases the mothers had agreed to the adoption, but not all were informed that their children would be sent to Germany for adoption. The Norwegian government recovered all but 80 of these children after the war.

==Germanisation==
{{Main|Kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany}}
[[File:Kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi-German occupants (Zamojszczyzna).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Kidnapping of Polish children during the Nazi-German resettlement operation in [[Zamość]] county]]
[[File:Polish children in Nazi-German labor camp in Dzierżązna.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Polish children in Nazi-German labour camp in Dzierżązna near [[Zgierz]]]]

In 1939, the Nazis started to kidnap children from foreign countries{{snd}}mainly from [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Poland]], but also including [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Norway]]{{snd}}for the ''Lebensborn'' program. They started to do this because "It is our duty to take [the children] with us to remove them from their environment... either we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves and give it a place in our people or we destroy this blood," Himmler reportedly said.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://colanmc.siu.edu/clockwork/papers/p13.htm "The Lebensborn Origination"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218025750/http://colanmc.siu.edu/clockwork/papers/p13.htm |date=18 February 2013 }}, Southern Illinois University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis would seize children in full view of the parents. The kidnapped children were administered several tests and were categorised into three groups:

{{quote|
* those considered desirable to be included into the German population,
* those who were acceptable, and
* the unwanted.}}

The children classified as unwanted were taken to [[concentration camp]]s to work or were killed. The children from the other groups, if between the ages of 2 and 6, were placed with families in the programme to be brought up by them in a kind of [[foster child]] status. Children of ages 6 to 12 were placed in German boarding schools. The schools assigned the children new German names and taught them to be proud to be part of Germany. They forced the children to forget their birth parents and erased any records of their ancestry. Those who resisted Germanisation were beaten and, if a child continued to rebel, he or she would be sent to a concentration camp.&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Lebensborn.html "The Lebensborn"], Jewish Virtual Library's description of the Lebensborn program&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final stages of the war, the files of all children kidnapped for the programme were destroyed. As a result, researchers have found it nearly impossible to learn how many children were taken. The Polish government has claimed that 10,000 children were kidnapped, and less than 15% were returned to their biological parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colanmc.siu.edu/clockwork/papers/p13.htm "The Lebensborn Orgization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218025750/http://colanmc.siu.edu/clockwork/papers/p13.htm |date=18 February 2013 }}, Southern Illinois University&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates include numbers as high as 200,000, although according to Dirk Moses a more likely number is around 20,000.&lt;ref name=Moses255&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Dirk Moses|title=Genocide and Settler Society: Frontier Violence and Stolen Indigenous Children in Australian History |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5zHAGNPTkqIC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=Germanization+%22Polish+children| location =New York and Oxford | publisher = Berghahn Books | year = 2004|page =255|accessdate=2008-09-16 | isbn=978-1-57181-410-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war trial==
[[File:Max Sollmann 1.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Max Sollmann before his trial at Nuremberg]]
After the war, the branch of the ''Lebensborn'' organisation operating in north-eastern Europe was accused of kidnapping children deemed racially valuable in order to resettle them with German families. However, of approximately 10,000 foreign-born children located after the war in the American-controlled area of Germany, [[RuSHA Trial|in the trial]] of the leaders of the ''Lebensborn'' organisation (''[[United States of America v. Ulrich Greifelt, et al.]]''), the court found that 340 had been handled by ''Lebensborn e. V.'' The accused were acquitted on charges of kidnapping.

The court found ample evidence of an existing programme of the kidnapping or forced movement of children in north-eastern Europe, but concluded that these activities were carried out by individuals who were not members of ''Lebensborn''. Exactly how many children were moved by ''Lebensborn'' or other organisations remains unknown due to the destruction of archives by SS members prior to fleeing the advancing Allied forces.

From the trial's transcript:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/greifelt3.htm ''Trial of Ulrich Greifelt and Others,'' United Nations War Crimes Commission. Part III] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615221427/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/greifelt3.htm |date=15 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The prosecution has failed to prove with the requisite certainty the participation of ''Lebensborn'', and the defendants connected therewith in the kidnapping programme conducted by the Nazis. While the evidence has disclosed that thousands upon thousands of children were unquestionably kidnapped by other agencies or organisations and brought into Germany, the evidence has further disclosed that only a small percentage of the total number ever found their way into ''Lebensborn''. And of this number only in isolated instances did ''Lebensborn'' take children who had a living parent. The majority of those children in any way connected with ''Lebensborn'' were orphans of ethnic Germans.

Upon the evidence submitted, the defendant Sollmann is found not guilty on counts one and two of the indictment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Post-war==
After Germany's surrender, the press reported on the unusually good weight and health of the "super babies". They spent time outdoors in sunlight and received two baths a day. Everything that came into contact with the babies was disinfected first. Nurses ensured that the children ate everything given to them.&lt;ref name="life1945081337"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title="Super Babies": Illegitimate children of SS men are housed in a German chateau | work=Life | date=15 August 1942 | accessdate=12 September 2015 | page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the last days of the war, the mothers and the children at maternity homes got the best treatment available, including food, although others in the area were starving. Once the war ended, local communities often took revenge on the women, beating them, cutting off their hair, and running them out of the community. Many ''Lebensborn'' children were born to unwed mothers. After the war, ''Lebensborn'' survivors were often subjected to ostracization.

Himmler's effort to secure a racially pure [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] and sloppy journalism on the subject in the early years after the war led to false assumptions about the programme. The main misconception was that the programme involved coercive breeding. The first stories reporting that ''Lebensborn'' was a coercive breeding programme can be found in the German magazine ''[[Revue (magazine)|Revue]]'', which ran a series on the subject in the 1950s. The 1961 German film ''[[Der Lebensborn (film)|Der Lebensborn]]'' purported that young girls were forced to mate with Nazi men in their camps.

The programme did intend to promote the growth of Aryan populations, through encouraging relationships between German soldiers and Nordic women in occupied countries. Access to ''Lebensborn'' was restricted in accordance  with the [[Nordic race|Nordicist]] eugenic and racial policies of Nazism, which could be referred to as supervised selective breeding. Recently discovered records and ongoing testimony of ''Lebensborn'' children{{snd}}and some of their parents{{snd}}shows that some SS men did sire children in Himmler's ''Lebensborn'' program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/worl d/europe/article626101.ece "Himmler was my godfather"], ''Times'' (UK) Online, 6 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely rumored within Germany during the period of the programme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Grunberger]], ''The 12-Year Reich'', pp. 246–7, {{ISBN|0-03-076435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-help groups and aftermath==
Help, recognition, and justice for ''Lebensborn'' survivors have been varied.

In Norway, children born to Norwegian mothers by Nazi fathers were allegedly often bullied, raped and abused after the war, and placed in mental institutions. The Norwegian government attempted to deport ''Lebensborn'' to Germany, Brazil, and Australia but did not succeed. A group of survivors attempted to fight the Norwegian government into admitting complicity. In 2008, their case before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] was dismissed, but they were each offered a £8,000 token from the Norwegian government.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Sharp, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-chosen-ones-the-war-children-born-to-nazi-fathers-in-a-sinister-eugenics-scheme-speak-out-771017.html "The chosen ones: The war children born to Nazi fathers in a sinister eugenics scheme speak out"], ''The Independent'', 20 January 2008. Retrieved 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, in the German town of Wernigerode, an open meeting took place among several ''Lebensborn'' children, with the intention of dispelling myths and encouraging those affected to investigate their origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6117744.stm "Nazi 'master race' children meet"], BBC News, 4 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Crossland, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/nazi-program-to-breed-master-race-lebensborn-children-break-silence-a-446978.html "Nazi Program to Breed Master Race: Lebensborn Children Break Silence"], ''Spiegel'', 07 November 2006. Retrieved 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden took in several hundred ''Lebensborn'' children from Norway after the war. A famous survivor is [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], a member of the music group [[ABBA]]. Her father was a sergeant in the ''Wehrmacht'', and her mother was Norwegian; to escape persecution after the war, her grandmother took Anni-Frid to Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Connolly, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/30/kateconnolly.theobserver "Torment of the Abba star with a Nazi father"], ''The Guardian'', 29 June 2002. Retrieved 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries that had ''Lebensborn'' clinics include France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and Luxembourg.

General documents on ''Lebensborn'' activities are administered by [[International Tracing Service]] and by [[German Federal Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.its-arolsen.org/en/archives/overview-of-the-archival-holdings/finding-aids/ New "Findbuch" (register) to still existing general „Lebensborn“-documents] its-arolsen.org, site looked at on 30 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The association ''Verein kriegskind.de'' is among those that published search efforts (''Suchbitten'') to identify ''Lebensborn'' children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kriegskind.de/suchbitten.html "Search efforts (Suchbitten) for Lebensborn-children"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626140947/http://www.kriegskind.de/suchbitten.html |date=26 June 2012 }}, kriegskind.de&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2510">In the [[philosophy of science]], under the [[correspondence principle]], a '''limiting case''' [[theory]] is an earlier theory which becomes incorporated into a later, usually broader theory; that is to say, the earlier (limiting case) theory proves to be a special or limited case of the later theory. Technically, a theory is said to be a limiting case of another, later theory when and if the later theory subsumes the theoretical relations and apparent referents of the earlier one. For example, physicists agree that [[classical mechanics]] constitutes a low-energy limiting case of [[relativity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Rivadulla, Andres: [https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/docs/481-2013-10-14-TheNewtonianLimit.pdf The Newtonian Limit of Relativity Theory and the Rationality of Theory Change], Synthese 141:417–429, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ladyman, James (2013): "Toward a Demarcation of Science from Pseudoscience", in ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience'', Chicago-London: The University of Chicago Press, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In words of [[Larry Laudan]], [[scientific realism|realist]] philosophers use this phrase in the sense that the theory "T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be a limiting case of [the theory] T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only if (a) ''all'' the variables (observable and theoretical) assigned a value in T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are assigned a value by T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and (b) the values assigned to every variable of T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the same as, or very close to, the values T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assigns to the corresponding variable when certain initial and boundary conditions—consistent with T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—are specified".

The idea that a theory (in our previous example, [[Newtonian mechanics]]) that is close to being true (i.e., that is [[verisimil]]) converges as a limiting case into a superior theory (in this example, [[relativistic mechanics]]) can be an argument for [[scientific realism]], as the theoretical entities postulated by the previous theories are still considered existent (if one assumes semantic realism, they are considered existent because they are referred to) in the successor theories.

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

A '''lineage''' in [[Buddhism]] is a line of transmission of the Buddhist teaching that is "theoretically traced back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself."{{sfn|Haskel|2001|p=2}} The acknowledgement of the transmission can be oral, or certified in documents. Several branches of Buddhism, including [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] (including [[Zen]] and [[Korean Seon|Seon]]) and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] maintain records of their historical teachers. These records serve as a validation for the living exponents of the tradition.

The historical authenticity of Buddhist lineage is questionable. [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]] has claimed, speaking about specifically Japanese Zen lineage, "the historicity of this “lineage” simply does not withstand critical scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Batchelor|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Batchelor (author)|title=The Lessons of History|url=http://www.stephenbatchelor.org/index.php/en/the-lessons-of-history|journal=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|volume =10| issue =2|date=Winter 2000|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Storlie has noted that transmission "is simply false on historical grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Storlie|first=Erik|title=Lineage Delusions: Eido Shimano Roshi, Dharma Transmission, and American Zen|url=http://sweepingzen.com/lineage-delusions-eido-shimano-roshi-dharma-transmission-and-american-zen/|publisher=Sweeping Zen|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] said "much of the traditions about the early history of Chan are the inventions of a later age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conze|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Conze|title=Buddhism: Its Essence and Development|page=201|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=2003|ISBN=9780486430959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vinaya==
In the lineage of the [[vinaya]], the requirements for ordination as a [[bhikkhu]] ("monk") or a [[bhikkhuni]] ("nun") include the presence of at least five other monks, one of whom must be a fully ordained preceptor, and another an acharya (teacher). This lineage for ordaining bhikshunis became extinct in the [[Theravada]] school and in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Therefore, when [[samanera|śrāmaṇerikā]]s like [[Tenzin Palmo]] wanted full ordination, she had to travel to [[Hong Kong]].

==Mahasiddha==
Lineages in the [[Mahasiddha]] tradition do not necessarily originate from Gautama Buddha, but are ultimately grounded, like all Buddhist lineages, in the [[Adi-Buddha]].

==Chan and Zen lineages==
{{main|Zen lineage charts|Dharma transmission}}

===Construction of lineages===
The idea of a patriarchal lineage in Chan Buddhism dates back to the [[epitaph]] for Fărú (法如 638–689), a disciple of the 5th patriarch, Hóngrĕn (弘忍 601–674). In the ''[[Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices]]'' and the ''Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks'', Daoyu and Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.{{sfn|Dumoulin|1993|p=37}}{{sfn|Cole|2009|p=73–114}}

In the 6th century biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre the typical Chan-lineage was developed:
{{quote|These famous biographies were non-sectarian. The Ch'an biographical works, however, aimed to establish Ch'an as a legitimate school of Buddhism traceable to its Indian origins, and at the same time championed a particular form of Ch'an. Historical accuracy was of little concern to the compilers; old legends were repeated, new stories were invented and reiterated until they too became legends.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=5-6}}}}

[[D. T. Suzuki]] contends that Chan's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had "no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism" and that Chan historians made [[Bodhidharma]] the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.{{sfn|Suzuki|1949|p=168}}

===Six patriarchs===
The earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma to Huineng. There is no generally accepted 7th Chinese Patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MISC/mag83546.htm 禪宗第七祖之爭的文獻研究]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle teachers of the Chan, Zen and Seon traditions are commonly known in English translations as "[[Patriarch]]s". However, the more precise terminology would be "Ancestors" or "Founders" ({{zh|c=祖|p=zǔ}}) and "Ancestral Masters" or "Founding Masters" ({{zh|c=祖師|zǔshī}}), as the commonly used Chinese terms are gender neutral. Various records of different authors are known, which give a variation of transmission lines:

{{Zen Lineage Six Patriarchs}}

===Continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha===
Eventually these descriptions of the lineage evolved into a continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha to Bodhidharma. The idea of a line of descent from Gautama is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of Chan.

According to the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' (證道歌 ''Zhèngdào gē'') by Yǒngjiā Xuánjué (665-713),{{sfn|Chang|1967}} one of the chief disciples of [[Huineng]], Bodhidharma was the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in a line of descent from Gautama Buddha through his disciple [[Mahākāśyapa]]:
{{quote|Mahakashyapa was the first, leading the line of transmission;&lt;br/&gt;
Twenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;&lt;br/&gt;
The Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;&lt;br/&gt;
And Bodhidharma became the First Father here&lt;br/&gt;
His mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,&lt;br/&gt;
And by them many minds came to see the Light.{{sfn|Suzuki|1948|p=50}}}}

The ''[[Denkoroku]]'' gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission,{{sfn|Cook|2003}}{{sfn|Diener|1991|p=266}} and 53 overall:

{{Zen Lineage 28 Patriarchs}}

===Transmission to Japan===
Twenty-four different Zen lineages are recorded to be transmitted to Japan. Only three survived until today. [[Sōtō]] was transmitted to Japan by [[Dōgen]], who travelled to [[China]] for Chan training in the [[13th century]]. After receiving [[Dharma transmission]] in the [[Caodong school]], he returned to Japan and established the lineage there, where it is called the [[Sōtō]].

The [[Linji school]] was also transmitted to Japan several times, where it is the [[Rinzai school]].

==Jōdo Shinshū==
In [[Jōdo Shinshū]], "Patriarch" refers to seven Indian, Chinese and Japanese masters before its founder, [[Shinran]].

==Tibetan Buddhism==
The 14th [[Dalai Lama]], in the foreword to ''Karmapa: The Sacred Prophecy''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Karmapa: The Sacred Prophecy|last=|first=|publisher=Kagyu Thubten Choling Publications Committee|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Within the context of Tibetan Buddhism, the importance of lineage extends far beyond the ordinary sense of a particular line of inheritance or descent. Lineage is a sacred trust through which the integrity of Buddha's teachings is preserved intact as it is transmitted from one generation to the next. The vital link through which the spiritual tradition is nourished and maintained is the profound connection between an enlightened master and perfectly devoted disciple. The master-disciple relationship is considered extremely sacred by all the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Karma Kagyu===

====Possession of lineage====
[[B. Alan Wallace|Wallace]]&lt;ref&gt;Chagmé ''et al.'', 1998: p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt; renders into English a citation of [[Karma Chagme]] ({{bo|w=karma chags med}}, fl. 17th century) that contains an embedded quotation attributed to [[Naropa|Nāropā]] (956-1041&lt;small&gt; CE&lt;/small&gt;):
{{quote|The crucial, primary qualification of a spiritual mentor is stated by Naropa, "The qualification of a spiritual mentor is that [t]he[y][(s/he)] possesses the lineage."&lt;br&gt;
''The Single Meaning of the Vajra Speech'' [Wylie: rDo rje'i gsungs dgongs pa gcig pa] states, "There is great profundity in the connection within the lineage of the holy Dharma." The real lineage of the realization of this Dharma, which transfer blessings,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|"In the Buddhist context, the term blessing should not be understood in terms of grace as in the case of theistic religions. Rather, it relates to the sense of inspiration received...which transforms or awakens the potentials inherent within an individual's [[mindstream|mental continuum]].

====Preservation of lineages====

Alan Wallace|Wallace]] (Chagmé ''et al.'', 1998: p.&amp;nbsp;21):
{{quote|With respect to oral transmission, even if the lineage is impure, it is not a problem. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche often sought out and received any oral transmission he thought was on the verge of disappearing. It made no difference who was giving it. He would receive it and, in turn, pass it on to make sure that the lineage remained unbroken.&lt;ref&gt;Chagmé, Karma (author, compiler); Gyatrul Rinpoche (commentary) &amp; Wallace, B. Alan (translator) (1998). ''A Spacious Path to Freedom: Practical Instructions on the Union of Mahamudra and Atiyoga''. Ithaca, New York, USA: [[Shambhala Publications]]. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-071-2}}; {{ISBN|1-55939-071-9}}, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Chöd===
[[Chöd]] is an advanced spiritual practice known as "Cutting Through the Ego."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodhicitta.net/Chod.htm|title=Chod - Cutting Through the Ego|last=Rinpoche|first=Yangthang |year=1991|accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice, based on the [[Prajnaparamita]] sutra, uses specific [[meditation]]s and [[Vajrayana|tantric]] ritual.

There are several [[hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts of how chöd came to Tibet.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQULAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One [[Namtar (biography)|''namtar'']] (hagiography) asserts that shortly after [[Kamalaśīla]] won his famous debate with [[Moheyan]] as to whether Tibet should adopt the "sudden" route to enlightenment or his own "gradual" route, Kamalaśīla enacted ''[[phowa]]'',  transferring his [[mindstream]] to animate a corpse polluted with contagion in order to safely move the hazard it presented.  As the mindstream of Kamalaśīla was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha named [[Dampa Sangye]] came across the vacant ''kuten'' or "physical basis" of Kamalaśīla. Dampa Sangye was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamalaśīla, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamalaśīla's body. Dampa Sangye's mindstream in Kamalaśīla's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Chöd which contributed to the Mahamudra Chöd of [[Machig Labdrön]]. The mindstream of Kamalaśīla was unable to return to his own ''kuten'' and so was forced to enter the vacant body of Dampa Sangye.&lt;ref name="Thrangu, Khenchen 2007"&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006).

This is a '''list of schools and lineages of Tibetan Buddhism'''.  It includes monastic and [[ngagpa]] lineages.  It includes lineages that are entirely non-Tibetan in their current teaching membership, but which are derived from Tibetan Buddhism.

==Schools==
[[File:Genealogical Tree of Tibetan Buddhist Schools.png|thumb|(Adapted, with modifications, from yogi [[Milarepa]], by W. Y. Evans-Wentz (1928), p. 14)]]
The diagram to the right shows the growth of [[Tibetan Buddhist]] traditions. The four main ones overlap markedly, such that "about eighty percent or more of the features of the Tibetan schools are the same".&lt;ref name="IntroComparison"&gt;Introductory Comparison of the Five Tibetan Traditions of Buddhism and Bon, http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/study/comparison_buddhist_traditions/tibetan_traditions/intro_compar_5_traditions_buddhism_bon.html, Retrieved 31.07.2013&lt;/ref&gt; Differences include the use of apparently, but not actually, contradictory terminology, opening dedications of texts to different deities and whether phenomena are described from the viewpoint of an unenlightened practitioner or of a Buddha.&lt;ref name="IntroComparison" /&gt; On questions of philosophy they have no fundamental differences, according to the Fourteenth Dalai Lama &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=The_four_main_schools_of_Tibetan_Buddhism, retrieved 31.07.2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan adjectival suffix ''-pa'' is translatable as "-ist" in English.

These first four major schools are sometimes said to constitute the Nyingma "Old Translation" and [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] "New Translation" traditions, the latter following from the historical Kadam lineage of translations and tantric lineages. Another common but trivial differentiation is into the Yellow Hat (Gelug) and [[Red Hat sect|Red Hat]] (non-Gelug) sects, a division that mirrors the distinction between the schools involved in the [[Rimé movement]] versus the one that did not, the Gelug. The correspondences are as follows:

===[[Nyingma]]=== 
"The Ancient Ones" are the oldest Buddhist school, the original order founded by [[Padmasambhava]] and [[Śāntarakṣita]].&lt;ref name="berzinarchives.com"&gt;Berzin. Alexander (2000). ''Introductory History of the Five Tibetan Traditions of Buddhism and Bon'': [http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/study/history_buddhism/general_histories/introduction_history_5_traditions_buddhism_bon.html Berzinarchives.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas other schools categorize their teachings into the three [[Yana (Buddhism)|yāna]]s or "vehicles", [[Hinayana]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]], the Nyingma tradition classifies its teachings into [[Nyingma#Nine Y.C4.81na|Nine Yānas]], among the highest of which is [[Dzogchen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kagyuoffice.org/buddhism.nyingma.html Kagyuoffice.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511061419/http://www.kagyuoffice.org/buddhism.nyingma.html |date=2013-05-11 }} See section: ''The Nine Yana Journey''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terma (religion)|Terma]] "treasures" (revealed texts) are of particular significance to the Nyingma school.

====Nyingma Terma lineages====

*[[Palyul]] is the seat of the [[Nam Cho]] [[Terma (religion)|Terma]] of [[Terton]] [[Migyur Dorje]]. Its monastery was founded in 1665 by Rigdzen Kunzang Sherab in [[Derge]], on the eastern edge of Tibet, a town in today's [[Dêgê County]], [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] in China's [[Sichuan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zagpo|first1=Ven. Tsering Lama jampal|title=A Garland of Imortal Wish-fulfilling Trees: The Palyul Tradition Of Nyingmapa|date=1988|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=0-937938-64-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxb7-4zSzyAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Garland+of+Immortal+Wish-fulfilling+Trees:+The+Palyul+Tradition+Of+Nyingmapa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aE_IVJeUKpeyyAS66YKACQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Garland%20of%20Immortal%20Wish-fulfilling%20Trees%3A%20The%20Palyul%20Tradition%20Of%20Nyingmapa&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Longchen Nyingthig]] is a ''[[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]]'', revealed scripture, of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which gives a systematic explanation of [[Dzogchen]]. It was revealed by [[Jigme Lingpa]] (1730–1798).
*[[Aro gTér]] is a [[ngagpa]] (non-monastic) lineage that was founded in the 1980s by a westerner who adopted the name  "Ngakpa Chögyam" and now calls himself "Ngak'chang Rinpoche".{{sfn|Cousens|2010|p=196}}  All of Aro gTér's contemporary teachers are ethnically non-Tibetan.

===[[Kagyu|Kagyu(pa)]]===
“Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word”. This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was [[Milarepa]], an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master [[Naropa]] via [[Marpa Lotsawa]], Milarepa and [[Gampopa]]&lt;ref name="berzinarchives.com"/&gt; and consists of four major sub-sects: the [[Karma Kagyu]], headed by a [[Karmapa]], the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. There are a further eight minor sub-sects, all of which trace their root to Pagtru Kagyu and the most notable of which are the [[Drikung Kagyu|Drikung]] and [[Drukpa Lineage]]s. The once-obscure [[Shangpa Kagyu]], which was famously represented by the 20th century teacher [[Kalu Rinpoche]], traces its history back to the Indian master [[Naropa]] via [[Niguma]], [[Sukhasiddhi]] and [[Kyungpo Naljor]].&lt;ref name="berzinarchives.com"/&gt;

===[[Sakya]]===
[[Image:Sakya Pandita.jpg|180px|thumb|right|[[Sakya Pandita]]]]
The "Grey Earth" school represents the scholarly tradition. Headed by the [[Sakya Trizin]], this tradition was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo ({{bo|w='khon dkon mchog rgyal po}}, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great [[lotsawa|lotsāwa]] Drogmi Shākya ({{bo|w=brog mi lo tsā wa ye shes}}) and traces its lineage to the [[mahasiddha]] Virūpa.&lt;ref name="berzinarchives.com"/&gt; A renowned exponent, [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251CE), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.

===[[Gelug]]===
The "Way of Virtue" school was originally a reformist movement and is known for its emphasis on logic and debate. The order was founded in the 14th to 15th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa]], renowned for both his scholarship and virtue. Its spiritual head is the [[Ganden Tripa]].

===[[Jonang]]===
The Jonang is a minor school that branched off from Sakya traditions; it was suppressed in 1650 in Gelug-controlled regions and subsequently banned and its monks and nuns converted to the Gelug school in 1658.

The Jonang re-established their religio-political center in [[Golok people|Golok]], [[Nakhi people|Nakhi]] and [[Mongols|Mongol]] areas in [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] centered at [[Dzamthang Monastery]] and have continued practicing uninterrupted to this day. An estimated 5,000 monks and nuns of the Jonang tradition practice today in these areas and at the edges of historic Gelug influence.

However, their teachings were limited to these regions until the [[Rimé movement]] of the 19th century encouraged the study of non-Gelug schools of thought and practice.&lt;ref name=Gruschke&gt;Gruschke 2001, p.72; and A. Gruschke, "Der Jonang-Orden: Gründe für seinen Niedergang, Voraussetzungen für das Überdauern und aktuelle Lage", in: Henk Blezer (ed.), ''Tibet, Past and Present. Tibetan Studies I'' (Proceedings of the Ninth Seminar of The IATS, 2000), Brill Academic Publishers, Leiden 2002, pp. 183-214&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times has been encouraged to grow by the [[14th Dalai Lama]], who installed the [[9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu]] as its head.

'''Ljubomir Cuculovski''' (born 1 September 1948 in [[Bitola]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]) is a Macedonian [[philosopher]] and professor in [[Skopje]]. He graduated from the Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Philosophy of [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje]], with a thesis on ''The Sources of [[Bergson]]’s Theory of Knowledge''. Then he received his master's title in sociological science in 1982, at the Institute for Sociological, Political and Juridical Research in Skopje, with a thesis on Religion and Morality. He received his PhD in philosophical sciences from the Faculty of Philosophy in Skopje in 1992, with a [[dissertation]] on ''Karl Marx: The Origin of Historical Materialism (1841–1849)''.

==Career in teaching and research==
In 1973–1975, Cuculovski was a teaching assistant at the Institute for Sociological, Political and Juridical Research in Skopje. From 1975 onwards, he was employed at the Faculty of Philosophy (Department of Philosophy), [[Saints|Ss.]] Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje. In 1992 he was appointed a [[docent]], while in 2002, he became a [[full professor]]. In 2000, Professor Ljubomir Cuculovski was elected a President of the University Senate of that university. He was also the head of the Department of Philosophy at the Faculty of Philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;

   Department of Philosophy, 2011, webpage:
   [http://fzf.ukim.edu.mk/index.php/en/departments-on-fzf/dep-of-philosophy/2009-12-06-00-56-32501/211-fzf-english/philosophy/1304-ljubomir-cuculovski-phd].
&lt;/ref&gt; for two terms (1999–2005). In 2007 he was appointed a [[professor ordinarius]].

To date, he has held numerous courses, including History of Marxism. He has held lectures and tutorials on Philosophy of Religion, Theories of Religion, and Introduction to Philosophy. His philosophical interest is primarily centered on the problem of human [[Social alienation|alienation]] and on the fundamental philosophical issues and problems directly related to the metaphysical questions of God, his existence, good and evil in the context of the assumption that a good and wise God has created the world. He is of the opinion that the problem of [[theodicy]] is the central issue in any philosophy of religion. In social and political philosophy, he sides with Marx's analysis and understanding of the world of capital and its functioning.
At the same time, he is actively involved in the teaching activities in the following departments at the Faculty of Philosophy: Department of Philosophy, Department of Defense and Peace Studies, and Department of Art History and Archeology. Retired in 2013.

==Writing==
So far he has published over 600 articles in scientific and professional journals, both in Macedonia and ex-Yugoslavia. Some of his texts and interviews have been published in daily or weekly newspapers in other countries ([[Bulgaria]], [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], [[Croatia]], ...). The central issues in his analysis are the contemporary social and political circumstances in the Republic of Macedonia&lt;ref name="Milačič2003"&gt;{{cite book

He is also a member of the editorial board of the journal ''[[Novi Plamen]]'' (English ''New Flame'') and ''[[Philosophia (journal of Philosophical Society of Macedonia)|Philosophia]]'', the journal of the Philosophical Society of Macedonia.

}}
The '''''Lunheng''''', also known by [[#Name|numerous English translations]], is a wide-ranging [[Chinese classic text]] by [[Wang Chong]] (27- {{c.|100}}{{nbsp}}CE). First published in 80{{nbsp}}CE, it contains critical essays  on [[natural science]] and [[Chinese mythology]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], and [[Chinese literature|literature]].

{{anchor|Title|Names|Etymology}}
==Name==
The title ''Lunheng'' combines ''lun'' [[Wikt:論|論]] or [[Wikt:论|论]] "discuss; talk about; discourse; decide on; determine; mention; regard; consider" and ''heng'' [[Wikt:衡|衡]] "crosswise; balance beam; weigh; measure; judge; appreciate". English translations of the title include "Disquisitions" (Alfred Forke), "Critical Essays" ([[Fung Yu-lan]]), "The Balanced Inquiries" ([[Wing-tsit Chan]]), or "Discourses Weighed in the Balance" ([[Joseph Needham]]).

==Text==
The received ''Lunheng'' comprises 85 ''pian'' [[Wikt:篇|篇]] "articles; sections; chapters" in 30 ''juan'' [[Wikt:巻|巻]] "scrolls; volumes; books", with more than 200,000 [[Chinese characters|characters]]. Actually, 84 ''pian'' is more accurate because the text only contains the title of Chapter 44 ''Zhaozhi'' 招致.

Yang Wenchang (楊文昌) edited the first printed ''Lunheng'' edition, which was the basis for subsequent editions. Its 1045 CE preface notes that Yang compared 2 complete and 7 partial textual copies and corrected 11,259 characters.

"No commentaries to the ''Lun heng'' appear to have been written before the nineteenth century," write Pokora and Loewe (1993:311), which is unusual among Chinese classics. The first ''Lunheng'' commentators were [[Yu Yue]] (1821–1907), [[Sun Yirang]] (1848–1908), and [[Yang Shoujing]] (1839–1915).

==History==
Based on internal evidence, Forke (1907:9) concludes the [[Eastern Han Dynasty|Later Han Dynasty]] ''Lunheng'' text "must date" from the years 76-84 CE. Chapter 38 (齊世 "The Equality of the Ages", tr. Forke 1907:480) says, "Our present sage and enlightened sovereign is continuing the blessings and the prosperity of the reigns of" [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]] (r. 25-57 CE) and [[Emperor Ming of Han|Emperor Ming]] (r. 58-75 CE), which implies the period of [[Emperor Zhang of Han|Emperor Zhang]] (r. 75-88 CE). Chapter 30 (講瑞 "Arguments on Ominous Creatures", tr. Forke 1907:372) notes it was completed during the ''Jianchu'' 建初 [[Chinese era name|era]] (76-84 CE).

Fung (1953:151) notes the ''Lunheng'' "was probably completed" during the years 82 and 83 CE. "The authenticity of the work has not been brought into question", write Pokora and Loewe (1993:309), and the text "may possibly have been completed between 70 and 80", based upon collections of Wang's earlier writings or essays.

==Content==
The contents of the ''Lunheng'' are summarized by Pokora and Loewe.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In discussing natural phenomena and their implications or causes, matters of popular belief and misconception and political issues, the book is often written in polemical form. A controversial statement is made, to be followed by the author's critical rebuttal, which is often supported by quotations from earlier writings. In many ways the ''Lun heng'' may be regarded as an encyclopaedic collection of the claims and beliefs of Chinese religion, thought and folklore. (1993:313) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wang's ''Lunheng'' frequently espouses [[Daoist]] notions of naturalism. For example, Chapter 54 ''[[Ziran]]'' 自然 "Spontaneity" says.
&lt;blockquote&gt;By the fusion of the fluids [''[[qi]]''] of Heaven and Earth all things of the world are produced spontaneously, just as by the mixture of the fluids of husband and wife children are born spontaneously. Among the things thus produced, creatures with blood in their veins are sensitive of hunger and cold. Seeing that grain can be eaten, they use it as food, and discovering that silk and hemp can be worn, they take it as raiment. Some people are of opinion that Heaven produces grain for the purpose of feeding mankind, and silk and hemp to cloth them. That would be tantamount to making Heaven the farmer of man or his mulberry girl [who feeds the silkworms], it would not be in accordance with spontaneity, therefore this opinion is very questionable and unacceptable. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reasoning on Taoist principles we find that Heaven [''[[tian]]''] emits its fluid everywhere. Among the many things of this world grain dispels hunger, and silk and hemp protect from cold. For that reason man eats grain, and wears silk and hemp. That Heaven does not produce grain, silk, and hemp purposely, in order to feed and cloth[e] mankind, follows from the fact that by calamitous changes it does not intend to reprove man. Things are produced spontaneously, and man wears and eats them; the fluid changes spontaneously, and man is frightened by it, for the usual theory is disheartening. Where would be spontaneity, if the heavenly signs were intentional, and where inaction [''[[wu wei]]'']? (tr. Forke 1907:92, cf. Fung 1953:152 and Chan 1963:296) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Meekness''' is an attribute of human nature and behavior. It has been defined several ways: [[Righteousness|righteous]], [[Humility|humble]], teachable, and [[Patience|patient under suffering]], long suffering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/meekness The Free Dictionary, ''Meekness'']&lt;/ref&gt; willing to follow gospel teachings; an attribute of a true disciple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/meek-meekness?lang=eng&amp;letter=m LDS.org Guide to the Scriptures, ''meekness'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/03/meekness-a-dimension-of-true-discipleship?lang=eng Neal A. Maxwell, Meekness -- A Dimension of True Discipleship, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meekness has been contrasted with humility as referring to behavior towards others, whereas humility refers to an attitude towards oneself&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Cochran, ''Receptive Human Virtues'' (2011) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; – meekness meaning restraining one's own power,&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;Matthew (1806). ''A Discourse Concerning Meekness.'' Hilliard&lt;/ref&gt; so as to allow room for others.&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Bassett, ''Doctrinal Insight to the Book of Mormon'' (2008) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
*The Israelite Apostle Paul gave an example of meek behavior when writing to Timothy: "The servant of the Lord must be gentle, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves." ([[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Tim.]] 2:24–25)
*[[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] explained: "Meekness takes injuries like pills, not chewing, but swallowing them down." This indicates that meekness allows a person to overlook or forgive perceived insults or offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/meekness The Free Dictionary, ''Usages of meekness'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*The meek feature in the [[Beatitudes]], and were linked thereby to the classical virtue of [[magnanimity]] by [[Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Titus, ''Resilience and the Virtue of Fortitude'' (2006) p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
*A meek behavior is presented as being opposite to "the natural man" (i.e. one who acts strictly according to desires of the body): 'Put off the natural man and become meek.' ([[Book of Mormon]], Mosiah 3:19), and in 3 Nephi 12:5 when Jesus Christ appears to the people of ancient America after his Ascension to Heaven and teaches them the beatitudes.

*LDS Apostle Elder David A. Bednar said in April 2018, "Meekness is a defining attribute of the Redeemer and is distinguished by righteous responsiveness, willing submissiveness, and strong self-restraint." He further said, "Whereas humility generally denotes dependence upon God and the constant need for His guidance and support, a distinguishing characteristic of meekness is a particular spiritual receptivity to learning both from the Holy Ghost and from people who may seem less capable, experienced, or educated, who may not hold important positions, or who otherwise may not appear to have much to contribute."&lt;ref&gt;David A. Bednar (April 2018). [https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2018/04/meek-and-lowly-of-heart?lang=eng "Meek and Lowly of Heart"]. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
*[[Beethoven]] rejected meekness and equality in favor of cultural [[elitism]]: “''Power'' is the moral principle of those who excel others”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Maynard Solomon, ''Beethoven Essays'' (1988) p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nietzsche]] rejected Christian meekness as part of a parasitic revolt by the low against the lofty, the manly, and the high.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufman ed., ''The Portable Nietzsche'' (1987) p. 626-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other traditions==
*[[Buddhism]], like Christianity, strongly values meekness&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Carman, ''Majesty and Meekness'' (1994) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; – the Buddha himself (in an earlier life) featuring as the 'Preacher of Meekness' who patiently had his limbs lopped off by a jealous king without complaining.&lt;ref&gt;D. Schlinghoff, ''Studies in the Ajanta Paintings'' (1987) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Taoism]] valorized the qualities of submission and non-contention.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lau ed., ''Lao Tzu'' (1963) p. 25-9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Book of Numbers]] chapter 12 verse 3: Now the man [[Moses]] was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.
* In [[Islam]], faqr, sometimes translated as "''poverty''", is one of the central attitudes in a  [[Faqeer]]. It was also one of the attributes of the Prophet. He said "faqr is my pride". In a spiritual sense, faqr is defined as the absence of desire for wealth, recognition or for the blessings of the otherworld. One of the aspects of one who has embodied the true essence of faqr, is that the mystic will never ask anything of anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam |author=Annemarie Schimmel |page=121 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |orig-year=1975 |format=reprint |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8078-9976-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is for one to ask someone else for anything they would be relying on a created being.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11779">'''Meta-ontology''' is a term of recent origin first used by [[Peter van Inwagen]] in analyzing [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s critique of [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s metaphysics,&lt;ref name=Inwagen/&gt; where Quine introduced a formal technique for determining the [[ontological commitment]]s in a comparison of ontologies.&lt;ref name=Inwagen2/&gt;

==Overview==
Thomas Hofweber, while acknowledging that the use of the term is controversial, suggests that, although strictly construed  meta-ontology is a separate [[metatheory]] of ontology, the field of ontology can be more broadly construed as containing its metatheory.&lt;ref name=Hofweber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;  Advocates of the term seek to distinguish 'ontology', which investigates what there is, from 'meta'-ontology, which investigates what we are asking when we ask what there is.&lt;ref name=Inwagen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenkrantz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt;

Jonathan Schaffer argues that there is a different question for meta-ontology to discuss, namely the classification of ontologies according to the hierarchical connections between the objects in them, and the determination of which objects are fundamental and which are derived. He describes three possible types of ontology: ''flat'', that is an array of undifferentiated objects; ''sorted'', that is an array of classified objects; and ''ordered'', that is an array of inter-related objects. Schaffer says Quine's ontology is ''flat'', a mere listing of objects, while [[Aristotle]]'s is ''ordered'', with an emphasis upon identifying the most fundamental objects.&lt;ref name=Schaffer/&gt;

[[Amie Thomasson|Amie L. Thomasson]] says that the Carnap-Quine debate is misplaced when it focuses (as done by Van Inwagen&lt;ref name=Inwagen/&gt;) upon the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]] between entities: "The real distinction instead [that is, instead of the analytic-synthetic distinction] is between existence questions asked using a linguistic framework and existence questions that are supposed to be asked somehow without being subject to those rules—asked, as Quine puts it 'before the adoption of the given language'."&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt; These questions are what Carnap referred to as [[internal-external distinction]]s.

[[Image:Hochschule für Philosophie München.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance area of the Munich School of Philosophy]]
'''Munich School of Philosophy''' (German: ''Hochschule für Philosophie München'') is a small [[Jesuit]] higher education college in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] founded in 1925. In the German-speaking countries it is the only institution of higher education exclusively specialized in the study of [[philosophy]].

== History ==
Founded as a seminary at [[Pullach]] in 1925 by [[Augustin Bea]], first named the Berchmanskolleg, it obtained the ability to issue a [[doctorate]] in 1932. In 1971 the school moved to central [[Munich]] and opened to non-Jesuit students. The majority of students are not members of the Jesuit Order, and now include women and international students. It is accredited by the [[Bavarian State Ministry of Sciences, Research and the Arts]] (in German: ''Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst'').

Since 2009, the Munich School of Philosophy hosts the yearly ''Rahner Lecture'' in memory of the German Jesuit and theologian [[Karl Rahner]].

== Philosophical tradition ==
Most faculty members are [[Jesuits]]. The school has long stood in the tradition of [[Neo-Scholasticism]]. Only since the 1970s, when the school opened to non-Jesuit students, [[contemporary philosophy]] such as [[marxism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[analytic philosophy]] have gained more prominence in the undergraduate and postgraduate education. To date, the undergraduate curriculum at the Munich School of Philosophy places much emphasis on the [[history of philosophy]] and issues pertaining to the study of [[religion]].

As a [[Jesuit]] school, its objectives and purpose must be in accord with the [[apostolic constitution]] ''Sapientia Christiana'', Art. 79 and 80 in research and teaching:
# to promote the study of philosophy and its history;
# to reflect systematically on fundamental issues of religious faith and to elucidate the affiliation between philosophy and theology;
# to analyze and develop the contributions of other sciences towards philosophy;
# to apply the insights gained from these theoretical endeavors to practical concerns of human and social life.

== Notable alumni and faculty members ==

=== Faculty ===
[[Harald Lesch]] is a German physicist, astronomer, natural philosopher, author, television presenter, and professor of physics at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] (LMU) and lecturer of [[natural philosophy]] at the Munich School of Philosophy.

=== Alumni ===
Notable alumni include former [[minister-president]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] [[Erwin Teufel]] and German politician and CDU party member [[Heiner Geißler]].

== Research centers ==
The Munich School of Philosophy has six distinctive research centers:
* Institute for Social and Development Studies (''German: Institut für Gesellschaftspolitik/IGP'')
* Institute for Communications and Media Research (''German: Institut für Kommunikationswissenschaft und Erwachsenenpädagogik/IKE'')
* Institute for Philosophy of Religion (''German: Institut für Religionsphilosophie/IRP'')
* Institute for Scientific Issues related to Philosophy and Theology (''German: Institut für naturwissenschaftliche Grenzfragen zur Philosophie und Theologie/ING'')
* Institute for Philosophy and Leadership (''German: Institut für Philosophie und Leadership'')
* Rottendorf Project (''German: Rottendorf Projekt)

== Rankings ==
The Munich School of Philosophy is currently not ranked in any major university web rankings due to its specialization in [[philosophy]]. It frequently cooperates with faculty members of two Munich universities, the [[Technical University Munich]] and the [[Ludwig-Maximilians-University]] which are both consistently ranked among Germany's foremost universities.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}
{{Postmodernism}}

'''Neotribalism''' (a.k.a. '''neo-tribalism''' and '''modern tribalism''') is a sociological concept which postulates that [[human evolution|human beings have evolved]] to live in [[tribalism|tribal society]], as opposed to [[mass society]], and thus will naturally form [[social network]]s constituting new  "[[tribe]]s".

==Sociological theory==
French sociologist [[Michel Maffesoli]] was perhaps the first to use the term ''neotribalism'' in a scholarly context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maffesoli|first=Michel |title=The Time of the Tribes: The Decline of Individualism in Mass Society|year=1996|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maffesoli predicted that as the culture and institutions of [[modernism]] declined, societies would embrace [[nostalgia]] and look to the organizational principles of the distant past for guidance, and that therefore the [[post-modern]] era would be the era of neotribalism.

Work by researchers such as American political scientist [[Robert D.

The '''New Testament Household Codes''' (''Haustafeln''), also known as '''New Testament Domestic Codes''', consist of instructions in the [[New Testament]] writings of the apostles [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] and [[Apostle Peter|Peter]] to pairs of Christian people in different domestic and civil structures of society. The main foci of the Household Codes are upon husband/wife, parent/child, and master/slave relationships. The Codes apparently were developed to urge the new first century Christians to comply with the non-negotiable requirements of Roman [[Patria Potestas]] law, and to meet the needs for order within the fledgling churches.&lt;ref name=EFStagg&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank Stagg. ''Woman in the World of Jesus''. Westminster Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-664-24195-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crouch/&gt; The two main passages that explain these relationships and duties are [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] {{Bibleref2-nb|Eph|5:22-6:9}} and [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]] {{Bibleref2-nb|Col|3:18-4:1}}. An underlying Household Code is also reflected in 1&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;2:1ff., 8ff.; 3:1ff., 8ff.; 5:17ff.; 6:1f.; {{Bibleref2|Titus|2:1-10}} and {{Bibleref2|1Pet|2:13-3:7||1&amp;nbsp;Peter&amp;nbsp;2:13-3:7}}. Historically, [[proof texts]] from the New Testament Household Codes—from the first century to the present day—have been used to define a married Christian woman's role in relation to their husbands, and to disqualify women from primary ministry positions in Christian churches.&lt;ref&gt;Newsom, Carol A. and Sharon H.

Accessed 14 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Others more positively interpret the ''Haustafeln'' passages to be "Peter and Paul’s radical Christian 'remix' that often passes unnoticed by modern readers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/mutuality-household-codes |title=Submission in Context: Christ and the Greco-Roman Household Codes |website=Rachelheldevans.com |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term ''Haustafel''==
The German word ''Haustafel'' ("house table"), plural ''Haustafeln'', refers to a summary table of specific actions members of each domestic pair in a household are expected to perform. The term is said to have been coined by [[Martin Luther]]. A ''Haustafel'' is included in [[Luther's Small Catechism]].&lt;ref name=Gombis/&gt;

==Historical setting==
According to certain studies, the public life of women in the time of [[Jesus]] was far more restricted than in Old Testament times.&lt;ref name=EFStagg/&gt;{{rp|p.52}} At the time the apostles were writing their letters concerning the ''Household Codes'' ''(Haustafeln)'', Roman law vested enormous power ''([[Patria Potestas]])'', lit. "the rule of the fathers") in the husband over his "family" ''([[pater familias]])'' which included his wife, children, agnatic descendants, slaves, and freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patria%20potestas |title=Patria Potestas &amp;#124; Definition of Patria potestas by Merriam-Webster |website=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally this power was absolute and included the power of life and death. He could acknowledge, banish, kill, or disown a child. A first-century jurist recounts the story of a man beating his wife to death because she had drunk some wine. His neighbors approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenintheancientworld.com/patriapotestas.htm |title=Patria Potestas: The Law And The Reality For Women |website=Womenintheancientworld.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church-state relations in the [[Roman Empire]] at the time were far from ideal.
* The Christians rejected ancestral [[pagan]] customs and [[Hellenistic religion]]s.
* Christian preaching about a new king [[Jesus]] sounded like revolution.
* Christians were often very unpopular and severe [[religious persecution]] of them had begun.
* Paul's success at [[Ephesus]] had provoked a riot to defend the cult of the goddess [[Artemis]].
* In 64 AD, the [[Great Fire of Rome]] destroyed over seventy percent of Rome. A rumor had gone forth which accused [[Nero]] of starting the fire himself, and that he had even sung a song from his Palace tower as he watched the flames engulf the city. At that time Christians were a rather obscure religious sect with a small following in the city. To "suppress this rumor" according to [[Tacitus]], Nero blamed the Christians and killed a “vast multitude” of them as scapegoats. Nero supported widespread [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]], including having his victims fed to the lions during giant spectacles held in the city's remaining amphitheater. He took pleasure in the Christian persecutions and even offered many of them upon stakes to be burned to death as torches for his parties. Many others of them were sewn into skins of animals and fed to starving dogs while the mob cheered.&lt;ref&gt;"The Burning of Rome, 64 AD", EyeWitness to History, www.eyewitnesstohistory.com (1999). Accessed 15 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of the concept==
In a Tübingen dissertation, James E. Crouch&lt;ref name=Crouch&gt;Crouch, James E. ''The Origin and Intention of the Colossian Haustafel''. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; identifies {{Bibleref2|Colossians|3:18-4:1}} as the earliest traceable form of the Christian Household Code, with further developments being found in Ephesians, the pastorals, and 1&amp;nbsp;Peter (as well as in early patristic literature: [[First Epistle of Clement|1&amp;nbsp;Clement]], [[Polycarp]], [[Didache]], and [[Epistle of Barnabas|Barnabas]]). Crouch concludes that the early Christians found in [[Hellenistic Judaism]] a Code which they adapted and [[Christianization|Christianized]].

The concept of Household Codes was borrowed from Greek and Roman ethics, according to Suzanne Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henderson|first=Suzanne Watts|title=Taking Liberties with the Text: The Colossians Household Code As Hermeneutic Paradigm|journal=[[Interpretation (journal)|Interpretation]]|year=2006|volume=60|issue=4|pages=420–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that over the past century, scholars have identified a range of parallels between the Colossians Household Code and the writings of the Greco-Roman world. She writes that [[Martin Dibelius]] emphasized the influence of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] thought, while others have argued that the Code "bears the influence of Hellenistic Jewish writers such as [[Philo]] and [[Josephus]].

Stagg writes:
::"The form of the Code stressing reciprocal social duties is traced to Judaism's own Oriental background, with its strong moral/ethical demand but also with a low view of woman.... At bottom is probably to be seen the perennial tension between freedom and order.... What mattered to (Paul) was 'a new creation'{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|6:15}} and 'in Christ' there is 'not any Jew not Greek, not any slave nor free, not any male and female{{' "}}.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}, pp. 187ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intent of the Codes==
Various theologians have assorted opinions as to why the apostles wrote the Codes in the first place, and then why they were directed to a variety of recipients in several New Testament passages. Some believe that the intent of the Codes is not universal throughout the passages in which they appear. They believe it necessary to determine the specific function of a Code within a specific New Testament passage. Timothy Gombis&lt;ref name=Gombis/&gt; posits that the most important factor in determining the purpose of the Code is to consider the literary context in which it appears.
# An apologetic thrust
# For order within churches and society
# To humanize antagonistic domestic relationships
# Responsibility and mutual respect
# Manifesto for maintaining hierarchical attitudes

Though the suggested intents have some common threads, the following are what appear to be the predominant theories of the original intent of the Household Codes of Paul and Peter:

=== An apologetic thrust ===
Margaret MacDonald argues that the ''Haustafel'', particularly as it appears in Ephesians, was aimed at “reducing the tension between community members and outsiders.”&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Margaret. ''The Pauline Churches: A Socio-historical Study of Institutionalization in the Pauline and Deutero-Pauline Writings''. SNTSMS 60; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. p109&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Christian Church, from its inception until the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#Under Nero|persecution under Nero]] in 64 AD, was tolerated by the Roman authorities who regarded it as merely another Jewish sect.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/persecution-russell.html |title=Roman Persecution of the Early Church by Adrian Russell |website=EarlyChurch.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The relationship between the Church and Judaism was far more tempestuous as can be seen within the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. Prior to the burning of Rome, their persecution was from the Jews. The Christians were regarded by both the common people and the authorities as being separatists. The Christian lifestyle itself distanced it from that of the pagan world.&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt;

During the first centuries, imperial Roman authorities considered Christian loyalty to Christ as disloyalty to their state. Toivo Pilli reports that the vast majority of Rome’s citizens and subjects experienced no burden of conscience even to public human sacrifices. The views of Christians tended to be seen quite differently since they added theological and ethical evaluation to all civil acts. When Christians opposed an imperial cult, they were deemed to have denied the emperor’s right to rule. Toivo Pilli writes how [[Pliny the Younger]] (61 AD – ca. 112 AD) explained his policy for dealing with Christians:
:If for three times they did not deny being Christians, he sentenced them to death, because "whatever kind of crime it may be to which they have confessed, their pertinacity and inflexible obstinacy should certainly be punished".&lt;ref name=Pilli&gt;Pilli, Toivo. "Christians as Citizens of a Persecuting State". ''Journal of European Baptist Studies''. September 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilli argues that Christians may have taken too literally the attitude of the first apostles: "We must obey God rather than men".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|4:19-20,5:29}} He characterizes it as a "curiously subversive" text when compared with {{Bibleref2|Romans|13}} which opens with the injunction to "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established".&lt;ref name=Pilli/&gt;

Theologian Timothy Gombis,&lt;ref name=Gombis/&gt; in his scholarly article about the ''Haustafel'' in Ephesians, says that biblical scholars have typically treated it as a resource in the debate over the role of women in ministry and in the home. Without agreeing with that view, Gombis finds that most scholars regard the ''Haustafel'' to have an apologetic thrust in Ephesians. This majority view is that Paul was attempting to shield the new Christian movement from the suspicion that it might undermine contemporary social structures and ultimately threaten the stability of the Roman empire. Gombis cites [[Craig Keener]] as claiming that:
::“groups accused of undermining the moral fabric of Roman society thus sometimes protested that they instead conformed to traditional Roman values, by producing their own lists, or ‘Household Codes’, fitting those normally used in their day.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig S. Keener|Keener, Craig]]. ''Paul, Women and Wives: Marriage and Women’s Ministry in the Letters of Paul''. Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1992. 145–46&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, Gombis cites David Balch's book about the Code in {{Bibleref2|1Pet|2:13–3:9||1&amp;nbsp;Pet.&amp;nbsp;2:13–3:9}}. Balch concludes that both [[Philo]] and [[Josephus]] used similar strategies when facing accusations that Jewish proselytism was ruining the social fabric of Roman society.&lt;ref&gt;Balch, David L. ''Let Wives Be Submissive: The Domestic Code in 1 Peter''. SBLMS 26; Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1981, p54&lt;/ref&gt;

===For order within churches and society===
Commentators have noted similarities between the New Testament Household Codes and [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of families in Book One of [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]].&lt;ref name="Balch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cere|first=Daniel Mark|author-link=Daniel Cere|title=Does Christianity Teach Male Headship?: The Equal-Regard Marriage and Its Critics|chapter=Marriage, Subordination and the Development of Christian Doctrine|year=2004|publisher=[[Eerdmans]]|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrUOdcUyyYIC&amp;pg=PA94|editor-last=Blankenhorn|editor-first=David|editor-link=David Blankenhorn|editor2-last=Browning|editor2-first=Don S.|editor3-last=Van Leeuwen|editor3-first=Mary Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aristotelian tradition specified that "the first and least parts of a family are master and slave, husband and wife, father and children"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|quote=Seeing then that the state is made up of households, before speaking of the state we must speak of the management of the household. The parts of the household are the persons who compose it, and a complete household consists of slaves and freemen. Now we should begin by examining everything in its least elements; and the first and least parts of a family are master and slave, husband and wife, father and children. We have therefore to consider what each of these three relations is and ought to be:—I mean the relation of master and servant, of husband and wife, and thirdly of parent and child.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
David Balch maintains that "the Household Codes in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] and [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]] clearly reflect the choice of an Aristotelian tradition of discourse on Household management" and that the structure of the Ephesians passage "is similar to [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of the Household in Book One of ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'': three pairs of social classes (husbands/wives, parents/children, masters/slaves), with the classes reciprocally related, and one class in each pair ruling, while the other is to be ruled." Others, however, suggest that the New Testament Household Codes are significantly different from their predecessors, in that they "do not give absolute power to the men, but instead require a high degree of responsibility and mutual respect for all members of Christian families."&lt;ref name=Felix-Just/&gt;

New Testament scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] finds the basic tenets of the Code in [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of the household in Book One of ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as well as in [[Philo]]'s ''Hypothetica 7.14''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=
(7.14) Do not these objects appear to you to be of greater importance than any other pursuit can possibly be? Therefore they do not go to interpreters of laws to learn what they ought to do; and even without asking, they are in no ignorance respecting the laws, so as to be likely, through following their own inclinations, to do wrong; but if you violate or alter any one of the laws, or if you ask any one of them about their national laws or customs, they can all tell you at once, without any difficulty; and the husband appears to be a master, endowed with sufficient authority to explain these laws to his wife, a father to teach them to his children, and a master to his servants.
|author=[[Philo]]

|work=The Works of Philo
|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book37.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes the several occurrences of the Code in the New Testament were intended to meet the needs for order within the churches and in the society of the day, essentially restraints to meet the threats of moral anarchy. Labeling it as ''libertinism'', Stagg envisions a scenario in which for some of Paul's hearers, particularly women and slaves, being freed from "The Law" was an invitation to reject all restraint.&lt;ref name=Stagg/&gt;

Similarly, Crouch concludes that the Household Code was developed to counteract the threat of a form of "enthusiasm", such as that which appeared within some of the new Christian churches, that was threatening to undermine the basic structures of first century society. Crouch comments that women and slaves, in particular, sought to extend their new-found Christian freedom to relationships outside the church as well as within it.&lt;ref name=Crouch/&gt;

Galatians is considered by many scholars (including Stagg) to be one of Paul's earliest extant writings.&lt;ref name=Bruce&gt;Bruce, F.F. ''Commentary on Galatians'' (NIGNT), 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words, Paul says "I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it".{{Bibleref2c|Galatians|1:13}} On his way to Damascus he was confronted by the risen Jesus in a heavenly vision. According to the three separate accounts in Acts, [[Saul]] found himself on the ground, blinded by the intensity of a heavenly light. The risen Jesus gave Saul a commission to "be a light to the Gentiles". Called to be "God’s great missionary to the Gentiles",&lt;ref name=Bilezikian&gt;Bilezikian, Gilbert. ''Beyond Sex Roles''. Baker Book House, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8010-0885-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul also can claim what Bilezikian has termed "an inaugural statement" in the New Testament:

{{Quotation|There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.|{{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}}}

Because of Paul's exhortations throughout Galatians about [[Christian freedom|freedom "in Christ"]], Galatians has been called “the Magna Carta of the Reformation” and Luther’s “Katie von Bora.” It is the book on which the Protestant Reformation was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.org/seriespage/galatians-introduction-argument-and-outline |title=9. Galatians: Introduction, Argument, and Outline |website=Bible.org |date=2004-06-27 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[F.F. Bruce]] writes that the purpose of this letter to the Galatian Christians was to refute the [[Judaizers]]’ false gospel—a gospel in which these [[Jewish Christians]] felt that [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]] was essential to [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]]—and to remind the Galatians of the real basis of their salvation. It was the urgency of the situation which moved Paul to write even before the [[Council of Jerusalem|Jerusalem Council]] convened, for the churches of Galatia were at stake.&lt;ref name="Bruce"/&gt;

Stagg&lt;ref name=Stagg/&gt; addresses the question of why so much of the Christian Household Code is found in what is generally recognized as the Pauline tradition. He points to a seeming irony that the Code in the New Testament is associated with the apostle who fought so openly and suffered such personal sacrifice for both freedom and equity for Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female. Citing the complexities with which Paul had to deal after his historic proclamation in Galatians 3:28, Stagg concludes that the New Testament Household Code was not a simple situation in which one man "single-handedly imposed male chauvinism on Gentile churches." He suggests that Paul's strong emphases stemmed from the "perennial tension between freedom and order." Pointing out that freedom is ever at the risk of its abuse in terms of permissiveness, disorder, anarchy, or chaos, "the twin threats of legalism and libertinism are ancient and recurrent". Stagg{{rp|p.188}} notes that various New Testament books reflect "this ongoing struggle for a proper relationship between law and grace, gift and demand, freedom and responsibility". He conjectures that this situation must have become acute in the early churches, especially among women and slaves who had suffered most under the heaviest restraints. Therefore, they understandably would want to make the most of their new freedom "in Christ", and Stagg concludes that Paul found himself at the center of the battle.

===To humanize antagonistic domestic relationships===
Michael Parsons takes the stance that the apostles' goal in developing the Christian Codes was to humanize relationships which, in the society of their own day, had become "battlefields of contempt and antagonism." They did this by introducing into the "new creation" relationships{{Bibleref2c|2cor|5:17|NIV|2&amp;nbsp;Cor.&amp;nbsp;5:17}} that which had been lost: namely, human dignity, particularly among women and slaves. While acknowledging that the Household Codes did not originate with Christianity, he considers them being "radically transformed by the Christian authors".&lt;ref name=Parsons&gt;{{cite journal
|url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/vox/vol18/slavery_parsons.pdf
|accessdate=14 Feb 2013
|author=Parsons, Michael
|title=Slavery and the New Testament: Equality and Submissiveness
|work= Vox Evangelica
|issue=18
|year=1988
|pages= 90–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He writes that the apostles used the contemporary form of the ''Haustafeln'' in their ethical instruction with "creative and imaginative pastoral insight". He does not think that the apostles, generally, are making social statements on prevailing customs. Instead, they are asking the question, "What does it mean to be 'in Christ' in this situation?" or "What is the relationship between Christian freedom and this social institution?" Parsons finds the implications to be profound. Even slaves are responsible; the possibility of living a Christian life depends solely on Christ’s grace―not circumstance.&lt;ref name=Parsons/&gt;

Parsons maintains that the ''Haustafeln'' in Ephesians and Colossians are clearly written to those ''within'' the church, not those outside. Many believe that in the 2&amp;nbsp;Corinthians passage, the apostle Paul is speaking to situations of, at a minimum, potential disorder in the churches—to include the breaking of all social order. Therefore, he believes the purpose of the New Testament Household Codes likely was a call to order in an unruly church. But Parsons says whatever the overall purpose of each particular ''Haustafel'' might have been, it is certain that the paired relationships are explained by their relationship to Christ. "Correspondingly new behavior is expected from Christian believers in each of those social situations. Each member of the three pairs is equal to the other 'in Christ', but they are not to presume on that new position and make it an excuse for behaving in any unchristian manner." There is no room in an "in Christ" relationship for feelings of antagonism, of superiority and inferiority, or of dehumanizing pride.&lt;ref name=Parsons/&gt;

===Responsibility and mutual respect===
Jesuit author Felix Just also finds similarities between many other Greco-Roman moral writings and four of the later New Testament epistles (letters). The biblical Household Codes contain instructions for particular groups of people within Christian families or "Households" as to how they should treat other members of their Household. He writes that most people in the first-century Roman Empire took it for granted that a ''[[pater familias]]'' had absolute authority and control over ''his'' Household. Thus, the secular examples of such "Household Codes" usually just indicated how slaves, children, or wives should act toward their masters, fathers, or husbands, respectively. They quite rarely also tell the adult men how they should treat the slaves, children, or wives who are members of their household.

According to author Felix Just, these New Testament texts do not give absolute power to the men. Instead, they require a high degree of responsibility and mutual respect from all members of Christian families, but "do not show the full equality of the various members of a household" compared to modern [[Gender equality|egalitarian]] views.&lt;ref name=Felix-Just&gt;{{cite web|author=Just, Felix |title=Household Codes in the New Testament
|url=http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/Epistles-HouseholdCodes.htm
|accessdate= 14 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manifesto for maintaining hierarchical attitudes===
Timothy Gombis argues that in the [[Letter to the Ephesians]], [[Paul of Tarsus]] was laying out "a manifesto for the New Humanity, painting in broad strokes a vision for how believers ought to conduct themselves in new creation communities". He believes the ''status quo'' in at least the Ephesians' world was patterned after the character of what he calls the "Old Humanity"—"selfish and self-destructive behavior" that was oriented according to that of its rulers.

In {{Bibleref2|Eph|5:18–21||Ephesians&amp;nbsp;5:18-21}}, Gombis says Paul gives a comprehensive view of what relationships ''ought to look like'' in the New Humanity. He continues, "The Haustafel, therefore, is a manifesto for the new creation people of God and does not merely have the modern notion of the nuclear family in view, though certainly it includes this. In short, it presents a comprehensive view of how relationships in what he terms "the New Humanity" ''should'' be structured.
Gombis writes:
::"The Old Humanity has been corrupted by the malign influence of the powers and authorities, and the New Humanity—the Church—is the new creation people of God, created 'according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth' (Eph. 4:24) and wholly oriented by the self-sacrificial love of Christ".

He finally concludes that Paul is not simply being socially conservative by maintaining a place for hierarchicalism, nor is he merely trying to shield early Christian communities from imperial pressure. Rather, Paul's "exhortations are radical in that they directly confront and subvert the social structures of [first century] contemporary society".&lt;ref name=Gombis/&gt;

The '''Oratory of the Holy Face''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Oratory (worship)| prayer oratory]] in [[Tours]] France. It is the site where devotions to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] started in Tours by Venerable [[Leo Dupont]] based on messages reported by Sister [[Marie of St. Peter]]. It receives many Catholic pilgrims every year.

The site (now at 8 rue Bernard Palissy, Tours) was originally the drawing room of Venerable [[Leo Dupont]] where he continuously burned a vigil lamp before an image of the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] based on a painting of the [[Veil of Veronica]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506&lt;/ref&gt; Dupont also used to invite people to pray in front of the image of the Holy Face of Jesus at the oratory. Dupont was inspired to pray to the Holy Face of Jesus based on the messages of the [[Carmelite]] nun Sister [[Marie of St. Peter]].

When Leo Dupont died in 1876, his house on Rue St. Etienne in Tours was purchased by the Archdiocese of Tours and turned into a [[oratory (worship)|prayer oratory]]. Archbishop [[Charles-Théodore Colet]] of Tours then approved of an order of priests called the [[Priests of the Holy Face]] to administer the chapel. The order was canonically erected in 1876 and Father Peter Javier, a friend of Dupont, was appointed as its director.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic encyclopedia [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15002a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oratory, and Dupont's prayers have been associated with a large number of reported cures.
The [[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|Dublin Review]] of 1885 reported that Mgr. Paul Guerin testified to having himself seen over 6000 certificates of cures wrought by virtue of the miraculous oil from the lamp in the oratory.&lt;ref&gt;The Dublin review, 1885, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Pope Leo XIII]] who approved of the Holy Face devotions in 1885 also expressed a desire to establish a similar oratory in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The New Zealand Tablet, 1892, page 31 [http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZT18920304.2.48&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----0-all]&lt;/ref&gt;This was eventually opened in the Via Pietro Cavallini in 1891 and administered by the Priests, but was demolished in subsequent redevelopment. &lt;ref&gt;Mario Armellini: Chiese di Roma 1891 p.794&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of well known Catholics have prayed at the oratory, e.g. Saints [[Marie-Azélie Guérin Martin|Louis and Blessed Zelie Martin]], the parents of Saint [[Thérèse of Lisieux]].&lt;ref&gt;Paulinus Redmond, 1995 ''Louis and Zelie Martin: The Seed and the Root of the Little Flower'' Cimino Press {{ISBN|1-899163-08-5}} page 257&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Therese was introduced to the devotion by her blood sister Celine and was later called ''Saint Therese of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face''. The poems and prayers she wrote helped to spread the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus.

'''Poul Martin Møller''' (21 March 1794 – 13 March 1838)&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p101&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Danish academic, writer, and poet. During his lifetime, he gained renown in Denmark for his poetry. After his death, his posthumously published fiction and philosophical writings were well received. He also devoted several decades of study to [[classical language]]s and literature. While serving as a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]], he was a mentor to the philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref name=Hannay2001p48&gt;{{Harvnb|Hannay|2001|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Møller was born near [[Vejle]] and raised on the island of [[Lolland]], where his father served as a pastor.&lt;ref name=Garff2004p87&gt;{{Harvnb|Garff|2004|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, his father tutored him in classical languages and literature.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p102&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 he enrolled in the University of Copenhagen and studied [[theology]]. He also taught religion at a nearby school during this time.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p102/&gt; He graduated as the [[valedictorian]] of his class three and a half years later.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p102/&gt; In 1815 he published his first poem.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p103&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a stint as the tutor of two young [[count]]s, he returned to Copenhagen to study classical [[philology]].&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p103/&gt;  After an unsuccessful [[proposal of marriage]] to his childhood sweetheart,&lt;ref name=Garff2004p87/&gt; he left Copenhagen to serve as the pastor of a ship during its two-year journey to China. While on the journey, he read the complete works of [[Cicero]], wrote poetry, and wrote in his journal.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p103/&gt; After returning to Copenhagen, he began teaching Greek and writing poetry and fiction. He later successfully proposed to his first wife, with whom he had four sons.&lt;ref name=Garff2004p88&gt;{{Harvnb|Garff|2004|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1826 to 1832, he taught at the [[Royal Frederick University]] in [[Oslo|Christiania]].&lt;ref name=Hannay2001p47&gt;{{Harvnb|Hannay|2001|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he rose from assistant professor to full professor, he disliked living in Norway and returned to Denmark. [[Image:Poul Martin Møller på dødslejet.jpg|thumb|alt=A picture of Poul Martin Møller's death mask.|Poul Martin Møller on his deathbed. Lithography of the death mask.]]Although eccentric, notoriously disheveled,&lt;ref name=Garff2004p87/&gt; and prone to becoming distracted during lessons, his good nature and pleasant disposition allowed him to become a popular teacher.&lt;ref name=Hannay2001p47/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p104&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p107&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, he was promoted to Professor Extraordinary at the University of Copenhagen, where he taught [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[classics|classical literature]], and [[ethics|moral philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Hannay2001p48/&gt; His first wife died in 1834, an event which left him shaken to the core and almost unable to function.&lt;ref name=Garff2004p88/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p107/&gt; Two years later, he married a friend of his late wife. He fathered a daughter with his second wife before succumbing to what was most likely [[liver cancer]] in March 1838.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p107/&gt;

==Writings==
While working as a teacher he wrote extensively, working on poetry, a novel, and translating literature into Danish. He published translations of both contemporary and classical authors, including [[Lord Byron|Lord Byron's]] “The Dream” and a portion of [[The Odyssey]].&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p103/&gt; Due to his habit of writing very slowly and later rewriting his work, he was never able to publish much of his work. The largest work that he published during his lifetime was a translation of the first six books of The Odyssey.&lt;ref name=Garff2004p88/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p104/&gt; He was most successful as a poet; his poem "Joy Over Denmark" became one of the most famous Danish poems.&lt;ref name=Garff2004p88/&gt; Though unfinished, Møller's novel ''Adventures of a Danish Student'' also gained lasting fame. It tells the comedic story of the romantic escapades of an eccentric student and his philosophical musings. Years later it became a favorite book of the Danish physicist and thinker [[Niels Bohr]], who often quoted it during lectures.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p122&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aaserud|2005|p=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death, he charged his stepbrother Christian Winter and his colleague Fredrick Olsen with the task of publishing his writing posthumously. Although Møller's unfocused nature made this a difficult task, they were eventually able to publish nine volumes by 1850. After these volumes were published, Møller's reputation greatly improved among the Danish public.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p110&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p109&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small portion of his philosophical writings were able to be published.&lt;ref name=Garff2004p88/&gt;

==Relationship with Kierkegaard==
Møller is perhaps best known for relationship with Søren Kierkegaard. They first met when Møller was teaching at the University of Copenhagen and they also lived in the same square in Copenhagen from 1836 to 1838. Møller was also well acquainted with Søren's brother [[Peter Kierkegaard|Peter]].&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p117&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years after Møller's death, Kierkegaard dedicated his work [[The Concept of Anxiety]] to him with remarks which were unusually personal for Kierkegaard.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p110/&gt; An unpublished draft of the dedication was even more emphatic, referring to Møller as the "inspiration of my youth" and "the mighty trumpet of my awakening".&lt;ref name=Hannay2001p97&gt;{{Harvnb|Hannay|2001|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|To the late Professor Poul Martin Møller, The happy lover of Greek culture, the admirer of Homer, the confidant of Socrates, the interpreter of Aristotle, Denmark’s joy in “Joy over Denmark,” though “widely traveled” always “remembered in the Danish summer,” the object of my profound admiration, my profound loss, this work is dedicated. ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', dedication}} {{Quotation|Poul Moller has correctly pointed out that a court fool uses more wit in one year than many a witty author in his whole life, and why is that if it is not because the former is an existing person who every moment of the day must have witnesses at his disposal, whereas the other is witty only momentarily. ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', Hong p. 351-352}}

In his journals, Kierkegaard notes that Møller provided him advice about the study of philosophy and communication. Part of Møller's influence came through his lectures on moral philosophy and the Greek and Roman classics that Kierkegaard attended while a student at the University of Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=Hannay2001p48/&gt; In addition to classroom instructions, they also frequented Møller's favorite [[tea house]].&lt;ref name=Garff2004p88/&gt; Kierkegaard adopted Møller's preferred method of writing, recording his thoughts in a short mixture of poetry and prose, into his own journals.&lt;ref name=Garff2004p97&gt;{{Harvnb|Garff|2004|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard records that shortly before his death, Møller cautioned him regarding the [[polemic]]al tone that he had adopted. Kierkegaard, however, viewed his tone as consistent with the [[New Testament]] writers.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p116&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p60&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2009|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
There is also significant common ground between the philosophical views of Møller and Kierkegaard, in large part due to Møller's tutelage. After Møller's writings were published posthumously, Kierkegaard studied them in great detail.&lt;ref name=Garff2004p89&gt;{{Harvnb|Garff|2004|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally believed that Møller had a [[maieutics|maieutic]] relationship with Kierkegaard, hence Kierkegaard's description of Møller as, “the confidant of [[Socrates]]”.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p109/&gt; They often debated the subjects of irony and humor, favorite topics of Kierkegaard's.&lt;ref name=Jensen2009p117/&gt;  Although Møller had studied the works of Hegel in great depth, he later became skeptical of [[Hegelianism|Hegel's philosophy]]. He felt that Hegel's philosophy was limited because of its abstractness. In his attack on Hegelianism in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'', Kierkegaard cites Møller as an opponent of Hegel.&lt;ref name=Hannay2001p48/&gt; Another similarity is the dislike both men felt toward philosophical systems that emphasized thought without feeling.&lt;ref name="Garff2004p87"/&gt; Møller highly valued personal authenticity in philosophy and preferred the use of [[aphorism]]s over discursive arguments.&lt;ref name=Hannay2001p48/&gt; Kierkegaard greatly appreciated the lighthearted satirical tone of Møller's as a departure from the serious scholarly tone of many of their contemporary philosophers.&lt;ref name=Garff2004p94&gt;{{Harvnb|Garff|2004|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Møller's philosophy was also influenced by the theological work of the [[speculative theist]] philosopher [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon Stewart (ed.), ''A Companion to Kierkegaard'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2015, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2389">'''Presentationism''' (from Latin ''prae-esse'', ''praesens'', present) is a philosophical term used in various senses deriving from the general sense of the term ''presentation''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Presentationism |volume=22 |page=298 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] (cf. ''Manual of Psychology'', i. 57), presentations are whatever constituents or our total experience at any moment directly determine the nature of the object as it is perceived or thought of at that moment. In [[James Mark Baldwin|Baldwin]]'s ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', vol. ii., a presentation is an object in the special form under which it is cognized at any given moment of perceptual or ideational process. This, the widest definition of the term, due largely to Professor [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]], thus includes both perceptual and ideational processes. The term has, indeed, been narrowed so as to include ideation, the correlative representation being utilized for ideal presentation, but in general the wider use is preferred.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

When the mind is cognizing an object, the object presents itself to the senses or to thought in one of a number of different forms (e.g. a picture is a work of art, a saleable commodity, a representation of a house, etc.). Presentation is thus essentially a cognitive process. Hence the most important use of the term presentationism, which is defined by Ward, in ''Mind'', N.S. (1893), ii. 58, as a doctrine the gist of which is that all the elements of psychical life are primarily and ultimately cognitive elements. This use takes precedence of two others: (1) that of Hamilton, for presentative as opposed to representative theories of knowledge, and (2) that of some later writers who took it as equivalent to [[Phenomenon|phenomenon]]. Ward traces the doctrine in his sense to [[David Hume]], to whom the mind is a kind of theatre in which perceptions appear and vanish continually (see Green and Grose edition of ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;534). The main problem is as to whether psychic activity is presented or not. Ward holds that it is not presented or presentable save indirectly.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

'''Pyotr Andreyevich Kikin'''  (Russian: Пётр Андреевич Кикин; 27 December 1775, [[Alatyr, Chuvash Republic|Alatyr]] - 18 May 1834, [[Saint Petersburg]]?) was a Russian general and a Secretary of State under Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]].

== Biography ==
He was one of twelve children born to Major Andrei Kikin (1747-1790) and his wife Maria Yermolova (1754-1819). His baptismal name was Bartholomei, but he never used it. As soon as he was old enough to take some responsibility, he was enrolled in the Guards and was a sergeant by the age of ten. He later studied in a boarding school at [[Moscow University]]&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{ВТ-ЭСБЕ|Кикин, Петр Андреевич}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began his regular military career as an ensign in the [[Semyonovsky Regiment]]. From 1806 to 1812, he fought in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)|Russo-Turkish War]],&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; serving as an [[adjutant]] under General [[Ivan Ivanovich Michelson|Michelson]].
[[File:Glrx-Kikin.jpg|thumb|185px|left|His wife, Maria (1787-1828). Portrait by [[Karl Bryullov]], one of the first painters to benefit from Kikin's art society.]]
He was promoted to colonel and almost immediately became involved in the [[French invasion of Russia]], serving in the [[Russian Army order of battle (1812)|First Western Army]]. He was wounded in the eye at the [[Battle of Valutino]] and was injured in a counter-attack at the [[Battle of Borodino]], but was still able to fight at the [[Battle of Krasnoi]]. In 1813, he was awarded the [[Order of St. George]] of the Third Degree and the [[Order of St. Alexander Nevsky]].&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://www.museum.ru/museum/1812/Persons/slovar/sl_k18.html Brief Biography] @ Словарь русских генералов.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=An exact date of receiving the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky was not given in the source.|date=June 2016}} From 1813 to 1814, he commanded a brigade under Field Marshal [[Peter Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Battle of Lützen]].

After completing that campaign, he retired from military service.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; Until the invasion, he had been considered a [[Francophile]], but his wartime experiences brought a new perspective. After reading the "Discourse on Old and New Styles" by [[Alexander Shishkov]], he became a committed [[Slavophile]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RpwYM3F35ukC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Pyotr+Kikin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIm_6045WxxwIVyjmICh294Qsq#v=onepage&amp;q=Pyotr%20Kikin&amp;f=false Excerpt from ''Poetics of the Text''] by Joe Andrew @ Google books.&lt;/ref&gt; joining the "[[Lovers of the Russian Word]]" society. He also wrote a letter to Shishkov, suggesting a memorial to celebrate the victory over Napoleon, which is sometimes cited as the inspiration for the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], but this is far from certain.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt;

In 1816, at the request of Tsar Alexander, Count [[Aleksey Arakcheyev]] convinced Kikin to reenter government service and he was appointed Secretary of State in charge of reviewing petitions to the Tsar.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; In this post, he was distinguished by his candor and firmness and was not afraid to disagree with the Tsar when he thought his decisions were unfair.
[[File:Karl Brullov 08.JPG|thumb|190px|Portrait of Kikin as Secretary of State, by Bryullov]]
In 1820, together with {{ill|Ivan Alexeyevich Gagarin|ru|Гагарин, Иван Алексеевич}} and [[Alexander Ivanovich Dmitriev-Mamonov]], he became a founding patron of the "[[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts|Society for the Encouragement of Artists]]"&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; and served as its first chairman.

He was also a farmer, making many improvements to an estate in [[Ryazan Governorate]] that he acquired from his wealthy mother-in-law, {{ill|Ekaterina Torsukova|ru|Торсукова, Екатерина Васильевна}}, and taking an active part in the affairs of the "Moscow Society of Agriculture". He published several essays on agricultural topics, attempted to improve the lives of farm laborers and experimented with new methods for tanning sheepskins.

In 1826, he resigned his position as Secretary of State and retired permanently from public life, although he became an active member of the  [[Free Economic Society]]. His place of death is not known for certain, but he is buried at the [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] in Saint Petersburg. In the early 20th-century, his estate was restored by the former Minister of Agriculture, [[Alexey Sergeyevich Yermolov]], who was also a Society member and a distant relative on his mother's side of the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4284">'''Ralph Strode'''&lt;ref&gt;Known also as Ralphus Strodus, Radulphus or Rodolphus.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[floruit|fl.]] 1350 – 1400), [[England|English]] schoolman, was probably a native of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]].

He was a fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford]], before 1360, and famous as a teacher of [[logic]] and [[philosophy]] and a writer on educational subjects. He belonged, like [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Bonaventure]], to that "School of the Middle" which mediated between [[Philosophical realism|realist]]s and [[nominalist]]s.

Besides his ''Logica'', he wrote ''Consequentiae'', a treatise on the [[syllogism]], and ''Obligationes'' or ''Scholastica militia'', a series of "formal exercises in scholastic dialectics." He had some not unfriendly controversy with his colleague [[John Wyclif]], against whom he defended the possession of wealth by the clergy, and held that in the Church abuses were better than disturbance. He also attacked Wyclif's doctrine of [[predestination]]. His positions are gathered from Wyclif's ''Responsiones ad Rodolphum Strodum'' (MS. 3926, Vienna Imperial Library).

[[Chaucer]] dedicates his poem ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' to the contemporary poet [[John Gower]] and to Strode:
{{Quotation|
"O moral Gower, this book I directe&lt;br&gt;
To the, and to the, philosophical Strode,&lt;br&gt;
To vouchen sauf, ther nede is, to correcte,&lt;br&gt;
Of youre benignités and zeles goode.
|(Book V, 1856-1860)}}

Modern English translation: "O moral Gower, I permit this book to you, and to you, philosophical Strode, to correct, away from your benevolence and zealous goodness." It is quite possible that [[Troilus and Criseyde]] was dedicated to "philosophical" (in one of the manuscripts: "logical"){{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Strode because the philosopher introduced [[Chaucer]] to some of the basic philosophical distinctions between late medieval [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. Thus, Chaucer's [[literary nominalism]] in his longest complete poem may well be due to his acquaintance with Strode.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, ''Literarischer Nominalismus im Spätmittelalter'' (Frankfurt: Lang, 1990), esp. pp. 53-58; Rodney Delasanta "Chaucer and Strode," ''Chaucer Review'' 26.2 (1991), 205-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 15th-century ''Vetus catalogus'' of fellows of Merton, Strode himself was a "poeta nobilis." [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[John Bale]] confirm this, but none of Strode's poems have survived. However, Professor Gollancz suggested that the ''Phantasma Radulphi'' attributed to Strode in the Vetus Catalogus could be the 14th-century elegiac poem ''The Pearl'', but this has found no support from later scholars and, on the basis of the poem's dialect, seems very unlikely.

From 1375 to 1385 this Strode or another of the same name was [[Common Serjeant of London]]; he died in 1387.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18674">'''Reality in Buddhism''' is called ''[[dharma]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]) or ''[[dhamma]]'' ([[Pali]]). This word, which is foundational to the conceptual frameworks of the Indian religions, refers in Buddhism to the system of natural laws which constitute the natural order of things. ''Dharma'' is therefore reality as-it-is (''yatha-bhuta''). The teaching of [[Gautama Buddha]] constituting as it does a method by which people can come out of their condition of suffering (''[[dukkha]]'') involves developing an awareness of reality (''see'' [[mindfulness]]). Buddhism thus seeks to address any disparity between a person's view of reality and the actual state of things. This is called developing Right or Correct View (Pali: ''[[Noble Eightfold Path|samma ditthi]]''). Seeing reality as-it-is {{Not a typo|is}} thus an essential prerequisite to mental health and well-being according to Buddha's teaching.

Buddhism addresses deeply philosophical questions regarding the nature of reality. One of the fundamental teachings is that all the constituent forms (''[[sankhara]]s'') that make up the universe are transient (Pali: ''[[anicca]]''), arising and passing away, and therefore without concrete identity or ownership (''[[Atta (Buddhism)|atta]]''). This lack of enduring ownership or identity (''[[anatta]]'') of phenomena has important consequences for the possibility of liberation from the conditions which give rise to suffering. This is explained in the doctrine of inter[[dependent origination]].

One of the most discussed themes in Buddhism is that of the emptiness (''[[sunyata]]'') of form ([[Pali]]: ''[[rūpa]]''), an important corollary of the transient and conditioned nature of phenomena. Reality is seen, ultimately, in Buddhism as a form of '[[Philosophy of perception|projection]]', resulting from the fruition (''[[vipaka]]'') of karmic seeds (''sankharas''). The precise nature of this 'illusion' that is the phenomenal universe is debated among different schools. For example;

* Some consider that the concept of the unreality of "reality" is confusing. They posit that, in Buddhism, the perceived reality is considered illusory not in the sense that reality is a fantasy or unreal, but that our perceptions and preconditions mislead us to believe that we are separate from the elements that we are made of. Reality, in Buddhist thought, would be described as the manifestation of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]].
* Other schools of thought in Buddhism (e.g., [[Dzogchen]]), consider ''perceived reality'' literally unreal. As a prominent contemporary teacher puts it: "In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream [...]".&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"&gt;[[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light'' Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term 'visions' denotes not only visual perceptions, but appearances perceived through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations, and operations on received mental objects.

__TOC__

==Reality in Buddhist sutras==
[[Buddhist]] [[Sūtra|sutras]] devote considerable space to the concept of reality, with each of two major doctrines&amp;mdash;the Doctrine of Dependent Origination (''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'') and the Doctrine of Cause and Effect (''[[karma]]'' and ''[[vipaka]]'')&amp;mdash;attempting to incorporate both the natural and the spiritual into its overall world view. Buddhist teachings continue to explore the nature of the world and our place in it.

The Buddha promoted experience over theorizing. According to Karel Werner, &lt;blockquote&gt;Experience is ... the path most elaborated in early Buddhism. The doctrine on the other hand was kept low. The Buddha avoided doctrinal formulations concerning the final reality as much as possible in order to prevent his followers from resting content with minor achievements on the path in which the absence of the final experience could be substituted by conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith, a situation which sometimes occurs, in both varieties, in the context of Hindu systems of doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner, ''Mysticism and Indian Spirituality.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press, 1989, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Mahayana developed those statements he did make into an extensive, diverse set of sometimes contrasting descriptions of reality "as it really is."&lt;ref&gt;See Henshall, Ron (2007), ''The Unborn and Emancipation from the Born''[http://www.theunborn.org.uk/Microsoft_Word_-_Ron_Henshall__Dissertation__2007.pdf], a master's thesis by a student of Peter Harvey.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Gelugpa]] draw a distinction between [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction|Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika]] in [[Madhyamika]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction was most prominently promulgated by [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419 CE), when he argued that this distinction can be found explicitly and implicitly within in the works of [[Nagarjuna]], [[Chandrakirti]], and [[Buddhapalita]].&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theravada]] school teaches that there is no universal personal god. The world as we know it does not have its origin in a primordial being such as [[Brahman]] or the [[Abrahamic]] [[God]]. What we see is only a product of transitory factors of existence, which depend functionally upon each other. The Buddha is said to have said: "The world exists because of causal actions, all things are produced by causal actions and all beings are governed and bound by causal actions. They are fixed like the rolling wheel of a cart, fixed by the pin of its axle shaft." (Sutta-Nipata 654)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'illusion' is frequently associated with [[Buddhism]] and the nature of reality. Some interpretations of Buddhism teach that reality is a coin with two sides: the not-permanent characteristic or ''[[anicca]]'' and the "not-self characteristic" or ''[[anatta]]'', referred to as "emptiness" in some [[Mahayana]] schools.  Dzogchen, as the [[non-dual]] culmination of the [[Nyingmapa|Ancient School]] (a school with a few million followers out of a few hundred million Buddhists) of [[Mantrayana]], resolves [[Ātman (Buddhism)|atman]] and [[anatman]] into the [[Mindstream]] Doctrine of [[Tapihritsa]]. The Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have taught the variously understood and interpreted concept of "not-self" in the [[Anatta-lakkhana Sutta]]. In this sutta, he lists the characteristics that we often associate with who we are, and found that these characteristics, ultimately, are not who we are because they are subject to change without control. He further illustrates the changing nature of our feelings, perceptions, and consciousness.

We can look at the concepts of not-permanent and not-self in objective terms, for example by [[Deconstruction|deconstructing]] the concept of an [[skandha|aggregated]] object such as a [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] and seeing that the flower is made up entirely of non-flower elements like soil, nutrients, photosynthetic energy, rain water and the effort of the entities that nourished and grew the flower. All of these factors, according to the [[Diamond Sutra]],  co-exist with each other to manifest what we call a 'flower'. In other words, there is no essence arisen from nothingness that is unique and personal to any being. In particular, there is neither a human [[soul]] that lives on beyond the death of the physical body nor one that is extinguished at death since, strictly speaking, there is nothing to extinguish. The relative reality (i.e., the illusory perceived reality) comes from our belief that we are separate from the rest of the things in the universe and, at times, at odds with the processes of nature and other beings. The ultimate or absolute reality, in some schools of Buddhist thought, shows that we are inter-connected with all things. The concept of non-discrimination expands on this by saying that, while a chair is different from a flower, they 'inter-are' because they are each made of non-flower and non-chair elements. Ultimately those elements are the same, so the distinction between chair and flower is one of quantity not of quality.

The [[Diamond Sutra]], a [[Mahayana]] scripture, has many passages that use the formula: A is not A, therefore A is called A.

==Reality and dreams in Dzogchen==
In [[Dzogchen]], perceived reality is considered to be relatively unreal.

{{Quotation|align=center|The real sky is (knowing) that [[saṃsāra|samsara]] and [[nirvana]] are merely an illusory display.&lt;ref&gt;In: [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga and the Practice of Natural Light''. Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham Rinpoche]]|Quintessential Instructions of Mind, p. 117}}

According to contemporary teacher [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] [[Rinpoche]], all appearances perceived during the whole life of an individual, through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations in their totality, are like a big [[dream]]. It is claimed that, on careful examination, the dream of life and regular nightly dreams are not very different, and that in their essential nature there is no difference between them.

The non-essential difference between the dreaming state and ordinary waking experience is that the latter is more concrete and linked to attachment; the dreaming experience while sleeping is slightly detached.

Also according to this teaching, there is a correspondence between the states of sleep and dream and our experiences when we die. After experiencing the intermediate state of [[bardo]], an individual comes out of it, a new karmic illusion is created and another existence begins. This is how [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] happens.

According to [[Dzogchen]] teachings, the energy of an individual is essentially without form and free from [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]]. However, [[karmic traces]] contained in the individual's [[mindstream]] give rise to two kinds of forms:

* forms that the individual experiences as his or her body, voice and mind
* forms that the individual experiences as an external environment.

What appears as a world of permanent external phenomena, is the energy of the individual him or herself. There is nothing completely external or separate from the individual. Everything that manifests in the individual's field of experience is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. This is the '[[Great Perfection]]' that is discovered in [[Dzogchen]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;The Crystal and The Way of Light. Sutra, Tantra and Dzogchen by [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]]. Compiled and Edited by [[John Shane]], [[Snow Lion Publications]], Ithaca, NY, USA, 2000, {{ISBN|1-55939-135-9}}, pp. 99, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to do yogic practice such as [[Dream Yoga]] and [[Yoga Nidra]] whilst dreaming, sleeping and in other [[bardo]] states of [[trance]]. In this way the yogi can have a very strong experience and with this comes understanding of the dream-like nature of daily life. This is also very relevant to diminishing attachments, because they are based on strong beliefs that life's perceptions such as objects are real and as a consequence: important. If one really understands what Buddha Shakyamuni meant when he said that everything is (relatively) unreal, then one can diminish attachments and tensions.

The teacher advises that the realization that life is only a big dream can help us finally liberate ourselves from the chains of various emotions, different kinds of attachment and the chains of ego. Then we have the possibility of ultimately becoming enlightened.&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"/&gt;

Different schools and traditions in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] give different explanations of what is called "reality".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. A. Berzin.

== Reality in the Tathagatagarbha Sutras ==

Prior to the period of the Tathagatagarbha Sutras, Mahayana [[metaphysics]] had been dominated by teachings on [[emptiness]] in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Tathagatagarbha genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-192. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting with some forms of Buddhism, the Buddha's teaching on 'reality' in the [[Tathagatagarbha]] Mahayana scriptures - which the Buddha states constitute the ultimate manifestation of the [[Mahayana]] Dharma (other Mahayana sutras make similar claims about their own teachings) - insists that there truly ''is'' a sphere or realm of ultimate truth - not just a repetitious cycle of interconnected elements, each dependent on the others. That suffering-filled cycle of x-generating-y-and-y-generating-z-and-z-generating-a, etc., is ''Samsara'', the prison-house of the reincarnating non-self; whereas liberation from dependency, enforced rebirth and bondage is [[nirvana]] or reality / spiritual essence (''tattva'' / ''dharmata''). This sphere also bears the name ''Tathagatagarbha'' (Buddha matrix). It is the deathless realm where dependent origination holds no sway, where non-self is supplanted by the everlasting, sovereign (''[[aishvarya]]'') self ([[Atman (Buddhism)|atman]]) (as a trans-historical, unconditioned, ultimate, liberating, supra-worldly yet boundless and immanent awakened mind). Of this real truth, called nirvana - which, while salvationally infused into samsara, is not bound or imprisoned in it - the Buddha states in the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]:&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, Kosho (tr.), Page, Tony (ed.) (1999&amp;ndash;2000).[https://web.archive.org/web/20131019072030/http://webzoom.freewebs.com/nirvana-sutra/convenient/Mahaparinirvana_Sutra_Yamamoto_Page_2007.pdf ''The Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra''] in 12 volumes. London: Nirvana Publications{{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What is the Real (''tattva'')? Knowledge of the true attributes of Nirvana; the Tathagata, the Dharma, the Sangha, and the attributes of space ... is the Real. What is knowledge of the attributes of Nirvana? The attributes of Nirvana are eightfold. What are these eight? Cessation [of ignorance and suffering]; loveliness/ wholesomeness; Truth; Reality; Eternity, Bliss, the Self [''atman''], and complete Purity: that is Nirvana."

He further comments: " ... that which is endowed with the Eternal, Bliss, the Self, and Purity is stated to be the meaning of 'Real Truth' ... Moreover, the Real is the Tathagata [i.e., the Buddha]; the Tathagata is the Real ... The Tathagata is not conditioned and not tainted, but utterly blissful: this is the Real ...".

Thus, in such doctrines, a very positive goal is envisioned, which is said to lie beyond the grasp of the five senses and the ordinary, restless mind, and only attainable through direct meditative perception and when all inner pollutants (twisted modes of view, and all moral contaminants) are purged, and the inherently deathless, spotless, radiantly shining mind of Buddha stands revealed. This is the realm of the ''Buddha-dhatu'' (popularly known as [[buddha nature]]) - inconceivable, beginning-less, endless, omniscient truth, the [[Dharmakaya]] (quintessential body-and-mind) of the Buddha. This reality is empty of all falsehood, impermanence, ignorance, afflictions, and pain, but filled with enduring happiness, purity, knowingness (''jnana''), and omni-radiant loving-kindness (''maitri'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8137">'''Regifting''' or '''regiving''' is the act of taking a [[gift]] that has been received and giving it to somebody else, sometimes in the guise of a new gift.  One example of a formalization of this activity are the [[white elephant gift exchange]]s, in which items can be regifted from year to year.
{{quotation|Wilmington's mayor, Don Betz, admits that he's a regifter, lured to the dark side of gift-giving by a sister in New York who sends bright, flashy polyester shirts every year. 'I'd never wear them,' Mr. Betz said. 'I try to give them to someone who can use them.'|Mayor Don Betz|December 1995, Wilmington Star-News&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wilmington Star-News (Wilmington, NC)|date=1995-12-03|title=The Gift You Keep On Giving|author=Maile Carpenter|page=1D}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the USA, "[[National Regifting Day]]" is December 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=2008-12-02|title=The Social Butterfly; Do you regift? Get ready for National Regifting Day!|author=Jennifer Brett|quote=The official holiday was created three years ago by a debt-counseling group called Money Management International as a way of espousing recycling and avoiding debt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, eBay marketed "National Re-gifting Week" as December 26–30 (December 26 being [[Boxing Day]], a time traditionally associated with gift-giving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Daily Herald-Tribune|date=2007-12-27|title='re-gifting' trend hits a new low|author=Roy Clancy|quote=In the 'spirit of giving and regiving', eBay Canada is offering five free listings to each of its users during its 'National Re-Gifting Week', Dec. 26 to Dec. 30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regiving differs from straightforward giving in that goods are not acquired specifically for donation. Typically, goods that have been received as a gift are offered to others, unbeknown to them that it was originally a gift to the person offering it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Meadow Lake Progress (Saskatchewan, Canada)|date=2008-12-14|title=The spirit of re-giving|author=Jennifer Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the motives are principally charitable but also includes giving items which are surplus to one's needs.

However, re-gifting also refers the means of giving away unwanted gifts as a way of disposing them.   Consider the "[[fruitcake]] gift" scenario.  Someone receives a fruitcake but they don't like (or want) fruitcake but think someone else might. They give it away to someone who also may not like fruitcake either.

Regiving differs from [[recycling]] in that recycling is most often associated with breaking components down and rebuilding into new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term {{Anchor|Etymology}}==
The term was popularized by an episode of the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' ("[[The Label Maker]]"), although the practice pre-dates the term substantially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/041220-regifting.htm "Word of the Week"], by Kerry Maxwell, ''Macmillan English Dictionary''.  Retrieved April 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Sacramento Bee (California)|date=2006-12-10|title='Tis better to regift than to receive; Once parodied in a 'Seinfeld' episode, it's now acceptable to foist your unwanted presents on someone else|author=Cynthia Hubert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Times|location=London|date=2006-12-26|title=With regifting, that awful present is just for Christmas, not for life|author=Chris Ayres|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, the character [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] calls [[List of Seinfeld minor characters#timwhatley|Dr. Tim Whatley]] a "regifter" after he gives [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]] a label-maker that was originally given to Whatley by Elaine.

Another variant introduced in ''[[Seinfeld]]'' is degifting (see [[Indian giver]]), which refers to the act of demanding a gift back from the receiver.

==Etiquette==
Several rules of [[etiquette]] are proposed in popular media regarding regifting; they include rewrapping the gift, not using the gift before regifting it, and not giving the gift back to the original gift-giver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/Advice/12RulesForRegiftingWithoutFear.aspx 12 rules for 'regifting' without fear], by MP Dunleavey, ''MSN Money''. Retrieved April 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Telegraph Herald (Dubuque, IA)|date=2007-12-23|title=Holiday ethics: How to tactfully regift it|author=Bruce Weinstein|page=E14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regifting has become a popular addition to many white elephant gift exchanges or yankee swap events. There are no rules that specifically prohibit or encourage the practice of regifting at these parties, but generally the host of the party suggests regifting if it is an option. However, if the host suggests a spending limit for the party, it is generally poor etiquette to regift in lieu of making a purchase. The online variations of these exchanges eliminate this situation through their online purchasing requirements.

A variant of regifting was mentioned as one of [[Oprah's Favorite Things]] during the [[2008 financial crisis|recession]]-themed 2008 episode.

A [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] PublicMind Poll in Dec. 2010 showed that regifting was "commonplace."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Kwoh, "Four in 10 New Jerseyans have regifted presents, poll finds," ''Star-Ledger'', Dec. 21, 2010, p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Burçak Ertimur, one of the investigators in the study, and a professor of marketing at FDU, said “The popularity of regifting is driven by many things for different people. For some, it’s thrift in difficult economic times, or it’s a way to get around annoyingly high expectations about gift-giving. It’s also awareness of, or guilt over, how much stuff goes into the landfill. But the main reason might be just the sheer volume of stuff we have,” she said.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hester, Sr., "Regifting’s popularity driven by many factors," New Jersey Newsroom. Dec. 20, 2010 accessed at http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/style/regiftings-popularity-driven-by-many-factors&lt;/ref&gt;

Regifting has recently become more acceptable when it was adopted by environmentally and budgetary conscious people that encourage the [[Green Gifting]] concept.&lt;ref name="shuuk"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Shuuk|title=Home Gift Ideas|url=http://www.theshuuk.com/shuuk-tamara-kleinberg-in-the-news/|accessdate=14 November 2013|date=11 February 2013|publisher=The Shuuk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128162041/http://www.theshuuk.com/shuuk-tamara-kleinberg-in-the-news/|archivedate=28 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sacred Tradition''', or '''Holy Tradition''', is a theological term used in some [[Christian tradition]]s, primarily those claiming [[apostolic succession]] such as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Church of the East|Assyrian]], and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] traditions, to refer to the foundation of the doctrinal and spiritual authority of the [[Christian Church]] and of the [[Bible]].

The word "tradition" is taken from the [[Latin]] ''trado, tradere'', meaning "to hand over, to deliver, to bequeath". The teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] and the [[Apostle (Christian)|holy Apostles]] are preserved in writing in the [[Scriptures]] as well as word of mouth and are handed on. This perpetual handing on of the Tradition is called the Living Tradition; it is the faithful and constant transmission of the teachings of the Apostles from one generation to the next. That "includes everything which contributes towards the sanctity of life and increase in faith of the People of God; and so the Church, in her teaching, life and worship [the Creeds, the Sacraments, the Magisterium, and the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass], perpetuates and hands on to all generations all that she herself is, all that she believes."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/v2revel.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Deposit of Faith ({{Lang-la|fidei depositum|links=no}}) refers to the entirety of [[revelation|Divine revelation]]. And there is, according to [[Roman Catholic theology]], two sources of Revelation which constitute a single Deposit of Faith, meaning that the entirety of Divine Revelation and the Deposit of Faith is transmitted to successive generations in [[Sacred Scripture]] and Sacred Tradition (through the teaching authority and interpretation of the Church's [[Magisterium]] (which consists of the Church's bishops, in union with the [[Pope]]), typically proceeding synods and [[Catholic ecumenical councils|ecumenical councils]]).

In [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox theology]], Holy Tradition is the inspired revelation of God and catholic teaching (Greek ''katholikos'', "according to the whole") of the Church, not an independent source of dogmatic authority to be regarded as a supplement to biblical revelation. Tradition is rather understood as the fullness of divine truth proclaimed in the scriptures, preserved by the apostolic bishops and expressed in the life of the Church through such things as the [[Divine Liturgy]] and the Holy Mysteries (Eucharist, baptism, marriage, etc.), the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed|Creed]] and other doctrinal definitions of the [[Seven Ecumenical Councils]], canonical [[Christian iconography]], and the sanctified lives of godly men and women.

According to the [[Christian theology|theological]] understanding of these Churches, sacred scripture is the written part of this larger tradition, recording (albeit sometimes through the work of individual authors) the community's experience of [[God in Christianity|God]] or more specifically of Jesus Christ. Thus, the Bible must be interpreted within the context of sacred tradition and within the community of the church. That is in contrast to many [[Protestant]] traditions, which teach that the Bible alone is a sufficient basis for all Christian teaching (a position known as ''[[sola scriptura]]'').

==Usage of term==
In the English language, "sacred tradition" is more likely to be used in reference to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and "holy tradition" in reference to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], although the two terms are interchangeable in meaning.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==History==
{{See also|Magisterium}}
Among the earliest examples of the theological appeal to tradition is the response of early 'orthodox' Christianity to [[Gnosticism]], a movement that used some Christian Scripture as the basis for its teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology: An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. Chapter 1 'The Patristic Period, c. 100&amp;ndash;451.'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] held that '[[rule of faith]]' (''regula fidei'') is preserved by a church through its historical continuity (of interpretation and teaching) with the Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath. op.cit. pp. 29&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] argued that although interpretations founded on a reading of all Holy Scripture are not prone to error, tradition is the proper guide.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath. op.cit. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athanasius]] held that Arianism fell into its central error by not adhering to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath. op.cit. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Vatican Council]] taught on tradition, scripture, and magisterium in ''[[Dei verbum]]'', n. 10:

{{quote|Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture form one sacred deposit of the word of God, committed to the Church. Holding fast to this deposit the entire holy people united with their shepherds remain always steadfast in the teaching of the Apostles, in the common life, in the breaking of the bread and in prayers (see Acts 2, 42, Greek text), so that holding to, practicing and professing the heritage of the faith, it becomes on the part of the bishops and faithful a single common effort.

But the task of authentically interpreting the word of God, whether written or handed on, has been entrusted exclusively to the living teaching office of the Church, whose authority is exercised in the name of Jesus Christ. This teaching office is not above the word of God, but serves it, teaching only what has been handed on, listening to it devoutly, guarding it scrupulously and explaining it faithfully in accord with a divine commission and with the help of the Holy Spirit, it draws from this one deposit of faith everything which it presents for belief as divinely revealed.

It is clear, therefore, that Sacred Tradition, Sacred Scripture and the teaching authority of the Church, in accord with God's most wise design, are so linked and joined together that one cannot stand without the others, and that all together and each in its own way under the action of the one Holy Spirit contribute effectively to the salvation of souls.}}

Thus, all of the teachings of the Catholic Church come from either Tradition or Scripture, or from the magisterium interpreting Tradition and Scripture. These two sources, Tradition and Scripture, are viewed and treated as one source of Divine Revelation, which includes both the deeds of God and the words of God:

{{quote|This plan of revelation is realized by deeds and words having in inner unity: the deeds wrought by God in the history of salvation manifest and confirm the teaching and realities signified by the words, while the words proclaim the deeds and clarify the mystery contained in them. (''[[Dei verbum]]'', 2)}}

The [[magisterium]] has a role in deciding authoritatively which truths are a part of sacred tradition.

== In the Catholic and Orthodox churches ==
Holy tradition for the Eastern Orthodox is the deposit of faith given by [[Jesus Christ]] to the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] and passed on in the Church from one generation to the next without addition, alteration, or subtraction.  [[Vladimir Lossky]] described tradition as "the life of the Holy Spirit in the Church."&lt;ref&gt;"Tradition and Traditions", in Leonid Ouspensky and Vladimir Lossky, ''The Meaning of Icons'', (Olten, Switzerland: Urs Graf-Verlag, 1952), 17, in the revised edition (Crestwood, NY: St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1982), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It is dynamic in application yet unchanging in [[dogma]].  It is growing in expression yet is always the same in essence. The Eastern Orthodox churches do not regard tradition as something which accrues or expands over time.  Rather, Orthodox believe tradition is the faith which Jesus Christ taught to the apostles and which they gave to their disciples without any development or deepening in understanding of the faith. It is merely that faith once delivered as understood within the context of lived history.

The Catholic Church, too, views tradition in much the same terms, as a passing down of that same apostolic faith, but, in a critical difference from the Eastern Orthodox position, Catholicism holds that the faith once delivered continues to deepen and mature over time{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} through the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] in the history of the Church and in the understanding of that faith by Christians, all the while staying identical in essence and substance. Thus, the doctrines of the [[Trinity]], the [[Hypostatic union|two natures of Christ]], the [[Theotokos|divine motherhood]], the [[Immaculate Conception]], and the [[Assumption of Mary]], along with other Catholic dogmas were always part of the orthodoxy of the Church, but were not [[dogmatic definition|precisely defined]] for many years, according to the need for clarification.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Moreover, the understanding of these doctrines may continue to grow and be enriched in the future, not only through mystical experience, but through the practice of the sciences of [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] as guided by the Holy Spirit; exemplified, for instance, by the [[Scholastics]] such as [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[William of Ockham]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. A common metaphor used to explain this position is that of a seed: the acorn itself has neither branches nor leaves, yet once planted in fertile soil, it gradually grows into a tall oak; throughout its lifetime, however, it ever continues to be the same tree that was planted.

According to some, prior to the sixth century, the Church's teachings on morality were incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=KWbtc5XPMw0C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=Giovanni+Cappelli+catholic#v=onepage&amp;q=Giovanni%20Cappelli%20catholic&amp;f=false | title=A History of Catholic Moral Theology in the Twentieth Century: From Confessing Sins to Liberating Consciences| isbn=9780826429292| last1=Keenan| first1=James F| date=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic  researchers such as Bernard Hoose and Mark Jordan have found that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are "simply not true". Not only was there "inconsistency, contradiction and even incoherence" in the Church's doctrines but the researchers' work has led them to conclude that "the tradition itself is not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=KWbtc5XPMw0C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=Giovanni+Cappelli+catholic#v=onepage&amp;q=Giovanni%20Cappelli%20catholic&amp;f=false | title=A History of Catholic Moral Theology in the Twentieth Century: From Confessing Sins to Liberating Consciences| isbn=9780826429292| last1=Keenan| first1=James F| date=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However others disagree and argue differently.

== Protestant position ==
Protestant denominations claim that the Bible alone is the source for Christian doctrine. This position does not deny that Jesus or the apostles preached in person, that their stories and teachings were transmitted orally during the early Christian era, or that truth exists outside of the Bible. For ''[[sola scriptura]]'' Christians today, however, these teachings are preserved in the Bible as the only inspired medium. Since in the opinion of ''sola scriptura'' Christians, other forms of tradition do not exist in a fixed form that remains constant in its transmission from one generation to the next and cannot be referenced or cited in its pure form, there is no way to verify which parts of the "tradition" are authentic and which are not.{{efn|For example, see the debate between James White and Patrick Madrid at [http://vintage.aomin.org/SANTRAN.html vintage.aomin.org]}}

'''''Sīmiyā’''''' (from Arabic Simah سِمة which means sign [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: σημεία, "signs") also '''''rūḥāniyya''''', or '''''‘ilm al-ḥikma'''''  ({{lang-ar|روحانية and علم الحكمة}}, lit. "spirituality" and "the dweomercraft of wisdom", respectively) is a doctrine found commonly within [[Sufi]]-[[occult]] traditions that may be deduced upon the notion of "linking the superior natures with the inferior...", and broadly described as [[theurgy]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Geoffroy, ''Introduction to Sufism: The Inner Path of Islam'', World Wisdom, 2010 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyclofIslam"&gt;"Rūḥāniyya". Encyclopædia of Islam. New ed.&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed further by [[al-Majriti|al-Majrīṭī]], who claims to reveal the techniques by which it is possible to convoke the ''rūḥāniyya'' of the celestial bodies.&lt;ref name = "EncyclofIslam" /&gt; Theologian [[Al-Ghazali|Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī]], the preacher and writer [[al-Kashifi|al-Kāshifī]], and the Sufi [[Ibn Arabi|Muḥyī al-Dīn Ibn al-'Arabī]] are amongst the most pre-eminent contributors. But [[Ahmad al-Buni|al-Būnī]], author of the two-volume ''[[Shams al-Ma'arif|Shams al-Ma‘ārif]]'', is as likely as not a considerable focal point for the craft. The 13th-century [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] thinker had transcribed a whole corpus of material (called the ‘Corpus Būnianum’), all of which was subsumed under the spiritual science, and a majority of his works are still used as prototypes for present-day magical practice and literature. The term ''sīmiyā’'' was the synonym of ''rūḥāniyya'', which meant 'spirituality'. This was to be contrasted with the more lesser conformed sorcery (''siḥr''), deemed forbidden in [[Islam]].

'''Social gravity''' was an application of [[Newtonian gravity]] to the system of commerce influence.

For instance, in ''The Administration of the Colonies'' (1764), [[Thomas Pownall]] (1722–1805) used the Newtonian concept of "attraction" to form the basis of his political and commercial theory of empire. Pownall's vision provided an important explanation of the mechanism by which colonial theorists understood the possibility of empire being "transferred" from one state to another. Pownall applied the Newtonian concept of gravity to his theory of empire, as evident in his suggestion that the "laws of nature" held the colonies to [[Great Britain]] in a manner "analogous in all cases, by which the center of gravity in the solar system" held the planets in their orbits. In making this analogy, Pownall's notion of 'social gravity' drew upon earlier visions of social cohesion, particularly ideas of sociability in eighteenth-century Britain. These ideas, in turn, were often predicated upon Stoic notions of [[cosmopolitanism]], expressed by the key term [[oikeiôsis]], in order to stress the "moral" imperative for like-minded humans to forge bonds dedicated to the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breuninger |first=Scott |date=Summer 2006 |title='Social Gravity' and the Translatio Tradition in Early American Theories of Empire |journal=Southern Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=70–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Philosophical Inquiry''' ('''SPI''') is a [[non-profit organization]] devoted to propagating a version of [[Socratic inquiry]] through the establishment of regular meetings. Based on their different settings, they are called [[Socrates Café]], [[Philosophers' Club]], these meetings take place all over the world. The purpose of these meetings is to facilitate discussion of [[philosophy]].

Christopher and Cecilia Phillips co-founded SPI in 1998.  The Society is funded through a grant from the Whitman Institute in San Francisco. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704161805/http://www.thewhitmaninstitute.org/grantees.html]

==History==
SPI is a grassroots nonprofit organization devoted to supporting philosophical inquirers of all ages and walks of life as they become more empathetic and autonomous thinkers who take active part in creating a more deliberative democracy. Its members strive to form and facilitate "democratic communities of philosophical inquiry". Their gatherings - which, depending on the setting, occasion and purpose, have such names as [[Socrates Café]], [[Philosophers’ Club]], bring together people from a wide array of walks of life and experiences. They take place in venues like parks, coffee houses, hospices, senior centers, nursing homes, prisons, plazas, bookstores, homeless shelters, community centers, libraries, schools, and other public spaces.

Board members include:  [[Matthew Lipman]], [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]], Roy J. Nirschel, president of [[Roger Williams University]], and [[Jacob Needleman]], professor of philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3628">The term '''Sottorealism''' (''sotto'' Italian for “beneath” or “under” and the Latin ''realis'' “concerning the thing;” ''res'' “thing, object”) describes an approach in contemporary aesthetics. It has been developed with respect to painting, but also applies to photography

==History==
The American art historian [[Carol Strickland]] (born 1946) coined the term Sottorealism in an essay titled “Detour as a Route to Unity and Order” (2006). In the essay, she was concerned with the art work of the German-Greek painter [[Aris Kalaizis]]. While approaching his work, Strickland discovered a hermeneutical void between realism and surrealism, which she filled with the neologism.&lt;ref&gt;aus:[[Aris Kalaizis]] im Gespräch mit Carol Strickland_Katalog 'Rubbacord'_Kerber-Vg._S. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Instead of painting a surreal universe, the Sottorealist is interested in crawling beneath the surface of reality. While the world of the dream isn’t a creative act, and while no photographic device is able to fully mediate that which is beyond reality, the Sottorealist acknowledges that which is given in reality. In doing so, the Sottorealist, however, also acknowledges that unseen forces are active in our perception of reality, such as memory or cultural frameworks or metaphysical. By making these numinous realities present in his work, he creates a convergence of the seen and unseen.

The idea is to go beyond the appearance of things and to uncover substructures that are beyond the empirical reality. Sottorealists approach these second or third orders of reality by constructing elaborate models. These models could be viewed as experiments that are necessary in order to sound out the full scope of that which is part of reality, even though it is not an apparent and visible part of it.

==Process==
[[File:Werkgenese Blumenhaus.jpg|right|thumb|upright=4.0|500px|Model for the painting „Homegrown“  by Aris Kalaizis (2011). The actress [[Andrea Sawatzki]] at the set.]]

Building models of that which to be painted, is an essential part in the process. These models can be erected in public spaces or in an atelier. They offer an opportunity to probe that which the artist feels to have unearthed from beneath the surface of reality. These models can also range in complexity, be very elaborate or very simple. Photographic images taken while this model is set up, aid the artist during the final realization of the painting. 
Aris Kalaizis was the first painter who has made use of this concept, when preparing his paintings.

==Proponents==
Prominent Sottorealists are the Canadian photographer [[Jeff Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Lauter: Jeff Wall. Figures &amp; Places_Ausgewählte Werke von 1978 bis 2000, München/London/New York 2002&lt;/ref&gt; the Finnish photographer [[Ilkka Halso]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Helsinki School'', Hatje Cantz, Ostfildern-Ruit 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the American [[Gregory Crewdson]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Berg: Gregory Crewdson 1985–2005 Hatje Cantz, Ostfildern-Ruit 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The German photographer [[Thomas Demand]] is also thought to be a Sottorealist.&lt;ref&gt;''Nationalgalerie'', Steidl Mack, Göttingen 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In painting, this approach is unique and is an important feature in the work of Aris Kalaizis.&lt;ref&gt;''Making Sky'', Monografie mit Werkverzeichnis (1995–2009). Hirmer-Verlag, München 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''temple of Confucius''' or '''Confucian temple''' is a [[temple]] for the veneration of [[Confucius]] and the sages and philosophers of [[Confucianism]] in [[Chinese folk religion]] and other [[East Asian religions]]. They were formerly the site of the administration of the [[imperial examination]] in China and [[Confucian examination system in Vietnam|Vietnam]] and often housed schools and other studying facilities.

{{anchor|Alternate names|Etymology}}

==Names== &lt;!--WP:MOS-ZH: do not repeat hanzi from infobox--&gt;
The temples are known by a variety of names throughout [[East Asia]]. The two greatest temples in [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|Qufu]] and [[Beijing Temple of Confucius|Beijing]] are now known in Chinese as {{nowrap|"Temples of Confucius"}} (''Kǒngmiào''). In [[Temple of Confucius, Shanghai|Shanghai]], Vietnam, [[Munmyo|Korea]], and Indonesia, they are known as {{nowrap|"'''Temples of Literature'''"}} {{nowrap|([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''wénmiào'';}} {{lang-vi|văn miếu}}; {{nowrap|[[Korean language|Korean]]: ''munmyo'';}} {{lang-ind|boen bio}}) or {{nowrap|"'''Temples of the Sage of Literature'''"}} ({{lang-vi|văn thánh miếu}}). In Southern China, however, temples by that name generally honor [[Wenchang Wang]], a separate deity associated with the scholar Zhang Yazi. In Japan, they are usually known as "'''Temples'''" or {{nowrap|"'''Halls of the Sage'''"}} {{nowrap|([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''seibyō''}} or ''seidō'', respectively).

== History ==
[[File:曲阜孔廟大成殿.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Hall of Great Perfection (Dacheng Hall) of the Confucius temple in [[Qufu]]]]

The development of state temples devoted to the cult of Confucius was an outcome of his gradual canonisation. In 195 BC, [[Han Gao Zu]], founder of the [[Han Dynasty]] (r. 206–195 BC), offered a sacrifice to the spirit of Confucius at his tomb in Qufu. Sacrifices to the spirit of Confucius and that of [[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]], his most prominent disciple, began in the Imperial University (Biyong) as early as 241.

In 454, the [[Liu Song]] dynasty of southern China built a prominent state Confucian temple. In 489, the [[Northern Wei]] constructed a Confucian temple in the capital, the first outside of Qufu in the north. In 630, the [[Tang Dynasty]] decreed that schools in all provinces and counties should have a Confucian temple, as a result of which temples spread throughout China. Well-known Confucian shrines include the Confucian Temple in [[Jianshui]], the Confucian Temple in [[Xi'an]] (now the [[Forest of Steles]]), the [[Nanjing Fuzimiao|Fuzi Miao in Nanjing]], and the [[Confucian Temple in Beijing]], first built in 1302. The Confucian Temple of old Tianjin is located on Dongmennei Dajie, a short distance west of Traditional Culture Street (Gu Wenhua Jie). Occupying 32 acres of land, The Confucian Temple is the largest extant traditional architectural complex in Tianjin.

[[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|The largest and oldest Temple of Confucius]] is found in Confucius' hometown, present-day [[Qufu]] in [[Shandong]] Province. It was established in 479 BC, one year after Confucius's death, at the order of the Duke Ai of the State of [[Lu (state)|Lu]], who commanded that the Confucian residence should be used to worship and offer sacrifice to Confucius. The temple was expanded repeatedly over a period of more than 2,000 years until it became the huge complex currently standing. There is another temple in [[Quzhou]].
In addition to Confucian temples associated with the state cult of Confucius, there were also ancestral temples belonging to the Kong lineage, buildings commemorating Confucius's deeds throughout China, and private temples within [[academies (China)|academies]].

== Structure ==
[[File:Datong Wenmiao 2013.08.29 11-33-25.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The gates of the Temple of Confucius in [[Datong]], [[Shanxi]].]]

Beginning in the Tang dynasty (618–907), Confucian temples were built in prefectural and county schools throughout the empire, either to the front of or on one side of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liu|first=Xu|title=Tang shu 唐書 |publisher=Zhonghua shuji|location=Beijing|pages=15.373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The front gate of the temple is called the Lingxing Gate ({{zh|t=欞星門|s=棂星门}}). Inside there are normally three courtyards, although sometimes there are only two. However, the complex in Qufu has nine courtyards containing scores of steles commemorating visits by an emperor or imperial grants of noble titles upon descendants of Confucius. The main building, situated in the inner courtyard with entry via the ''Dachengmen'' ({{zh|t=大成門|s=大成门}}), is called the ''Dachengdian'' ({{zh|c=大成殿}}), variously translated as "Hall of Great Achievement", "Hall of Great Completion", or "Hall of Great Perfection". In imperial China, this hall housed the [[Spirit Tablet]]s ({{zh|t=神位}}) of Confucius and those of other important sages ({{zh|t=聖|s=圣}}) and worthies ({{zh|t=賢|s=贤}}). In front of the ''Dachengdian'' in Qufu is the Apricot Pavilion or ''Xingtan'' ({{zh|t=杏壇|s=杏坛}}). Another important building behind the main building is the Shrine of Adoring the Sage (''Chongshengci'' {{zh|t=崇聖祠|s=崇圣祠}}), which honoured the ancestors of Confucius and the fathers of the Four Correlates and Twelve Philosophers.
[[File:Cicheng Kongmiao 2013.07.27 12-53-44.jpg|thumb|200px|Main hall of the Temple of Confucius in [[Ningbo]], [[Zhejiang]].]]

Unlike [[Daoist]] or [[Buddhist]] temples, Confucian temples do not normally have images. In the early years of the temple in Qufu, it appears that the spirits of Confucius and his disciples were represented with wall paintings and clay or wooden statues. Official temples also contained images of Confucius himself. However, there was opposition to this practice, which was seen as imitative of Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sommer|first=Deborah|title=Destroying Confucius: Iconoclasm in the Confucian Temple|journal=On Sacred Grounds: Culture, Society, Politics and the Formation of the Cult of Confucius|year=2002|pages=95–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also argued that the point of the imperial temples was to honour Confucius's teachings, not the man himself.

The lack of unity in likenesses in statues of Confucius first led Emperor [[Hongwu Emperor|Taizu]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] to decree that all new Confucian temples should contain only spirit tablets and no images. In 1530, it was decided that all existing images of Confucius should be replaced with spirit tablets in imperial temples in the capital and other bureaucratic locations; nevertheless many modern Confucian temples do feature statues. Statues also remained in temples operated by Confucius's family descendants, such as that in Qufu.

== Worship ==
[[File:Prayer flairs at Temple of Confucius.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Prayer plaques in a temple of Confucius]]

The state cult of Confucius centred upon offering sacrifices to Confucius's spirit in the Confucian temple.
[[File:PyeonjongIMG 6163.JPG|200px|thumb|''[[Aak]]'' musicians at a [[Seokjeon Daeje|Confucian ceremony]] in [[Munmyo]] Shrine, Korea]]

A dance known as the Eight-Row Dance (八佾舞), consisting of eight columns of eight dancers each, was also performed. Originally this was a Six-Row Dance, as performed for the lesser aristocracy, but in 1477 Confucius was allowed the imperial honour of the eight-row dance since he posthumously received the title of king.  Musicians who accompanied this dance played a form of music termed ''[[yayue]]''.

In addition to worshipping Confucius, Confucian temples also honour the "[[Four Correlates]]", the "[[Twelve Philosophers]]", and other disciples and Confucian scholars through history. The composition and number of figures worshipped changed and grew through time. Since temples were a statement of Confucian orthodoxy, the issue of which Confucians to enshrine was a controversial one.

By the [[Republic of China|Republican period]] (20th century), there were a total of 162 figures worshipped. The Four Correlates are [[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]], [[Zengzi|Zeng Shen]], [[Kong Ji]] (Zisi), and [[Mencius]]. The Twelve Philosophers are [[Min Sun]] (Ziqian), [[Ran Geng]] (Boniu), [[Ran Yong]] (Zhonggong), Zai Yu (Ziwo), Zi-gong, Ran You, Zi-Lu, Zi-You, Zi-Xia, Zi-Zhang, You Ruo, and [[Zhu Xi]]. A list of disciples of Confucius and their place in the Confucian temple can be found at [[Disciples of Confucius]].

== Outside mainland China ==

With the spread of Confucian learning throughout East Asia, Confucian temples were also built in [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]]. Starting in the 18th century, some were even built in Europe and the Americas. At their height, there are estimated to have been over 3,000 Confucian temples in existence.

=== Hong Kong ===
The bill allowing for the building of the very first Confucian Temple in Hong Kong, proposed by the [[Confucian Academy]], passed in September 2013. The location of the temple was decided to be near the famous Taoist temple, [[Wong Tai Sin Temple (Hong Kong)|Wong Tai Sin Temple]], in [[Wong Tai Sin District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hk.news.yahoo.com/孔廟黃大仙新地標-224032729.html |title=孔廟黃大仙新地標 |language=Chinese |trans-title=Wong Tai Sin Temple of Confucius landmark |work=The Sun |location=Hong Kong |date=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923090856/http://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E5%AD%94%E5%BB%9F%E9%BB%83%E5%A4%A7%E4%BB%99%E6%96%B0%E5%9C%B0%E6%A8%99-224032729.html |archivedate=23 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
The first Confucian temple in [[Taiwan]] to be constructed was the [[Taiwan Confucian Temple]], which was built during the period of [[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungning Kingdom]] in 1665 in [[Tainan]]. A more recent one, the [[Taipei Confucius Temple]], was built on Wenwu Street in [[Taipei]] in 1879, torn down by Japanese in 1907 to make place for the [[Taipei First Girls' High School]], and re-erected on Dalong Street from 1925 to 1939. The new temple was designed by Wang Yi-Shun, who also oversaw its construction. The design is an example of typical [[Fujian]] temple style. Every year on September the 28th, the birthday of Confucius, city authorities hold the Shidian ({{zh|c=釋奠}}) Ceremony here. In addition, there is a [[Confucius Temple of Kaohsiung|Confucian temple]] located in [[Zuoying|Zuoying District]] of [[Kaohsiung]] that was completed in 1974 in the Northern Song architectural style. Other Confucian Temples are found in [[Chiayi Confucian Temple|Chiayi City]], [[Taipei Confucius Temple|Taipei]], [[Taichung Confucian Temple|Taichung]] and [[Temple of Confucius, Changhua|Changhua County]].

=== Vietnam ===
A Confucian Temple in Vietnam is called '''Văn Miếu'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tiasang.com.vn/DesktopModules/VietTotal.Articles/PrintView.aspx?ItemID=1782|title=Dịch hai chữ Văn Miếu ra tiếng Tây|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817140420/http://tiasang.com.vn/DesktopModules/VietTotal.Articles/PrintView.aspx?ItemID=1782|archive-date=2016-08-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded Văn Miếu in Vietnam is the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Văn Miếu, Hanoi]], established in 1070. After 1397, with the construction of schools throughout Vietnam under the [[Trần Dynasty|Tran]], Confucian temples began to spread throughout the country. Another renowned Vietnamese Confucian temple is the [[Temple of Literature, Hung Yen|Văn Miếu, Hưng Yên]], located in [[Hưng Yên City]]. Well-known Confucian temples were built in [[Huế]], [[Tam Ky|Tam Kỳ]], [[Hoi An|Hội An]], [[Hung Yen|Hưng Yên]], [[Hai Duong|Hải Dương]], [[Bien Hoa|Biên Hòa]], [[Vinh Long|Vĩnh Long]] and [[Bac Ninh|Bắc Ninh]].

=== Korea ===
Outside China, the largest number of Confucian temples is found in Korea. Temples were first built during the [[Goryeo]] period (918–1392). In the time of [[Yi Seonggye]] (r. 1392–1398), it was decreed that Confucian temples should be built in all areas of the nation. Although Chinese models were followed, variations in layout and construction were common, such as the building of schools in front of temples. Korea also added its own scholars (the eighteen scholars of the East) to the Confucian pantheon.

Historically, Korea had a total of 362 temples devoted to Confucianism. After [[World War II]] and the division of the country, those in the North were converted to other uses. However, many of the 232 temples in the South continued their activities (see [[Munmyo]]). In addition to temples devoted to Confucianism the [[Republic of Korea]] also has twelve Confucian family temples, two temples in private schools, and three libraries.

=== Japan ===
{{nihongo|Confucian temples|孔子廟|kōshi-byō}} were also widely built in Japan, often in conjunction with Confucian schools. The most famous is the [[Yushima Seido]], built in 1630 during the Edo period as a private school connected with the Neo-Confucianist scholar [[Hayashi Razan]]. Originally built in Shinobi-ga-oka in [[Ueno, Tokyo|Ueno]], it was later moved to [[Yushima]] ([[Ochanomizu]]) by the Tokugawa Shogunate and reopened as a school of Confucianism to spread the teachings of the Hayashi school.

Other well-known Confucian temples are found in [[Confucius Shrine, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Bizen, Okayama|Bizen]], [[Okayama prefecture]]; [[Taku, Saga|Taku]], [[Saga prefecture]]; and [[Naha]], [[Okinawa prefecture]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

=== Indonesia ===

{{main|Confucian church}}
Confucian temples are also found in Indonesia, where they are often known as "Churches of Confucius" as Confucianism is a recognised religion in that country. In Chinese, these establishments are known as [[Li Tang (hall of worship)|''litang'']] ({{lang|zh|礼堂}}) or "halls of worship". The largest and oldest is the [[Boen Bio]] in [[Surabaya]], originally built in the city's [[Chinatown]] in 1883 and moved to a new site in 1907. There are reportedly more than 100 Confucianist halls of worship throughout Indonesia.

=== Malaysia ===
The first Confucian temple in Malaysia was built within a primary school known as [[Chung Hwa Confucian School]] (which has since split into SJK(C) Chung Hwa Confucian A, B and [[Chung Hwa Confucian High School|SMJK Chung Hwa Confucian]]) in [[Penang]], in the early 20th Century. The building of the school was initiated by the [[Qing]] dynasty ambassador to the British [[Straits Settlement]] at that time. In those days parents in Penang brought their children to this temple for prayer before they began their schooling. The children prayed for excellence in their studies.

There are also 2 Confucian schools in [[Kuala Lumpur]], namely SMJK Confucian and Confucian Private School, and a Confucian school in [[Malacca]] where ceremonies in honour of Confucius are held annually.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2802">The '''Tongcheng School''' was a Chinese literary school that flourished during the [[Qing dynasty]] advocating the philosophy of the [[Neo-Confucian]] values that rose to prominence during the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/place/Tongcheng#ref1001044 |title=Tongcheng  |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2015 |website=global.britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=23 November 2015 |quote=''Not only was Tongcheng thus a centre of a strong political faction, but it also became the focus of the Tongcheng school, one of the chief literary schools that flourished during the Qing period (1644–1911/12).

== History ==
The Tongcheng school of literary prose was founded by [[Fang Bao]], [[Liu Dakui]], and [[Yao Nai]] who were natives of [[Tongcheng Country]], [[Anhui Province]] in the early years of the [[Qing dynasty]].

Fang Bao initiated the genre using what he had learned from his teacher [[Gui Youguang]], creating the concept of ''Yi Fa''. ''Yi'' refers to the central ideas or arguments within an article and ''Fa'' to the various literary forms and artistry that are present in the theory of the Tongcheng school. The style of writing was more stoic in nature in that it stressed the need to present the purpose of the article in a concise manner without excessive pomp or romance in the writing style.&lt;ref name = "daily"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-05/20/content_7824869.htm |title=Tongcheng School of Literature |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=20 May 2009 |website=ah.goc.cn |publisher=China Daily |access-date=23 November 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school rose to prominence under the [[Kangxi Emperor]] and prospered throughout the Qing period. Significant originating writings of the school include Fang Bao's ''Random Notes from Prison'' and Yao Nai's ''Ascent to Mount Tai''.

== Writers ==
Significant authors of the Tongcheng style include [[Fang Bao]]'s students: Shen Tong, Wang Youpu, Shen Tingfang, Wang Zhaofu, Chen Dashou and Li Xueyu; Liu Dakui's students: Wang Zhuo, Wu Ding and [[Cheng Jinfang]]; and Yao Nai's students: Guan Tong, Men Cengliang, Fang Dongshu and Yao Ying. Other notable adherents to the Tongcheng school include Zhu Qi, Long Qirui, Chen Xueshou, Wu Jiabin, Deng Xianhe, Sun Dingchen, Lu Yitong and Shao Yichen.&lt;ref name = "daily"/&gt;

The [[Sanskrit]] word, '''Vidya''', figures prominently in all texts pertaining to [[Indian philosophy]] - to mean science, learning, knowledge and scholarship; most importantly, it refers to valid knowledge which cannot be contradicted and true knowledge which is the knowledge of the Self intuitively gained. ''Vidya'' is not mere intellectual knowledge, for the [[Vedas]] demand understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of the Upanishads|author=Archibald Edward Gough|publisher=Trubner &amp; Co.|page=48|url= https://archive.org/details/philosophyofupan00gouguoft }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==

'''Vidya''' or ''vidyā'' ([[Sanskrit]]: विद्या) primarily means science, learning, philosophy, knowledge, scholarship, any knowledge whether true or false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit.de Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its root is ''Vid'' ([[Sanskrit]]: विद्) which means - to reason upon, knower, finding, knowing, acquiring or understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit.de Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=vid+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance==

In [[Hindu philosophy]], '' Vidyā'' refers to the knowledge of the soul or spiritual knowledge;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=325|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.1.apte.694114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it refers to the study of the six schools of Hindu philosophy – [[Nyaya]], [[Yoga]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Mīmāṃsā|Purvamimamsa]] and [[Vedanta|Uttaramimamsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Going to school in South Asia|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=75|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LQcBMtetBDkC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DITQU_mCBcm1uATD8YK4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of gaining the knowledge of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] cannot commence unless one has explored the ''Prānavidya'' or ''Agnividya''  to the full in all its numerous phase; through ''vidyā'' or '' [[upasana]] '' to ''[[jnana]] '' was always the eternal order indicated by the Upanishads. ''Jnāna'' dawns after the completion and perfection of the being through the ''vidyās''; then, one crosses over beyond birth and death having already destroyed the bonds of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commentary on the Katha Upanishad (Verses I.1.17/18)|author=Swami Krishnananda|pages=20, 21|url= http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/katha1/Commentary_on_Katha_Upanishad.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

During the [[Vedic]] period, ''Vidyādāna'' or the gift for the sake of education was considered to be the best of gifts, possessing a higher religious efficacy than even the gift of land. ''Vidyā'' comes from the root ''Vid'' ('to know'), it therefore means knowledge, science, learning, lore, scholarship and philosophy. There are basically four ''Vidyas'' – 1) ''Trayi'' (triple) which is the study of the [[Vedas]] and their auxiliary texts, 2) ''[[Anviksiki]]'' which is logic and metaphysics, 3) ''Dandaniti'' which is the science of government, and 4) ''Varum'', the practical arts such as agriculture, commerce, medicine etc. ''Vidyā'' gives insight, in the spiritual sphere it leads to salvation, in the mundane sphere it leads to progress and prosperity. ''Vidyā'' illuminates the mind and shatters illusions, increases intelligence, power and efficiency; develops the intellect and makes it more re-fined; it effects a complete transformation as the root of all happiness and as the source of illumination and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Aryans ti Swaraj|author=S.R.Bakshi|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=11 to 15|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ldo1QtQigosC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8oXQU5qaEcOJuASwjIDIDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word, ''Vidyā'', does not occur in the [[Rig Veda]], it occurs in the [[Atharvaveda]] and in the [[Brahmana]] portions of the [[Yajurveda]] and in the [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devi Mahatmya|author=Thomas B.Coburn|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=189|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hy9kf7_TOHgC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q5bQU4KyN9OeugS1pIGIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra==

In [[Hinduism]], Goddesses are personifications of the deepest level of power and energy. The concept of [[Shakti]], in its most abstract terms, relates to the energetic principle of Ultimate Reality, the dynamic aspect of the divine. This concept surfaces in the [[Kena Upanishad]] as Goddess Umā bestowing ''Brahma-vidya'' on [[Indra]]; when linked with ''shakti'' and ''maya'', she embodies the power of illusion (''maya''), encompassing ignorance (''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]'') and knowledge (''vidyā'') and thereby presented with a dual personality. According to the Saktas, [[Maya (Illusion)|Māyā]] is basically a positive, creative, magical energy of the Goddess that brings forth the universe. The ten ''Mahāvidyās''  are bestowers or personifications of transcendent and liberating religious knowledge; the term ''Vidyā'' in this context refers to power, essence of reality and the ''mantras''. The gentle and motherly forms of Goddess Sri Vidyā are 'right-handed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Goddesses: Beliefs and Practices|author=Lynn Foulston|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|pages=9,14,115,|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XgwVgPx5G5UC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=sri+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LrbQU5juHcu8ugSUsILoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sri%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the awareness of the 'exterior' ([[Shiva]]) combined with the "I" encompasses the entire space as "I" it is called ''sada-siva-tattva''. When later, discarding the abstraction of the Self and the exterior, clear identification with the insentient space takes place, it is called ''isvara-tattva''; the investigation of these two last steps is pure ''vidyā'' (knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tripura Rahasya|publisher=world Wisdom|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOpi_CkDfKQC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X4PQU_a4IdKzuAS3pYHwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Māyā'', which has been identified with ''[[Prakrti]]'' in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] represents its three ''[[guna]]s''; also identified with ''avidyā'', which term primarily means the dark abyss of non-being and secondarily the mysterious darkness of the unmanifest state, ''Māyā'' binds through ''avidyā'' and releases through ''vidyā'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taittiriya Upanishad (Verse III.2)|publisher=The Ramakrishna Math|page=13|url=http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Taittiriya%20Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Sarvanand%20[Sanskrit-English].pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist belief==

In [[Mahayana]] texts, the female divinities are designated grammatically feminine terms ''Dhārāni'' and ''Vidyā''. ''Dharani'' refers to [[mantra]]s, the sounds that carry the essence or energy of a deity, which enable contact with the goddess on her plane of reality because the mantras invoke all deities. ''Vidyā'' is also synonymous with mantra and refers to the mantric invocation of female deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Goddesses of India|author=Miranda Eberie Shaw|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvDKOK1h3zMC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X4PQU_a4IdKzuAS3pYHwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tibet]], the word, ''[[rigpa]]'' , meaning ''vidyā'', refers to the non-dualistic awareness or intrinsic awareness. In [[Theravada Buddhism]], ''vidyā'' means 'non-dual awareness' of [[three marks of existence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Characteristics of Existence|publisher=Maithri Publications|url= http://www.maithri.com/links/articles/tri_lakshana1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reflections in a mirror|author=Charlie Singer|publisher=iUniverse|pages=15, 49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myZdqZhmAwIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8oXQU5qaEcOJuASwjIDIDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agni Vidyā==

''Agni Vidyā'' or the science of Fire is said to be the greatest discovery of the ancient Indians who gained direct experience of divine fire through continuous research, contemplation, observation and experimentation; their experience led them to discover ways of using this knowledge to heal and nurture the outer and the inner worlds. To them fire is sacred, and because of the pervasive nature of fire all things are sacred. Body and mind which are extensions of the fire that the soul spontaneously emits are also sacred. Within the body the most significant centres of fire are more subtle than those of the sense organs. They are called the ''chakras'' which are seven fields of sacred fire. The understanding of the role of fire without and within gives proper self-understanding which understanding is gained through yogic practices. The performance of [[yajna]]s is the ''karma-kānda'' aspect of ''agni vidyā''. All rituals follow set rules and conditions. The main function of the fire ritual is to make an offering to nature’s finest forces and divinities that fill the space of inner consciousness; fire carries oblations to these forces and divinities. The fire has seven tongues all having unique qualities. The gods, goddesses, divinities and nature’s forces are grouped in seven main categories which match with the qualities of the seven tongues of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pursuit of Power and Freedom|publisher=Himalayan Institute Press|pages=33, 34, 38, 39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ph55FuAfQ7AC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pYXQU-agGNeiugS9wILwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atmaikatva==

''Atmaikatva'' or the absolute oneness of the self is the theme of entire [[Advaita Vedanta]] which distinguishes six ''[[pramana]]s'' or means of valid knowledge, but this ''vidyā'' or knowledge of [[Brahman]] is ''guhahita'', ''gahavareshta'' i.e. set in the secret place and hidden in its depth, unattainable except through ''adhyātma-yoga'', the meditation centering upon the nature of the self. Vedanta literature is only preparatory to it, it dispels ignorance and makes the mind receptive but does not reveal the truth therefore it is an indirect means of knowledge. The oneness of the self, which is self-established and self-shining, is called ''vidyā'' in cosmic reference which reveals the true nature of [[Brahman]], the self-shining pure consciousness which is not a ''visaya'' ('object matter or content') but the one subject, transcendent of all conventional subjects and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=S.K.chattopadhyaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=To_QU-SoEYqHuATuiILYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Self or the Atman is to be sought, the Self is to be enquired into, known and understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogy Upanishad (Verse VIII.vii.1)|page=446|url= https://archive.org/details/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hierarchy of knowledge==

The sage of the [[Mundaka Upanishad]](Verse I.1.4), more in the context of the ritualistic than of epistemological concerns, states that there are two kinds of knowledge (''vidyā'') to be attained, the higher (''para'') and the lower (''apara''). ''[[Para Vidya|Para vidyā]]'', the higher knowledge, is knowledge of the Absolute ([[Brahman]], [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]); ''Apara'', the lower knowledge, is knowledge of the world – of objects, events, means, ends, virtues and vices. ''Para vidyā'' has Reality as its content; ''Apara vidyā'', the phenomenal world. According to Advaita Vedanta, ''Para vidyā'', by the nature of its content, possesses a unique quality of ultimacy that annuls any supposed ultimacy that might be attached to any other or form of knowledge, and is intuitively gained as self-certifying. Once Brahman is realized all other modes of knowledge are seen to be touched by ''avidyā'', the root of ignorance. In this context, ''Vidyā'' means true knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Re-construction|author=Eliot Deutsch|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63gdKwhHeV0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q5bQU4KyN9OeugS1pIGIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it is argued that the Advaita Vedanta interpretation does not answer the final question: what is the reality or truth-value of ''avidyā'' or what is the substratum that is the basis or cause of ''avidyā''?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Indian Interpreters of the Bhagavad Gita|publisher=SUNY Press|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ku2DGm20WWUC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DITQU_mCBcm1uATD8YK4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valid knowledge==

The Upanishads teach us that the knowledge of difference is ''avidyā'' or ignorance, and the knowledge of identity is true knowledge or ''vidyā'' or valid knowledge, which leads to life eternal. For the [[Cārvāka]]s, perception is the only means of valid knowledge (''pramana''). Vadi Deva Suri of the [[Jainism|Jaina school]] defines valid knowledge as determinate cognition which apprehends itself and an object and which is capable of prompting activity which attains a desirable object or rejects an undesirable object; the result of valid knowledge is cessation of ignorance. [[Vaisheshika]]s recognized four kinds of valid knowledge – Perception, Inference, Recollection and Intuition. The Mimamsa schools introduced the concept of intrinsic validity of knowledge (''svatahpramanya'') and extrinsic validity of knowledge (''parastah-apramana'') but agreed that the validity of knowledge cannot be determined by the knowledge of any special excellence in its cause or the knowledge of its harmony with the real nature of its object or the knowledge of a fruitful action. [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] accepted perception, inference, scriptural testimony, comparison, presumption and non-apprehension as the six sources of knowledge and concluded that the knowledge which corresponds with the real nature of its object is valid. The Atman is the reality in the empirical self as the ever present foundational subject-objectless universal consciousness which sustains the empirical self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrim Books|pages=16,120,162,319,368|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Outlines_of_Indian_Philosophy.html?id=99aBngEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

In ''upāsanā'' the movement starts from the outer extremities and gradually penetrates into the inmost recesses of the soul, and the whole investigation is conducted in two spheres, in the subject as well as in the object, in the individual as well as in the world, in the ''aham'' as also in the '' [[idam]] '', in the ''adhyātma'' and also in ''adhidaiva'' spheres and conducted synthetically as well as analytically, through ''apti'' as well as ''samrddhi'', which the [[Bhagavad Gita]] calls '' [[yoga]] '' and '' [[vibhooti]] ''. The ''vidyās'' do not rest content in knowing the reality simply as a whole but proceed further to comprehend it in all its infinite details too. The higher includes the lower grades and adds something more to it and never rejects it; the lower has its fulfilment in the higher and finds its consummation there but never faces extinction. All forms of contemplation have only one aim: to lead to the Supreme Knowledge and hence they are termed as ''vidyās''; through ''vidyā'', which is ''amrta'', one attains immortality ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] Verse V.1). ''[[Dahara-vidya|Dahara Vidyā]]'', ''Udgitha Vidyā'' and ''[[Madhu-vidya|Madhu Vidyā]]'' are the synthetic way whereas the analytic way is signified by the Sleeping man of the ''Garga-Ajātsatru'' episode and by the Five Sheaths, which ways show that the world and the individual spring from the same eternal source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the Upanishads|author=Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya|publisher=Pilgrims Book|pages=171, 175|url= http://www.abebooks.com/Studies-Upanishads-Govindagopal-Mukhopadhyaya-Pilgrims-Publishing/12423632861/bd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yuri Sergeevich Savenko''' ({{lang-ru|Ю́рий Серге́евич Саве́нко}}) is a Russian psychiatrist, the president since 1989 of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]].&lt;ref name="Savenko, Perekhov"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Savenko, Yuri |author2=Perekhov, Alexei |title=The State of Psychiatry in Russia|journal=[[Psychiatric Times]]|date=13 February 2014|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/special-reports/state-psychiatry-russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="20-летие"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Савенко, Юрий|title=20-летие НПА России |journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]] |volume= |issue=№ 1 |pages=5–18 |year=2009 |issn=1028-8554 |url=http://www.npar.ru/pdf/2009-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the Council of Experts of the Russian Commissioner for Human Rights in the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name="Savenko, Perekhov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Гурьянова"&gt;{{cite news|author=Гурьянова, Татьяна|title=Юрий Cавенко: "Психически больные нуждаются в поддержке"|url=http://www.aif.ru/health/article/22058|accessdate=25 July 2011|newspaper=«АиФ Здоровье» №43|date=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds M.D. qualification&lt;ref name="Mercer"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mercer, Ellen |author2=Mesner, Lea |title=An International psychiatric directory|year=1993|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=0-89042-248-6|pages=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFXiRMYA3QkC&amp;&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}} and is [[editor-in-chief]] of and a regular contributor to the ''[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]'', which has been published since 1991.&lt;ref name="Savenko, Perekhov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Журнал"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/ |title=About ''Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal'' |publisher=НПА |accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been working as editorial consultant of the ''[[Moskovskiy Psikhoterapevticheskiy Zhurnal]]'' (“Moscow Journal for Psychotherapy”) for many years before he left this position in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See the title pages of the following issues:

* Московский психотерапевтический журнал, 2007, № 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before defending his doctoral thesis, Savenko was expelled from the Institute of Psychiatry in 1974.&lt;ref name="Никакие"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Савенко, Юрий|title=Никакие жизненные коллизии не меняют нас с раннего детства…|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2009|issue=1|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2009/1/16-savenko.htm|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His main works concern anxious psychotic syndromes,&lt;ref name="Докт. дисс."&gt;{{cite book|author=Савенко, Юрий|title=Тревожные психотические синдромы. Автореферат докт. дисс|year=1974|publisher=|location=Москва}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychotic disorders problems, subject of psychiatry, and the [[classification of mental disorders]].&lt;ref name="Навстречу МКБ-11"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Савенко, Юрий|title=Навстречу МКБ-11|trans-title=Toward the ICD-11|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2008|issue=3|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2008/3/02_mkb.htm|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuri Savenko took part in a 'wrongful confinement' lawsuit filed in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="Brintlinger"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brintlinger, Angela |author2=Vinitsky, Ilya |title=Madness and the mad in Russian culture|year=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-9140-7|pages=294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ED3U_XVLwHwC&amp;pg=PA294}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|294}} When writing about this case, Savenko charged the [[Serbsky Institute]] with having a "pernicious effect on Russian medicine" and warned that the leadership of the psychiatric community "is now completely under the shadow of the state."&lt;ref name="Brintlinger"/&gt;{{rp|294}}

On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko wrote to the [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] an [[open letter]], in which Savenko asked Medvedev to submit to the [[State Duma]] a draft law prepared by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address a sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to a lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization.&lt;ref name="Открытое письмо"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Савенко, Юрий|script-title=ru:Открытое письмо Президенту Российской Федерации  Д.А. Медведеву|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2009|issue=№ 2|pages=5–6|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2009/2/medved.htm|accessdate=12 July 2011|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Yuri Savenko and Valery Krasnov provided the leadership for the Second East European Congress of Psychiatry in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Christodoulou&gt;{{cite journal|title=The First Psychiatric Congress of Eastern Europe|journal=[[World Psychiatry (journal)|World Psychiatry]]|date=June 2008|volume=7|issue=2|page=128|doi=10.1002/j.2051-5545.2008.tb00177.x|pmid=18560477|author=Christodoulou, George|pmc=2408391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eugenic views ==
Savenko is a supporter of preventive [[eugenics]], he justifies [[enforced sterilization]] of women, which is practiced in Moscow psychoneurological nursing homes, and states that 
{{cquote|one needs a more strictly adjusted and open control over the practice of preventive eugenics, which, in itself, is, in its turn, justifiable.&lt;ref name="Лишённые"&gt;{{cite news|title=Лишённые наследства. Законно ли запрещают рожать пациенткам психоневрологических интернатов?|url=http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/93n/n93n-s26.shtml|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|date=12 December 2005}} Савенко: «…Необходим более строго выверенный и открытый контроль за практикой предупредительной евгеники, которая сама по себе, в свою очередь, оправданна».&lt;/ref&gt; }}
However, Article 7 of Part 1 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] defines enforced sterilization among [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref name="Rome Statute"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm|publisher=[[The International Criminal Court]]|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he seemed to take the opposite point of view and criticize German eugenics in the documentary ''Archetype. Neurosis. Libido. T-4 Death Squad'' produced by the [[Rossiya K]] TV channel.&lt;ref&gt;He says, “All statistics show Germany has the same rate of serious mental illness as that throughout the whole world. They reached nothing and only disgraced themselves.” Watch from 23:09 {{cite web|title=Archetype. Neurosis. Libido. T-4 Death Squad (TV documentary)|url=http://tvkultura.ru/video/show/brand_id/23166/video_id/640534|work=The [[Rossiya K]] TV channel|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attitude to homosexuality ==
In 2005, Savenko as the president of the IPA expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the [[Executive committee|Executive Committee]] of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] to exclude [[homosexuality]] as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry, referred the proposal to [[antipsychiatry|antipsychiatric actions]], and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. His statement was put in the following words: “It is surprising for us that the substitution of ideological, social and liberal reasoning for scientific one came not from Russia and that the Executive Committee of the APA unanimously proposed to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry. It shows that even the well-developed [[legal framework]] for psychiatry and the [[denationalization]] of [[Community mental health service|mental health service]] (by 80% in the USA), ie, the absence of two of the three factors that played a crucial role in Soviet abuses of psychiatry, does not protect against inherently antipsychiatric actions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Савенко, Юрий |author2=Виноградова, Любовь |script-title=ru:Латентные формы антипсихиатрии как главная опасность|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2005|volume=№ 4|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2005/4/latent.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he and Perekhov in  their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality that has endured into the present day.&lt;ref name="Savenko, Perekhov"/&gt;

== The resolution on Savenko ==
On 19 December 2013, the Commission on Professional Ethics Issues at the Board of the Russian Society of Psychiatrists delivered to Savenko when he raised ethical issues concerning the case of [[Mikhail Kosenko]] in publications, a resolution as follows:
 
{{quote|Savenko Yu. S. in his public appearances has grossly violated the norms of professional ethics. In numerous declarations, appeals, appearances by Savenko Yu. S. in the media, there are noted impermissible, insulting, offensive statements, which derogate from honour, dignity and goodwill of both individual experts and the expert institution F[ederal] S[tate] B[udgetary] I[nstitution] "the Serbsky S[tate] S[cientific] C[enter for] S[ocial and] F[orensic] P[sychiatry]" and at the same time undermine the authority of the psychiatric community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Постановление Комиссии правления Российского общества психиатров по вопросам профессиональной этики|trans-title=The resolution by the Commission on Professional Ethics Issues at the Board of the Russian Society of Psychiatrists|url=http://psychiatr.ru/news/197|publisher=The Russian Society of Psychiatrists|accessdate=16 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116075111/http:/psychiatr.ru/download/1398?view=1&amp;name=1396.pdf|archivedate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Savenko responded that the strikingly unethical nature of the resolution by the Ethical Commission (of 12 December 2013) showed in the ascription to the IPA open letter to the WPA, hosted on the website, of phrases that were never used there.&lt;ref name=Outcomes&gt;{{cite web|author=Savenko, Yuri [Юрий Савенко]|script-title=ru:Президент НПА России Ю.С.Савенко анализирует итоги дела Михаила Косенко|trans-title=The President of the IPA of Russia Yu.S. Savenko analyzes the outcomes of the case of Mikhail Kosenko|url=http://npar.ru/prezident-npa-rossii-yu-s-savenko-analiziruet-itogi-dela-mixaila-kosenko/|publisher=[[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]]|accessdate=3 February 2014|date=1 February 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He adds we see a rather awkward performance of a social role using the old scenario of accusatory campaigns of Soviet times to have the possibility to refer to "the opinion of the professional public" for use abroad.&lt;ref name=Outcomes/&gt;

== Awards ==
On 10 December 2013, Savenko received the award of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] "for historic contribution to the defence of human rights and the human rights movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Лия Ахеджакова стала лауреатом премии Московской Хельсинкской группы|url=http://www.rg.ru/2013/12/10/ahedjakova-anons.html|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Лия Ахеджакова удостоена премии за защиту прав человека|url=http://top.rbc.ru/society/10/12/2013/893881.shtml|accessdate=24 December 2013|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
